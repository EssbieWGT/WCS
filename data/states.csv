According to the National Rural Health Association, suicide rates are “significantly higher” in rural areas than in urban areas and farmers die by suicide at a rate 3.5 times higher than the general population.
Mental health hotlines for farmers have seen more calls this year. In addition to the normally stressful profession, farmers have another year of unstable trade, less than desirable markets, high input costs and the phrase “farm crisis” on the tip of many people’s tongues.

Amber Wright, a therapist with Integrated Telehealth Partners, said there are certain signs that a farmer, or anyone, might be in a poor mental health state. Wright said communication, on the part of the person struggling and from their support network, are important factors in addressing some of the issues. 
Wright, who meets with patients via telehealth at UnityPoint Health’s Behavioral Health Clinic in Grinnell, said irritability, increased substance or alcohol consumption, and sleeplessness are signs that someone might be having more than just a bad day. 
“That could be another symptom of something else major,” Wright said.

FarmAid hotline: 
1-800-FARM-AID 


According to FarmAid, which operates a hotline for farmers in need of assistance, farmers have unique stressors that affect their mental health: farming relies on factors outside of a farmer’s control, they often work alone for long hours at a time, there is a lot of pressure to hold onto their land and they usually have a self-reliant attitude that makes it difficult to ask for help. 
Rural areas where farmers live are also more likely to be mental health care deserts, which adds to the difficulty of finding help. 
Wright said meeting the “daily requirements” for living – adequate food, fluids and sleep – can help alleviate some of the stress that can lead to a more serious mental health issue. She also recommended farmers make time for a hobby or activity, like walking the dog, going for a drive, or grabbing coffee with a friend. 
“Trying to find those skills that are going to help you decrease that stress and also kind of help bring your morale back up too,” Wright said. 
Telehealth counseling and online resources can be another option for rural households. Iowa State University, Iowa Farm Bureau and Iowa Corn Growers Association have lists of mental health resources for farmers. 
Other organizations, like Farm Rescue, offer operational support, like haying or feeding livestock, to farm families in distress.
ISU has the Iowa Concern hotline and a partnership with Farm Foundation to offer free counseling and other resources. The university also has a list of stress management resources, like financial planning, legal counseling and disaster assistance. 
Wright said resources like this can be helpful to manage stress. Even writing out expenses and trying to come up with a financial plan can make it a little less stressful the next time a piece of equipment breaks down. 
“Always communicate, write out things, write them down, talk to people … ask for help,” she said.

Southern Turnings, founded by Scott and Jane Ann Maddox, has become a staple for residents and a tourist destination for visitors. 
The business now hosts community events, weekly classes and has expanded to additional locations, playing a significant role in efforts to bring activity back to Pine Avenue.
Starting with a single lathe 
When Southern Turnings opened more than eight years ago, Scott Maddox said downtown Wiggins had “one other struggling business.”  
“When I moved here (in 1997), this was a vibrant community,” he said. “All the buildings were open, there were shops, there were things to do. It was wonderful. Over time, that kind of dissipated, and basically there was nothing here.” 
Originally, the space was intended to be Maddox’s studio — just an air-conditioned space to turn wood. The idea to add a coffee shop and retail area came from Jane Ann Maddox. Still, the first few years showed little promise.

Maddox remembers asking his wife to buy a soda just to log a transaction for the day.
“I just thought we’d lost our minds. I mean, there was just no business,” he said.  
They stuck with it through the COVID-19 pandemic, and eventually, the tide turned. 
“Pretty soon we were sitting here going, ‘This is crazy!’” Maddox said. “I give credit to our community for making that (growth) happen, because obviously, if they wouldn’t come through that door, we wouldn’t be growing.” 
He said there’s no secret to success — much of the credit goes to their employees and patrons. 
“I don’t think I’ve done anything different than anybody else could have done, but I am told that people hope we never leave,” he said. 
Teaching the next generation

As Southern Turning continues to grow, it offers new opportunities to connect with the community — including weekly hands-on woodworking classes.  
Maddox first learned about woodturning — using a lathe to shape wood into symmetrical items like bowls and cups — during a trip to Silver Dollar City in Stone County, Missouri. He was fascinated by the craft, watching a young ex-Marine with PTSD turn wood for three hours.  
A retired high school teacher, Maddox said he envisioned his studio as an extension of the classroom. Over the years, he has taught students who have gone on to sell their pieces to help pay for college. Today, his students range from age 11 to 92. 
While Maddox may be  one of the only practicing woodturners in the area, he’s part of a broader community that stretches across Mississippi and into Memphis.
“There’s something about making something,” he said. “I would hope that kids would get more involved because that’s something that will last forever, but once people like me pass away and are no longer turning, it’s a craft that’s going away.” 
A vision for what comes next

Southern Turnings’ success has grown alongside renewed efforts to revitalize downtown. Maddox said local business owners formed the Pine Avenue Business Association, which now hosts events on the first Saturday of each month to bring more people to the area.
That momentum has inspired the Maddoxes to expand. Two and a half years ago, they opened a drive-thru coffee hut, which has thrived like the original location. A third location — a coffee shop at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College — is expected to open Jan. 5. 
The Maddoxes have also begun thinking about the future. With retirement on the horizon, they’ve considered eventually selling the business — but for now, they say they’re focused on staying connected to the community.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/29092413/Wood-Turning_Image_Studio.jpg,,,2026-01-03 09:12:17.047576

Dozens of boat strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean that the president and members of his administration have justified, without showing evidence, by saying the boats were carrying drugs to the U.S.“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” Trump wrote on his social media site, TruthSocial. “This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement.”The president will hold a press conference at his Florida residence in Mar-a-Lago at 11 a.m. Eastern. Andy Kim: Officials ‘blatantly lied’ to CongressThe news drew ire from members of Congress. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Andy Kim said for weeks Trump officials briefed Congress that the boat strikes were not “about regime change.”“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote on social media. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.""Utah’s GOP Sen. Mike Lee initially questioned “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”But Lee later changed course after speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.“He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” Lee said of Rubio.Rubio has long stated that Venezuela’s president is not legitimate, nor is his government. Rubio accused him of being the head of a drug cartel, but provided little evidence.  For months, Democrats and a handful of Republican lawmakers have tried to curb the president’s strikes in the Caribbean, which have killed hundreds, but Congress failed to pass several War Powers Resolutions.The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a tool for Congress to check the power of the executive branch by limiting the president's ability to initiate or escalate military actions abroad.",,,,2026-01-03 08:56:58.300171

From beginning to end, 2025 was a year of devastation for scientists in the United States.
January saw the abrupt suspension of key operations across the National Institutes of Health, not only disrupting clinical trials and other in-progress studies but stalling grant reviews and other activities necessary to conduct research. Around the same time, the Trump administration issued executive orders declaring there are only two sexes and ending DEI programs. The Trump administration also removed public data and analysis tools related to health disparties, climate change and environmental justice, among other databases.
February and March saw a steep undercutting of federal support for the infrastructure crucial to conducting research as well as the withholding of federal funding from several universities.
And over the course of the following months, billions of dollars of grants supporting research projects across disciplines, institutions and states were terminated. These include funding already spent on in-progress studies that have been forced to end before completion. Federal agencies, including NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development have been downsized or dismantled altogether.
The Conversation asked researchers from a range of fields to share how the Trump administration’s science funding cuts have affected them. All describe the significant losses they and their communities have experienced. But many also voice their determination to continue doing work they believe is crucial to a healthier, safer and more fair society.

 Pipeline of new scientists cut off

Carrie McDonough, Associate Professor of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University
People are exposed to thousands of synthetic chemicals every day, but the health risks those chemicals pose are poorly understood. I was a co-investigator on a US$1.5 million grant from the EPA to develop machine-learning techniques for rapid chemical safety assessment. My lab was two months into our project when it was terminated in May because it no longer aligned with agency priorities, despite the administration’s Make America Healthy Again report specifically highlighting using AI to rapidly assess childhood chemical exposures as a focus area.
Labs like mine are usually pipelines for early-career scientists to enter federal research labs, but the uncertain future of federal research agencies has disrupted this process. I’m seeing recent graduates lose federal jobs, and countless opportunities disappear. Students who would have been the next generation of scientists helping to shape environmental regulations to protect Americans have had their careers altered forever.
I’ve been splitting my time between research, teaching and advocating for academic freedom and the economic importance of science funding because I care deeply about the scientific and academic excellence of this country and its effects on the world. I owe it to my students and the next generation to make sure people know what’s at stake.

 Fewer people trained to treat addiction

Cara Poland, Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University
I run a program that has trained 20,000 health care practitioners across the U.S. on how to effectively and compassionately treat addiction in their communities. Most doctors aren’t trained to treat addiction, leaving patients without lifesaving care and leading to preventable deaths.
This work is personal: My brother died from substance use disorder. Behind every statistic is a family like mine, hoping for care that could save their loved one’s life.
With our federal funding cut by 60%, my team and I are unable to continue developing our addiction medicine curriculum and enrolling medical schools and clinicians into our program.
Meanwhile, addiction-related deaths continue to rise as the U.S. health system loses its capacity to deliver effective treatment. These setbacks ripple through hospitals and communities, perpetuating treatment gaps and deepening the addiction crisis.

 Communities left to brave extreme weather alone

Brian G. Henning, Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies and Sciences, Gonzaga University
In 2021, a heat dome settled over the Northwest, shattering temperature records and claiming lives. Since that devastating summer, my team and I have been working with the City of Spokane to prepare for the climate challenges ahead.
We and the city were awarded a $19.9 million grant from the EPA to support projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build capacity to address environmental and climate justice challenges.
As our work was about to begin, the Trump administration rescinded our funding in May. As a result, the five public facilities that were set to serve as hubs for community members to gather during extreme weather will be less equipped to handle power failures. Around 300 low-income households will miss out on efficient HVAC system updates. And our local economy will lose the jobs and investments these projects would have generated.
Despite this setback, the work will continue. My team and I care about our neighbors, and we remain focused on helping our community become more resilient to extreme heat and wildfires. This includes pursuing new funding to support this work. It will be smaller, slower and with fewer resources than planned, but we are not deterred.

 LGBTQ+ people made invisible

Nathaniel M. Tran, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Administration, University of Illinois Chicago
This year nearly broke me as a scientist.
Shortly after coming into office, the Trump administration began targeting research projects focusing on LGBTQ+ health for early termination. I felt demoralized after receiving termination letters from the NIH for my own project examining access to preventive services and home-based care among LGBTQ+ older adults. The disruption of publicly funded research projects wastes millions of dollars from existing contracts.
Then, news broke that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer process or make publicly available the LGBTQ+ demographic data that public health researchers like me rely on.
But instead of becoming demoralized, I grew emboldened: I will not be erased, and I will not let the LGBTQ+ community be erased. These setbacks renewed my commitment to advancing the public’s health, guided by rigorous science, collaboration and equity.

 Pediatric brain cancer research squelched

Rachael Sirianni, Professor of Neurological Surgery, UMass Chan Medical School
My lab designs new cancer treatments. We are one of only a few groups in the nation focused on treating pediatric cancer that has spread across the brain and spinal cord. This research is being crushed by the broad, destabilizing impacts of federal cuts to the NIH.
Compared to last year, I am working with around 25% of our funding and less than 50% of our staff. We cannot finish our studies, publish results or pursue new ideas. We have lost technology in development. Students and colleagues are leaving as training opportunities and hope for the future of science dries up.
I’m faced with impossible questions about what to do next. Do I use my dwindling research funds to maintain personnel who took years to train? Keep equipment running? Bet it all on one final, risky study? There are simply no good choices remaining.

 Inequality in science festers

Stephanie Nawyn, Associate Professor of Sociology, Michigan State University
Many people have asked me how the termination of my National Science Foundation grant to improve work cultures in university departments has affected me, but I believe that is the wrong question. Certainly it has meant the loss of publications, summer funding for faculty and graduate students, and opportunities to make working conditions at my and my colleagues’ institutions more equitable and inclusive.
But the greatest effects will come from the widespread terminations across science as a whole, including the elimination of NSF programs dedicated to improving gender equity in science and technology. These terminations are part of a broader dismantling of science and higher education that will have cascading negative effects lasting decades.
Infrastructure for knowledge production that took years to build cannot be rebuilt overnight.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)There was nothing under the tree this Christmas for South Dakota’s schools, state employees and health care providers.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden proposed no funding increase for them in the next state budget.
“Because our revenues haven’t grown much, we have to keep them flat this year,” Rhoden said during his annual December budget address.
Hearing that news so close to the holidays, I was reminded of the climactic movie scene in “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation,” when a wife takes her husband to task for eliminating his company’s Christmas bonuses.
“You didn’t!” she exclaims. “Well, of all the cheap, lousy ways to save a buck!”
Governor proposes ‘limited budget’ for SD that avoids big cuts but keeps school funding flat

Rhoden’s plan looks even cheaper and lousier in light of the revenue our state government has surrendered, the money it’s wasted, and the questions that have arisen about its spending on economic development.
Three years ago, lawmakers and then-Gov. Kristi Noem decided to reduce the state sales tax rate from 4.5% to 4.2% until 2027. It was an ill-considered attempt to distract homeowners from their property tax complaints by giving them a sales tax holiday they didn’t ask for, and it cost the state more than $100 million in annual revenue. Most consumers, meanwhile, aren’t noticing the penny they’re saving every time they spend $3.33.
Noem’s administration also squandered $20 million developing a prison site that ultimately had to be abandoned.
That fiasco began four years ago. The state was flush with cash from federal COVID-19 relief and stimulus funding, so Noem and legislators started stuffing money into a prison construction account. They wanted to replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, which dates to 1881.
Noem’s Department of Corrections selected a site in rural Lincoln County, and a lawsuit quickly arose from landowners who hadn’t been told that a prison might pop up in their neighborhood.
Years of contention boiled over last winter after Noem bolted to run the federal Department of Homeland Security. An insurgent group of legislators led a revolt against the Lincoln County location, and Rhoden — who was elevated from lieutenant governor upon Noem’s departure — surrendered to reality. He pushed the reset button and appointed a task force that selected a different site in Sioux Falls.
By that time, the state had already spent an unrecoverable $20 million on the abandoned land, for myriad expenses including design work, sewer pipes, herbicide application and geothermal test wells.
More recently, questions have arisen about the combined $69 million of grants, loans and tax rebates that the administrations of Noem and Rhoden have showered on CJ Schwan’s. The money is helping the company build a $550 million frozen food production plant in northern Sioux Falls that will employ 650 people (the math works out to about $106,000 of state aid per employee, for jobs that will pay an average of $40,000 per year).


Let us know what you think...


 

CJ Schwan’s employs Noem’s former state economic development commissioner, Steve Westra, who pledged the first state grant to the company four years ago before leaving his state job. The company also has the chairman of the state’s Board of Economic Development, Jeff Erickson, on its corporate board, while Erickson is involved with a corporation that rents space to CJ Schwan’s in a downtown Sioux Falls office building.
CJ Schwan’s is part of CJ Group, a South Korean conglomerate that had $30 billion in revenue last year. That’s an amount four times larger than South Dakota’s annual state budget.
Now, after flushing so many dollars, Rhoden wants lawmakers to pinch pennies. He’s offering schools, state employees and Medicaid-funded health care providers the equivalent of the jelly-of-the-month subscription that Clark Griswold’s boss substituted for bonuses in “Christmas Vacation.”
Clark called that “the biggest bag-over-the-head, punch-in-the-face I ever got.”
South Dakotans might feel the same way if lawmakers adopt Rhoden’s budget plan.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EM8A3851-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 08:11:41.189736

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — With Tyson Foods weeks away from shuttering its Lexington beef plant, the anticipated financial blow to the state is becoming clearer. Meanwhile, some workers have made strides to adjust.
The statewide economic loss, including both direct and ripple effects, is estimated at $3.28 billion a year, according to a recently released University of Nebraska-Lincoln analysis.

While public documents reported that a “mass layoff” of 3,212 Tyson workers will occur “on or around” Jan. 20, the UNL study projects more than 7,000 jobs will be lost statewide, along with an annual labor income loss of $530 million. That higher job loss count includes employees in other industries that support the Tyson beef plant operation and its workforce.
Tax revenues also will drop with the exit of Lexington’s largest employer. The projected annual decline in state personal income tax revenue is estimated at $23.2 million, according to the Dec. 22 report, and state sales tax proceeds are predicted to slide by $10 million a year.
Dawson County and neighboring communities will feel a concentrated punch, say authors and economics professors Elliott Dennis and Eric Thompson. Dennis specializes in livestock and risk management in UNL’s Department of Agricultural Economics. Thompson is an economist and director of the UNL Bureau of Business Research. 
According to their analysis, local sales tax revenues in Dawson County will likely fall by $2.77 million a year due to the plant folding. Tyson has said that certain wind-down activities may continue for a short time beyond the Jan. 20 date.
Thompson called the Tyson plant closure significant statewide, saying he hasn’t seen many local employers “of this scale” close shop in the past few decades. The UNL analysis said the Lexington plant could process nearly 5,000 cattle daily, about 4.8% of total daily U.S. beef slaughter. It said the plant’s demise marks the first time one of the “Big Four” meatpacking companies has permanently closed a major facility during the current cattle supply crunch.
Still, Thompson said, such an occurrence in a market economy is not unnatural. 
“The state needs to really focus on getting new investment,” he said.
 Norfolk plant still empty 

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said that Tyson officials were exploring options for the Lexington facility that include repurposing it into a “value-added” ag operation. Tyson has not announced any plan.
Nebraskans lament Tyson decision to close Lexington plant with 3,200 workers

U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb, has lamented publicly that Tyson about 20 years ago “pulled out” of his hometown of Norfolk, eliminating 1,300 jobs at the company’s stripped and now-abandoned meatpacking facility there, and the property has yet to be repurposed.
Since Tyson announced the Lexington plant closure on Nov. 21, Pillen has said that more than 1,600 people attended job fairs and other events designed to connect displaced workers with potential jobs and state workforce support services. More events are scheduled.
An hour drive from Lexington, the recently opened Sustainable Beef meatpacking plant in North Platte is hiring about 100 more workers and raising its daily cattle processing goal as a result of Tyson’s Lexington announcement, the North Platte Telegraph and Wall Street Journal have reported.
Lexington-area Tyson workers were inquiring about jobs immediately after Arkansas-based Tyson announced the closure. Sustainable Beef CEO David Briggs told the Telegraph that about 400 former Tyson workers already had joined his workforce, some before and some after the Nov. 21 announcement. 
Today, the North Platte plant reportedly aims for 1,000 employees and to process 1,800 head of cattle per day.
Rancher-owned Sustainable Beef opened its plant in 2025 and was expected to create a more competitive supply chain against the “Big Four” producers. The four, Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef, control about 83-85% of U.S. beef processing capacity, which, Dennis said, has long been a point of concern for cattle producers regarding market power and price.
For the Dec. 22 economic impact report, the UNL economists drew upon multiple data sources and used the IMpact analysis for PLANing (IMPLAN) model, a tool they described as an industry standard. 



What led to packing plant shutdown?
A separate UNL analysis identified a fundamental driver of the Lexington plant’s closure as U.S. cattle supplies, saying the national herd is at a 70-year low. That Dec. 12 report said the cattle shortage stems from:

A multiyear drought in Texas and Southern Plains states that burned up pasture and increased feeding costs
Improved beef efficiency, leading to more beef per carcass due partly to genetic improvements
Slower-than-expected herd rebuilding due to aging producers, higher interest rates and producer desires to pay down debt leading to less retention of heifers
Recent disruptions, including shut down of the southern U.S. border to Mexican feeder cattle due to concerns about New World screwworm

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said also that he was told key contributors to Tyson’s decision to end Lexington operations involved the age and inefficiencies of the factory, which was built decades ago to manufacture combines and other farm machinery before being retrofitted for a meatpacking plant around 1990.

President Donald Trump’s administration announced this week Louisiana will receive $208 million in 2026 from the massive $50 billion federal rural health fund that will be distributed over the next five years.  The amount of money each state receives will be recalculated annually until the $50 billion is exhausted in 2030. 
Louisiana officials said this initial allocation indicates the support the state can expect to garner in future years. Assuming its $208 million allocation continues, Louisiana should receive more than $1 billion for rural health care support over the five-year life of the fund, Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said Friday in an interview. 

The state plans to use some of its money to add slots to health care training and degree programs that already exist at Louisiana public universities and colleges. The additional spots would be prioritized for students who show an interest in working in rural areas. 

Greenstein held out a mental health counseling program at Northwestern State University as an example of a degree track that could be expanded with the rural health funds. He said the university has more qualified candidates applying to that program than it can afford to train currently. 

The state is also looking to expand the Health Care Employment Reinvestment Opportunity (HERO) program, which leverages public money to attract private funding for scholarships given to health care students who agree to work in underserved communities. A new rural version of this initiative is likely to be set up with the money, Greenstein said.  
Louisiana is also looking to set up a rural clinician credit bank, where rural hospitals and other health care providers can draw down public funds in order to provide signing and retention bonuses for medical professionals. This would allow rural health care employers to compete with their urban and suburban counterparts, who have more resources to provide such incentives, Greenstein said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The money may also go toward reestablishing a state income tax credit for rural health care professionals, according to Louisiana’s application for the rural health care funding submitted last year. Approximately 400 rural health care workers took advantage of a similar tax credit when it existed previously, according to the application. 
Louisiana will also help rural hospitals purchase electronic health records systems with the money. Greenstein said this should improve access to care for people who need to see specialists. It will make it easier for rural hospital patients to have their cancer screenings, X-rays and other images transferred from their primary care provider to specialists at other hospital systems, for example. 

Putting rural patients’ records into an electronic system will also make it much easier to collect data and identify trends in health care across the state. Louisiana will be able to better respond to its health care challenges when it has access to more accurate and better information about health care delivery, Greenstein said. 

The rural health funding will also allow Louisiana to distribute wireless health care devices to more residents. 

Patients with chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes, would be able to take readings of their blood pressure, blood sugar and blood oxygen levels at home that could then be monitored by health care providers remotely. 
This could help rural residents, who live farther away from medical facilities, when it’s necessary to see their health care providers in person and before their condition requires emergency services, Greenstein said. 
The state will also use the federal money to partner with rural health care providers to launch nutrition programs called “food FARMacies.” Rural hospitals and other providers will be given the money to provide education on diet and disease prevention through food and meal planning. They will also be sites for direct access to fresh food through collaborations with local farmers, according to the state rural funding application. 

The health department will be using some of Louisiana’s existing programs for nutrition and fitness the LSU Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge has already developed. 

Jeff Reynolds, executive director of the Rural Hospital Coalition of Louisiana, said his organization is excited about the opportunities the funding will enable, particularly when it comes to luring more health care workers to rural institutions. 

But health care experts have warned the federal government’s $50 billion rural health care fund will not be enough to make up for massive cuts to the national Medicaid program over the next decade. Those reductions, pushed by Trump, will disproportionately impact rural hospitals because their patients are more likely to have low incomes and rely on Medicaid for health insurance.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vaughanregionalmedicalcenter_mclelland12870-1024x6831766063149-1.jpg,,,2026-01-03 06:13:13.761326

Decisions now are largely local, but state lawmakers could soon change that.","An aerial view shows an Amazon data center last year in Ashburn, Virginia. Maryland officials are trying to balance between opponents of data centers and their environmental and energy demands, and the wholesale acceptance of centers by Virginia, for their jobs and tax revenues. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)The proposals seem to be cropping up left and right.
A vacant Social Security building in Baltimore County. A former power plant in Montgomery. An old mall site in Prince George’s. And that’s on top of a data center campus that has long been under development on a former industrial site in Frederick County.
It’s likely that large scale data centers, which have a large presence in neighboring Virginia, will make their way to Maryland in greater numbers in the years ahead. Yet, there isn’t a cohesive statewide policy regulating the arrival of these facilities, which demand immense amounts of energy. Instead, local jurisdictions wield much of the power to approve or deny projects through zoning rules.
“Local governments can make decisions that affect the entire state,” said Dave Arndt, co-chair of the Maryland Legislative Coalition Climate Justice Wing, who focuses on data centers. “If they approve a very large hyperscale data center that requires new transmission lines, new distribution lines and a new substation — and uses the same amount of electricity as the city of Baltimore — that’s going to increase our rates.”
During the coming General Assembly session, data center regulations are likely to draw some interest, as Maryland’s grid operator continues to issue dire warnings about just how much energy they’re projected to demand — and how that could send energy prices soaring ever further.
Perhaps one needn’t look any further than December’s special session, during which lawmakers overrode Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) veto of a study to evaluate data centers’ potential impact on the state, one of several studies the governor rejected.

Speaking from the Senate floor about the study, Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County) said his office learned over the summer about the data center proposal in Woodlawn — in his district — and has been in “fact-finding mode” ever since.
“The experts are adamant that across the country, and here in Maryland, we are currently rushing to approve data center projects through a poorly planned, chaotic process that lacks a foolproof regulatory framework to protect our communities from harm,” Sydnor said.
Sydnor argued that data center projects seem to offer benefits “only for the wealthy,” while the costs “are socialized for everyone else.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), speaking for an override of the governor’s veto, said looming data centers have “a very real impact. Frederick County is the first that has really started to develop our data center platforms, and right now we’re looking at a 2,200-acre parcel.”
Last session, the legislature integrated a few data center regulations in a broader package of energy reforms. For example, one provision required electric utilities to create new rate schedules for large-load customers such as data centers — subject to approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC).
“It is the intent of the General Assembly that residential retail electric customers in the State should not bear the financial risks associated with large load customers interconnecting to the electric system serving the State,” read the bill, which Moore signed in May.
But it seems clear more rule changes are coming.
For his part, the governor argues that the state should open its doors to data centers — but not without constraints.
“I do not believe in the false choice that oftentimes is being laid out: That it’s either we let Big Tech do whatever they want, and we turn intoo Northern Virginia, or it’s, don’t allow any type of economic development in the state,” Moore said during a recent news conference. “I don’t think either one of those answers are right.”
In 2024, Moore’s administration proposed a bill exempting data centers’ diesel-powered backup generators from scrutiny by the  PSC, which passed.
In his recent remarks, Moore said he envisions a process where state officials work with the impacted community, local officials and environmental groups to determine how data centers considering Maryland can contribute using “best practices,” including by bringing their own power generation along with them.
Data center woes at PJM
Under current policies, all electricity ratepayers share the costs of system expansion and maintenance. But there’s a growing push to require very large users to fund the power boosts that they require.
Maryland Gov. Wes. Moore (D) announces a new executive order focused on bolstering energy generation in Maryland on Dec. 19, 2025.
Leaders at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, which includes Maryland, Washington, D.C., and a dozen other states, are currently considering a host of possible policy changes related to data centers. They’re expected to make a decision in January, after which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gets to make the final call.
A proposal from state governors, including Moore, called for PJM to provide incentives for data centers to bring their own power generation. A proposal from state lawmakers, including several Marylanders, would require PJM to curtail power to data centers in emergencies if they do not bring their own generation.
The need for regulatory change appears dire. At its energy capacity auction in December, PJM failed to procure all of the energy that it deemed necessary for the 2027-2028 delivery year — and the projected demand from data centers was largely to blame.
The shortfall doesn’t mean that the grid won’t be able to serve customers during the delivery year. But PJM aims to have a 20% reserve margin for power system emergencies, and it only secured 14.8%.
The shortage happened because PJM projections show there will be an increase of nearly 5,100 megawatts worth of data center demand for those years, though there is worry that the demand is being over-counted as data centers talk to multiple power companies about the same project.
PJM officials are optimistic that their policy changes could reduce the shortfall by lowering the projected toll of data centers.
“There are factors here that lead us to believe that we will actually be closer to the … standard once the delivery year arrives, because of things that we expect to change between now and 2027,” said Stu Bressler, executive vice president of market services and strategy at PJM.
Maryland isn’t ‘negotiating with an empty hand’
At the same time, Maryland is eyeing policy changes of its own.
Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), said she is working on a bill that would require all data centers of a certain size to receive a certificate to operate from the PSC.
She argues that the bill would provide a new layer of state scrutiny focused on energy usage, going beyond the current permitting regime at the Maryland Department of the Environment, which is more focused on emissions and site conditions. But it would also create a state-level repository of data center proposals, making it easier to keep track of proposals.
“It’s basically a transparency bill, so that we’ll have everything in one place at the state,” Hester said.
Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said she is crafting a bill that would encourage data centers to curtail their power usage during peak periods, such as hot days, when the electrical system is taxed by heavy usage of air conditioners. The electrical system is built around withstanding the peaks, Charkoudian said, even though most of the year, the system is far from maxed out.
“I’m really focused on: When data centers are coming online in Maryland, how can they be part of the solution for the 100 hours a year where their presence is going to lead to driving up costs?” Charkoudian said.
Data centers could reduce their usage by moving particular work to non-peak periods, or pre-cooling their equipment to avoid cooling during the hottest time of the day, when the grid will be most taxed, Charkoudian said.
Charkoudian said her bill will also incentivize data centers to build battery energy storage facilities in their areas, so that they could turn to stored power during peak periods.
Arndt from the Climate Justice Wing called Charkoudian’s bill a “win-win-win situation.”

“They [data centers] stay operational. The grid stays operational. We win because we don’t have to build new peaker plants,” Arndt said, referring to plants that are called on in peak demand periods.
But it’s important that the bill continue to ensure that data centers use clean backup power during peak periods, rather than relying on fossil fuel backup generators, Arndt cautioned.
“We don’t want diesel generators running for four hours in a community just because we’re running low on energy.” Arndt said.
Angie McCarthy, Maryland conservation advocate at Nature Forward, said her group supports Charkoudian’s bill, though she knows it won’t come without controversy. She expects data center players to argue that onerous regulations could cause data centers to seek sites in nearby states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Maryland.
“From our perspective, Maryland is seen as a prime spot for data center development, because we have such access to the fiber-optic cables and other infrastructure that Virginia has installed in their state,” McCarthy said. “We aren’t negotiating with an empty hand.”
The Maryland Tech Council, a trade association representing technology companies, has focused much of its recent messaging on the economic boost that data centers can bring to the state.
A typical 800,000 square foot data center produces about 5,000 jobs during construction, along with $775 million in economic activity and $18 million in state tax revenue, according to a Tech Council report issued in August. During operation, a typical facility spurs 500 permanent jobs, $31 million in annual compensation and $14 million in annual state tax revenue, according to the study, conducted by the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based firm led by economist Anirban Basu.
In a more recent report, the Tech Council zeroed in on Prince George’s County, arguing that a “mid-sized” data center development would generate over $1 billion in economic activity during construction, and $20 million in annual tax revenue for the county.
“As other states aggressively compete for data center investment, Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” reads the August report. “By welcoming responsible data center development, Maryland can address its immediate fiscal and economic challenges while positioning itself as a leader in the digital economy for decades to come. The time to act is now; before this opportunity, like so many others, migrates to neighboring states with more favorable business environments.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2161851139.jpg,,,2026-01-03 09:56:46.080237

Scott Applewhite/AP)The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run — a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 — a full year before her term was set to expire.
There are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.
Rather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats — or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive — many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.
As of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions — Republicans in 2018 and 2020 — this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.
There is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.
As a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.
 
Why do members leave Congress?
Many planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members.
For example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.
Sometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.
Other members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.
But some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on.
In a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.
 
What’s unique about 2026?
In addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.
The shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies.
In Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats — nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation — are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.
All decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.
In 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.

Currently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates.
Democrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.
As a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough danger to abandon the fight in advance.
 
Retirement vs. resignation
One final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one.
House conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House.
This also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
One of the murkiest questions surrounding the Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort seems like it should be the easiest to answer: Is the water getting clearer?
For decades, widely used data indicate that, overall, water clarity is getting worse.
Earlier this year, for instance, the Chesapeake Bay Report Card released by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science reported that 2024 water clarity was “very poor” and that “water clarity scores continue to show a significant decline over time.”
One of the major goals of the state-federal Bay Program partnership is to reduce the amount of sediment and nutrients entering the Bay to improve clarity so that underwater grass beds can get enough light to survive.
The region has spent billions of dollars to control sediment and nutrient-fueled algae blooms that cloud the water — seemingly without significant results.
Yet underwater grass beds in the Bay have expanded even as data seem to show that the water is murkier. The amount of submerged aquatic vegetation, or SAV, increased from 38,227 acres in 1984 to 78,451 acres last year.

If the water is cloudy, how are grasses getting enough light to expand?
A recent analysis published in the Annual Review of Marine Science came up with an answer, though it is murky too: The amount of light available for plants is improving, even if it doesn’t always look that way.
“For a long time, the story was that we’ve been cleaning up the watershed, but clarity is not improving,” said Jessie Turner, an assistant professor in the Department of Ocean and Earth Sciences at Old Dominion University, who was the lead author of the journal article.
“That has switched, but it was hard to untangle things,” she said.
Turner has been trying to sort out the story for nearly a decade, first as a student at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and then in her current position. Former colleagues from VIMS and the University of Delaware are co-authors of the article.
It turns out that how far we see into the water — how visibly “clear” it is — is not the same thing as how much light is passing through that water.
The Bay goal is to get more light to underwater plants, but the main tool for measuring clarity has been the Secchi disk — a black and white disk that is lowered into the water until it disappears. The Secchi disk is cheap and easy to use and has been relied upon for decades by researchers and citizen scientists.
But it measures visual clarity, not the amount or quality of light that might be reaching plants on the bottom.
Bay water is filled with tiny particles. Some are bits of sediment, but many are tiny algae cells and microscopic bits of detritus from organic material that is breaking down in the water.
Those organic particles limit visibility, but they don’t block light waves. Instead, they scatter them, reflecting light through the water column. Turner likens it to headlights in a fog bank. The headlights brighten the fog, which is made up of tiny water particles, but a driver can’t see very far into it.
“You can have a lot of light getting to your eyeball in the fog, but the visibility is very poor,” Turner said. “In the water, that would look like a very shallow Secchi depth reading. But you still have enough light for something like seagrass.”
“What ultimately matters to something like SAV is how much light is getting to the bottom,” she said.
When Turner and her colleagues examined historical data gathered with specialized light sensors, they found a different trend than those seen with Secchi disks.
Data from those sensors, which assess the amount of sunlight that is penetrating the water, including the specific wavelengths that are important for plant photosynthesis, show improvements since around 1990.

Many factors affect clarity and light availability, and their relative importance varies from place to place. Sorting them out is complex. For instance, the amount of sediment in the water has slowly declined over time. That has helped clear the water, but clearer water allows for more algal growth, Turner said, which in turn contributes to more tiny particles of organic material. The particles gradually settle to the bottom but are easily resuspended.
That can cloud the water from a Secchi disk perspective, but the increased amount of tiny organic particles, rather than larger sediment particles, can improve light.
Trying to understand all those factors, Turner said, “is a little bit of a maze.”
Water clarity is still important, she noted. Someone diving in the Bay wants to be able to see where they are going, and someone throwing a fishing line into the water wants a fish to be able to spot bait at the end of the line.
Future nutrient reductions should further reduce algae production, and over time that could improve clarity. That might be happening — Secchi disk readings in the last decade do show a slight improvement.
But it’s hard to predict whether Bay clarity goals will be met, Turner said. That’s because the Bay system has been fundamentally changed over the decades by things such as marsh loss, shoreline hardening and the transformation of its watershed to meet the needs of a growing population.
“A recovered Chesapeake Bay with improved water clarity may not resemble the ecosystem that we predict or expect,” Turner wrote in the paper. As a result, the future Bay may have a mix of different particle types and sizes than it did in the past, which means expectations about future clarity may be altered as well.
The good news is that even if clarity goals are not fully attained, continued light improvements will have ecological benefits, especially for grass beds, which will result in healthier ecosystems over time and more habitat for fish and crabs.
“We may get to a point where you still can’t see the bottom when you go swimming in a lot of places,” Turner said. “But if the ecosystem is healthy in terms of what’s living in it, then maybe that’s a success story in and of itself.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/692f0bc449c13-1-1024x667.jpeg,,,2026-01-03 10:56:54.767648

The case against the AG has stretched back to a 2021 dispute between the Legislative branch and the state Supreme Court and ultimately embroiled all three branches in murky allegations of impropriety, focusing on Knudsen’s actions while defending the Legislative and administrative branches. 
In 2023, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline for members of the state bar, filed a complaint alleging Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct in 41 separate counts — which Knudsen’s lawyers described as a “political stunt.”
Subsequently, in 2024, the Commission on Practice, which regulates lawyers, recommended the state Supreme Court suspend him for 90 days. Knudsen is a Republican in his second term as AG.
In an order Wednesday, the Supreme Court, which included five district court judges as a majority of the state’s highest court recused themselves, dismissed the recommendation to suspend Knudsen, citing in part violations to his due process rights, although Justice Katherine Bidegaray dissented.
But the court had to grapple with a number of points in its deliberations, including arguments that Knudsen, as an elected official in the executive branch, couldn’t be regulated by another branch of government.
The court opinion, written by Chief Justice Cory Swanson, created precedent in stating that the Attorney General is subject to the Commission on Practice and ultimate jurisdiction of the Montana Supreme Court.
In recent years in Montana, Republicans including Knudsen have been highly critical of the judiciary.

While the court asserted its own jurisdiction and dismissed much of the case against Knudsen, Swanson wrote that Knudsen’s actions “throughout the saga of 2021 were beyond what we have seen any competent attorney, let alone the Attorney General, do.”
Swanson added that the opinion of the court “suffices as the Court’s public admonition regarding the rule violations.”
“Moreover, we plainly warn all Montana attorneys, including Knudsen and his subordinates, to obey lawful orders of all courts,” the opinion said.
In the opinion, the court also addressed whether Knudsen had been afforded due process, and whether the allegations against him were factual. 
In addressing the specific complaints against Knudsen, mostly related to disobeying court orders and making statements critical of the Supreme Court, the ruling found that Knudsen violated two rules of professional conduct, but that the Commission “failed to provide legal justification” and proof that he had violated three other rules of professional conduct. 
However, the court also found several instances where Knudsen successfully argued that his due process had been violated. 
In one instance, the Commission excluded an expert witness without allowing Knudsen time to respond to a motion, while in another the court stated that the Commission issued “inadequate conclusions of law.”
“This due process violation alone is sufficiently serious to vacate the Commission’s decision and remand it for a new proceeding or entry of an amended decision explaining its conclusions of law,” the ruling stated. But, “given the time, expense and turmoil that have exceeded all expectations in this proceeding, we have no intention of remanding this matter for another round.”
The majority opinion used those instances as reasoning for dismissal and for not disciplining Knudsen for the actions that were proven violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, a justification Bidegaray described as “unprecedented” in her dissent. 
In a statement, Knudsen expressed his appreciation for the Supreme Court “bringing this frivolous complaint to a long-overdue conclusion.”
“We’ve said it from the very beginning, this was nothing more than a political stunt,” Knudsen said. 
 DISSENT

While the five district court judges appointed to hear the case agreed with Swanson, Supreme Court Justice Katherine Bidegaray, one of the court’s newest members, dissented, arguing that finding a lawyer broke rules of conduct but refusing to discipline them weakened the court’s authority and erodes confidence in the legal system. 
Bidegaray said the court record, and state precedent, don’t justify nullifying Knudsen’s disciplinary record “or insulating an elected attorney from professional accountability.”
While she concurred with much of the majority opinion, she added that she would hold Knudsen violated a third professional rule of conduct by disobeying a court order that “was prejudicial to the administration of justice.”
She also pushed back against the conclusions that Knudsen’s due process rights were violated by the Commission, and that none of the actions taken resulted in substantial prejudice against him — indeed a two-day hearing, plus the Supreme Court’s ability to review the written decisions, gave Knudsen his due process, she wrote. 
But Bidegaray’s biggest dissent came from the “unprecedented and extraordinary decision” to not discipline Knudsen for the professional violations the court agreed Knudsen committed. 
“There has never been a case where this Court dismissed a disciplinary action while also holding that the attorney committed proven misconduct,” she wrote. “Until today.”
She added that dismissal ultimately nullifies the entire proceedings of the case, and “such a remedy is incompatible with our constitutional obligation to regulate the bar and protect the public.”
Bidegaray also pointed out some irregularities in how the Supreme Court handled the case, comparing them to ones made by Commission that were considered egregious enough to warrant due process violations. 
“The Court appears to have a different standard for adherence to its own procedural rules in these proceedings,” she wrote.
Bidegaray wrote she would impose a public censure, a 30-day suspension and require Knudsen to pay for litigation costs.
“Discipline is not punitive; it is protective—of the public, the courts, and the profession—and serves to preserve confidence in the fair and orderly administration of justice,” she wrote.
In the majority opinion, Swanson noted Bidegaray’s dissent and stated that while her arguments could be correct, the failings by the Commission throughout the process — with due process requirements, and inadequate findings of fact and conclusions of law — precluded such a conclusion. 
“When an attorney — from the newest associate in the smallest firm to the elected official who supervises more lawyers than any other in the state — faces a potential loss of professional licensing, then we expect the proceeding to carry the burden of persuasion and uphold the procedural due process standards written in the rules and in our caselaw,” Swanson wrote. “The Commission failed to do so in numerous respects here, and we only weaken our regulation of the practice of law if we overlook those violations.”

Growth will inevitably continue in Vermont, but is growth something we want to promote or try to manage? 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jerry Ward and John Bossange: Hijacking the abundance myth.","Jerry Ward lives in Randolph and is a retired physician. John Bossange lives in South Burlington and is a retired school principal. Both serve on the Board of Directors of Better (Not Bigger) Vermont.



The panic stirred up by some of our leaders regarding the so-called housing crisis appears to be rooted in a loosely defined abundance narrative that has been adopted to justify rapid growth without fully accounting for its consequences.
Recent commentaries published in VTDigger by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources; Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service; and Miro Weinberger, executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, try to assert that we need to build 40,000 new homes within the next four years. Even Gov. Phil Scott has issued a controversial executive order to boost housing production. Adding to this rush to grow, the Vermont Futures Project has proposed increasing the Vermont population to 802,000. We feel that these initiatives, when combined, are leading us down a path toward growth that will not serve us well.
Growth will inevitably continue in Vermont, but is growth something we want to promote or try to manage? Healthy growth occurs naturally when we foster the conditions that support growth. It is unnecessary and irresponsible to start by building 40,000 new homes by 2030, and we certainly don’t need to increase our population by 150,000 within the decade, especially in Chittenden County, as promoted by the Vermont Futures Project.
We have no argument with those who believe Vermont desperately needs more affordable apartments, duplexes, multifamily homes, condominiums and single-family starter homes. But that is not what has been happening for the last 20 years in Chittenden County, and that’s not what the housing industry is proposing for the future. As we know, there are numerous negative impacts from short-sighted, unsustainable, sprawling growth on municipal services, and it’s the taxpayers who ultimately bear the burden from expensive, market-driven development projects.
The most disappointing and glaring omission in the abundance discussion is simply defining abundance. Of what? Some abundance proponents focus on more energy and less regulation to promote economic development, while advocates in Vermont are focusing on housing. But what happens if we unfetter the constraints imposed by energy, natural resources and Vermont’s strong environmental regulations, and we build those new homes?
Do we not then need an abundance of more clean water? Agricultural land to produce more food? More storm, sewer and water treatment systems? More waste and recycle facilities? More municipal personnel in our towns and village offices? Teachers for the new children. Police, fire responders and maintenance workers for our roads and parklands, to mention just a few impacts of more energy, housing and people? Abundance leads to a need for more abundance, and that has not been adequately addressed by the proponents of the Abundance Agenda in Vermont. That’s the abundance myth.
As a nation, we are conflicted about growth and yet addicted to it. Our existential challenge is to accept a vision of growth within our limited financial capacity and shrinking natural resources. Shortsighted, unsustainable growth is enticing because of the apparent short-term improvements to our standard of living. However, the long-term impacts can bring irreparable damage to what feels like home. Increasingly, we are dealing with the consequences of negative impacts and not planning accordingly for sustainable growth.
Struggling to find an affordable place to live, to pay for all the impacts resulting from an abundance of excessive growth, is the unavoidable but unaddressed elephant in the room. So far, none of the individuals mentioned at the beginning of this commentary or any representative from the organizations they represent have addressed this issue.
Here in Vermont, the home affordability crisis is exacerbated by the growing capture of the housing market by large equity firms and out-of-state investors who purchase single-family homes and rental properties, reducing homeownership opportunities and driving up the cost of rents and housing prices. For those abundance advocates concerned with inhibitors of growth, it is large corporations with lobbying teams that deserve everyone’s greater scrutiny, not necessarily state or local regulations enforced by our small towns and villages.
So, when Moore, Johnson, Weinberger and Scott talk about reducing costs, or about opponents preserving the existing regulatory barriers, or write that we need affordable housing, or that Vermont needs an abundance agenda, or that environmentalists are creating political theater, or that too many families remain priced out of the communities where they grew up, keep in mind the exploitation of the Abundance Agenda, that unspoken elephant in the room. Abundance inevitably leads to a need for more services and natural resources. For private investors, corporations and out-of-state profiteers, that’s not their concern. Vermont’s proposed Abundance Agenda is a gold mine for them, unattainable for most struggling Vermonters.
Abundance needs to be for everyone, not just for those who will destroy our environment, deplete our natural resources and make excessive profits. If it does not, abundance, as defined by influential leaders in Vermont, will remain a hijacked myth and a tool for the rich to get richer.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Clarkson Regional Health Services, the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s longtime private partner in providing medical care and hospital services, is offering the university system a chance to buy out its share of the Nebraska Medicine partnership for $500 million, both groups announced Friday.
The NU Board of Regents is set to consider the transaction in a discussion and vote planned Jan. 9 that appears to have already secured significant political support, including from Gov. Jim Pillen, a former NU regent. He said the change, if approved, would help keep the hospital in Nebraska hands.
“I strongly support this transaction, because it will directly benefit the citizens of our great state by bringing them better health care and by further strengthening the University of Nebraska system,” Pillen said in a statement.
University officials said it was not yet clear how much of the $500 million would be privately funded and how much would be sought from state taxpayers as part of a budget process that NU acknowledges comes at a time when the purse strings are already tight from a projected revenue shortfall, and campuses have already faced budget cuts.
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, president of the NU system and a former UNMC chancellor, said patients would see no changes in the care or cost of medical care they receive in a Nebraska Medicine clinic or to the group’s health care workforce support structure that stretches “border to border.”
The key difference would be Nebraska Medicine’s governance structure shifting from two owners to one, he said. Many Nebraskans already assume UNMC runs the Med Center and don’t know that Nebraska Medicine’s clinics have involved Clarkson as a private partner since 1997, or that the east Omaha hospital has since the 1950s.
Gold said UNMC and the NU system would benefit from joining top fellow academic medical centers at the University of Iowa, the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, which oversee the clinical and hospital side of respective medical nonprofits, in addition to the medical training and teaching. 
The new-look Nebraska Medicine would still be governed by the Nebraska Medicine board, not the NU Board of Regents, Gold explained. That group has a duty to make sure the hospital is providing quality care to patients.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“What does the average consumer really care about this?” Gold asked, repeating a reporter’s question. “The answer really is what I would characterize as stability, to make us, from a governance perspective, look a lot more like our peers.”
Part of the transaction is also valuable for helping UNMC consolidate Clarkson properties around the Med Center campus, where growth and construction cranes are as common as ambulance arrivals. And Clarkson, which helped the university build the core hospital building at 42nd and Dewey Streets, has pledged a $200 million gift to help replace it.
Today, the buildings around UNMC that house doctors’ offices and the Clarkson Tower at Nebraska Medical Center are owned by Clarkson and made available for use by Nebraska Medicine at drastically reduced leases or for no lease at all.
Gold says renters occupy much of those Clarkson properties, and he expects the combination of revenues from that real estate, debt service and some public dollars to be used to cover and recoup the $500 million, though funders are still sorting out the mix. He said none of the public project funding would pull from the budgets of other NU campuses. 
Considering the quality of health care offered at Nebraska Medicine, Gold said he could see a scenario in which some of the revenue streams provided by Nebraska Medicine could help keep NU tuition more affordable than it might be otherwise.
Clarkson, for its part, appears poised to transition from its longtime focus on providing health care to using funds from the sale to grow a private foundation focused on grants aimed at making Nebraska the healthiest state and improving how health care is delivered here.
“Clarkson’s partnership with the university to establish and grow Nebraska Medicine has been a successful one, and we are proud of the advancements we have made together in serving our community,” said Jim Landen, chairman of the Clarkson board. 
Dr. Bill Lydiatt, CEO of Clarkson and a head-and-neck surgical oncologist, said he is excited to give to its longtime partners at NU and “provide them with the best path toward continuing the important work of Nebraska Medicine, including serving as one of the finest teaching hospitals.”
Gold understands he and NU will face financial skeptics on and off campus by seeking a $500 million project at a time of slimmer budgets, but he said the other options for UNMC clinical partners would have involved private partners from out of state, including some he called “far less attractive.”
His goal, if the regents agree, is to close the transaction within a six-month window and keep building. 
“This is as much to protect this critical asset as a Nebraska public asset as it is anything else,” Gold said.

Sarah Andrews is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
WATERBURY — For 48 years, George Woodard woke up before dawn and milked his cows. His day would end the same way, in his barn with the herd. 
For many of those years, Woodard’s 200-acre farm was booming. Now, the milking stalls in his barn sit empty, only occasionally visited by Woodard and his tabbycat, Jack. 
“It was a time which was precious. And it’s gone,” Woodard said.
Waterbury was once a dairy town. It’s home to Ben & Jerry’s Factory Store, a magnet for tourists seeking socially-responsible, locally-sourced ice cream.
But if they want to see a working dairy farm, they’ll have to go elsewhere. Rising costs of production and competition from ever-growing commercial dairies have driven out Waterbury’s dairy farms.
Until recently, Waterbury was home to three commercial dairy farms: the Wallaces’, the Davises’, and the Woodards’. Today, there are none.

Ten years ago, a fire destroyed Rosina Wallace’s dairy barn, killing her entire herd of 23 cows. After that, it was too expensive to start over. 
“The dairy industry does not want small farmers,” Wallace said. “Financially, it was just impossible for me to get back into it.”
In 1943, Mark Davis’ grandparents bought nearly 200 acres of grazing land to start their farm. 
Davis started milking when he was 14. Later, his wife, Maureen, and their children all took part in managing the herd of more than 40 cows – it’s not a job that can be done alone. 
Davis stopped milking about two years ago, after years of losing money.
“It was a great job, a great way to grow up, a great way to raise our kids. But it’s a very hard way to make a living,” Davis said. “It’s bad for a while, and then it gets worse.”
Woodard’s grandfather bought their Loomis Hill farm in 1912. He used the land for logging and sugaring. 
In 1973, Woodard graduated from Vermont Technical College and returned to Loomis Hill. He started by buying 10 heifer calves. Then, he bought 10 more. By December of 1975, the Woodards started shipping milk.
Across town, Wallace’s great-grandfather bought their Blush Hill Road farmland in 1866. For many years, it was mainly operating as a maple farm and fruit orchard. Wallace’s father decided to transition the farm to dairy after he finished college.
As Wallace’s father got older, he asked her to take over the farm. Wallace couldn’t wait. 
“I grew up helping on the farm all the time. It just never occurred to me that I could be the farmer,” Wallace said. “I gladly came back to the farm and worked with my dad to learn everything.” 
In the 2000s, the price that large milk buyers offered small farms plummeted. They reduced the amount of milk purchased from small dairies. 
Woodard and Wallace, like many other small dairies, started producing organic milk. The buyers were willing to pay more, and demand was higher.
The costs were higher, too. Organic feed was expensive, and the demands of keeping the herd healthy were high. 
“The last 10 years that I farmed, I was organic,” Wallace said. “I thought being organic would help me to be able to stay healthier financially, but then the price of the grain more than doubled.”
Davis didn’t go organic, but expenses still soared. The price farmers received for their milk just couldn’t keep up with the rising costs of feed, maintenance, labor, and processing.  
“My dad had a saying about it. The milk price goes in cycles; it’s bad for a while, and then it gets worse,” Wallace said. 
Dairy death spiral
Those rising costs led to a loss of the support businesses that dairy farms depend upon – a sort of dairy death spiral.
Throughout the 20th century, Waterbury had an agricultural economy. There were two creameries in town, and a large animal veterinarian.
Over time, as small dairies started to close, so did those supporting agricultural services. Emergency veterinarians became harder to find, coming from Waitsfield or Warren. When Waterbury’s creameries closed, shipping milk became more costly. 
As processing shifted to larger plants, milk had to move larger distances, putting small dairies at a disadvantage, said Silene DeCiucies. She’s with the Center for an Agricultural Economy, a nonprofit that advocates for local farmers.
“The economy of scale is very real in dairy, and there’s nothing going against it currently in Vermont,” DeCiucies said.
The story of dairy in Waterbury mirrors the trends in Vermont as a whole. Over the last decade, the number of dairy farms in Vermont has fallen from more than 900 to fewer than 500 today.
As Vermont loses dairy farms, the remaining ones are becoming larger. Graph via Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets.
Meanwhile, the size of those remaining farms has increased. Only 2% were considered large farms a decade ago; now, 9% have herds of 700 or more cows.
These changing economic factors slowly pushed Davis, Woodard and Wallace out of milking. Davis says 2014 was the last year his farm turned a profit. 
“I should have stopped 20 years earlier than I did, because, you know, we were feeding a lot of money that was made in the past back into it, just to keep things going,” Davis said.

In 2021, Woodard stopped milking. Davis followed two years later. Now, both farmers run small beef operations. Beef requires less labor, and the costs of production are lower and more stable. 
Woodard now has 10 cattle, Davis has 26. Instead of going to the barn every 12 hours to milk, the farmers spend their time managing the pasture and feed. It’s a much easier way to farm. 
Dairy farming is hard work, and after almost 50 years, Davis welcomes the change of pace.
“I’ve spent my whole lifetime looking for an off switch on a cow, and I’ve never found one,” Davis said.
After the fire destroyed Wallace’s barn and she lost her herd, dairy farming was no longer an option. 
“I really miss it. And if I’d had my choice, I’d still be dairy farming.” Wallace said. “The good thing is I never would have been smart enough to stop when I should have.”
Wallace doesn’t plan to make the transition to raising beef. For her, sending her animals to be processed for beef is too emotionally difficult. 
“For me, the hardest part of dairy farming was determining when I had to pronounce a death sentence for an animal,” Wallace said.
She now takes care of two alpacas, whose wool she processes for textiles. Her farm also is home to her two beloved steers, Ferdinand and Gad.
But that farm no longer turns a profit. Wallace now works at the Cabot Creamery Store, another tourist-focused dairy attraction down the road from Ben & Jerry’s. 
“It’s what I really, really, really like doing, but as long as I have my animals and I’m not making enough money off my animals to keep going, I keep my day job,” Wallace said.
Can small dairy farms survive?
Waterbury’s experience begs the question — Is it possible for any small dairy farm to survive in today’s Vermont?
Laura Ginsburg, an expert at the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food, and Markets, thinks so.
“People sometimes get stuck at looking at what’s worked in the past, that it should work into the future. But we’re in a very different place today than we were even five years ago,” Ginsburg said.
There is a stable market for organic dairy, and she said innovations can cut costs. 
“I do think there is opportunity, it’s just going to look different than it’s looked in the past,” said Ginsburg.
Young farmers are struggling to start their own dairies. Land costs are just too high. 
“You can only get so much manure in a 5-gallon bucket. And when the 5-gallon bucket is full, there’s no room left for anything else,” Woodard said.
“The same thing has happened with land. You can’t buy a farm anymore,” Woodard said
Today, dairy farming is gone in Waterbury, and it doesn’t seem likely to return. Wallace recognizes that large dairy farms are likely to continue to outcompete smaller ones. 
“Some things change, but some things stay the same, and the whole idea of getting bigger in order to survive probably isn’t going to go away,” Wallace said.
High land prices offer an easy way for struggling farmers to exit the business. But even though they are done with dairy, Wallace, Woodard, and Davis plan to continue farming on their land as long as they are able.
“You’re sitting on a gold mine, but the only way you can, you know, retrieve the gold is to get off the gold mine,” Davis said.
Woodard doesn’t know what the next century will bring to his farm. He says it’s unlikely his kids will want to farm.
But running one of the last dairy farms in Waterbury was a good life, he said — one he would not trade.
“If you’ve got a farm, OK, you’re not going to be making a whole crap load of money, but at the end of 50 years, you still have that place, and you’ve made a living on that place,” Woodard said. 
Wallace has no children, so her niece will take over the fifth-generation farm someday. She hopes her niece will continue to run it as a farm.
“Brown cows and green grass is a beautiful sight,” Wallace said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ludlow police chief ID’d as shooter of man allegedly armed with knife in New Year’s Day incident.","Ludlow Police Chief Jeffrey Warfle shot and injured a man on New Year’s Day after the man allegedly pulled a knife at a downtown hotel where he had been living, according to Vermont State Police. 
The wounded man, Jaime Gomez, 18, was taken to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, where he was continuing to receive care, Vermont State Police said in a press release Friday.

State police, who are heading up the investigation, had reported Thursday that Gomez was in stable condition. He is facing two felony charges, state police said.
Police had released few details about the Thursday morning shooting prior to issuing the press release late Friday afternoon that provided more information. According to the release, at about 6 a.m. Thursday, local police received a call reporting a disturbance at the Fox Run Inn on Main Street. 
Warfle responded to the scene and encountered Gomez who, according to the release, was reported “to be agitated and destroying property” there.
“Video of the encounter shows the chief spoke with Gomez and attempted to de-escalate the situation,” the release stated, adding that as Warfle spoke to a witness, Gomez approached them and refused to follow Warfle’s commands.
Gomez, the release stated, then “pulled an item from his pocket and lunged at the chief. At that point Chief Warfle fired his service weapon, striking Gomez, who then dropped a knife.”
The release did not specify how many shots Warfle fired or where Gomez was struck.
After the shooting, Warfle called for medical assistance for Gomez and for additional first responders to come to the scene, the release stated.
The state police have obtained an arrest warrant for Gomez on one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and another of attempted aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to the release. It’s unclear who the victim was in connection with each charge.
State police referred questions about Warfle’s employment status to the Ludlow Police Department. A person who answered a call to the police department Friday afternoon said Warfle was on leave and would not be back for a few days. 
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office and a county state’s attorney’s office will conduct separate use-of-force reviews into the shooting to determine if the police chief’s actions were legally justified.
The last police-involved shooting in Ludlow took place in August 2022, when Ludlow Police Officer Zachary Paul fatally shot 35-year-old Michael Mills, of Cavendish, following a car chase. Mills was reportedly dealing with a mental health crisis and had made many calls to police that night before the pursuit. Reviews by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the Orange County State’s Attorney’s Office found that Paul’s use of force was “objectively reasonable and justified.”
Paul, who was 21 at the time, had recently joined the Ludlow Police Department after graduating from the Vermont Police Academy. At the time of the shooting, Warfle was in the cruiser with Paul and was his field training officer. Warfle did not fire his gun during the incident. 
Warfle, who was appointed Ludlow’s police chief last year, had previously worked as a Rutland City police officer. In that position, he was the subject of a Brady letter in February 2019. The letters are filed by prosecutors when an officer’s credibility is called into question and can often mean the end of an officer’s career. 
Then-Rutland County State’s Attorney Rose Kennedy drafted the letter. She said the letter stemmed from Warfle issuing a citation to a person on a charge of disorderly conduct, but following a complaint Warfle admitted that the person’s conduct did not rise to the level of a charge. 
According to the state police press release Friday, Warfle has been cooperating with investigators but had yet to be interviewed.

(Photo via Getty Images)Drivers using their phones outside of hands-free or voice-activated modes now face a $100 fine as Iowa’s 2025 distracted driving law goes into full effect.
The measure, signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in April 2025, expanded Iowa’s previous ban on texting while driving to ban all handheld use of personal electronic devices while driving. Iowa is the 31st state to enact a “hands free” law.
Although the law took effect July 1, law enforcement officers were only able issue warnings throughout 2025. But as of Jan. 1, 2026, drivers are now subject to fines for breaking the law. The baseline fine is $100 for using a phone while texting, increasing to $500 in cases if the incident results in an injury, and to $1,000 in incidents that cause a death.
In a December recording of “Iowa Press,” Larry Grant, state safety planner for the Iowa Department of Transportation, said in 2025, Iowa saw a major reduction in traffic fatalities in comparison to previous years. According to DOT data, there were 260 traffic deaths in 2025 — a total of 97 fewer deaths than in 2024 and a nearly a century low. Public officials say the hands-free law, as well as other factors like people complying with other safety laws by wearing seatbelts or obeying speed limits, have contributed to the state seeing fewer deadly traffic incidents in the past year.

“Now granted, one fatality is too many, and everybody needs to realize that — but we’re we’re down 77 fatalities on average right now,” Grant said at the Dec. 12 recording. “And if you go back for our high in the last five years, we’re down over 100 fatalities. That’s 100 lives that are still here. So that’s just huge when we look at that.”
Other states that have passed similar “hands-free” measures, including Iowa’s neighbors Minnesota and Illinois, have also seen reductions in car crashes and traffic deaths since enacting these restrictions.
Part of the reason fines did not start until 2026 was in an effort to give time for drivers to learn about the new law. Sgt. Alex Dinkla, an Iowa State Patrol spokesperson and Brett Tjepkes, chief of the Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau, said in December the state and law enforcement officers have made a major push to inform people about the new “hands-free” law through educational materials and distributing pamphlets at rest areas and driver’s licensing stations.
Dinkla said in his experience, most people “probably are aware” of the new law, but that he has still encountered some drivers who do not know about the change.
Many newer cars — and a majority of smartphones — are able to enter hands-free mode to ensure compliance with the law, Dinkla said.
“Something that we had to kind of work through, I think with the public and messaging, is that you don’t have to have a new vehicle with all of the technology involved in it,” he said. “Almost every phone that’s out there will make a hands-free call. You can ask Siri, you can ask Alexa, and or even just a one touch which the law allows for, but it can’t be in your hand.”
The law was signed in 2025 after several years of stalling in the legislative process, despite having strong support from law enforcement and safety advocates as well as from families of victims who died in distracted driving incidents.
“It wasn’t one person that did this,” Dinkla said. “It wasn’t one department that did this. This was a collective effort amongst many folks. You heard stories of people that were involved in texting and driving. They championed trying to get that across the finish line. The Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau, many other city, county supporters with that. So it was definitely a collective effort.”

Melinda S. Spencer, 35, was also charged with abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence, according to police. It’s unclear how far along her pregnancy was. Kentucky has very few and only narrow exceptions to its abortion ban. 
According to a KSP news release, a medical clinic in Campton contacted state police on Dec. 31 around 2:30 p.m. and reported that “there was a lady in the clinic (who) disclosed that she had aborted her pregnancy at her residence.” 
After police arrived at United Clinic, they said, the woman “stated to detectives that she had ordered medication online to complete an abortion” and “took the medication which resulted in the death of a developed male infant.” 
After that, police said, she “buried the infant on the backside of her property in a shallow grave.” Police say they went to the residence property and “located the infant in a shallow grave.” 
The case is still under investigation. 
Kentucky state law defines first degree fetal homicide as causing  “the death of an unborn child” except when a person “acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.” The crime  is considered a capital offense in Kentucky. 
The woman’s other charges — abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence are Class D felonies. 
Kentucky state law describes abuse of a corpse as treatment “that would outrage ordinary family sensibilities” and includes burial without proper preparation.

The legislation (SB 1032) by Sen. Alexis Calatayud, R-Miami, also would allow doctors to significantly increase the supply limits that qualified doctors can prescribe to patients. The bill would allow doctors to issue certifications for up to 10 70-day supply limits of smokeable medical marijuana, rather than three. Doctors could also issue up to 20 35-day supply limits instead of the existing six.
The proposal would waive the $75 registration and annual renewal fees to receive a medical marijuana ID card for any military veteran honorably discharged from the U.S. armed forces.
A similar measure (HB 719) was filed in the House last month by Rep. Bill Partington, R-Ormond Beach. His bill would go further by requiring the Florida Department of Health to establish reciprocity agreements allowing patients from other states to qualify for a registration card “within 1 business day.”
Partington’s bill also would allow doctors to recommend medical cannabis via telehealth visits for initial consultations. Existing Florida law allows telehealth visits only when patients have their cards renewed.
There are 929,655 medical marijuana patients in Florida, according to the Office of Medical Marijuana Use. To remain in the program, each patient must renew his or her ID card with the state every 12 months at $75 per clip. They must renew certification by their doctors every 210 days, or approximately seven months from the date the physician certifies. Those fees vary by clinic and location across the state, generally ranging between $100 to $200.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/medical-marijuana-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

That number pales in comparison to the $40 million Republican Byron Donalds’ gubernatorial campaign announced last month.
Jolly is a former Pinellas County Republican U.S. representative who announced his candidacy in early June, and for much of 2025 was the only high-profile Democrat in the race to succeed Ron DeSantis in November 2026.
Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings entered the Democratic race in November. His campaign has yet to announce any fundraising amounts (and did not respond to a request for comment).
“David Jolly is running a campaign focused on listening, not lecturing,” said Campaign Chair Mitchell Berger in a press release. “This fundraising report reflects more than financial strength. It reflects a movement bringing together Democrats, Independents, and Republicans who want solutions, not division.”
The other major Republican candidates for governor are former House Speaker Paul Renner and investment firm CEO James Fishback.
Fundraising reports for Florida political candidates and political committees for the fourth quarter of 2025 are due on Monday, Jan. 12.
There haven’t been many public-opinion polls looking at the 2026 gubernatorial race in Florida, but a University of North Florida Public Opinion Research Lab survey released in late October showed Donalds leading Jolly by 11 percentage points and Demings by 12 points.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

The Delaware City Refining Company has appealed a recent state order requiring the rapid installation of real-time fenceline air-monitoring sensors, arguing that the mandate’s 70-day timeline is technically infeasible and risks producing unreliable data rather than meaningful public protection.
On Friday, Dec. 12, 2025, Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Gregory Patterson issued an order directing the refinery to install and operate real-time sensors around the facility to monitor volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, following a butane release in late November that was later determined to have lasted significantly longer than initially reported.
In a statement released this week, the refinery said its engineers evaluated available monitoring technologies and concluded that installing a system capable of reliably meeting DNREC’s specifications within the required timeframe is not feasible. Company officials said they have notified DNREC of those findings and are seeking to amend the order to allow adequate time to select appropriate technology, identify suitable monitoring locations, and establish a realistic installation schedule.
The refinery said it is working cooperatively with DNREC and has formally appealed the order to allow for a compliance plan that balances transparency with technical accuracy.
State’s Rationale for the Order
DNREC issued the expedited order after a release of butane and related VOCs that the refinery initially reported as lasting less than two hours but later acknowledged continued for approximately 19 hours, from Nov. 26 into Nov. 27. While the Delaware Division of Public Health concluded the release posed no immediate or long-term health threat, DNREC said the delayed detection left regulators and the public without real-time information during the incident.
Under the order, the refinery would be required to install fenceline sensors capable of triggering automatic alerts to DNREC and the public when VOC levels exceed set thresholds and to take immediate corrective action if an exceedance is detected. DNREC has noted that PBF Energy, the refinery’s parent company, operates similar systems at facilities in California.
A Broader Debate Over Regulation and Reliability
Supporters of the order say fenceline monitoring would improve transparency and community trust. Critics counter that while such systems can be useful tools, they have limitations: sensors detect only certain pollutants, can generate false positive readings, yet miss releases depending on wind direction, and require careful calibration to avoid false readings.
From a regulatory perspective, refinery officials argue that rushing installation could undermine confidence in the data and distract from the more fundamental goal of improving internal detection and operational awareness.
Economic Stakes for Delaware
The Delaware City Refinery has operated since 1956 and remains a major industrial employer and taxpayer in the region, supporting hundreds of direct jobs and additional work for contractors, trades, and transportation services. At the same time, it has been the focus of repeated environmental enforcement actions and community concern over emissions.
Industry observers warn that overly aggressive or inflexible regulatory timelines can carry unintended consequences. California, often cited as a model for strict environmental policy, has seen 72% of its refineries close in recent years, including two major refineries this month.  This contributes to higher fuel prices, job losses, and increased reliance on imported fuel.
What Comes Next
The Environmental Appeals Board will review the refinery’s appeal while discussions with DNREC continue. Refinery officials say they remain committed to complying with an amended order that achieves the state’s transparency goals without sacrificing technical integrity.
For DNREC, the case is part of a broader enforcement and rulemaking effort, including proposed regulations expected in 2026 that could expand fenceline monitoring requirements statewide.
The outcome of the appeal may set an important precedent for how Delaware balances environmental accountability with economic stability and practical implementation.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dcrc_-_fenceline-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

Colin Hackley)A divided Florida Supreme Court ruling this week on assisted reproduction methods raises the prospect of children having three parents — or at least raises a new complication for couples seeking to have kids with outside help.
By a narrow 4-2 margin, the state’s high court on Wednesday concluded that under Florida statute a sperm donor did not automatically relinquish his parental rights because the artificial insemination was done at home instead of at a fertility clinic.
A majority of justices agreed to overturn two lower court decisions that had previously found that Angel Rivera had given up his parental rights when he agreed to provide his sperm to Ashley Brito and Jennifer Salas. 
Brito used an at-home artificial insemination kit. According to court documents, Brito and Salas got married after confirming the pregnancy and began raising the child together. However, they separated a little more than a year later. Soon afterward, Rivera filed a petition seeking recognition as the child’s legal father.
The majority justices stressed that they were not concluding that Rivera is entitled to parental rights. Rather, the opinion focused on whether the governing state law, passed in 1993 and amended in 2020, applies to people who artificially inseminate outside a clinic setting.
Justice Jaime Grosshans, writing for the majority, said the law did not apply to Rivera.
“Taken together, it is clear that this section of newly enacted statutes, as well as the one amended statute, focused almost exclusively on providing a legal framework for gestational surrogacy issues and laboratory-based reproductive procedures — i.e. ART, [assistive reproductive technology],” Grosshans wrote.
Joining Grosshans in the decision were outgoing Justice Charles Canady as well as Justice Jorge Labarga and Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz.
Justice John Couriel, who wrote a dissenting opinion that Justices Meredith Sasso and Renatha Francis concurred with, said the majority “gets that job wrong” and that it was clear that Rivera was clearly a donor whose actions were covered by the law.
And Couriel argued that the court’s decision opens the door to circumstances not authorized by the Legislature.
“But now, the majority authorizes Rivera to become parent number three,” Couriel wrote. “This might be good or bad policy by the Court’s lights, but it is not our law.”
Couriel added, “The Court seems bashful about the full import of its reasoning, stopping one step short of what it knows will be an odd result indeed under Florida law: declaring Rivera a child’s third legal parent. And that is understandable. Whatever hoops Rivera and other donors in his position will have to jump through, so too will people who have relied on their donations as they await the courts’ sorting out of claims that the statute on its face resolves.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Florida-Supreme-Court-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

Gov. Phil Scott has appointed two new lawmakers to fill vacancies in the Vermont Legislature days before the start of the session next week. 
John Benson, a managing partner at the engineering firm DuBois & King who currently serves as chair of the Brookfield Selectboard, will fill the vacant Orange County Senate seat left by Republican Larry Hart.  
Val Taylor will replace Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, whose Rutland-11 district includes Killington, Chittenden, Mendon and Pittsfield. Harrison decided to step down amid a move to New Hampshire. Taylor previously served as chair of the Mendon Selectboard. 
Both Benson and Taylor are Republicans, according to Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott.
Customarily, the governor chooses a legislative replacement who belongs to the same political party as the resigning lawmaker, picking from a list of candidates submitted by the relevant local political party.
All Vermont legislators are up for reelection this November. In an email, Taylor said she planned to run for the House seat she’s filling. 
She replaces Harrison, who, after almost a decade in office, had risen to vice chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. 
In an email, Taylor said she was excited to work in the Legislature to ensure tax dollars are “well spent.”
In Orange County, Hart stepped down in October, citing the toll the position had taken on his physical and mental health. He was in his first year in the role.  
Benson, Hart’s replacement, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. 
In a statement, Scott praised Benson’s career serving his local community.
“His career as a civil engineer, decades as a volunteer firefighter, and now on the Selectboard, demonstrate his commitment to working together to solve problems, which will be an important perspective to have in the Senate,” Scott said.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Louisiana’s existing six congressional districts will be used for the 2026 midterm election after the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule in a case challenging their boundaries by the end of 2025. 
State lawmakers convened for a special session in October to push back election deadlines one month, with Republicans hoping justices would issue a ruling before the year. Had they made a decision on that timeline, the legislature was expected to hold another special session to redraw the districts, possibly eliminating one or both of Louisiana’s majority-Black seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Instead, the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a ruling during its usual late-spring release period. 
State Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, who co-sponsored legislation to change the 2026 election calendar to allow for a new round of redistricting, said in an interview Friday there were no plans to hold another special session or deviate from the existing map. 
Lawmakers can’t create new maps after the Supreme Court’s ruling in the spring because Louisiana is switching to a closed party primary system this year. The switch moved up the qualifying period for candidates from July to February, which created a limited window for redistricting if the decision was issued in late 2025.
The case in question, Louisiana v. Callais, challenges the legality of a second majority-Black U.S. House district Republicans state lawmakers drew in 2024 in response to a federal court finding a 2022 version of the state’s congressional maps was unconstitutional. Louisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, but just one favored a Black candidate before the redistricting process in a state where nearly a third of the population is Black.
The case has since been shaped into a test of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal law that prohibits racial discrimination in elections. Section 2 prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. State Attorney General Liz Murrill, who originally defended the 2024 version of the map, now argues race-conscious redistricting under Section 2 is no longer necessary to ensure fair racial representation and now violates the 14th and 15th amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
The Callais case is also notable because justices were originally supposed to rule on the case in spring 2025. But in a rare move, they punted their decision to their next term and called for a second round of oral arguments that were held in October.  The fact that the case had been argued twice gave GOP lawmakers hope a ruling would come earlier than usual. 
Critics of the special session argued Republican legislative leaders would not have authorized the expense of a special session, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in per diem and extra staff time, without the assurance a ruling was coming. 
Kleinpeter and Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, denied this during the session. 
Beaullieu testified during a committee hearing there was no official forecast for when the decision would be issued. He also acknowledged to a reporter the election calendar changes he backed would become pointless if the Supreme Court doesn’t rule in time. 
Qualifying for closed party primaries in the congressional races, scheduled for May 16, will take place Feb. 11-13. Any party runoffs that are needed will be held June 27, and the general election is set for Nov. 3.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bernie Sanders swears in Zohran Mamdani as New York City mayor.","Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders swore in Zohran Mamdani, the new Democratic mayor of New York City, during Mamdani’s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2026 (CBS New York).
Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders swore in Zohran Mamdani, the new Democratic mayor of New York City, during Mamdani’s inauguration on Thursday.
Mamdani was officially sworn in at midnight New Year’s Day by New York Attorney General Letitia James. But for his public inauguration ceremony later that day, the mayor chose Sanders to administer his oath of office a second time in a ceremonial capacity.
“You showed the world the most important lesson that can be learned today — and that is that when working people stand together, when we don’t let them divide us up, there is nothing we cannot accomplish,” Sanders told Mamdani in a speech before the swearing-in, in front of tens of thousands of people gathered outside New York City Hall.
Both Sanders and Mamdani are self-described Democratic socialists and are at the forefront of national progressive politics. New York’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another progressive leader, also spoke at the event. Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn, had endorsed Mamdani’s bid for mayor and campaigned with him last year.
Mamdani has called Sanders “the single most influential political figure in my life.” Sanders told VTDigger last fall that Mamdani’s campaign studied the senator’s 1981 run for Burlington mayor, when Sanders upset a more moderate opponent who’d held elected office for years.
In November’s mayoral election, Mamdani bested former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was running as an independent after Mamdani defeated him and a field of other opponents in a shock victory in the summertime Democratic primary.


In his speech before swearing in Mamdani, Sanders described the mayor’s signature campaign proposals as “not radical,” even as the mayor’s opponents have assailed them as such. Mamdani has called for raising taxes on New York City’s wealthiest residents to fund universal child care and city buses that are faster and fare-free. He also wants to freeze rent increases for millions of tenants in rent-stabilized housing.  
Sanders said Mamdani’s campaign had a seismic impact on national politics “in a moment when people in America, and in fact, throughout the world, are losing faith in democracy.”
“Thank you for inspiring our nation,” he said. “Thank you for giving us, from coast to coast, the hope and the vision that we can create government that works for all — not just the wealthy and the few.
According to the New York Times, Mamdani’s supporters “defied freezing temperatures” and “a fresh coating of snow” to witness the mayor’s inauguration. While Sanders was bundled in a large green coat for the ceremony, he skipped the mittens — sewn by Essex Junction resident Jen Ellis — that he went viral for wearing to former President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021.

Once the fastest-growing provider of addiction services in Kentucky, ARC has foundered over the past 16 months amid reports of an ongoing FBI investigation into possible health care fraud and closer scrutiny by insurers who process claims for patient care and had begun slashing reimbursement.
Over the past year, ARC has closed multiple facilities and programs and laid off several hundred employees. At its peak in 2024, ARC had about 1,800 residential treatment beds, programs throughout Kentucky and about 1,350 employees.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/240627ARC_09MM-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 15:56:44.372856

More than $100,000 was returned to Montanans in 2025, a press release said. Montana is one of six states that provides restitution assistance to victims of investment fraud. 
“When fraudsters and bad actors harm Montanans, we aggressively investigate them, we fully prosecute them, and we ensure they take a one-way trip to Deer Lodge,” Brown said in a press release. “The most rewarding parts of my job as State Auditor is locking up bad actors and helping Montanans rebuild their lives. There is no better time to do that than this holiday season.”
No general fund money is used in the restitution. Instead, CSI collects money from firms doing investment business in Montana into the Securities Restitution Assistance Fund, a press release said. That fund also includes money collected from those who have violated Montana’s security laws.
State law limits the amount of money victims can receive from that fund and there’s additional restrictions if the fund is “depleted below” $1 million. When laws around victim restitution for securities-related fraud were passed, they were capped at $25,000. 
In 2015 through House Bill 57, restitution was increased to $50,000 for fraud against a victim who is a senior citizen or any other person defined in state law as a “vulnerable person.” That 2015 legislation was run by then-Rep. Moffie Funk, a Helena Democrat, at the request of former state auditor Monica Lindeen.

Their release stated that “currently, a growing number of both Republican and Democratic-led states are stepping up to reform SNAP.”
Some may think the government shouldn’t pay for sugary drinks. I understand that initial reaction. But let’s dig a little deeper.
Elon Musk has received over $38 billion in contracts, subsidies, tax credits and loans from the U.S. government — our tax dollars. Emphasis on subsidies and tax credits.
From 1995 to 2024, South Dakota ranked eighth in the nation for reliance on farm subsidies. Of the $25 billion that came to South Dakota, former Gov. Kristi Noem’s family collected $4.9 million.
Two SD lawmakers join push to ban soda and candy purchases from food assistance program

Meanwhile, some legislators say a single mom of three working two jobs and receiving $109 a month in SNAP benefits shouldn’t be able to buy a diet Coke.
And yes, of course we might wish her cart was filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. But let’s be honest — I hope you’re not judging my shopping list today, either.
What also stood out to me was the claim that “many states are reforming SNAP,” with no detail about how. For example, Michigan’s “Double Up” program allows government food benefits to double in value when healthier choices are made. Studies show that bans will only increase administrative costs and create more stigma around poverty while not making any behavioral changes.
Restricting items doesn’t help families. The path to meaningful assistance is through incentives and support, not punishment. I shared Michigan’s program with Davis, who is my state senator. Perhaps the political optics mattered more than what would actually help her constituents.
This type of legislation helps no one. It adds stigma. It won’t reduce poverty, it won’t improve educational outcomes, and it won’t improve health, because the people being targeted still won’t be able to afford health insurance. But that 99-cent soda? That’s what we’re controlling.
Considering both Davis and Rehfeldt are health care providers and moms, what about legislation to expand free and reduced school lunch, lower health care costs or make women’s health more accessible for rural communities?
We’re angry at the wrong people.
We’re restricting the wrong things.
We’re catering to the wrong individuals.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-02 20:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"How Mississippi could meet the needs of more than 19,000 families waiting for child care vouchers",Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/02/mississippi-child-care-vouchers/,The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children.,"When she is not caring for her 6-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son, Amaya Jones is working full time at Kroger. Jones wants to go back to school in January to study social work, so she can help young women like herself navigate complicated programs designed to help – but which often trap – poor people. 
“I know what it’s like to be homeless, to apply for (food stamps) and be denied even though you need it, to be looked at as just a number – I know how it all feels,” Jones said. “I want to help mothers and kids and young women.”
Returning to school will only be possible if Jones regains vouchers she lost in June that made child care affordable, she said. 
Jones’ family is one of more than 19,000 Mississippi families who lost access to child care vouchers and is now on a growing waitlist after pandemic-era funding that boosted the program dried up, according to the Mississippi Department of Human Services. 
The extra funding didn’t expand eligibility. The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children. The additional pandemic funds allowed the program to reach more eligible families – who are now on the hook for hundreds of dollars each month. While thousands of families sit on a waitlist for the voucher, some child care providers are eating the cost and risk closure. 
Mississippi receives nearly $90 million a year from a federal block grant called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. States are allowed to transfer up to 30% of those funds to a separate federal grant, the Child Care and Development Fund, that supports Mississippi’s child care voucher program. In recent years, Mississippi has elected to make this maximum transfer. But states are not prohibited from using the remaining TANF funds on other child care expenses.
This has been the rub between state leaders and child care advocates lately: Advocates want the state to spend more – including some of its $156 million in stockpiled TANF funds – on the child care voucher. But the agency says that’s not doable.
Mark Jones, director of communications at the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the agency is pursuing other solutions for child care that will become clearer in 2026. 
“Plugging long-term holes with non-recurring funds is not feasible nor responsible,” Mark Jones said about feeding unspent TANF funds into the voucher program. 
Meanwhile, advocates have argued it’s not responsible to be sitting on millions of unspent TANF dollars. 
“Mississippi gets a new TANF grant, $86 million, every year,” said Carol Burnett, director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, which has been advocating on behalf of child care access for decades. “We rarely spend it all, which is how we ended up with a huge unspent balance in TANF. So, TANF is not one-time money because we get the grant every year and we don’t ever spend it all.”

Mississippi Today spoke to four national TANF experts who weighed in on the situation. They agreed  Mississippi can use more TANF dollars than it is already using toward child care subsidies. The issue can be complicated, but not as much as Mississippi is making it, said Elizabeth Lower-Basch, deputy director for policy for the Center for Law and Social Policy and a national TANF expert. 
“Mississippi is making this harder than it needs to be, I think, is the bottom line,” Lower-Basch said. 
While TANF funds are flexible and can be used on a wide range of services, the system is inherently labyrinthine. Part of that, experts say, is to safeguard against misuse – something Mississippi is well known for. 
“I’m guessing since Mississippi has gotten so much blowback for some of the ways it used TANF in the past, it’s gotten a little gun-shy,” said Lower-Basch.
While Mississippi may not be able to push more than 30% of its TANF funds through a transfer to the Child Care and Development Fund, experts say there are other ways to use TANF to supply more child care vouchers.
Other states have successfully conjoined funding streams so that extra TANF funds can be used on child care vouchers without technically being considered “transferred funds,” explained Stephanie Schmit, director of Child Care and Early Education at the Center for Law and Social Policy. It can sometimes be complicated. 
“States do ‘marry them’ in ways that work well in their state, but states use different mechanisms to make that happen. There’s often memorandums of understanding or contacts,” Schmit said. “… It’s not as straightforward as ‘direct dollars can be spent through the existing system – done.’ It’s layers, and it’s very much dependent on the state.”
The department is going a different route, Mark Jones said. The agency opened a request for proposals for work supports, or programs that help people in low-income jobs to remain employed. Proposals may include child care, along with 11 other areas – such as transportation and job search assistance – according to the department’s application. 
There’s no guarantee the state will select proposals that include child care – or that the eligibility would resolve the current waitlist. But if the winning proposals include child care, the subgrantee would supply child care for the program participants by paying the child care provider directly, Mark Jones explained. 
“In early 2026, once we announce the TANF subgrantees, we will have a clear picture of the future,” he said. 
The child care crisis
Experts have long-considered the state of U.S. child care a crisis. But that’s indicative of a deeper problem: the devaluing of caregiving and early education nationwide. The system doesn’t work for anyone involved, experts say. Parents can’t afford to buy into it, and child care employees can’t afford to work in it. 
The only solution would be to provide public dollars “in a very significant way,” explained Ruth Friedman, who previously directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Child Care during the Biden administration. Except for New Mexico, which recently made child care free for everyone, state and federal governments have been unwilling to make that type of investment, she said.
“Child care is expensive because it’s inherently labor-intensive,” Friedman explained. “Children need adult attention and interactions to be safe and to support their healthy development in child care. But child care programs know parents can’t afford the true cost of care, so the only way they can actually make any profit is to underpay their staff … which just exacerbates the supply problem.”
Friedman worries that H.R.1, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act that U.S. Congress passed in law in July, will worsen the crisis since it shifts hundreds of millions of dollars in health care and food aid costs to states, leaving less room in state budgets for child care. 
Mississippi is already seeing that play out. After the Legislature appropriated a historic $15 million toward child care last year to make a dent in the voucher waitlist, advocates hoped the welfare agency would request the same this year. 
Instead, the Mississippi Department of Human Services Director Bob Anderson asked the Legislature to put $15 million toward SNAP and made no mention of child care. Agency spokesperson Jones said the agency had to make “tough decisions” since about $140 million in food aid costs previously covered by the federal government are now shifting to Mississippi. 
Later, during a December meeting of the Senate Study Group on Women, Children and Families, Anderson said the department would need $60 million to address the child care voucher waitlist – but clarified that he was not asking the Legislature for that money. 
The federal changes to Medicaid and SNAP will also affect how low-income families and child care workers balance their budgets. In Mississippi, more than a third of child care workers rely on Medicaid or food aid to make ends meet. 
“Since the child care workforce relies heavily on Medicaid and SNAP because their jobs pay so little, OBBBA’s massive cuts to the Medicaid and SNAP programs is likely to cause child care workers to leave the profession,” Friedman said. “Of course families’ child care bills will get harder to pay as their own health insurance and food costs rise as a result of the new law.”
Meanwhile, the thousands of eligible families without vouchers are piecing together haphazard child care with family, or going into debt with their child care providers. 
Jones says she’s lucky her mother can care for her children most days, but she worries about the toll it’s taking on their grandmother, who has heart failure. 
“She’s in and out of the hospital, as well,” Jones said. “One day she can be doing fine, the next day she’s not feeling well. If my baby gets sick, I don’t want him to get her sick. It’s extremely scary trying to live this day by day.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09120132/3X0A6593.jpg,,,2026-01-02 15:12:32.883711

(Courtesy)Gov. Mike Braun and Attorney General Todd Rokita want a federal judge to lift a decades-old ban on the placement of a Ten Commandments monument at the Indiana Statehouse grounds.
A motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on Tuesday argues that the original legal standard used to block the monument has since been overturned by Supreme Court decisions and that existing law now allows historical displays with religious content.
The case has reemerged amid separate legislative and judicial battles over Ten Commandments displays in other states.
In contention now is an 11,500-pound limestone monument that was donated by the Indiana Limestone Institute in 1996. Then-Indiana Republican Rep. Brent Steele arranged for the donation and placement of the monument, which was intended to be installed near the site of the former Ten Commandments display on the Statehouse lawn, according to court filings.
The attorney general described the top portion of the monument as consisting of a 4-foot, 4-inch tall block of limestone that sits atop a larger rectangular base that is also made of limestone. The Ten Commandments are inscribed on one side of the block and the Bill of Rights are etched on the opposite side.
Smaller sides of the monument contain the preamble to the 1851 Indiana Constitution, as well as a dedication showing the monument was a gift from the limestone institute.
A yearslong battle
A similar Ten Commandments display donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles previously stood on the Statehouse lawn for more than three decades before it was vandalized and removed in 1991.
In 2000, then-Gov. Frank O’Bannon accepted the replacement monument, but the Indiana Civil Liberties Union sued, claiming the monument’s placement on state property would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction later in 2000, concluding that the state’s purpose for erecting the monument was religious, not secular, and that a “reasonable person would … regard it as an explicit endorsement of the Ten Commandments.”
Story continues below.
b977dfd6-2de2-4c1a-8493-8c474a352163
 
The preliminary injunction was later affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and has remained in effect ever since.
In their latest motion, however, Indiana officials contend the original injunction “rests upon legal principles that can no longer be sustained” because the Supreme Court has “discarded the Lemon test” — the 1971 standard that until 2022 guided Establishment Clause analysis.
Rokita additionally said in a news release that the Statehouse grounds “feature many monuments and markers celebrating Indiana’s and America’s heritage.” 
“This monument belongs among them as a reminder of core principles that have guided our nation,” he continued. “After all these years, it’s time to place this historical recognition where Hoosiers and visitors can appreciate its significance in our common story.”
In the same release, Braun added that the monument “reflects foundational texts that have shaped our Nation’s laws, liberties, and civic life for generations.”
“Restoring this historical monument,” the governor said, “is about honoring our heritage and who we are as Hoosiers.”
Rokita further argued in court filings that the state should be able to erect the monument because subsequent U.S. Supreme Court rulings evaluate religious displays based on historical practices rather than the old Lemon standard used. 
The Republican attorney general pointed to the 2005 Van Orden v. Perry case, for example, in which the high court justices allowed a Ten Commandments monument to remain on the Texas State Capitol grounds as part of a broader historical setting.
Opposition — and pending legislation
Civil liberties groups have long been opposed to such a display on state grounds, though. 
In similar disputes, courts across the country have blocked laws requiring Ten Commandments displays in public schools. A federal appeals court ruled in June that a Louisiana law requiring posters of the Ten Commandments in every classroom was unconstitutional under longstanding First Amendment precedent.
And in Texas, a federal judge’s November order forced several school districts to remove classroom posters of the Ten Commandments and concluded that a state law mandating such displays violated the Establishment Clause.
Still, the fight over religious texts in public spaces isn’t limited to the Statehouse lawn.
A new bill pending in the Indiana legislature, authored by Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, seeks to “require each school corporation to place a durable poster or framed picture representing the text of the Ten Commandments in each school library and classroom.”
Davis’ House Bill 1086 has been assigned to the House Education Committee, but it’s not clear whether it will receive a hearing. Similar legislative attempts in the Hoosier legislature have been unsuccessful.
If the federal judge grants Indiana’s motion, the monument could be placed near its originally intended location on the Statehouse grounds. The plaintiffs — which include the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Americans United for Separation of Church and State — have 14 days to file a response.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-02 19:44:15+00:00,CT Mirror,CT to get $154M through federal rural health grant for 2026,Lisa Hagen and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/02/ct-to-get-154m-through-federal-rural-health-grant-for-2026/,CT will receive federal assistance to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state ahead of anticipated cuts to Medicaid.,"Connecticut will receive about $154 million in its first tranche of federal assistance to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state ahead of anticipated changes and cuts to Medicaid.
The federal aid comes from the Rural Health Transformation Program, a $50 billion fund that will dole out money to all states over the next five years. The initiative was part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” amid concerns about how the bill’s Medicaid cuts would affect rural facilities.
Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said the award will enable the state “to keep working on long-standing priorities to improve health, prevent disease, and work to achieve our agency’s vision for a Connecticut where everyone is healthy, secure, and thriving.”
“This grant represents a tremendous opportunity to strengthen population health, health care access, workforce capacity, and system sustainability for residents in rural communities across our state,” Barton Reeves stated in emailed comments.
DSS is already hiring for three positions that will be responsible for implementing the Rural Health Transformation Program grant at the state level. 
Over the next five years, half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly divided among all 50 states. The other $25 billion will be based on the sole discretion of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and will take into account the rural makeup of states plus other factors, such as potential for impact.
Connecticut will receive the second-lowest award of all 50 states, just ahead of New Jersey and the smallest award in New England. But it’s possible it will receive more in future yearly allotments.
Every state is slated to get at least $100 million a year through 2030. But stakeholders in Connecticut acknowledged it will be difficult to receive much from the second pot of money at CMS’s discretion, especially since Connecticut is less geographically rural compared to others states.
In a statement this week, CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said “states are stepping forward with bold, creative plans to expand rural access, strengthen their workforces, modernize care and support the communities that keep our nation running. CMS is proud to partner with every state to turn their ideas into lasting improvements for rural families.”
Officials at the Connecticut Department of Social Services and the Office of Policy and Management took the lead on the grant application and worked with several other state agencies. They received input from rural hospitals, federally qualified health centers and others in the health care field.
Following the passage of the “big beautiful bill” over the summer, the rural grant application process was a quick turnaround that opened up in the fall and wrapped up with the awards announcement by the end of the year.
In November, the Department of Social Services requested roughly $938 million from the federal government for the effort. But the state is unlikely to get anywhere near that amount over the next five years of the federal program.
Still, those who helped craft Connecticut’s application for federal assistance are optimistic about the award as well as “working with the state to maximize these funds.”
“Specifically, we are grateful that the state included many of our suggestions in its plan, such as incentives for the recruitment of providers, the development of a rural residency program and funding for technology infrastructure that will improve access to telehealth and remote patient monitoring,” according to a statement from Joanne Borduas, CEO of the Community Health and Wellness Center, which has health centers located in Torrington, North Canaan and Winsted.
“These are all critical to ensuring that our patients in the rural northwest corner of the state can continue to receive the high quality health care they need and deserve.”
Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, echoed Borduas.
“We believe there is an opportunity for the state to support the implementation of targeted initiatives that both directly invest in rural health care providers and the surrounding hospitals and health systems on which patients living in rural areas depend for care,” Kidwell stated in emailed comments.
Connecticut Senate Republicans similarly praised the news of the funding, saying it will “help bolster recruitment and retention of health care workers, and it will improve and strengthen opioid addiction services.”
Connecticut’s plan included 31 different initiatives focused on increasing care options in rural areas and facilitating access to that care. It included efforts aiming to reduce or eliminate travel times, like rolling out mobile medical and dental vans, as well as expanding telehealth options. There are also programs that seek to improve overall wellness: bringing evidence-based exercise classes to senior centers and making upgrades to existing trail systems.
A handful of the proposed initiatives would require sign-off from state lawmakers, including streamlining the state’s “certificate of need” approval process for major hospital transactions — such as mergers, acquisitions, and unit closures — and seeking a SNAP waiver to bar the purchase of energy drinks and candy.
The funding comes at an uncertain time for many clinics and hospitals as they brace for major health care shakeups in the coming years.
Cutbacks to Medicaid are imminent as a result of the “big beautiful bill.” Rural providers, who see many government-insured individuals, could suffer disproportionately as a result. And if some of those patients fall off the rolls, hospitals expect to treat more people who are uninsured.
Some of those changes to Medicaid could start as early as the end of 2026.
First-time work requirements for the health program could go into effect on Dec. 31. But states may also be eligible for delaying implementation. And by the end of the year, states will need to start redetermining eligibility for Medicaid every six months instead of once a year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DayKimball_Putnam_YK_file-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-02 14:57:48.536350

Jillian Gilchrest.","Tiffani McGinnis, a West Hartford town councilor and Democratic political organizer, opened a campaign this week to succeed state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who is running for Congress.
McGinnis is the first candidate to declare for the open seat in the safe Democratic district, and it underscores what Gilchrest has been telling Democrats: Her campaign to qualify for a primary against U.S. Rep. John B. Larson is all or nothing.
“I am running for Congress, and I will not be running for state representative,” Gilchrest said Friday.
McGinnis has made no formal announcement, but she electronically filed her registration as a candidate for General Assembly with the State Elections Enforcement Commission on Tuesday night.
The filing was expected, coming after Gilchrest assured McGinnis that she had no desire for Democrats to put a hold on anyone else seeking the 18th House District seat she won by unseating an incumbent eight years ago. 
“She reached out to me,” Gilchrest said, a gesture she called “very unnecessary.”
McGinnis, 54, is a Tennessee native who had been a political activist for a dozen years before moving to West Hartford a decade ago with her husband and three children.
The last election that McGinnis observed as only a spectator was the 2000 presidential election, which Al Gore lost after the U.S. Supreme Court settled a contentious and close Florida recount in favor George W. Bush.
“I started volunteering in 2004,” McGinnis said Friday.
In 2020, she worked for the election of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the organizer of New England Women for Biden-Harris. Four years later, she created Gen X for Harris.
Democrats selected her as one of the electors who would cast Connecticut’s seven Electoral College votes in 2024 for Harris, who easily won the state over Donald J. Trump.

She also was active in Connecticut politics, serving as treasurer of Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz’s reelection campaign in 2022, then chairing a political action committee Bysiewicz formed in 2023, Women in Power PAC.
“Occasionally, I would think about running for office,” McGinnis said.
In March 2023, McGinnis was appointed to a vacancy on the West Hartford town council. She was elected to a two-year term in 2023 and reelected in 2025 on a slate of six Democrats that outpolled Republicans by nearly 3-1 margins.
No other Democrat has made a move for Gilchrest’s seat.
“Tiffani is the only person who has reached out to me,” Gilchrest said.
McGinnis’s registration as a candidate is of value to Gilchrest, whose candidacy has not been helped by speculation that she eventually would quit the race for Congress and seek a fifth term representing in the General Assembly.
Gilchrest was elected to the state House as an insurgent, unseating a 12-term incumbent, Andy Fleischmann, in a Democratic primary she won with 53% of the vote in 2018.
It is a template she now is trying to replicate on a larger, more crowded stage: the 27 communities of the 1st Congressional District, which is dominated by Hartford and its suburbs.
Larson, 77, of East Hartford, is facing his first serious challenge since winning the open congressional seat in 1998.

“After taking time to listen, reflect, and recharge with my family, I’m more convinced than ever that Kentucky needs experienced, common-sense leadership focused on what matters most: stronger schools, support for working families, and keeping our communities safe and affordable,” he said. 
Timoney, a longtime employee of Fayette County Public Schools, was defeated in the 2024 primary election by Liberty Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson. A key issue among GOP voters at the time was Timoney’s vote against an anti-transgender law affecting medical treatment for youth and public schools. Campaign mailers slammed Timoney for his vote on the issue.

Timoney won about 28% of the vote, or 1,072 votes, in the primary. Jefferson was later defeated by the current incumbent, Democratic Rep. Adam Moore, in the general election. Moore took 50.3% of the vote, or 13,030 votes. 
Moore, of Lexington, is the only candidate to formally file with the secretary of state’s office in the 45th House District so far. The filing deadline is Friday, Jan. 9. 
In a statement after filing in November, Moore said he is “determined to keep bringing home results for our communities” and that he planned to focus on health care access, rising energy costs and “advancing common-sense solutions” in the upcoming legislative session.

A spokesperson for the Senate said Miller died from natural causes.
Miller spend more than four decades working for the Legislature in the state capitol.
From 2009 until 2024, she served as Senate Secretary, and took on a temporarily role during last year’s session before fully retiring.
“Marilyn Miller was part of the institution of the legislature,” Senate President Matt Regier said in a statement. “Her gentle strength guided and mentored thousands of lawmakers, staff, and visitors over the decades. Our hearts are with her family and grieve that she is no longer with us, but the Senate is grateful for her service and friendship.”
In 2023, the Legislature officially designated the Senate leadership offices in the capital as “The Marilyn Miller Senate Suite,” and a plaque with her likeness hangs outside the entrance.
According to the plaque, Miller accepted a position as Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives for the 1993 session, after retiring from a 30-year career in state government.

Old-timers might opt for the 21-0 victory over LSU in the 1960 Sugar Bowl. But given the stakes, surely this Sugar Bowl victory 66 years later becomes the biggest ever.","NEW ORLEANS — Notes, quotes and an opinion or two from a Crescent City still buzzing Friday morning from Thursday night’s instant college football classic in the Sugar Bowl:
• Las Vegas oddsmakers have made Miami a three-point favorite over Ole Miss for next Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona. Oddsmakers set the over-under point total at 51.5. Undefeated and top-seeded Indiana is a four-point pick over Oregon in the Peach Bowl.

• Coaches and commentators are always talking and sports writers are forever writing about how crazy college football has become with pay-for-play and the transfer portal. Perhaps the most crazy example might be this: LSU now owes Lane Kiffin half a million dollars because the Ole Miss Rebels have advanced to the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs. Should Ole Miss beat Miami, that total rises to $750,000. If Ole Miss wins it all, Kiffin will make a million. Crazy, no?
• Ole Miss improved to 7-4 all-time in Sugar Bowl appearances, with wins this year and in 2016, 1970, 1963, 1961, 1960 and 1958. Only Alabama, with 10 victories, has won more Sugar Bowls.
• The win over Georgia puts the Rebels’ record at 4-1 against this season’s 12-team College Football Playoffs field. That’s most victories of any team in the tournament.

• All the unusual off-field circumstances (Kiffin leaving, etc.) during this Ole Miss post-season run continue to be regurgitated in the national media. An emotional Ole Miss Chancellor Glenn Boyce, speaking to Yahoo’s Ross Dellenger on the field amid the post-game Ole Miss celebration, tried to put the focus where it belongs.  “It’s incredibly hard to put it in words,”  Boyce said. “The way you hold something like this together is, sure, leadership and leadership matters, but here’s the other way: these players.”
• Biggest football win in Ole Miss history? Old-timers might opt for the 21-0 victory over LSU in the 1960 Sugar Bowl – and it was huge – but given the stakes, surely this Sugar Bowl victory 66 years later becomes the biggest ever.

• Trinidad Chambliss, asked post-game about his pending appeal to the NCAA, said he expects an answer soon. “The NCAA has been closed now, but I’m pretty sure it opens tomorrow, so maybe we’ll get an answer soon,” he said. “I’ve got people working on it. I’m not the one that’s working on it. My job right now is to focus on football and to focus on this team and to focus on being 1-0 in the next game, so that’s my main focus right now.”
• Pete Golding’s signature victory as a head coach came less than an hour’s drive from his hometown of Hammond, Louisiana. “Yeah, it’s definitely special, being 35 miles away,” Golding said. “My brother lives in New Orleans, a bunch of family. A bunch of Hammond High boys here tonight.”

• The Sugar Bowl ended about one hour before college football’s transfer portal opened. Golding, with that in mind, said he has courted junior placekicker Lucas Carneiro in recent days. Carneiro, a transfer from Western Kentucky, is one of the nation’s best placekickers, as he showed in the Sugar Bowl with three long and clutch field goals. “I think a lot of people think Lucas is the best kicker in the country, so a lot of people want Lucas,” Golding said. “So I’ve been meeting with Lucas a lot lately. We’ve had a lot of good meetings here, and especially this week. I got to spend a lot of time with him one-on-one and just getting to know him a little more and figuring out what he wants in the future. … We felt like he was the best kicker in the country coming out of Western Kentucky last year. He’s done an unbelievable job this year.”
• Georgia coach Kirby Smart was gracious in defeat, praising Golding, the Rebels players and even the Ole Miss crowd. Smart said Ole Miss deserved the victory, but added: “I enjoyed that game and that atmosphere. I am proud of our team. I’m sick that we lost, and there’s things I would love to go back and do differently. But I’m just so proud of the way our guys competed when down 10, and just didn’t finish it.”

Ned Lamont wins a third term as Connecticut governor, he could become the longest-serving CT governor since the Revolutionary War.","If Gov. Ned Lamont wins a third term as governor, he could become the longest-serving governor since Jonathan Trumbull during the Revolutionary War.
But the chances of him outlasting John Winthrop “The Younger,” an early governor of the Connecticut Colony in the 1600s, are slim — it would require a fourth and fifth term (and an amendment to the state Constitution) before Lamont or anyone else could serve longer than Winthrop’s 18 years.
The Connecticut governor who served the shortest time was Hiram Bingham III, a remarkable figure who might have served as inspiration for the fictional Indiana Jones. Bingham was elected simultaneously as governor and to the U.S. Senate. He chose the Senate role, but to ease the transition for his lieutenant governor, Bingham was sworn in as governor of Connecticut on Jan. 7, 1925 (101 years ago Wednesday). He attended the parade and the inaugural ball, then, the next day, he resigned and left for Washington, D.C.
In modern times, the longest-serving Connecticut governor was William A. O’Neill, a Democrat who served for more than 10 years. O’Neill was sworn in on the last day of 1980 after Gov. Ella T. Grasso resigned. He was reelected twice and served until early 1991 after he decided not to seek a third full term.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTGovs-1024x631.jpg,,,2026-01-02 13:57:24.280575

(Photo: Gaston County Sheriff's Office)Federal law enforcement officials announced Friday that they had foiled a planned attack “in support of ISIS” in Mint Hill, North Carolina, on New Year’s Eve.
According to Russ Ferguson, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, the suspect is 18-year-old Christian Sturdivant, an American citizen and Mint Hill resident.
Ferguson said the man had been in contact with ISIS members in Tiktok chatrooms and “had pledged allegiance to ISIS” while planning a New Year’s Eve terrorist attack on a grocery store and a fast-food restaurant in Mint Hill.
“He started reading ISIS material, started going to ISIS websites, making Tiktok videos, and eventually reached out to what he thought was a member of ISIS. In reality, it was an undercover agent with NYPD in New York,” Ferguson said. “He was preparing for jihad, and innocent people were going to die, and we were very, very fortunate they did not.” 
Ferguson said Sturdivant intended to use knives and hammers and planned to wear a Kevlar vest, but also planned to die in the attack. He was under surveillance for two weeks before his arrest on New Year’s Eve, Ferguson said. “At no time was the public in harm’s way.”
James Barnacle, the FBI special agent in charge of the Charlotte field office, said Sturdivant had been under psychological care in recent years. He said Sturdivant’s grandfather had stopped him from attacking neighbors when the suspect was 14.
“His family actively hid knives and weapons from him,” Barnacle said.
Barnacle said the FBI had been watching Sturdivant during that period in 2022, but stopped its investigation when the teen entered mental health treatment.
But last month, when Sturdivant turned 18, Barnacle said, he resumed trying to contact members of ISIS and was immediately flagged by a number of law enforcement agencies.
Barnacle said Sturdivant was seen as a credible threat. “He wrote a manifest. He stole two hammers out of the storage shed and hid them in his house. He reached out to an undercover agent and requested guns.”
Ferguson said the FBI first tried to have Sturdivant involuntarily committed, but a state magistrate denied the petition. So they obtained a warrant and arrested him for “providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization,” a charge that can carry a prison sentence of 20 years.
Sturdivant is currently being held without bail in the Gaston County jail. No attorney or public defender was listed for him at midday Friday. The case will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gleason for the Western District of North Carolina and DOJ Trial Attorney Elisa Poteat with the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GetImage.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 13:57:24.280575

(Photo via Google Earth)A southeast Iowa hospital where a long-term care resident died after being put to bed while struggling to breathe is now facing a potential $10,000 fine.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing has proposed a $10,000 fine against the 165-bed skilled-nursing facility at West Burlington’s Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center, known as The Klein Center. That fine is being held in suspension while the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal penalty will be imposed in place of the proposed state fine.
According to state inspectors, the staff at the Klein Center failed to perform a proper assessment and failed to intervene when a female resident with Down syndrome coughed, choked and vomited during the evening meal on Dec. 5, 2025.

Inspectors reported that a certified nurse aide alleged that as she and a licensed practical nurse sat talking near the dining area, a male resident of the facility approached them, reported that a female resident was choking and coughing, and asked the nurse to check on her. According to the CNA, the nurse said, “OK,” but didn’t follow up.
About 10 minutes later, the CNA allegedly told inspectors, another resident of the facility approached the nurse and said a woman in the dining area was choking, had turned red in the face and had vomited.
At that point, the nurse checked on the woman, determined she was choking, and encouraged her to spit out any sputum before assisting her from the dining area to her room. Once in her room, the woman “continued to cough with copious amounts of sputum coming up,” inspectors reported, and was unable to take drinks of water or swallow.
‘Maybe this will help’
The CNA reportedly told inspectors that although the woman appeared to be struggling to breathe, the nurse left the room, then returned with the woman’s evening medications. The nurse “placed the pills in (the woman’s) mouth and gave her some water, but (the woman) continued to cough and gag, eventually spitting out” the pills, the CNA reportedly told inspectors.
The state inspectors reported that the nurse then instructed the woman to lie down in bed, with her head elevated, and placed the woman’s CPAP, or Continuous Positive Air Pressure, mask in place, saying, “Maybe this will help.”
According to inspectors, the CNA later told them she “questioned in her head whether it was a good idea putting the woman in bed when she was still coughing but dismissed it since the LPN was the charge nurse.”
Later in the evening, a certified nurse aide noted the woman was pale, had labored breathing, and had thrown up in her CPAP mask. Two nurses were called to the resident’s bedside where they noted the woman’s oxygen levels – which are considered dangerous when they fall below 92% — had dropped to 34% and the woman was no longer responsive.
The staff called 911, but pronounced the woman dead a short time later.
Inspectors reported that when they asked the licensed practical nurse whether she had performed any patient assessments after the choking episode — such as checking the woman’s lung sounds, vital signs and oxygen levels — the nurse “teared up and stated, ‘No.’”
Resident abuse cited in May 2025
In May 2025, Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center was fined $500 by the state for resident abuse. In that case, a CNA had reportedly confronted a male resident of the home who had expressed concerns about the welfare of a fellow resident.
The CNA allegedly told the male resident not to worry about the other residents and “sit your f—ing ass down.” A worker also reported hearing the CNA call the male resident a “b—-” while asserting that she knew “how to do my f—ing job.” The employee told inspectors the CNA had called a different resident a “b—–” many times and was generally very vulgar to the residents.
A second employee reportedly told inspectors the CNA once gave a shower to a female resident who complained the water was too hot, prompting the CNA to tell her “shut the f— up.” The employee who reported the matter said the resident was crying afterward and asking why the CNA was mean to her.
In all, three staff members told inspectors they were aware of the CNA’s verbal abuse of residents but didn’t report it, in part because they had to work with her regularly.
Federal records indicate that during the past three years, Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center has been fined once by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The facility has a three-star, or average, overall rating from CMS.

Kansans for Life, an organization opposed to abortion rights, says KDHE ought to have released the report long ago. In this 2023 image, Stanek attends a legislative hearing. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The number of abortions performed in Kansas during 2024 surpassed 19,000 for the second consecutive year in wake of judicial and political decisions in other states restricting access to the medical procedure.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported clinics and hospitals in Kansas conducted a record 19,811 abortions in 2024, up from 19,467 in 2023, 12,319 in 2022 and 7,849 in 2021. Of the 2024 total, 4,763 were provided to residents of Kansas. Demand for abortion among Kansans increased 9.3% from 4,356 in 2023 and was above the 3,844 reported in 2022 and 3,937 in 2021.
In 2024, 15,048 abortions in Kansas were provided to out-of-state residents. That was a slight decline from the 15,111 nonresident abortions in 2023 and a significant increase from 8,475 in 2022 and 3,912 in 2021 among people living outside Kansas.
Three-fourths of abortions in Kansas the past two years were for patients residing in other states, primarily Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Here was a state-by-state breakdown in terms of Kansas abortions in 2024 for nonresidents: Texas, 6,736; Missouri, 3,760; Oklahoma, 3,141; Arkansas, 851; Louisiana, 206; and Nebraska, 138.
In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide for nearly 50 years. Reversing that precedent returned authority to prohibit or regulate the procedure to individual states.
The Kansas Supreme Court had issued a decision in 2019 that found the Kansas Constitution guaranteed individuals bodily autonomy in health care decisions, including a woman’s right to end a pregnancy. The state court’s decision preserved abortion rights in Kansas after the U.S. Supreme Court severed federal constitutional protections.
In Missouri, abortion was legal only in cases of medical emergency from 2022 to 2024. However, Missouri voters in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment restoring broader reproductive freedoms. Other states in the Midwest responded to the U.S. Supreme Court by imposing bans on abortion, including Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Oklahoma has allowed abortions only to preserve the life of a pregnant person. Nebraska enforces a 12-week abortion ban.
Mackenzie Ayers, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion organization Kansans for Life, said the state health department should have more promptly released information on 2024 abortions in Kansas. The state’s latest report was posted online at the end of December 2025 as part of a larger annual summary of vital statistics on Kansas.

“By waiting until the final hours of the year to release Kansas’ 2024 abortion statistics, Gov. Laura Kelly has made it clear she hoped these numbers would go unnoticed,” Ayers said.

Ayers said Kansans for Life believed young females were obtaining abortions in Kansas without parental consent. She said the organization would be “pursuing every legal option to restore some form of informed consent protections for women in 2026 and continue to sound the alarms about parental consent laws being potentially ignored.”

Janet Stanek, secretary of the state Department of Health and Environment, said the latest annual report provided an overview of information on the health status of Kansans.
“Public health statistics are essential to governmental agencies, businesses, industries and citizens for effective health policy decisions and program planning. KDHE is committed to ensuring accessibility,” Stanek’s report said.


KDHE’s report said 85.8% of all abortions performed in the state during 2024 were for unmarried women. KDHE said 77.1% of Kansas resident abortions in 2024 occurred prior to nine weeks of gestational age. Nearly 93% were prior to the 13th week of gestation and 2.8% came after 16 weeks gestation, the state health department said.
KDHE said there 140.3 abortions per 1,000 live births among Kansas residents in 2024. That was 9.6% higher than the ratio of 128 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2023.
The highest abortion ratio among Kansans residents on 2024 was for females 15 to 19 years of age, who had a rate of 341.9 abortions for every 1,000 live births. The lowest ratio — 80.4 abortions per 1,000 births — was for women 30 to 34 years of age, KDHE said. There was variation among Black, white and Hispanic women. The ratios: white non-Hispanics, 85 abortions per 1,000 live births; Black non-Hispanics, 402 abortions per 1,000 births; and Hispanics, 211.6 abortions per 1,000 births.

During 2024, KDHE said, there were 33,956 live births to residents of Kansas for a rate of 11.4 per 1,000 people. The agency said that was the lowest Kansas birth rate since 1912. The rate in 2024 represented a decline of 0.2% from 34,041 births in 2023. Here was the age breakdown of these Kansas mothers: under age 20, 4.5%; 20 to 29 years of age, 51.2%; 30 to 39 year of age, 41.5%; and aged 40 and over, 2.8%;

KDHE reported Kansas residents had 2,656 low-birth-weight infants, representing 7.8% of total births, in 2024. There were 197 infant deaths among Kansas residents, an increase of 8.2% from 182 deaths in 2023.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/P2130666-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-02 13:57:24.280575

Located in Moffat County, Craig Generating Station’s 446-megawatt Unit 1 had been scheduled to go offline on Dec. 31, 2025, part of a wave of coal retirements planned across Colorado through 2030. But an emergency order issued Dec. 30 by the Department of Energy requires the plant to “take all measures necessary to ensure that Craig Unit 1 is available to operate” until at least March 30, 2026.
Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, co-owner of Craig Generating Station, said in a press release that the “additional investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply” required by the order will raise costs for the plant’s customers, which include dozens of electric utilities and rural co-ops. Unit 1 was already offline due to a mechanical failure on Dec. 19, Tri-State said.

“We are continuing to review the order to determine what this means for Craig Station employees and operations, and the financial impacts,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley. “As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”
The five-page DOE order, signed by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, cites “growing resource adequacy concerns” as justification for the move, which followed similar actions in Indiana and Washington.
Shortly after taking office last year, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” in an executive order blasted by environmental advocates as a pretext for advancing the interests of fossil-fuel companies. Despite the declaration’s stated concerns about “insufficient energy production,” the administration has continued to cancel and delay major wind and solar projects.
An analysis released in December by the Sierra Club estimated that keeping Craig’s Unit 1 open for 90 days would cost ratepayers at least $20 million. Critics of the administration anticipate that the DOE’s orders will continue to be renewed every 90 days under the authority granted to the department by Federal Power Act, raising costs by $85 million to $150 million annually.
“Keeping this dirty and outdated coal plant online will harm the health of surrounding communities and hurt all of our pocketbooks,” said Michael Hiatt of environmental group Earthjustice. “This unlawful order will benefit no one but the struggling coal industry.”
The DOE order comes amid a series of Trump administration actions targeting Colorado that are widely viewed as retaliation for the ongoing incarceration of Trump ally and former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted on felony charges for her role in a breach of her own office’s secure election equipment in 2021.
Colorado U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet voted to confirm Wright, a former Denver oil executive, as Trump’s pick for Energy Secretary in January 2025, calling Wright “passionate about strengthening America’s energy independence and lowering costs for Colorado families.” In a statement Wednesday, Bennet, a Democrat who is running for Colorado governor, said he was “disappointed but not surprised by this continued revenge tour.”
“The DOE order is the latest in a string of attacks against Colorado, because we refuse to bend to the President,” Bennet said. “President Trump continues to take out his personal and political grievances on Coloradans who are already struggling to make ends meet.”

Mike Braun ceremonially signs legislation in his Statehouse office on Wednesday, May 28, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has re-established a board overseeing the state’s workforce training programs just months after a similar board was dissolved.
Braun signed an executive order saying the State Workforce Development Board was needed to comply with federal law on the implementation of state and federal workforce initiatives.
The governor’s office said the board would serve “as a central coordinating body to align employers, education and training providers, and state agencies around measurable workforce outcomes.”
Braun’s order released Monday comes after the 21-member Governor’s Workforce Cabinet was eliminated as of July 1. The Workforce Cabinet was enacted in 2018 at the request of then-Gov. Eric Holcomb.
The state budget bill approved by the General Assembly last year repealed the Workforce Cabinet from state law and transferred its activities to the state Department of Workforce Development.
Braun has not yet named members to the board or specified its makeup.
The order said Braun will be a board member and that the governor will appoint other members from those nominated by Indiana business organizations, trade associations and labor unions. Board members must include officials responsible for state workforce programs and from local government.
“We will use the Indiana Workforce Development Board to bring together an elite team of job creators and workforce development experts to help create new opportunities and bigger paychecks for Hoosier workers,” Braun said in a governor’s office statement.
The workforce board’s reinstatement follows a renewed push by some Republican lawmakers to reduce Indiana’s roster of more than 250 state boards and commissions.

According to the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals, Jerome Miller, who has practiced mental health counseling in Des Moines, was issued a three-year temporary license in August 2022.
The board alleges it fielded complaints alleging Miller’s conduct was unprofessional and demonstrated a failure to maintain professional boundaries with a client.

According to the board, in July 2024, Miller disclosed personal information about himself to a client, which the client stated made them feel uncomfortable. Miller also hugged the client, the board alleged, telling the client they gave “good hugs.” The board says the client also alleged Miller made other inappropriate comments, undisclosed by the board, which Miller denied.
The board charged Miller with engaging in unethical conduct, including, but not limited to, improper sexual contact with a client or making suggestive or improper remarks to a client.
The case was resolved with a settlement in which Miller agreed to accept a warning that any future misconduct could result in additional discipline.
Miller, whose license has expired, also agreed to complete six hours of board-approved education in area of professional boundaries, plus six hours of board-approved education in the area of professionalism.

The comment[...],"(Photo by Getty Images)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and local advocates are defending Ohio’s child care system after comments from the Trump administration accusing another state of child care fraud.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said states would need to provide “justification” proving that federal child care funds are being spent on “legitimate” entities. The comments followed fraud allegations in Minnesota related to the state’s child care programs, stemming from a YouTube video by a right-wing social media influencer. The allegations particularly targeted child care centers run by Somali citizens of the state.
The allegations led the Trump administration to freeze federal funding going to the child care sector in Minnesota, which owners and Democrats in the state said would cause major problems in an already struggling sector.
While DeWine said “people are rightfully concerned” about the Minnesota child care fraud allegations, he defended Ohio’s nearly 5,200 state-funded facilities.
In a recent statement, the governor said with the sheer number of facilities “there is certainly the potential for fraud,” but Ohio has several ways of countering the threat.

He noted the practice of paying facilities based on attendance instead of enrollment, a new provision inserted into the state’s most recent operating budget.
DeWine also said the Ohio Department of Children and Youth has a system in place verify attendance and review childcare programs, along with investigating allegations of fraud.
“The department has a comprehensive review process of child care programs that receive state dollars that includes a review of family eligibility, unannounced health and safety inspections, and financial management reviews,” DeWine said in a statement.
Advocacy groups in the state said the child care system in Ohio certainly has room for improvement, and faces struggles based on cost and accessibility, but the threat of fraud isn’t on the list of widespread problems.
“Ohio has strict child care regulations and inspections,” said Tami Lunan, who leads The CEO Project, which focuses its advocacy on parents, child care providers, teachers, and women of color who work in what the group calls the “care economy.”
Lunan said delaying or freezing funding to providers “would be a disaster” because of the already thin margins under which child care centers operate.
“Ohio’s child care providers, many of whom are small business owners, women, and people of color, operate under constant scrutiny and accountability while serving working-class families who rely on stable, affordable care,” Lunan said in a statement.
“Suggesting otherwise without evidence is dangerous and inappropriate to the providers who are doing essential work and following the law.”
In a Jan. 1 press release, the think tank Policy Matters Ohio said lawmakers need to address workforce shortages, low wages, high costs and other issues, rather than focusing on “misleading claims” about child care.
The organization furthered DeWine’s and other advocates’ statements that Ohio’s system includes strict oversight and “crucial accountability measures.”
“Ohio already has strong systems in place to protect children and taxpayers,” Policy Matters senior project coordinator and child care researcher Ali Smith said.
“Licensed child care providers undergo routine, thorough, unannounced inspections every year, and those reports are available for anyone to review. Suggesting that oversight is lax is simply not true.”
Citing data from the Ohio Department of Children and Youth, Policy Matters said the department received 124 fraud allegations in 2025, and 61 of those resulted in overpayments being paid back to the state. A dozen programs were closed by the Department of Children and Youth in that year.
“This is how accountability and transparent oversight are supposed to work,” Policy Matters stated in its release.
DeWine noted this data as well, adding that 30 other programs accused of fraud were “operating in accordance with state and federal laws,” and 21 are still being reviewed.
Smith encouraged caution for families seeing “unsubstantiated claims of fraud” on social media or elsewhere, citing examples of viral videos that were taken during holiday breaks when facilities were closed.
“We urge Ohioans to rely on official sources, rather than social media speculation,” Smith said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-02 17:06:52+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT DMV raises towing rates, but tow companies say it’s not enough",Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/02/ct-dmv-towing-rates-increase/,"Towing companies argue the fees won't cover their ""true costs,"" but their ask would have more than doubled the consumers' cost, a report said.","Despite pleas from tow truck company owners for a larger hike in towing rates, a hearing officer for the state Department of Motor Vehicles has approved a 13.5% increase spread over the next three years.
The new rate aligns with a DMV attorney’s recommendation at a public hearing in October before attorney Steven Baron, a per diem contractor hired by the state. Several towing companies appeared at that hearing seeking significantly larger increases from the current $125 rate.
But in an eight-page decision released in December,  Baron said the rate for a nonconsensual tow of a vehicle under 10,000 pounds would increase to $130.63 in 2026 and then go up to $136.51 in 2027 and $142.65 in 2028. Almost all nonconsensual private property trespass tows would be covered under this rate increase. It does not include police-ordered tows.
“It’s too low. I don’t consider it a fair increase,” said Timothy Vibert, president of the Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut.
“It’s basically a cost of living increase and nothing else,” Vibert said.
In approving the DMV’s recommendation, Baron rejected towing companies’ proposal to adopt Maryland’s towing fees which he said “could more than double the cost for the consumer.”
Michael Festa, owner of MyHoopty of Watertown and president of the Association of Connecticut Towers, said in a statement that “the increase falls short of addressing the true cost of compliance, insurance, labor, and regulatory burden faced by licensed towers.”
“Private property towing is no longer a simple service — it is a heavily regulated public function,” Festa said. “Rate relief must reflect that reality, or the system becomes unsustainable.”
Baron also agreed with the  DMV’s recommendation not to raise the storage rate fees for towed vehicles. The rate for vehicles under 20 feet long is $30 if stored inside and $26 if stored outside for the first five days. Rates then increase to $37 and $31, respectively.
At the October hearing DMV attorney David Cardone said the agency did not support an increase in storage rates because it would directly impact the consumer.
“Since the cost of the nonconsensual trespass tow is borne by the consumer, an increase in storage rates may have the greatest  impact on a segment of the population that can least afford to absorb an increase,” Cardone said
In his analysis, Baron noted the towing rate increase mirrors the growth of the Consumer Price index over the past two years. The new rates included several new fees that were part of a legislative overhaul of the state’s more than 100-year-old towing regulations last session.
Legislators passed the new law after a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica revealed that towing companies could seek permission from the DMV to sell someone’s vehicle after 15 days, one of the shortest time periods in the country. 
The series highlighted how towing companies doing private property or trespass tows were affecting low-income residents who in many cases couldn’t afford the fees to get their cars back.
One of the new charges implemented because of the new legislation is a $50 drop fee as proposed by the DMV. Cardone said towing companies previously were not required to release the vehicle should someone arrive on scene when it was being “hooked up,” but under the new law they must release it.
There is also a new after-hours redemption fee of $50 to cover labor costs. The new statute requires tow companies to be available at all times with proper notice to allow someone to get their car back, especially on weekends. The new fee would cover the costs of an employee having to go to the tow yard to release the vehicle.
Baron did approve a $1 increase per mile in mileage charges to tow vehicles back to their lots — bumping it to $6.65 a mile. The new statute only allows towing companies to charge for a maximum of 13 miles, capping mileage costs at $86.45 under the new plan.
The new rates also removed a fuel surcharge that towing companies were getting if diesel fuel was over $3.50 a gallon. They were allowed to bill customers for fuel, but Baron eliminated that from the new regulations.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2275-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 12:13:16.912679

Investing in public schools is ... investing in Mississippi's people.""","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

Whether you call it “school choice” or vouchers, privatization of education socializes all the costs of education, but privatizes all the benefits.
So under “school choice,” all Mississippi taxpayers will pay for wealthy kids to go to private schools, even though those private schools won’t accept all Mississippi taxpayers’ children as students.
If “school choice” keeps being pushed on Mississippi taxpayers, we will continue to be saddled with an even greater financial burden that doesn’t benefit the majority of Mississippi families nor Mississippi communities. In fact, it actively harms most families, businesses and communities because it starves the public schools, which are the only schools responsible for educating every child who walks through their doors.
We will all end up paying even more for education and getting far less in return because private schools are private for a reason – because they don’t want the responsibility nor the accountability of educating all children. Most private schools are set up to educate a select few and the select few does not include poor children, children with special needs and children who don’t speak English.
Educating all children well and equitably comes with a cost. With public schools, taxpayers not only share the costs, they also reap all the benefits that come with a well-educated citizenry.
I don’t know of any private school that wants to accept the responsibility and accountability of educating all children in their community, but they would gladly accept the generous gift of Mississippi taxpayer money to continue educating a select handful of already-enrolled private school students.

Folks already using private schools would benefit above all others in Mississippi. Where “school choice”/vouchers have passed in other states, we’ve seen private schools increase their tuition once vouchers are available because they know which families can still afford it and it keeps out students that most private schools would rather not serve.
Mississippi legislators have rarely kept their promise to Mississippi taxpayers, families and communities to be responsible stewards of our public schools. Every time the state Legislature breaks its promise to the people who elected them, they increase the financial burden of their own local communities. The Mississippi Legislature ties the hands of the local community by telling them how much they can tax at the local level and what that money can and can’t be used for.
Plus, many of our communities are at or near the maximum percentage they can tax at the local level. And whether they are at or near that maximum local tax percentage allowed by the Legislature, the vast majority of Mississippi communities don’t have the economic capacity to make up for – at the local level – the amount of financial support they’re supposed to be getting from the State. 
“School choice” is a lie built on a false promise. Mississippi has tried vouchers or “school choice” before, and the only people who could receive them were people who had the same skin color as me. Mississippi, like some other Southern states, used vouchers to prop up segregation. Vouchers weren’t intended to be available for all children then, and they won’t be this time either.
“School choice” doesn’t just hurt individual children or families or communities. “School choice” will hurt our cost of living, our overall quality of life, our state’s economic capacity to succeed and, ultimately, the cornerstone of our representative democracy. 
Public education is an American value. Investing in public schools is not only investing in Mississippi’s people, it’s also the most common sense approach to strengthening our economy not only at the state level, but also at the levels of our local communities, families and individuals.
Mississippi would be wise to elect legislators and congressional representatives who are committed to strengthening the single most important factor to improving every community’s capacity to succeed economically – America’s public schools.

This story was first published by WyoFile on Dec. 18, 2025.
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population continues to stagnate geographically, a relatively new trend that wildlife managers say is related to bears saturating “suitable habitat” where the species is tolerated.
That finding is described in a new and first-ever rangewide report summarizing where grizzly bears are found in the Lower 48.
Overall, grizzlies, which are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, continued their decades-long recovery and reoccupied 4% more habitat over the past two years. That equates to a rangewide expansion of roughly 2,250 square miles, or an area about two-thirds the size of Yellowstone National Park.

But bruins that dwell in the tri-state Yellowstone area were the exception. The estimated 1,050 grizzlies there occupied about 3.5% less ground, or about 963 fewer square miles, than they did two years ago. The report does not address what drove the change, but lead author and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks research biologist Cecily Costello said it’s likely related to grizzlies running out of ideal habitat in the modern West.
“When you look at the habitat to the east of the Yellowstone Ecosystem, to the south of Yellowstone, you’re looking at a lot of open prairie,” Costello said. “There’s not really big river valleys those bears could move into. There’s a little bit of a limitation in terms of the range expansion in those directions.”
Wyoming grizzly managers see it similarly, attributing the slight retreat to bears losing spaces where they can live without getting into trouble.
“I think it’s just indicative of where the population is,” said Dan Thompson, large carnivore supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I don’t think we should expect it to expand.”
The occupied grizzly bear range in the Yellowstone region is retreating slightly and encompasses an estimated 26,100 square miles, nearly two thirds of which is located in Wyoming. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
Matt Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s new leader, agreed. His predecessor, Frank van Manen, predicted about a decade ago that the grizzly population in the Yellowstone region would soon stabilize — and now it seems to be doing just that.
“Occupied range has kind of waned up, and now it’s kind of slightly decreasing,” Gould said. “It’ll be interesting to see: ‘Does it drastically drop, or is it going to stay steady and bounce around?’”

Range for grizzlies stopped expanding
Biologists first documented the end of a half-century-long era of grizzly range expansion in the Yellowstone area two years ago. At the time, federal scientists observed a 0.5% reduction in the species’ overall distribution — a retreat of 142 square miles.
The mapping Costello and her co-authors just completed examined the period from 2010 to 2024. Distribution in the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystem is based on hard data — from tracked bears, conflicts and other verified observations — over a 15-year rolling window.
The data is smoothed out based on the whereabouts of all grizzlies known to exist in any given area. For that reason, bears that make “outlier” movements, like the subadult male that reached the Bighorns in 2024, don’t usually influence the distribution maps.

Contraction in the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s occupied range comes at a time when there has been a record number of bears dying, though grizzly biologists say they don’t necessarily see the two trends as being related.
Mortality hit a high in 2024, with 72 known grizzlies that died that calendar year, Gould said. The death toll in 2025 is almost the same, at 71, which is about 35% greater than the 10-year average of 54 mortalities. (Editor’s note: Following publication of this story, Gould confirmed an additional death with the Daily Montanan, which put the count at 72 for 2025.) 
The leading causes of death, according to Gould, were livestock conflict (21 grizzlies killed as a result), followed by “site conflicts with humans” (16 grizzlies), self-defense killings (12 grizzlies), accidental deaths (nine grizzlies) and natural causes like predation (six grizzlies).
In 2025, three in four Yellowstone-area grizzly deaths were within a zone in the core of the ecosystem known as the “demographic monitoring area.” That’s a slightly higher rate than average.
Where grizzly bear habitats are retreating
Wildlife managers count bears in the demographic monitoring area. This area was declared fully occupied by bears in 2019.
In Costello’s distribution report, this “core” area represented 71% of where grizzlies were found in 2024. The other 29% of the occupied range fell outside of this core area on the fringes of the mountainous, public land-dominated ecosystem. This is where grizzly range has been retreating. When Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly distribution reached its peak in 2021, more than 40% of occupied range was mapped outside the core zone.
In 2024, the largest contraction in occupied Yellowstone habitat was located in eastern Idaho in the Big Hole Mountains and Snake River Range. Another recession appears in Montana’s Ruby Range, maps from the report show, and there’s a small loss of occupied range in the South Pass area off the tip of the Wyoming River Range.
Costello, who compiled the maps, said she doesn’t put a “whole lot of stock” into small regional changes.
“The edges are a little bit uncertain,” she said, “because you have less [grizzly data] about the edges than you do about the middle.”
The other major population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48 dwell in Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Occupied grizzly range stretched by 2,500 square miles, a nearly 12% increase. These bears mostly pressed into new habitat on the eastern and southern sides of the ecosystem, gaining ground in the Sapphire Range, and Boulder and Big Belt Mountains, maps show.
There are more than 24,000 square miles of occupied grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, a 12% increase from an assessment two years ago. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem’s occupied range encompasses much more open prairie than to the south in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
Partly, that’s explained by Montana grizzlies moving down big river corridors, Costello said. When a bunch of them make the movement, the occupied range line can “pull out really quickly.” Smoothing of the data can then make it look like they’ve reoccupied big chunks of open country, she said.
Habitat is another explanation for why western Montana occupied grizzly range keeps stretching while Yellowstone-area bears have held steady and retreated in places.
“When you look at the plant communities and mountains that exist in western Montana, there’s still a lot of what could be considered decent bear habitat,” Costello said. “It’s the expectation that we’ll probably continue to see bears moving into those habitats.”
A lot of that growth is expected to take grizzly populations toward Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem, which has been unoccupied since the species was wiped out there in the 1950s.

(Photo by Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Nursing has issued a warning to a nurse suspected of being intoxicated at work and failing to report two arrests for drunken driving.
In 2020, the Board of Nursing charged Mandi Irlbeck of Harlan with excessive use of alcohol that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety. The board alleged that in May 2020, Irlbeck came to work in a condition unfit to work. The board did not disclose the nature or place of her employment.
In additional, the board said it received information that Irlbeck “excessively uses alcohol.”
In a settlement, Irlbeck agreed to have her license placed on probation for 18 months, during which she would not use alcohol and would enroll in a chemical screening program.
In July 2025, the board received a complaint that Irlbeck’s coworkers suspected she had been intoxicated while working as a nurse. While looking into that matter, the board learned Irlbeck had failed to report a 2024 conviction for drunken driving during a period when she worked at a MercyOne medical facility.
The board also learned Irlbeck was then facing a charge of second-offense drunken driving that was still working its way through the courts. That charge stemmed from a May 2025 incident in which Irlbeck was pulled over near Logan and, according to police, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.235% — almost three times the legal limit for driving.
Court records show Irlbeck subsequently pleaded guilty to the second-offense drunken driving charge and, according to the board, she was fired from her place of employment due to concerns with her use of alcohol.
The Board of Nursing charged Irlbeck with being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the nursing profession, and with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
The board and Irlbeck recently agreed to a settlement that calls for Irlbeck to accept a warning that states any future infractions may result in some form of discipline. As part of the settlement, Irlbeck also agreed to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program. Her nursing license remains in full effect.



Board takes action in other nursing cases
Other Iowa-licensed nurses whose cases recently came before the Board of Nursing include:
Melynda Albert of Muscatine — The board alleges that while Albert was working in a Bettendorf assisted living facility in April 2023, she was suspected of taking a vial of morphine from a resident’s supply. Court records indicate the theft occurred at The Summit, a residential care facility in Bettendorf, and that the victim was a dying hospice patient.
Albert was criminally charged with unlawful possession of a prescription drug, possession of a controlled substance and fifth-degree theft. She later pleaded guilty to the possession charge and the two remaining charges were dismissed and was placed on probation.
In December 2023, Albert was criminally charged with theft, and later convicted, for stealing items at a Walmart store.
In August 2024, she was charged with violating the terms of her probation in the morphine-theft case by failing to complete a substance-abuse evaluation as ordered. In December 2024, she was cited for driving with an open container of alcohol in the car.
In April 2025, District Associate Judge Michael Motto ruled Albert had successfully completed the terms of her probation in the morphine-theft case and ordered that all charges in the matter be expunged from the public court record — although those records remain accessible to the public.
Board of Nursing documents indicate the panel filed a set of disciplinary charges against Albert in June 2025, although the written charging documents in the case have not been publicly disclosed. As part of a recent settlement agreement with the board, Albert has agreed to an indefinite suspension of her license that will remain in effect until the completion of a substance-abuse evaluation that indicates it is safe for Albert to practice, at which point her license will be placed on probation for one year.
Jaclyn Zabolotny of St. Cloud, Minn. — In May 2025, Zabolotny applied for an Iowa license to work as a registered nurse. Board records indicate that on her application she reported a criminal history and an out-of-state disciplinary case. An investigation showed that in May 2017, while working as a licensed nurse in Minnesota, Zabolotny was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance procured by fraud or deceit. She later pleaded guilty to the charge and successfully completed probation in 2019, after which her criminal conviction was expunged.
According to board records, Zabolotny admitted she obtained a prescription for an opiate using the credentials of a nurse practitioner so she could get some sleep and keep working the 60 to 90 hours per week she was scheduled. According to the board, Zabolotny “regrets this decision and knows it was wrong.”  Noting that Zabolotny has completed a substance abuse evaluation, recommended educational courses, and mental health counseling, and has maintained an unconditional nursing license in Minnesota since February 2021, the Iowa board agreed to issue her a license free and clear of any restrictions.
Angela Gaynor of Sioux City — Board records indicate Gaynor’s Iowa license to practice nursing expired in 2018. In February 2025, she applied for license reactivation and disclosed a 2019 criminal conviction for felony credit card fraud, which resulted in a deferred judgment and three years of probation. In October 2020, Gaynor entered a guilty plea to a charge of violating her probation by testing positive for THC and alcohol.
In January 2022, she stipulated to a second probation violation resulting from her refusal to enter a residential treatment program. In January 2023, Gaynor was successfully discharged from probation. In deciding to grant Gaynor’s request for a reactivated Iowa license, subject to two years of probationary status, the Board of Nursing noted Gaynor “was forthcoming regarding her criminal history and drug use,” and that she had been sober for 15 years before suffering a relapse.
Nikki Smith of Waterloo — Board records indicate Smith applied for licensure in November 2024. A board review of her criminal history showed a conviction for first-offense drunken driving in July 2020, violation of a no-contact order in October 2022, a second-offense drunken driving charge in May 2024, and domestic-abuse assault by display or use of a weapon in May 2024. Smith subsequently completed a substance-abuse evaluation, a domestic abuse program and a drinking driver’s class, according to the board. Noting that Smith was “forthcoming regarding her criminal history” and that “she took full responsibility for her mistakes,” the board agreed to issue Smith a license, subject to one year of probationary status.
Ursella M. Washington of Perry — The Board of Nursing has charged Washington with committing an act that might adversely affect the physical or psychosocial welfare of a patient; failing to assess, accurately document, evaluate, or report the status of a patient, and failing to respond to a board investigation or subpoena. The board has not disclosed any information as to the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges or when it may have occurred. A disciplinary hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 23, 2026. Although the charges were only recently made public, state records indicate they were approved by the board on Sept. 8, 2025.

The board says it has opened an investigation into the matter and that in order to allow Wood “the opportunity to respond” to that investigation, and in order to meet the board’s interest in protecting the public, Wood and the board have agreed that for now, Wood will not practice massage therapy in Iowa. The agreement stipulates that it does not constitute “disciplinary action,” although, as a result of the agreement, Wood’s licensure status is being changed to “suspended” until further notice by the board.
Ankeny therapist sanctioned by board
In a separate, unrelated case, the Iowa Board of Massage Therapy has sanctioned Li Labee of Ankeny after charging her with two counts of allowing unlicensed employees to perform massage therapy without the required license.
The board alleged that while operating Bandung Massage in Ankeny, Labee “was, at best, not checking to ensure her employees were licensed by the State of Iowa.”
To resolve the matter, Labee and the board recently entered into a formal settlement agreement that includes conflicting information as to the nature of the discipline being imposed.
The signed, finalized agreement twice describes itself as a “voluntary surrender,” suggesting Labee has agreed to relinquish her license as a massage therapist. However, the “final order” portion of the agreement specifies only that Labee will receive a warning and be required to pay a $2,000 civil penalty, with no mention of her license being surrendered.

Instead, Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty will run for district court judge. The Martin Democrat, who has represented the 95th House District since 2019, shared her decision in a New Year’s Day post on Facebook. She said she plans to serve the remainder of her term in the House. 
She thanked her constituents for their support, and said some of her proudest accomplishments included backing funding for the Mountain Parkway Expansion through Prestonsburg and for straightening a road to John M. Stumbo Elementary School.
“In addition to serving as your State Representative, for over 20 years, I have worked as an attorney representing our local families,” Laferty wrote. “I hope my record of hard work, and always trying to do what’s right for my community, helps you to support me in this election, as well!  Once again, I humbly ask for your trust and vote!” 
Kentucky Democrats once held Democratic strongholds throughout the Appalachian part of the state and began losing ground around the start of the century. At present, Democrats have 20 seats in the state House to the Republicans’ 80. 
Last year, the last remaining Eastern Kentucky Democrat in the Senate, Sen. Robin Webb of Grayson, switched parties. At the time, Webb said she joined the Republicans, not because she was leaving the Democratic Party, but “the party left me.”

The growth comes as private and public school enrollment is declining in the state.
Across the state, 12,433 school-aged children are enrolled in alternative instruction, which includes homeschooling and some private schools — such as online, hybrid and microschools — that are unaccredited, or accredited by an entity other than the state. Students notify the state when they enroll in alternative instruction.


Rising Alternatives
Examining the impact, causes and concerns surrounding the rapid growth of alternative instruction options in the state.
Read the series >


Enrollment in alternative instruction has nearly tripled since 2015 — now making up 7.6% of children receiving an education in the state.
The growth comes as public education enrollment decreases in the state for a second consecutive year. Public education peaked in South Dakota in 2023, with 137,759 students enrolled. This year, 135,577 students are enrolled in public schools.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told lawmakers during his budget address earlier this month that his administration expects public school enrollment to continue to decrease next year, due to growing alternative instruction enrollment and lower birth rates.
State-accredited private school enrollment — including religious and tribal schools — decreased slightly to 15,043 this year. Enrollment is still higher than 2023, when it was 14,741.


The Sioux Falls School District reported the largest increase in alternative instruction this year, with 131 more students enrolled. Harrisburg (78), Brandon Valley (67) and Rapid City (64) were also among the highest increases in alternative instruction enrollment in the state.
McLaughlin and Burke school districts reported some of the highest percentage increases of students enrolling in alternative instruction since last year.
In McLaughlin, 18 students enrolled in alternative instruction in 2025, a 157% increase from seven registered the year before. In Burke, 41 students enrolled in alternative instruction in 2025, a 156% increase from 16 in 2024.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/591A4902-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 10:57:28.931965

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Moving the Chiefs to Kansas will spur economic development, but the complexity and lack of details about the deal make it difficult to determine what taxpayers will ultimately pay.
The announcement that the Chiefs and state of Kansas will spend an estimated $4 billion to build a domed stadium in Wyandotte County surrounded by an entertainment district and a team headquarters and training facility in Johnson County has prompted questions about whether Kansans will lose money on the deal.
Economic growth in a large and so-far-undefined area in Wyandotte and Johnson counties will be reserved to pay down STAR bonds over the next two or three decades. The Chiefs also could enjoy property tax subsidies and other financial support if economic development programs are implemented locally. 
It is accurate when state leaders say no new taxes will be implemented to move the Chiefs across the border, said Ian Graves, a Prairie Village City Council member and self-described public finance policy wonk who has been studying the details. 
However, the project may require new taxes down the road to cover the loss of revenue growth that would normally flow into the state’s coffers, he said. 
The Chiefs project will be funded through a 60-40 public-private partnership, according to terms posted online by the Kansas Department of Commerce. The state’s 60% of funding will come from a mix of STAR bonds, or sales tax and revenue bonds, and funds in the Attracting Professional Sports to Kansas Fund, which is revenue from iLottery and sports betting. 
STAR bonds also will be repaid with 100% of liquor sales tax collected in the district. 
According to a Commerce Department fact sheet, the state expects 20,000 new jobs to be created during the construction phase and more than 4,000 new permanent jobs at the stadium and entertainment district that will surround the stadium. The annual estimated economic impact is expected to be $1 billion, and the Chiefs will pay $7 million in annual rent. 
Graves said his primary concern is with how the project freezes future revenue growth.  
“We are diverting natural revenue growth over time that we rely on to basically account for the increase of price in goods and services that governments require,” he said. “If you look at sales tax revenue growth, just naturally, it floats with inflation because as the price of purchased goods go up, sales tax revenues also climb, and then that increased revenue goes back to be able to support the city or state.”
Graves said his interest isn’t part of his Prairie Village role but came about because the city recently passed bonds and he had spent time learning about their mechanisms. He used his computer science background to build an online tool to take a deep dive into costs associated with the Chiefs project.
The tool allows users to change assumptions such as the interest rate, repayment period and principal amount. 
“Even after I made it, I’m like this still isn’t super easy to understand,” he said. “You can set worst-case scenarios, but basically it’s just a lot of money going to it, and you can see that most of it is just regular old sales and use tax. The narrative about alcohol and gambling revenues, that’s just kind of window dressing. It’s just sales taxes that are powering this thing.”
Toggling different scenarios on Graves’ STAR bonds financing model, the state’s portion over time — including principal and interest — could be anywhere from $3 billion to $4 billion and on up. 
Paul Byrne, economics professor at Washburn University, said moving the Chiefs will definitely generate new economic activity for Kansas. 
“Some of the critics kind of downplay that, but you’re having a lot of people crossing the state line, they’re going to spend a lot of money,” he said. “That money is going to have a multiplier effect, and that’s going to have an impact on the revenue. So that I definitely take as a given.”
The multiplier effect refers to the idea that money spent in a community has a ripple effect. A cook at a new restaurant receives a paycheck on which they paid taxes. They then buy groceries at local stores, which fuels more jobs and income in the community. 
However, the question is whether that growth will justify the subsidies going to build the Chiefs’ facilities, Byrne said.
He expressed concern about the way the STAR bonds will be set up and what challenges that will present for repayment and the state budget. Much is still unknown, he said.

Gov. and Secretary of Commerce David Toland will determine the final boundaries of the STAR bonds district when the bonds are issued to pay for the 60% investment the state will make in building the Kansas City Chiefs stadium, headquarters and training facility.

STAR bonds
Kansas STAR bonds are issued to finance major development projects, and under usual circumstances, must be for projects where the capital investment exceeds $75 million and projected annual gross sales are $75 million, according to the Kansas Department of Commerce. 
The bonds must not pay for more than 50% of the development and are typically repaid over 20 years. 
However, to entice the Chiefs and possibly the Royals across the state border, the Kansas Legislature in 2024 passed a special session law that would allow STAR bonds to pay for up to 70% of a project and upped the repayment timeframe to 30 years. 
STAR bonds typically are paid through state retail sales tax dollars generated by the district, which is determined by the Commerce Department. For instance, if the bond district had $1 million in state sales tax revenue in the 12 months preceding the date the bonds were issued, that sets the base value at $1 million. If sales tax revenue jumped to $6 million after the new development, the new revenue of $5 million would go to debt repayment. 
However, new regulations regarding stadium development allow the base value to be changed, Byrne said. 
“It gives the secretary of commerce the right to pick any base value,” Byrne said. “That jumped out at me because they could just make everything zero. If they choose a base value that’s below what would typically be a base value, well then you’re even more clearly capturing sales tax revenue or property tax revenue, or whatever would have gone to the state and to the local government.” 
Although the state has approved using its sales tax revenue in the proposed district to repay the STAR bonds, other taxing authorities in the district, such as Wyandotte County and Olathe, will vote on whether to fund the project with a percentage or all of local sales taxes collected.
Bob North, the Commerce Department’s chief counsel, said changing that base value hasn’t been discussed. But he said state legislators and leaders have made it clear they don’t want to set a base that would have any effect on existing income.
“We’re not going to set an artificially low base, because that could actually have an impact on state general fund revenues,” he said.

The state budget
The Chiefs economic development package will affect state revenue, North said. 
“We think some of that foregone revenue will be made up with increased income tax and some of the other kinds of economic benefits we’re going to see from the Chiefs being here,” he said. 
North stressed that only the state portion of the sales tax revenue increase in the bond district will repay the Chiefs bonds. Local governments will have to determine whether they are going to pledge county or city sales tax revenue to the STAR bonds. 
If local communities choose not to participate, it would have a negative financial impact on the project, North said. 
“STAR bonds are built on the premise that it’s going to be a partnership between the state and the local units of government,” he said. “We anticipate both Olathe and Kansas City, Kansas, unified government voting to participate in the STAR bonds. It’s really important, and something that we’re monitoring very closely.” 
But would it be a deal breaker if they don’t participate? 
“It’s hard to look nine to 12 months into the future,” North said. “The answer to that is going to depend on the kind of economic conditions that are present in nine to 12 months, interest rates and general economic conditions and things like that. So we can’t definitively say at this point in time what that impact might be.”
The participation of local governments concerns Graves, who said taking away the growth in revenue could put the area in a position of being unable to keep up with annual increases in the cost of doing business. 
“It all creeps up on you over time,” he said. “That’ll happen about two election cycles out, is when that will really bite. In one or two election cycles, it’s going to be like, ‘Gosh, we really have this budget shortfall, and it’s because we’ve nuked off all this natural growth from Wyandotte and JoCo from feeding into the state coffers.’ And so how are they going to plug that hole? Are they going to cut services? They going to raise taxes? They going to do both? And that will be a question for future Kansas. Not cool just-got-the-Chiefs Kansas, right?”
This rendering by the Kansas Department of Commerce shows possible STAR bonds district borders, but Bob North, commerce chief counsel, said the district won’t encompass all of Wyandotte County, as shown here. (Submitted)
 
The map
A map put out by the Kansas Department of Commerce highlights possible boundaries for the STAR bond district, which is key to determine how much of an area’s sales tax revenue will be pulled into paying for the stadium. 
The map is labeled “illustrative” and notes the final boundaries will be determined by the secretary of commerce. When overlaid on a county map, it looks as if the boundaries could include all of Wyandotte County, but North said that won’t be the case. 
The district will be finalized by the secretary closer to when the STAR bonds are issued, which will be in six to eight months, he said. 
“The size of the district is going to be contingent, to a certain extent, on what we need to do to finance the bonds,” North said. 
For instance, if interest rates drop two points in the next few months, the district would have a smaller footprint, and the opposite is also true, he said. 
“The unknown is the exact site in Wyandotte County, and until that piece is resolved, we can’t really finalize what Wyandotte County is going to look like,” he said. “It certainly will not be the entire county. The STAR bond district will be the stadium and then the mixed-use development that’s adjacent to the stadium.”
North said the STAR bond act allows the commerce secretary to reduce or add to the district’s size after it is set up, if necessary, but he could only think of instances in which the land area has been reduced. 
In an economic impact study done by contractor Canyon Research Southwest Inc., it is estimated the construction phase will generate more than 20,000 added jobs, with significant economic benefits. (Screen capture from Economic Impact Study)
Up in the air
Some parts of the plan are uncertain, such as whether the Chiefs will take advantage of the state’s High Performance Incentive Program, or HPIP, Byrne said. The program provides a 10% income tax credit for eligible capital investments, with the threshold in five metro counties, including Wyandotte and Johnson, set at $1 million. 
It also provides a sales tax exemption that can be used on the company’s capital investments, and a training tax credit up to $50,000. 
The HPIP is for companies that locate their headquarters in the state and pay above-average wages. North said it is a statutory program and isn’t included in the stadium bill, so if the Chiefs meet the criteria laid out, they can participate.  
Byrne said visiting players on opposing teams would likely pay tax for their work in the state, which would be a benefit to state revenue. In addition, other events held at the stadium during the offseason could bring in revenue. 
Although the published STAR bonds district map isn’t finalized, it indicates the district will be large, he said. 
One misconception he’s seen around STAR bonds is confusion over where the sales tax revenue comes from to pay off the bonds, Byrne said. 
“People think there’s some special way where they only include the Chiefs stadium. It captures everything,” he said. “Somebody goes in the middle of May and goes to a restaurant, that’ll be captured as well. And clearly that person probably isn’t going there just because there’s a stadium there, because the Chiefs are there. That’s the misconception.”
Graves said other uncertainties are outlined in the STAR bonds terms, which open the possibility of setting up other taxing districts such as TIFs, or tax increment financing districts. A TIF district does what STAR bonds do, except with property taxes. 
Property tax values are frozen at the beginning of the project, and when improvements generate additional property taxes, those dollars would pay for improvements.
The STAR bonds terms with the Chiefs also open the possibility to establish community improvement districts and transportation improvement districts, Graves said.  
“All of those can be set up, and they do not count toward the public portion of the project’s cap,” he said. “What I take that to mean is that Wyandotte could, in theory, establish something like a TIF in the surrounding area around the Chiefs stadium, at the behest of the Chiefs or the developers working for the Chiefs, or what have you, to also capture revenues on the property tax side and divert that to developing those districts.”
One of the unknowns about the Chiefs development is exactly where it will be located. It is expected to be on land near the Kansas Speedway in the Village West development of Kansas City, Kansas. (Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)
Yay or nay?
Both Graves and Byrne pointed to economists who, in general, say stadium subsidy deals are not winners for states. 
Byrne said he can’t ignore the economic development that will occur. 
Unlike some projects that are controversial because they simply shift economic activity from one part of a town or county to another part, Byrne said shifting economic dollars from MIssouri to Kansas will positively affect Kansas. 
“There’s a reason you had those border wars for all those years,” Byrne said. “If you can get someone across that state line, it is going to generate pretty significant economic activity.”
North pointed to expected job creation, which will increase state income tax collections, and property taxes from major developments that occur. That assumes local areas don’t set up a TIF district that would subsidize the development by nixing property taxes.
Graves said he’s “agnostic” about whether the state should have fought to bring the Chiefs to Kansas. 
“What I wish we could be more clear about is how this financing works,” he said. “Because I don’t feel like we’re being transparent with the residents about where this money is coming from, and what public services they rely on that rely on this increment that naturally grows. I don’t think we’re being straightforward. After 10 years of growth, this could be hundreds of millions of dollars diverted every year to financing this thing, and that’s a hole in the budget. What’s going to flood that hole?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7847-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

New Mexico’s economy is “treading water” while much of the nation is in or near a recession, a recent Legislative Finance Committee report found. The report estimated the state would finish this fiscal year with $13.4 billion in recurring revenue — a nearly $323 million decrease since LFC’s previous forecast in August.
Lawmakers and state analysts attribute the low point to a number of factors, ranging from massive reductions to corporate income tax as part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” to spending on the governor’s executive orders for disaster response.
“The tariffs, increased prices and higher uncertainty are impacting a wide range of areas. One example: Oil prices per barrel are down 20-plus percent,” Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), who chairs the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, told Source NM. “There are no doom and gloom conclusions here. While we retain really strong non-recurring capacity and we’re in a safe place with really strong reserves. The ‘new money’ and the ability to invest in new programs, make a ton of new governmental hires — that is something that we’re going to have to watch very carefully.”
In recent hearings, lawmakers and legislative analysts blamed HR1, commonly known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” for significantly limiting the state’s revenue sources. The legislation gave hefty corporate income tax breaks to industries such as oil and gas and manufacturing, which combined make up half of New Mexico’s corporate tax base. Corporate income tax was briefly in the red this fiscal year for the first time since early in the pandemic, they said.
The federal fallout is responsible for tens of millions of dollars in revenue loss, according to the December LFC report. The federal increase to the standard deduction will lead to an estimated loss of $39.2 million for New Mexico and changes to Medicaid and state-directed payments will lead to an estimated loss of $17.1 million, the report says.
The LFC report projected that the state will only have $105.7 million in “new money,” which refers to a year’s total revenue minus the prior year’s spending. That amounts to less than 1% of growth from the current fiscal year.
Small said that he has confidence in the state’s finances and believes leaders are in a “strong position” to invest in the state. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t concerns.
Of particular concern, he said, are hiring new full-time employees at state agencies and paying for health insurance premiums. Small said he is “very fearful” of federal cuts to programs like Medicaid and wants to ensure the state doesn’t spread itself too thin by compensating for the federal cuts.

“That is something we are very, frankly, fearful of. Cutting billions of dollars to our health care system that is already stressed is quite concerning,” Small said. “It’s another reminder to make sure we retain the capacity to address those challenges the best that we can and it means not going too far on recurring spending in other areas.”
One way the state could spread itself too thin, the December LFC report says, is in funding emergency responses.
Spending on executive orders from the governor to pay for the state’s response to unexpected disasters like wildfires, flooding and the COVID-19 pandemic have become a growing point of contention between the fourth floor of the Roundhouse and state lawmakers. Those orders alone could wipe out all of New Mexico’s new money next fiscal year, the report says.
State agencies had opportunities in November and December to present their budget requests to lawmakers on the interim Legislative Finance Committee.
Budget requests ranged from the routine to the unexpected during those hearings. A coalition of cities and towns said water infrastructure projects are underfunded by $200 million; rural prosecutors asked for help with internet connections and high-mileage cars; the state Public Education Department secretary disclosed a $35 million shortfall after a debacle that involved paying multiple school districts to serve the same students virtually.
While 30-day legislative sessions typically are reserved for budgetary matters, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office told Source NM that public safety will be on her legislative agenda, known as a call. Lawmakers in both parties have announced plans to propose legislation around firearm dealers and criminal sentencing.
The governor released her own $11.3 billion budget proposal on Dec. 22, a 4.6% increase over the current fiscal year that includes additional spending for the state’s universal child care program, as well as funding to compensate for decreased federal dollars.
“The recurring, very expensive new investments will be very challenging,” Small told Source. “This is the final year of the administration. In a lot of ways, we are and should be focused on finishing things out, as opposed to starting brand new initiatives.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

(Photo by Janine L, Weisman/Rhode Island Current)South Carolina lawmakers and utility executives have been grappling with how to meet the state’s growing power needs. But the state has been slow to make use of federal programs that aid the energy crunch from another direction — by reducing the amount of power used.
That could change, pending final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy.
South Carolina’s Energy Office is expected to award the operator contract for a pair of consumer rebate programs by Jan. 14, according to a state procurement notice, nearly 3½ years after the passage of the Biden administration’s hallmark clean energy package that funded them.
How long it will take for the state’s $137 million share to go out after the contractor is chosen remains to be seen. The federal energy agency has left other states in limbo for months.
What the programs do
The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program reimburses up to $14,000 to low- and middle-income residents who install high-efficiency electric appliances in their homes.
Another program is available to homeowners of all income levels. The Home Efficiency Rebates program, dubbed HOMES, pays for home improvements. That could include insulating and sealing homes or installing smart thermostats that automatically reduce heating and cooling use during hours when no one is home.
While any homeowner can apply for HOMES, low-income families are allowed the biggest rebates. Caps range from $2,000 to $16,000, depending on applicants’ income and their project’s estimated energy savings.
Renters may be eligible for either program with written permission from the property owner, according to the state Energy Office.
And residents that meet income eligibility, earning no more than one and a half times the area median income for their county, can apply for funding under both programs. To qualify for appliance rebates in Richland County, for example, a household income can’t exceed $139,000. In Charleston County, the income cap is about $166,000. In Greenville County, it’s about $146,000.
South Carolina’s share of the federal funding package is to be split almost evenly between the two programs, according to a database maintained by Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C., climate policy research firm.
Where the programs stand
A handful of states had fully executed contracts and access to funding before President Joe Biden left office. Five states, including North Carolina and Georgia, as well as Washington, D.C., already have both programs in place, according to the database. Seven other states have at least one of the programs in operation.
North Carolina’s programs have been running since Jan. 16, 2025. Georgia started with a pilot program in November 2024 and began full operations in March 2025.
As of Dec. 2, 2025, Georgia had paid out $1.9 million total to 184 households under the appliance-rebate program. Its HOMES program had awarded 684 households a total of $7.1 million, according to the state’s online dashboard.
North Carolina is rolling its programs out one county at a time. As of June 13, the state had received more than 4,100 applications.
But the U.S. Department of Energy has slow-walked a review of Biden-era funding, leaving the remaining 36 states and five territories that applied wondering whether their share of funding will actually come.
South Carolina’s Energy Office started the application process near the end of September 2023, which included opting to participate. Nearly 1½ years later, in mid-January 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy gave the initial funding nod, but the state still had to come up with a plan for how to give those funds out and what to focus the spending on.
Five days later, President Donald Trump took office.
On day one, the president signed an executive order freezing clean energy-related funding in the previous administration’s massive energy and infrastructure laws. This threw the future of the two energy efficiency programs into question, alongside several other initiatives, including grants for solar programs that help low-income communities and funding to expand the availability of public electric vehicle chargers along the U.S. interstate system.
In early June, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told a U.S. House energy panel that his agency’s review was ongoing.
“By the end of this summer or middle of this summer, we are going to have clarity on most of the big projects,” Wright said.
But where the energy efficiency rebates fit into that review is unclear, and nothing appears to have changed since that hearing.
South Carolina joined the queue near the end of July, submitting its plan for final approval.
While the Energy Office is prepared to select a contractor, it too will remain on hold until federal sign-offs resume.
Other programs
As for those other energy-related programs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in August it was terminating a $124 million Solar For All grant won by South Carolina’s Office of Resilience. While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.
The state Office of Resilience was still in its first year of planning when the funding was pulled, so the agency had yet to work out details for spending the grant.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pointed to a provision in Republican’s “One, Big, Beautiful” spending package repealing the fund that housed the money.
​“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program, or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.
The provision applied only to “unobligated” funds, however, and the states suing to hold on to the money argue the environmental agency had awarded all $7 billion of the program’s grant money.
SC can restart electric vehicle charging program after federal funding restored

Court battles also took place earlier in 2025 over electric vehicle charging funds.
The Federal Highway Administration stopped sending out dollars for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, known as NEVI, in February.
Twenty states, the District of Columbia and half a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the paused funding. The money remained on ice until a federal judge, in June, ordered the freeze be lifted.
In August, the highway agency sent notices out to states, letting them know they could reapply.
The agency has since approved South Carolina’s new application.
The state is eligible for about $70 million and will start looking for contractors to build charging stations sometime in 2026, according to the state’s transportation department.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electrician-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

A celebration of Didier on Dec. 31 in Cadours before his ashes were laid to rest alongside his mother and grandparents in Villefranche. Vermont friends are invited to send remembrances of Didier, to be translated and shared with his family, to nwelch@uvm.edu.

Long-time Burlington photographer Didier Delmas died Dec. 22 in Cadours, France, from complications of von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. He was 71.
Born in Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Didier briefly studied architecture in Toulouse before leaving school to pursue his dreams in photography. Self-trained, he first worked as an archeological photographer for Toulouse’s Musée Saint-Raymond before opening his first studio, focusing on hard-to-photograph metal and glass. His early fine arts photographs are in the permanent collections at the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, and the Galerie Le Château d’Eau, Toulouse.
During summer visits to the U.S., Didier photographed campus life for Middlebury’s French School. When in 1983 he was awarded a photography contract for the “Joy of Gardening” cookbook, he settled first at Shelburne Farms and then in Burlington. For nearly 20 years he excelled in advertising and catalog photography. His fine arts giclée prints were sold through Frog Hollow and elsewhere.
Retiring from photography in 2001, Didier pursued a second dream of studying philosophy. After completing a bachelor’s in Cinema Studies at Burlington College, he went on to earn a master’s and a doctorate at McGill University, specializing in 17th-century visual culture.
Didier is survived by his father, Bernard Delmas, his sisters Marilyne (Roger) Nègro and Christine Delmas and their children, all of southwest France, as well as by his ex-wives, Gretchen Amussen of Paris and Nancy Welch of Hanover, New Hampshire. His death is also mourned by the many Vermont friends who affectionately called him “Chef Didier” and remember him as a gifted chef and generous host.

Brockport, N.Y.
Died Dec. 16, 2025
Putney, Vermont
Details of services
A memorial celebration is being planned for April 4th in Southern Vermont.

Kai George, 83, died peacefully in her home in Putney on Dec. 16, 2025 with her family by her side.
Kai’s achievements and rich experiences could fill a book. We will share some of those here, but as anyone who met her recognized, the qualities that made Kai so special were her love of life, her generous spirit, and her desire to connect with everyone she met, from young children to elders. 
Over the last 24 months, as a glioblastoma brain tumor gradually took away her ability to do many of the things she had enjoyed throughout her life, she delighted in time shared with friends and family. Those who knew her from earlier times saw a person who combined these qualities with remarkable abilities ranging from cooking, gardening, singing, playing guitar and piano, knitting, and much more–all of which she seemed to do effortlessly. Although she was prodigiously talented, she was exceedingly humble — always showing much more interest in the lives of her friends and family than her own notable achievements.
Kai was born Karen Jean Lowen in Brockport, N.Y. on July 30, 1942, the first child of Rev. M. DeForest “Dee” Lowen and Thelma Orchidea (Johnson) Lowen. Her immigrant “Mormor,” four aunts, and two cousins created a warm community around her, celebrating Swedish holidays with joy and devotion.
Kai lived in Utica, N.Y. during her elementary school years. In eighth grade her family moved to Ridgewood, N.J. and she graduated from Ridgewood High School in 1960. She attended Earlham College for two years before marrying Malcolm “Mac” George on June 30, 1962 in her father’s American Baptist church in Ridgewood. The newlyweds moved to San Francisco where Mac began his architectural career and Kai attended San Francisco State University, receiving a B.A. in elementary education. 
Kai began her career teaching elementary school in the turbulent 1960s in Berkeley, California. In her first teaching job out of school, Kai supported her Black students as they faced protesters opposed to busing laws that brought them to her school. Kai took time away from teaching when her first child, Randy, was born in 1969. The young family traveled in Europe for several months in 1971.
After their second child, Kirstin, was born, Kai and Mac left the San Francisco Bay Area and city life to begin a new chapter in rural Midcoast Maine in 1973. It was there in the town of Montville that Kai and Mac put down roots and lived for the next 36 years. Kai formed some of her deepest, most enduring friendships there.
She gracefully integrated being a devoted mom with building a house in the woods, growing a significant portion of her family’s food, and becoming an integral part of the Waldo County community. Soon Kai found herself going back to teaching, first as a childbirth educator (which she did for nearly 20 years), then as the director of the local Adult Basic Education program. In 1981 she returned to teaching elementary school full-time. 
In 1989 Kai created the Multi-Aged Integrated Learning Environment (MILE) program at Walker Elementary School in Liberty, Maine. Beginning with MILE One for 5-8 year olds and soon extending to MILE Two for 8-11 year olds, this pioneering initiative was centered around Kai’s deep belief in meeting every student where they were, regardless of their age, and building holistic learning communities that explored exciting themes (e.g., Maine animals) while learning the traditional subjects.
She was widely recognized for her excellence as an educator and had the pleasure of teaching many children whose parents knew Kai as their childbirth teacher and in some cases as their first grade teacher! In 1996, Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science Education. She was flown to the White House to receive this honor from Hillary Clinton.
When the first of Kai’s four grandchildren was born in 2004, she retired from teaching and became a devoted and delighted grandparent. When her twin grandchildren were born in India in 2014, she travelled there for two months to help care for the babies. She shared her love of the natural world with all of her grandchildren. Kai took her “barn barns” on many adventures including hiking, canoeing, camping, attending circus yoga camps, and much more. All four of this next generation considered their Farmor/Mormor to be like a third parent and friend. 
Kai moved from Maine to Putney, Vermont in September of 2009, following Mac’s death that spring. In her new community, Kai developed many close friendships. She was a tutor and nature educator at the Putney Central School, worked shifts at the Community Center food shelf, was on the board of the Putney Mountain Association, sang in the River Singers Chorus, and won the award for most classes attended in one month at the local yoga studio. She enjoyed sharing her love of vegetable gardening with her neighbors at Putney Commons and created beautiful flower gardens there.
Throughout Kai’s life, she made time to travel overseas, often with friends and sometimes as a volunteer. She also prioritized immersing herself in wild places with Mac and other friends: up mountain trails, on pristine lakes, and along the coast of Maine. Knitting and sewing for loved ones was a source of great pleasure, as was making nourishing, delicious food. She was well known for her ability to host guests in her beauty-filled homes while simultaneously, and seemingly without effort, cooking a fabulous meal. 
Kai accepted her terminal diagnosis with equanimity and without fear or regret. Instead, she continued to express wonder and appreciation for the natural world and her loved ones. Toward the end of her life, as Kai began to need more assistance, this supreme giver was finally able to receive care from dozens of friends and family near and far, new and old. Local friends visited and assisted her daily. Maine friends whom she’d known for 50 years came to stay with her every few weeks over these last two years
 Kai left this world with the same grace with which she lived her life. Even in her final days, Kai never lost her infectious smile and love for everyone. She lives on as an inspiration to all who knew and loved her.
Kai is survived by son Randy George and daughter in law Eliza Cain of Moretown, Vermont; daughter Kirstin Edelglass and son in law William Edelglass of Marlboro, Vermont; granddaughters Maia George of Burlington, Vermont and Solveig George of Beverly, Massachusetts; grandchildren Jasmine and Sarah Edelglass of Marlboro, Vermont; brother Neal Lowen of Oakland, California; and many cousins, nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by father M. DeForest Lowen, mother Thelma Lowen, husband Mac George and brother Eric Lowen.
 For those wishing to make a donation in Kai’s name, her family suggests these two organizations for which she volunteered: the Putney Mountain Association or the Community Asylum Seekers Project.

He did it with his strong right arm. He did it with his legs. He did it with courage and with uncommon flair.,"NEW ORLEANS — Trinidad Chambliss continues to write one of the most fascinating stories in college football history. If this wasn’t football, you’d call it a fairy tale. All that’s missing are magic beans and silver slippers.
Here Thursday night at the jam-packed Superdome, one of the world’s most famous sports venues, Chambliss willed the Ole Miss Rebels to a scintillating 39-34 Sugar Bowl victory over the proud Georgia Bulldogs. He did it with his strong right arm. He did it with his legs. He did it with courage and with uncommon flair.
Rick Cleveland
Last season Chambliss was doing it at Division II Ferris State in Michigan, where he won a national championship. This year, he’s doing it on the biggest stage in college football, where he is now two steps from winning another much, much bigger trophy.
Chambliss threw for 362 yards and two touchdowns, often darting away from some the biggest, strongest, red-shirted human beings you will ever see. At one point he completed a Sugar Bowl-record 13 passes in a row. He made plays when there didn’t seem a play to be made. Sometimes, it seemed like magic. And after all that he might have led the loudest Hotty Toddy in history. “Are you ready?” he hollered into the microphone after being awarded the MVP trophy. About 40,000 Ole Miss fans, most dressed in powder blue, thundered the rest. 
Said Georgia coach Kirby Smart, accurately, “Their quarterback is just incredible. I mean, he does an unbelievable job of not giving up sacks and making plays with his legs. They made more plays than we did; and I’ve got to be honest, that’s part of football. They out-executed us, out-coached us, out-played us.”

“I’m speechless,” Chambliss would later say in the post-game press conference. “We were down 9 points at one point, and they were down 9 points when we played them before, so it was kind of like roles reversed. I didn’t play my best football in the fourth quarter when we played them before, so I wanted to redeem myself.”
Mission accomplished – and then some.
Georgia, winner of two national championships this decade, had won 53 straight games when leading at halftime. The Bulldogs led Ole Miss 21-12 at intermission, only to be outscored 27-13 over the last 30 minutes. Every time Ole Miss needed a big play – and those times were many – Chambliss stepped up and made it. Georgia had won and amazing 75 straight games when leading going into the fourth quarter. Not this time.

Make no mistake: Rebel heroes were many this night:

Mississippians Will Echoles (the defensive MVP) of Houston, Suntarine Perkins of Raleigh and Zxavian Harris of Canton keyed a defensive effort that made just enough stops to seal the victory. 
Running back Kewan Lacy, as good as any back in the country, ran for 98 bruising yards and two touchdowns.
Wide receiver Harrison Wallace III snagged nine passes for 156 yards and a touchdown, while teammate Deshaun Stribling caught seven more throws for 122 yards. There may be a college team that has as many high-quality wide receivers as Ole Miss, but these eyes haven’t seen it.
And, heavens, let us not forget placekicker Lucas Carneiro, the transfer from Western Kentucky, who launched Sugar Bowl record-breaking field goals of 55 and 56 yards in the first quarter and then hit the game-winning field goal of 47 yards with six seconds remaining. All three kicks would have been good from 60 yards or more. Ole Miss would not have won without him.

This observer had thought Ole Miss would have to win the turnover battle and/or make a big play in the kicking game in order to slay Georgia. That wasn’t the case. Georgia got the game’s only turnover, a 47-yard scoop-and-score fumble return by Dylan Everette in the second quarter. The Bulldogs also made a huge kicking game play in the third quarter, faking a punt to extend a drive that led to a third quarter field goal and a 24-19 Georgia lead. It was pretty much all Rebels after that.
Ole Miss dominated statistically, out-gaining the Bulldogs 473-343. Take away that scoop-and-score and the Rebels would have won more comfortably. 
“Pete! Pete! Pete!” Rebel fans thundered when the Rebels’ new head coach Pete Golding was called to the podium in the post-game awards ceremony. Later, Golding credited the crowd.
“The fans, you know, it felt like a home game to me, looking up and hearing them,” Golding said. “And then for these guys to play the way and to be able to come back the way they did versus a team like that. … They (the Rebels) are never scared and they don’t panic, and that’s what I love about this group.”
Said Smart: “It felt like we were on the road.”
So now, Ole Miss moves on to play Miami at Tempe, Arizona, in the Fiesta Bowl and the national semifinals on Jan. 8. Indiana plays Oregon in the Peach Bowl, the other semifinal, the next night. Winners of those two games will play for the national championship Jan. 19 in Miami Gardens, Florida.
Could the Ole Miss Rebels win it all? 
I’d answer that with this: Would that be any more unbelievable than a transfer from Ferris State beating the Georgia Bulldogs with one of the greatest performances in Sugar Bowl history?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232241/AP26002189253468.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:56:32.642202

Consumers will have to pay a 1.5% fee on all products with an embedded battery as the result of a new law aiming to curb risk of battery fires. 


Starting January 1, Californians will pay a new fee every time they buy a product with a non-removable battery – whether it’s a power tool, a PlayStation, or even a singing greeting card.
The 1.5% surcharge, capped at $15, expands a recycling program that’s been quietly collecting old computer monitors and TVs for two decades. The change is a result of Senate Bill 1215, authored by former state Sen. Josh Newman, a Democrat who represented parts of Los Angeles and San Bernardino. It was signed into law in 2022. 
Consumers will pay the fee when buying any product with an embedded battery whether it’s rechargeable or not. Many of these products, experts said, end up in the trash. In its most recent analysis, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery estimates about 7,300 tons of batteries go to landfills illegally or by accident.  
California pioneered electronic waste fees with computer monitors and TVs in 2003. The fee worked, keeping hazardous screens out of landfills and building better systems for proper disposal. But over the last 20 years, electronic waste has continued to evolve.  
Powerful lithium batteries have become cheaper and more accessible as demand for technology has increased. They now power everyday products, from cellphones and AirPods to power tools and toys. 
“These things are everywhere. They’re ubiquitous,” said Joe La Mariana, executive director of RethinkWaste, which manages waste services for 12 San Mateo County cities – a co-sponsor of the legislation. 
They’re also, under some circumstances, a risk. Under harsh conditions at recycling and waste facilities, lithium-ion batteries can burst into flames and even explode.
“Paying a small check‑stand fee to fund proper collection is far cheaper than million‑dollar fires, higher insurance premiums, and rate hikes passed back to communities,” said Doug Kobold, executive director of the California Product Stewardship Council, which co-sponsored the legislation. 
A growing problem 
In 2016, in the San Mateo County city of San Carlos, a lithium-ion battery sparked a major fire at the Shoreway Environmental Center recycling facility. It caused a four-month plant shutdown and $8.5 million in damage. RethinkWaste, a regional waste management agency, oversees that facility. As a result of the fire, its insurance premium rose from $180,000 to $3.2 million annually, La Mariana said; ratepayers ultimately bore that cost. 
That fire catalyzed the waste management agency to seek solutions to the growing battery fire problem. 
“Being a publicly owned facility, every bit of that property is owned and paid for by our 430,000 ratepayers,” La Mariana said. “So we have a fiduciary responsibility to maintain the integrity of these assets. But also, on a human level, we have a very high responsibility for the safety of our colleagues and our co-workers.” 
Battery fires in waste and recycling facilities are an everyday hazard. Experts say they’re  underreported, likely because facilities fear oversight or increases in insurance premiums. 
And batteries can catch fire anywhere. Earlier this year, two girls were hospitalized after an electric scooter caught fire in a Los Angeles apartment building. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are nearly two battery fires on U.S. flights every week. 
Clean energy shift brings battery hazards
The fee consumers will pay in the new year is just one piece of the state’s evolving response to the emerging risk of lithium-ion batteries. 
Single-use plastic vapes are exempt from the new law because the Department of Toxic Substances Control raised concerns about collection and recycling systems handling nicotine, a hazardous substance, said Nick Lapis, an advocate with Californians Against Waste, which co-sponsored the legislation. They’re also the fastest growing source of lithium-ion battery waste.  
“If you imagine somebody’s a pack a day smoker, that means every single day they’re throwing out a device with a lithium-ion battery,” Lapis said. 
Last year,  assemblymembers Jacqui Irwin and Lori Wilson introduced Assembly Bill 762, a law that would ban single-use plastic vapes entirely. Lapis says he expects the Legislature to address the risk of vapes this year. 
Large-scale lithium-ion batteries present great danger of a different kind.
During the Los Angeles fires, dangerous lithium-ion batteries, including from electric vehicles, were left behind — resulting in a major cleanup operation by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
And almost a year ago, a fire burned at a battery storage site in Moss Landing for two days, requiring more than 1,000 people to be evacuated. Monterey County neighbors to the facility have complained of feeling sick since the fire, and a recent study detected toxic metals in nearby marshes. 
In 2024, Newsom established a collaborative of state agencies, including the California Air Resources Board and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, to look into safety solutions for battery storage technologies. New CalFire regulations for battery storage systems will take effect this year.  
Finding ways to properly dispose of batteries and their lithium in the waste stream is critical as the state transitions away from fossil fuels, said Meg Slattery, a scientist for Earthjustice.

A recent report found that with many fines and fees borne by poor people, about 42% are not paying what they've been assessed. The report recommended lowering fines and fees as a way of improving overall revenue collection. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A recent report found that reducing the size of fines and fees increases the likelihood of collecting more revenue, and that imposing a “collections fee” to compel people to pay increases their debt burden.
The report from the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, published in October, draws on five years of research into fines and fees imposed in the court system within Jefferson County, which includes Birmingham. It could have major salience in a state where governments rely heavily on fines and fees for revenue.
“The way that fines and fees are set up right now, you are not done with your sentence until you have finished paying,” said Leah Nelson, co-founder and co-principal investigator on the project and  a senior research associate at the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama. “Meaning, based on our findings, that almost no one actually finishes. The most common outcome is not finishing.”

While the research was only isolated to one county, the process for collecting court debt is nearly identical for all counties throughout Alabama, even though the amount of charge and offense the fine is tied to may be different.
Fines and fees are typically imposed when a person is found guilty by a court, which then levies a predetermined set of assessments based on the type of severity of the offense. Restitution may also be ordered for the victim to experience a financial loss.
Once the court receives payment, the money is then disbursed according to the priorities set by state law.
Fines and fees occupy two spheres, according to Nelson, as both a tool of criminal justice and a way of funding the courts.
“Certainly, it is a sanction, it is a penalty to penalize them for what they did wrong,” she said. “Is it intended as a deterrent? Probably. We all know we are going to get a fine if we speed and get caught. But then it is also a public finance tool, which is a completely different set of values.”
The report said fines and fees are problematic revenue generators because a substantial part of the population is unable to make their payments.
“In terms of overall payment trends, 42% of people pay nothing toward their fines and fees, with only 16% of people determined to be indigent paying off their full debt, compared with 50% of those who were not found to be indigent,” the report states.
The report also found that the balance for defendants increases over time, going from a cumulative median balance of about $1,200 when people are first assessed to a median balance of more than $1,500 about five years later. The top quartile in the sample had a balance of about $1,800, according to a graphic in the report, which then increased to almost $3,500.
The report did not include a breakdown for income for this specific analysis, but the median income of the census tracts demographics of the sample of people included in the report is about $44,000.
Increases in the balance are likely the result of a 30% collection fee that is imposed on outstanding court debt in addition to what is already owed. If someone has an outstanding balance of $1,000, the total increases to $1,300.
About two-thirds of the people who owed fines and fees in the sample are Black, according to the report.  Blacks on average initially owed $1,300 while whites owed $1,150. The cumulative balance for fines and fees for Blacks was more than $1,800 while whites had a cumulative balance, on average, of about $1,500.
“It is so complicated because I think it is reasonable to rule out the idea that judges are, on an individual basis, making decisions that are affected by the race of the defendant,” Nelson said. “The reason I say that is because these fines and fees happen, pretty much, by default.”
One reason that could explain why Blacks face a greater burden is they are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system.
In terms of offenses involving drugs, the initial fine is $1,000 but each subsequent fine is $2,500.
“We also know that Black people are policed differently than white people, and particularly around drug possession, we see pretty significant disparities in arrest rates even though we know that, generally, Black people and white people use drugs at about the same rates,” Nelson said. “You should see equal distribution by population of arrests for that crime because the crime is committed by both races at about the same rate. But we see more Black people more likely to be arrested for unauthorized possession.”
The report documents other problems that may arise because of unpaid court debts.
People could avoid going to court because of fears pertaining to fines and fees. People who owe fines and fees are also less likely to engage with law enforcement because of the potential consequences they face stemming from unpaid court debt.
“People don’t know what will happen,” Nelson said. “It could be that an officer could tell them to go to the courthouse and pay it, or it could be that the officer arrests them, depending on the jurisdiction.”
The fears can even reach into health care.
“I talked with people who avoided going to the hospital because there is a fear, a myth, that the hospital might run their name, and see that they owe money to the court, and call the police and get them arrested,” Nelson said. “People avoid situations where their names are put on a computer. That is every public amenity.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NorthportCourt_McLelland10854-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:11:55.297007

(Photo: KGHM Polska Meidz)Gold had a stupendous 2025, the price of an ounce reaching $3,000 for the first time in March, and then topping $4,000 in October. It closed 2025 at more than $4,300 an ounce, 66% higher than the price at the start of the year.
To which silver could have said “hold my beer.”
Silver started the year at around $30 an ounce. It ended on Dec. 31 at a little over $70 — a 144% increase.
Silver doesn’t get near the attention gold does, not even in the Silver State. In debates over Nevada mining taxes over the years, the focus has been on the value of gold, with silver warranting a mention, if at all, as an also-ran.
That’s for good reason. 
When the Nevada Department of Taxation reports mining tax revenues for the Silver State’s primary mining tax, silver isn’t even reported separately. Instead, the value of silver, a byproduct of mining gold, copper, and other minerals, is unceremoniously lumped into total “Gold/Silver” production revenues. 
According to Taxation’s 2024 report, $9.08 billion of “Gold/Silver” was mined in Nevada in 2024.
Roughly 5.7 million ounces of silver were mined in Nevada in 2024, according to the Nevada Division of Minerals. At the annual average price that year of a little less than $30 an ounce, that would amount to around $162 million worth of silver.
Which would mean the value of gold mined in Nevada in 2024 was more than $8.9 billion, 55 times as much as the value of silver.
‘Next generation metal’ though
The skyrocketing price of precious metals over the last year has been attributed in large part to investors worldwide seeking shelter amid global economic volatility and uncertainty, coupled with the declining value of the world’s dominant currency, the U.S. dollar, which dropped by 10% in 2025.
Especially late in the year, some analysts were also describing the rising price of gold and silver as a “momentum trade,” a corollary of FOMO (fear of missing out), in which investors chase after whatever stock or commodity is going up in a flashy way.
But a number of other — and more silver-specific — factors also contributed to the price of silver outpacing gold (as well as the stock prices for Nvidia and the techs) in 2025. In addition to being a precious metal that investors might turn to in volatile times, silver, unlike gold, has, as the cryptocurrency investors might say, multiple “use cases.”
Gold is shiny. But silver has the highest electrical conductivity of any metal.
“Silver is poised to play a pivotal ‘next generation metal’ role across industries critical to the green energy transition and digital transformation over the coming decade,” reads a December report on the mineral’s key industrial applications commissioned by the Silver Institute, a global industry association. 
Silver “enhances energy conversion in solar panels; accelerates data processing in data centers; and enables rapid charging and efficient power transmission in electric vehicles,” the report says.
While the Trump administration may not share the Silver Institute’s enthusiasm for solar power and EV’s, it’s all-in on data centers and the AI hyperscaling for which they stand, and has acknowledged silver has a value beyond merely looking pretty.
The U.S. Geological Survey in November added silver, along with copper, to the official list of “critical minerals,” potentially meaning tariff and federal investment and regulatory policies that would be favorable to U.S. silver producers.
Silver’s status as more than just another shiny object was also underscored in October when China, the world’s second-leading source of silver behind Mexico (the U.S. ranks 9th), announced new restrictions on silver exports, set to take effect with the new year. “This is not good,” Elon Musk wrote on his social media site earlier this week. “Silver is needed in many industrial processes.”
“Good” depends on one’s perspective. Higher metal prices benefit companies with silver-yielding mines.
Musk’s concern notwithstanding, many analysts project the price of silver will continue to rise in 2026, for a lot of the same reasons that drove precious metal prices to shoot up in 2025.
And as the Nevada Mining Association puts it in a blurb on its website, “When performance is more important than price, silver is often the material of choice.”
Continued rising prices of silver and other precious metals is by no means a sure thing. Of all commodity prices, minerals are infamously among the most volatile.
Meanwhile, even if silver has entered a new normal, and the price continues to soar upward, easily and by far the most valuable mineral in the Silver State will still be gold.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/kghm-silver-bars-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:11:55.297007

(Photo courtesy of IndeDocs)The 2026 calendar year marks the final year before the full effect of Act 20 of 2023 — the Certificate of Need repeal — will be felt in South Carolina’s health ecosystem.
This law will unleash competitive forces in the marketplace and reshape how care is delivered across our state.
But the job is not finished. One critical omission remains: The General Assembly has yet to address employment non-compete agreements imposed on physicians.
When a physician is prevented from continuing to practice in the community they serve, patients don’t get to vote on that decision. The continuity of medical care — something every clinician is trained to protect — can be severed by an administrative clause about which patients don’t even know.
In medicine, the real consequence lands on patients.
In other industries, non-competes may protect trade secrets or competitive advantage. In health care, they restrict something far more personal: the relationship between a patient and the doctor they trust.
A non-compete doesn’t just tell a doctor where they can work. It dictates whether their family must move and whether they can continue providing care in the very community they may have served for years.
In rural areas — where access to care is already stretched thin — the effects are amplified.
One restrictive contract can leave thousands without timely access to a primary care doctor, surgeon, or specialist. Non-competes give employers control of the labor force and take that control away from the communities that depend on those physicians.
Non-compete clauses for physicians are ethically objectionable because they subordinate the physician’s duty to patients to the employer’s business interests.
They treat the doctor–patient relationship as if patients were assets of the hospital rather than autonomous people, which is inconsistent with the special moral status of medical care.
Physicians are fiduciaries, expected to put patient welfare ahead of financial or institutional interests. A non-compete imposed as a condition of employment creates a built-in conflict between that duty and an employer’s interest in protecting market share, making a physician’s ability to continue caring for patients dependent on corporate permission rather than clinical judgment or patient choice.
Non-compete clauses also strip patients of meaningful choice and continuity of care.
When a physician leaves an employer, these provisions can force the doctor to relocate or stop practicing locally, abruptly severing long-standing relationships and compelling patients to transfer care regardless of trust or preference.
Patients are never parties to these contracts, yet they bear the consequences when a trusted physician disappears from their community. Any agreement that makes it harder for physicians to meet their duty of non-abandonment places contractual obligations above professional ethics — a reversal that should give policymakers pause.
Unlike states that have taken legislative action, South Carolina’s approach to non-competes is governed almost entirely by case law.
On paper that means contracts must be “reasonable.” In practice, it leaves individual physicians to challenge large systems on their own — something few are willing or able to do.
Most doctors will not risk becoming a test case, fearing retaliation or years of costly litigation.
The result is predictable: non-competes go largely unchallenged, even as their use expands.
Some South Carolina health systems use non-competes; others do not. National systems that operate in states where non-competes are restricted or prohibited function perfectly well without them, demonstrating these clauses are not essential to stable hospital operations.
Recent scrutiny of non-compete clauses has highlighted a broader gap: oversight reaches only certain entities. In a state like ours — where nonprofit systems dominate — outside enforcement often ends just as the impact on patients begins.
A patient doesn’t feel the difference between a for-profit and nonprofit employer when their doctor is suddenly forced to stop practicing in their community.
What they feel is loss, disruption, and too often the burden of starting over with a doctor assigned to take over their care.
Consider this: Lawyers are prohibited from blanket non-competes, and many lawmakers are attorneys themselves. Patients lose access to their doctors, and physicians lose the ability to practice freely in the communities that need them.
Health care is not a commodity; patients are not assets and doctors are not indentured servants.
South Carolinians deserve a system built around their right to choose who cares for them. If we want a stronger, healthier future for our state, removing non-competes as a condition of employment in medicine is one of the most impactful steps our Legislature can take — for patients, for physicians, and for every community that relies on us.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hochman-feature-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 08:11:55.297007

This isn’t old news. Nor are the solutions that lawmakers like state Rep. LaKeySha Bosley, a St. Louis Democrat, continue to propose in the hopes of finally getting more people to pay attention.
The numbers should raise alarms for Missouriians in every corner of the state, Bosley said.
“I can only imagine how fearful I’d be to have a child in this state knowing what I know statistically. And I know that is very true for other women who are not just in the urban areas but are in rural communities that don’t have access to a hospital within 20-plus miles, or even an urgent care, or anything,” Bosley said. “And that right there is where we should be putting a lot of our focus.”
Bosley, who is entering her eighth and final legislative session in the Missouri House, said she hopes to finally push through legislation that better addresses the state’s birth outcomes. She is among the only lawmakers so far to pre-file multiple legislative fixes to better study and prevent infant and maternal deaths. 
“We are a state that claims to love our children and want to put our children in the best outcomes to succeed in life,” Bosley said. “And the only way that I know how to do that is to start at the beginning.”
State Rep. LaKeySha Bosley, D-St. Louis, raises her hand to ask a question during the House Elections Committee hearing in September 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
On average, 70 women die each year in Missouri during childbirth or in the first year postpartum. Of those deaths, 80% are deemed preventable. Cardiovascular disease and mental health conditions were among the main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in the state.  
Missouri’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review board dissects the causes of death in each case, aiming to identify preventable situations. 
Bosley is hoping to pass legislation that would establish a similar board to track and study infant deaths in the state, as well as fund grief counseling for family members who lost a child during childbirth or shortly after. The same bill would also expand the maternal mortality board to also study and address the socioeconomic and environmental outcomes, including global warming, on pregnancy outcomes. 
While the state’s infant mortality rate improved slightly from 2022 to the latest 2023 data, 441 babies still died before they turned 1 year old in Missouri in 2023, putting the state 33rd in the nation for infant deaths. Black infants are dying at twice the rate of white infants. The leading causes of death for infants in Missouri were birth defects, preterm birth, sudden unexpected infant death and accidents, according to a recent report from the March of Dimes. 
“The problem here is not only is this a lack of access issue, this is also a social economic issue,” Bosley said. “Most women who live in very poor communities in rural Missouri and also women of color typically have greater health risk and lower health outcomes. That goes back to systemic bias at how the health care system came to be.” 
State Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, who is also pushing for the expansion of doula services, is hoping to further expand the state’s maternal mortality review board to include more diverse statewide representation. Her legislation would also add data on prenatal and postnatal health care access to the data collected by the board.
“We gotta do something,” Washington said. “ … People that English isn’t their first language and women of color, and women who are poor, especially Medicaid recipients, they’re not treated with the same level of respect. I’m not sure if any woman is, to be honest.”
State Sen. Barbara Washington, D-Kansas City, speaks during a legislative hearing in January 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Not long ago in Missouri, women on Medicaid were seven times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than women on private insurance, according to a report by the state’s Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review studying deaths from 2017 to 2021. Black mothers in that time frame were 2.5 times more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than white mothers. 
These outcomes prompted lawmakers to expand Medicaid coverage for new mothers from 60 days to one year postpartum.
One of Bosley’s bills seeks to include coverage for doula services for up to one year through the state’s Medicaid program, called MO HealthNet.
Doulas — who offer support for families during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum, but do not deliver babies — have been lifted up as one solution to improving maternal and infant health outcomes, especially among low-income families and families of color.
Last year, in an effort to address this, the state issued an emergency rule allowing doulas to be reimbursed through Medicaid. That rule has since expired.
Bosley also reintroduced a bill seeking to create the “Missouri Dignity in Pregnancy and Childbirth Act,” which would establish an evidence-based implicit bias program for perinatal health providers at all Missouri hospitals. 
“I don’t think we’ll ever get rid of bias, unfortunately, but we can at least have a conversation so people can start to be conscious about certain thoughts,” she said. 
She made note of a recent case in Indiana where a Black woman in active labor was turned away from a hospital and gave birth a short time later in a truck. She also noted the recent charges against a Virginia nurse accused of intentionally injuring at least one baby in the NICU.
“This is not something in the 1800s when we didn’t have technology that we have now,” Bosley said. “These are real-life stories that are happening in the 21st century.”
Another bill would make childbirth classes free for expectant mothers enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program.
Undocumented mothers in Missouri navigate pregnancy, postpartum as ICE threats loom

Rose Anderson-Rice, CEO of Generate Health, a St. Louis nonprofit that works to create more equitable maternal and infant health outcomes, particularly for families of color, said legislative fixes such as expandingMedicaid eligibility can be really impactful. 
She hopes to see lawmakers and community leaders focus on growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce, invest in addressing social determinants of health, fund community-based organizations that work with moms and babies, and improve access to maternal health care for families who are both underserved and under-represented. 
Anderson-Rice pays particular attention to the state’s infant mortality rates, thinking of the classrooms full of children lost, whose futures — perhaps as doctors, athletes, parents — will never be realized.
“Public health professionals often liken infant mortality to the canary in the coal mine- it’s an indicator on the health of the community,” she said. “This is not about politics; it’s about responsibility. If we want a healthy Missouri, we need to fix this now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/obstetric-services.jpg,,,2026-01-02 07:12:01.988053

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Stricter cellphone bans, more focus on STEM and increased school “efficiency” are shaping up as some of the highest-priority education debates Indiana lawmakers will tackle during a fast 2026 legislative session that starts back up next week.
The session will be shorter than usual — ending by late February — after legislators already convened for two weeks in December on redistricting. Senate bills must be filed by Jan. 9, and House bills by Jan. 14.
Multiple education bills have already moved, and one — a cellphone crackdown proposal — was heard in the Senate education committee in early December. Caucus leaders in the Republican-dominated General Assembly won’t formally roll out their priority agendas until next week, however.
At an annual legislative conference hosted last month in Indianapolis, lawmakers and Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner previewed a crowded policy landscape shaped by academic recovery concerns, declining enrollment, student disengagement and growing unease about children’s use of technology.
Cellphones in classrooms — and beyond
One of the most visible education debates of the coming session is already underway: whether Indiana should expand restrictions on student cellphone use to cover the entire school day.
Under current law — approved by lawmakers in 2024 — schools must prohibit cellphone use during instructional time unless a teacher permits it for academic purposes. Senate Bill 78 would go further, requiring public schools to ban cellphone use “from bell to bell,” including during lunch and passing periods, with limited exceptions.
‘Away for the day’: Indiana lawmakers take up bill expanding cellphone ban to entire school day

The bill already received public testimony in the Senate Education Committee in December and was authored by committee chairman Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond. Raatz said the committee is likely to vote on the measure early this month.
Supporters argue the change would reduce distractions and improve student focus and mental health. Opponents — including some parents and students — have raised concerns about safety, emergencies and local control.
Jenner signaled broader alarm about technology’s impact on children, calling for a statewide conversation that extends beyond classrooms.
“I cannot tell you how much it is impacting our children,” Jenner said. “We are seeing seven- and eight-year-old[s] with social media accounts. We are seeing nine-year-old[s] on anxiety medicine because they’re obsessed with the number of likes and the comments.”
House Education Committee Chair Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, said lawmakers are also exploring ways to regulate social media platforms themselves, particularly the algorithms that keep children engaged.
“We’re also … looking at some language that could potentially avoid litigation, but goes after the algorithms,” Behning said. “That’s what’s getting the endorphins … that impact their cognitive ability.”
More work on literacy
Lawmakers and education officials continue to tout Indiana’s recent gains in early literacy, driven by state investments in reading instruction and intervention. But Jenner said the work is far from finished — and may prompt additional statutory changes on top of major policies passed in the last two sessions.
“We’ve seen some great success in reading, but we have a lot more work to do,” Jenner said, noting that the state saw a 5% jump in reading proficiency. Current law requires schools with fewer than 70% of students reading proficiently to participate in a state literacy cadre program, which provides targeted, evidence-based instructional support for teachers.
“What we wanted to see is … should we adjust that percentage a bit, or should we do a rolling average of some sort,” Jenner said. She emphasized that any changes should avoid creating an unfunded mandate.
One persistent challenge, she added, is middle school literacy.
“The only needle that we have not moved in Indiana is middle school reading,” Jenner said, pointing to seventh- and eighth-grade outcomes as key concerns heading into 2026.
 Doubling down on STEM
Beyond literacy, lawmakers and state officials signaled a renewed push to strengthen math and STEM instruction — an area they acknowledged is lagging behind recent reading gains. STEM is shorthand for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
Behning said Indiana’s success with literacy initiatives could serve as a model for future investments in math, particularly early numeracy.
“We know that if we’re going to be successful in STEM, we have to be successful in math,” Behning said. He pointed to the state’s literacy cadre as an approach lawmakers could look to replicate in math classrooms.
Behning added that many educators were never trained in “foundational, explicit skills in math,” leaving schools struggling to improve outcomes without additional state support.
Funding equity and school operations
Education funding is also expected to remain a flashpoint, particularly for districts with weak property-tax bases. Rep. Ed DeLaney, an Indianapolis Democrat who sits on the House Education Committee, warned that public schools’ share of the state budget has declined over the past decade and urged greater state investment to support high-need districts.
“If we move money to them from the state,” he said, “that may free up some local property taxes.”
Indianapolis charter schools and parents look for help busing students

But legislators are also watching closely as Indianapolis leaders advance recommendations from the Indianapolis Local Education Alliance, which calls for a new authority to manage school facilities and transportation across traditional public, charter and innovation schools.
Supporters say the plan could reduce costs and allow school boards to focus more on classroom outcomes. Critics worry about local control and whether similar models could spread statewide.
“I think we’ll be able to learn some things and probably apply them more broadly in Indiana,” Jenner said, while stressing that conversations around consolidation and shared services look very different outside Indianapolis.
Rural lawmakers and education leaders, she added, are closely watching how urban proposals could influence policy elsewhere, particularly in counties facing population decline, long bus routes and limited resources.
Jenner cautioned legislators against using enrollment alone to drive decisions, however, instead urging them to weigh student outcomes and fiscal health when considering changes.
“I would challenge the General Assembly that those are the two elements, at the very least, that we need to understand statewide,” Jenner said.
 Other priorities rolling in
Education advocacy groups are also beginning to roll out their own legislative priorities, calling on lawmakers to address school funding, staffing and student supports.
The Indiana Coalition for Public Education has called for greater state investment in K-12 schools, more equitable funding for districts with limited property-tax bases, and caution against additional mandates without funding.
Meanwhile, the Indiana School Boards Association is urging lawmakers to focus on local flexibility, shared services, school safety and workforce-related learning, while reducing regulatory burdens on districts.
The Indiana State Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union, has not yet released its 2026 agenda.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.).  Photos by Ken Coleman and Kyle Davidson Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s first bid for the governor’s office in 2018 against Republican stalwart Bill Schuette reached record spending, outpacing the previous high in 2006 when Dick Devos’ mega billions gave then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm a literal run for her money.
But the money already spent in the 2026 gubernatorial race shows that it could be on pace to get close to the record-breaking fundraising totals seen in 2006, which saw nearly $80 million in spending, and 2018, which exceeded $90 million.
Year-end 2025 campaign finance reports aren’t due until the end of January, which will detail spending between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 while also wrapping up the contribution and spending totals for the previous year.
But the public campaign finance data available over two quarters of fundraising and spending, up until October, show that donors have given more than $25 million to Michigan’s gubernatorial primary candidates and the lone independent candidate, Mike Duggan, who is already playing like he’s in a general election. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That total is expected to rise sharply as the race moves forward because the race is wide open and would include Duggan, the outgoing mayor of Detroit, who has a penchant for attracting big money due to his strength in his successive mayoral elections.
Assuming the 2025 gubernatorial spending amount is at least doubled by the end of the August primary season, and keeps pace to triple that amount by November, it would come close to the 2006 and 2018 fundraising totals. The open nature of the race with likely three viable candidates on the ballot could signal another record-breaking year.
Of note, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the top Democrat in the primacy race, has attracted just as many wealthy donor dollars as Duggan and her main Republican rivals, creating a scenario where those same class of high-power donors could be playing all sides in the contest.
Here’s where each of the major candidates stand as the year wraps up, with a look at who has given the most to each of their campaigns.
Jocelyn Benson (D)
Benson is arguably the frontrunner in the Democratic side of the race, and her fundraising totals show why she’s earned that position. She raised $4.75 million up until October and spent just $1.76 million, ending the third quarter with $2.98 million cash on hand.
The state’s campaign finance reporting system, which has been plagued with issues due to systemic changes made in the latter half of Benson’s tenure as secretary of state, allows users to download spreadsheet information to see total contributions to a campaign thus far in a given election cycle — as long as those records contain less than 25,000 entries.
Michigan’s Benson has familial, professional ties to company pushing data center project in Saline

Benson has amassed so many donations that her full contribution analysis report isn’t available for download on the public facing site. That said, what is available shows Benson received large political action committee donations from the Michigan Laborers Political League, the Michigan Legacy PAC, End Citizens United, the Deldin Law PAC, United Food and Commercial Workers Active Ballot Club, Emily’s List Michigan, and the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters PAC. 
Those contributions ranged from $10,000 to $60,000, according to Michigan’s campaign finance system — which notes that the data is reliable but not guaranteed to be completely accurate.
Benson also received the maximum allowed individual contributions from Shadia Turfah, the president of PharmaScript of Michigan, philanthropist Kathy Brzoznowski, Nancy Tellem, the former president of XBox Entertainment Studios, public health advocate Debra Efroymson, Carolyn Cassin, president of Michigan Women Forward, and Lyna Lam, wife of the California tech billionaire Chris Larsen.
Also contributing the maximum individual amount is Stephen Ross, owner of Related Companies, the firm behind a controversial data center proposed in Washtenaw County. Benson’s husband is also a vice president at Related.
Garlin Gilchrist (D)
Gilchrist as the current lieutenant governor is vying to be the heir apparent to Whitmer’s administration. That’s a steep hill to climb: Michigan has a nearly 40-year history of lieutenant governors launching gubernatorial bids and falling short. 
Gilchrist calls Gaza, Palestine crisis a genocide at Arab convention, fundraising communications

The second-in-command of the Whitmer administration, however, has forged his own path in the race, being the first to make a public stance that the ongoing Israeli war in Gaza amounted to a genocide against Palestinians, and vowed to not take money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.
Gilchrist raised less than both Benson and Swanson, but he was still able to raise just under $1.13 million up until October, while spending $748,632 and with $378,457 on hand.
The majority of Gilchrist’s campaign contributions came from small dollar donors, but some of his top dollar donations in included max-dollar contributions from Tyrone Sanders, a government consultant with Obsidian Group, Mike Shehadi, the CEO of Pharamascript Inc., Nicole Hamp, a researcher at University of Michigan, and two political action committees — the Rooted in Community Leadership PAC, and the Collective PAC.
Chris Swanson (D)
The sheriff of Genesee County has less name recognition and top-level political experience than his opponents in Benson and Gilchrist, but he has kept up in fundraising, amassing $1.36 million up until October. He did, however, spend $975,997, leaving the campaign with $385,189 cash on hand.
His top donors include Antonio Pollicella, CEO of Team Wellness Center, Phil Hagerman, the CEO of Forum Health LLC, Ryan LaFontaine of LaFontaine Automotive, and Philp Shaltz of Shaltz Automotive, each giving him the maximum amount.
Mike Duggan (I)
The outgoing mayor of Detroit, a former Democrat, thus far has raised $4.38 million, spent more than $1.96 million and had $2.4 million cash on hand going into October.
Union battles at Detroit Medical Center may shadow Duggan’s 2026 bid for Michigan governor

Several news outlets have reported that a not insignificant chunk of his campaign cash has come from Republican donors, including former Michigan Republican Party Chair Ron Weiser, JC Huizenga, Jeff Sakwa and others.
Overall, the majority of Duggan’s contributors donated in the $5,000 (154 individual contributions) and $8,325 (141 individual contributions) categories, the latter being the maximum amount an individual can donate to a single campaign. Another 262 individual contributions came from the $500 range.
Among his top donors are the CEOs of various companies and organizations, like William Wild of the Midwest Independent Retailers Association, Marjory Epstein, the chair of Vesco Oil, Tricia Keith, the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, both the CEO and president of Belle Tire, several members of the Penske Corporation, and several members of the Detroit Pistons front office, including Eric Tellem, the team’s vice president of player personnel.
Each of those donors gave the maximum amount to Duggan’s campaign.
John James (R)
Michigan’s John James staffs up gubernatorial election team ahead of 2026 primary season

James bucked his party’s wishes to have him run for reelection in Congress, creating an open race for his seat and inserting himself in a crowded Republican gubernatorial primary. His campaign has positioned him as the frontrunner, and he has the campaign cash to justify some of that thinking despite criticism about him being absent in the race.
The congressman brought in $3.65 million and spent nearly $1.38 million, with more than $2.27 million cash on hand up until October.
Two members of the DeVos family, Pamela DeVos and Dan DeVos, are among his highest contributors, giving $5 million to Mission Michigan, an issues super PAC supporting James’ campaign. Other contributors include various executives in investment firms, technology and industrial companies. 
While the big dollars are flowing to James’ campaign, a large majority of his individual direct contributions came from small dollar donors, campaign finance records show.
Aric Nesbitt (R) 
One of Michigan’s top Republican legislators, Nesbitt, the state Senate minority leader, has amassed $2.7 million and spent $616,869, with more than $2.1 million on hand up until October. He is one of James’ chief rivals in the race and has been attacking him head on in various debates and messaging.

Some of Nesbitt’s largest donors, giving the maximum amount to his campaign, include Carol Van Andel, director of the Van Andel Foundation, and David Van Andel, chair of the Van Andel Institute, both members of the Van Andel family that co-founded Amway with members of the DeVos family.
Also giving the max amount to Nesbitt were Sidney Jansma, the president of Wolverine Gas and Oil, Mark Fazakerley, founder of Eagle Alloy and a major supporter of former GOP gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon, Mark Faraj, CEO of KMT Distribution, Ron Boji of the Boji Group, and Chris Yatooma, the husband of Republican secretary of state candidate Monica Yatooma.
Nesbitt also received more than $400,000 from GOPAC, a Virginia-based Republican group the Detroit News reported is funded by some of the nation’s largest companies.
Mike Cox (R) 
A former Michigan attorney general during the Granholm and Snyder years, Cox is back to try and take the GOP nomination for governor this year. Like Nesbitt, Cox is also positioning himself as a quasi-foil to James and has similarly attacked his lack of presence in the race in 2025. Cox ended the third quarter raising $4.58 million, with $757,638 spent and more than $3.78 million on hand. That includes $2 million of his own money he loaned to his campaign.

Among Cox’s top donors giving him the maximum amount are various attorneys or members of Michigan law firms. Attorneys Ben Gonek, Manvir Grewal, Todd Flood, David Shea and Michael Stines, and retired attorney Jeffrey Sheehan. 
Cox also received max-dollar campaign contributions from Greg Wier, president of Prudential Alarm, and billionaire Peter Karmanos, the owner of the Carolina Hurricanes hockey team and the former CEO of Compuware.
Marking the changing of the political times, Justin Elias, the president of Puff Cannabis, also gave Cox $8,325.
Tom Leonard (R)
Leonard, a former Michigan House speaker and the 2018 GOP nominee for attorney general, entered the race later than some of the other candidates, but he was working to catch up with his fellow primary candidates in fundraising.
He raised $937,023 thus far, spent $227,730 and has $709,293 on hand going into October.
Some of his top donors include those who gave to other campaigns, like Weiser, Yatooma, Boji and Faraj, but also Matthew Moroun, the son of former billionaire businessman Matty Moroun, attorney Jeffrey Ishbia, and James Husanger, the chief risk officer of MSU Federal Credit Union. Each of them gave the maximum amount to Leonard’s campaign.
Ralph Rebandt (R)
A former pastor, Rebandt ran for governor in 2022 and made the ballot after scandal plagued the gubernatorial field that year, as half of the candidates in the crowded field were booted from the ballot due to fraudulent signatures on their nominating petitions. Rebandt ultimately lost that race to Dixon.
Undeterred, Rebandt is back but with sharper focus after running once before. He raised $926,800, spent $46,344 and had $880,455 cash on hand up until October.
Only three individuals gave Rebandt the maximum amount allowed, including Lael Bryant of Ask Services, and Randy Simmons, owner of Simmons Insurance. A large chunk of his campaign cash came from a personal loan, giving himself $799,627 of his total haul thus far.

(Photo courtesy of Helion)Washington spent much of the 1970s trying to become a center for nuclear power, with plans for five huge fission reactors at Richland and Satsop.
Then came cost overruns, construction problems, and one of the biggest municipal bond defaults in Wall Street history in 1983.
Only one of the five proposed reactors of the Washington Public Power Supply System — or WPPSS, commonly pronounced “Whoops” — was finished at Richland. In 1998, WPPSS became Energy Northwest largely to erase the stigma, and completed the 1,150-megawatt reactor that became the Columbia Generating Station.
Fast forward to today.
Again, Washington is trying to become a hub for nuclear power. But instead of monster-size reactors, the state is now home to multiple ventures involving smaller reactors — all using technologies unheard of in the 1970s and 1980s.
Construction at the Satsop Nuclear Power Plant took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as seen here. But the Washington Public Power Supply System project was never completed.

Fusion and small modular reactors are the emerging sources of nuclear power, although both are still fledgling technologies. Policymakers are looking at both. So, too, are some of the nation’s largest tech corporations, eager to find power for electricity-hungry data centers.
One of the first commercially viable fusion reactors in the U.S. is under construction roughly 6 miles southeast of Wenatchee. It’s expected to be working by 2028, with power going to Microsoft. Fusion reactors are attractive in part because they don’t produce highly radioactive waste.
Efforts are also underway to develop a different type of fusion reactor in Everett and Richland. These would be small portable units. 
And there are plans for what could be the nation’s second small modular reactor complex at Richland. Amazon is playing a part in that potential undertaking. Small modular reactors are essentially prefabricated mini-versions of traditional fission reactors. They are supposedly faster and cheaper to build than traditional reactors.
In the works
Founded in 2013 in Redmond, Helion Energy moved its main lab to Everett and recently began construction in July on a reactor site in the small Chelan County town of Malaga.
“This is a first-of-its-kind generator,” said Helion co-founder Anthony Pancotti.
The Malaga complex will house a 50-megawatt fusion reactor called Orion. The plan is for the reactor to deliver power to Microsoft under a contract between the two companies. 
Helion’s long-term plan is to eventually produce more of these reactors to be distributed worldwide, Pancotti said. Helion has roughly 450 employees at Everett and Malaga.
Small portable fusion reactors — about the size of a wine barrel and capable of generating 100 kilowatts — could become a reality in southern Seattle and Richland in a few years.
“What we are going for is mobile power,” said Brian Riordan, cofounder of Avalanche Energy, a company based in the Seattle area that is developing space and underwater fusion reactors.
Initial customers would likely buy the mini-reactors for military satellites and unmanned underwater vehicles. Riordan hopes to sell Avalanche’s first 100-kilowatt reactor before 2030.
The company plans to branch out into other uses, for portable power generators, with Riordan noting that the fusion device needs to produce electricity cheaper than what is created by wind and solar power options. 
Avalanche’s headquarters and research facilities are near Boeing Field. The company recently leased a Port of Benton facility in northern Richland for an operation called FusionWERX.
“FusionWERX is going to be the fusion industry’s equivalent of a commercial wind tunnel — an open-access facility where new ideas, technologies, and components can be tested and validated,” Avalanche’s CEO, Robin Langtry, said in a statement.
Avalanche has roughly 70 employees split between Seattle and Richland.
Another company, X-energy, signed agreements last year with Amazon and Energy Northwest for the retail giant to invest $334 million to study putting four modular reactors on the site of the half-built WPPSS Reactor No. 1, which is next to the Columbia Generating Station.
This piece of federal land gives the project the advantage of existing infrastructure, including roads and utilities from the 1980s.
Amazon’s interest is prompted by its plans to build data centers.
The four-reactor proposal — dubbed the “Cascade Advanced Energy Facility” — would produce 320 megawatts, with the possibility of adding more reactors to reach 960 megawatts.

Energy Northwest has been doing environmental, safety and legal reviews on the proposal. Construction is tentatively set to begin at the end of this decade.
Amazon has tentative plans to work with X-energy to build small modular reactors across the nation by 2039 that would collectively produce 5,000 megawatts of power.
‘The world’s leading hub for fusion’
The concept of fusion has been around for roughly a century. Right now, around 40 fusion development projects using different technologies exist worldwide, while no commercially viable fusion reactors are currently producing electricity.
A huge hurdle is that the amount of electricity needed to create a fusion reaction is greater than the power that would be produced. In 2022, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California used lasers to produce surplus electricity.
Shortly afterward, Helion Energy achieved that same goal with a setup that slams two atoms together.
Practical fusion is so new that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission — which routinely takes years to approve new designs for fission reactors — currently does not regulate fusion devices.
Consequently, Helion and Avalanche do not need the commission’s approval for their devices. Instead, they obtain permits from the state and their host counties.
That will likely change soon. Last July, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a report to Congress on how it should license fusion devices.
On Oct. 31, U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell and U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, both Washington Democrats, along with other congressional members of both parties, announced the introduction of a bill to provide tax credits for fusion-related ventures. 
“The state of Washington is the world’s leading hub for fusion energy, which one day could provide vast amounts of the type of power we need to keep electricity prices down and increase America’s economic competitiveness,” Cantwell said in a press release.
Then, in November, the U.S. Department of Energy created an Office of Fusion as the Trump administration moved away from renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, in order to shift money to nuclear and fossil fuel development.
Fusion leaders met with the Energy Department on Dec. 9 to lobby for federal support for fusion.
“Now is the time for the U.S. to make a significant investment, and that means over a billion dollars per year in annual appropriations and a one-time infrastructure investment,” Andrew Holland, CEO of the Fusion Industry Association, said at the time, according to Reuters.
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a huge federal lab in northern Richland, is beginning two fusion-related materials projects. Materials are critical as, during operation, components of fusion reactors can reach temperatures hotter than the sun.
The Tri-Cities area has deep roots and a strong workforce in the nuclear sector, tracing back to the Manhattan Project in 1943.
Consequently, this region has great interest in new types of reactors, the fusion industry, and clean energy projects, said David Reeploeg, head of federal relations for the Tri-City Development Council, and Sean O’Brien, executive director of the council’s clean energy spinoff called the Energy Forward Alliance.
The Tri-Cities, which include Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, are also looking at attracting data centers with local nuclear power and having a long-time nuclear fuel assembly plant expand the types of fuel it can offer, Reeploeg and O’Brien said.
“The key focus for us is keeping our workforce employed,” O’ Brien said.
Modular designs
Small modular reactors are like prefabricated houses. There are locked-in designs and pre-built components, which are then taken to a site and assembled. Small modular reactors are designed so extra modules can be added as needed. This concept is supposed to lead to lower costs, faster construction and more flexibility.
Each modular unit would be a mini-reactor capable of generating 50 to 300 megawatts of energy. 
Some U.S. and world leaders are pushing this new nuclear reactor as a carbon-emissions-free power technology to combat climate change.
NuScale Power, based in Corvallis, Oregon, is the only U.S. venture so far to receive Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval for its small modular reactor design. 
The company obtained a contract to build a modular reactor complex at Idaho Falls for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, which is part of the Utah state government and provides electricity to four states.
However, many of that project’s prospective customers dropped out, and the project was canceled in 2023.
A 2022 Stanford University study raised questions about contamination from used nuclear fuel from small modular reactors. It looked at NuScale’s designs, as well as designs from two other companies submitted to the federal government. Not among them was X-energy’s, the company involved in the project with Energy Northwest and Amazon. The study picked NuScale’s design because it was the furthest along in the federal review process.

The Stanford study concluded that NuScale’s design and the two others would produce greater volumes of radioactive waste than conventional reactors, and that the used reactor fuel would be roughly 50% more radioactive. 
NuScale contested those conclusions, saying the Stanford study looked at outdated designs.
State legislation teed up
Two Republican Washington state legislators — with high-ranking Democratic cosponsors — have introduced similar 2026 nuclear fission power reactor bills in the Senate and House.
The bills, which do not mention fusion power, call for developing a nuclear power development master plan for Washington state by Dec. 15, 2026. Introduced by Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia and Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco, the legislation points to signs that Washington’s push for alternative power sources might not meet the state’s needs.
Washington is a net exporter of electricity, but the state government predicts it will be a net importer of power by 2050. Meanwhile, Montana and Wyoming were expected to send wind and solar power to Washington in the next few decades. But the legislation says that those power sources now look less promising.
The proposed report would address future fission power reactor goals, plus what various governments and utilities should do. It would also look at financing, siting, consulting with tribes, workforce requirements, and regulatory needs.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helion-malaga-project-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-02 07:12:01.988053

A statewide group tasked with reviewing domestic violence homicides and other related deaths will begin to look at missed opportunities to offer resources and intervention to change future outcomes. 
With a better picture of what help victims and perpetrators had access to before a death, Mississippi’s Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team puts the state in a position to make systemic changes around its response to domestic violence, said team member Stacey Riley. 
“This will help us as a state and give the movement to find what the changes are and how to make them happen,” said Riley, CEO of the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence. “It’s not just about ‘We have to make it better.’”
She is among those appointed to the committee established during the legislative session under the Department of Public Safety. Its 13 members include domestic violence service providers, advocates, law enforcement and prosecutors. 
Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen, another committee member, said the group can help learn how to prevent domestic violence deaths and other related crimes. 
“How do we keep this from being a problem that repeats?” he asked. 
Choosing what cases to review will be up to the committee, and the group has a number of domestic violence deaths to choose from. 
Between 2020 and 2024, Mississippi Today reviewed local news stories, police reports, court records and other public information and found that at least 300 people died in domestic violence incidents. This number includes victims, abusers, children, law enforcement and others. 
At least 70 domestic violence incidents occurred across the state in 2025, resulting in at least 44 deaths and 48 injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive. That number is likely higher when other forms of domestic violence, such as beatings, strangulation and stabbings, are factored in and law enforcement investigations indicate that a case is domestic violence related. 
The work of the Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team is years in the making. 
In 2024, the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence supported a bill to establish the committee, but it did not make it out of committee. 
The next year, the coalition, along with advocates and some who lost family members to domestic violence, spoke in support of a pair of bills to establish the review committee. One version, Senate Bill 2886, became law in July. 
Tara Gandy, who lost her daughter Joslin Napier in 2022, held a framed photo of her as Gov. Tate Reeves signed the bill into law. 
“(The review team) will allow for my daughter and those who have already lost their lives to domestic violence … to no longer be just a number,” Gandy said after the bill signing. “They will be a number with a purpose.” 
Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell selected four initial members before the law went into effect in July, said Bailey Martin Holloway, a spokesperson for the department. From there, the members elected a chair and vice chair and additional team members. 
The committee is expected to meet quarterly, Holloway said. The group’s first tasks will be to set up administrative procedures and processes, which can include how the committee will receive cases and how to obtain court, medical and other records to review. 
Riley hopes the National Domestic Violence Fatality Review Initiative can train the committee about methods, procedures and policies to review domestic violence cases. 
Members of the review team are:

Allen McDaniel, Tindell’s chief of staff, committee chair. 
Luis Montgomery, public policy and justice strategist for the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence, committee vice chair. He lobbied for the bill that established the committee.
Anna Brumfield, special assistant attorney general. She trains law enforcement officers about domestic abuse protection orders and how to use the AG’s Domestic Violence Reporting System and Protection Order Registry.
Kassie Coleman, district attorney for Clarke, Kemper, Lauderdale and Wayne counties. She has prosecuted crimes against women and children and was appointed as a member of the Commission for the Study of Domestic Abuse Proceedings.
Debra Mitchell, a medical social worker.
Stacey Riley, CEO of the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence. 
Tiffany Crawford, sexual assault prevention and response program manager for the Mississippi National Guard.
Lanisha Bell, project director for the Tribal Financial Management Center with the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime. 
Michael Harper, Leake County deputy coroner. 
Shella Cage-Head, community advocate.
Jeff McCutchen, Oxford police chief. His department established a victim’s service unit in 2021 to focus on crimes against people, including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking and harassment.
Sholatta Sharp, special projects coordinator for the Mississippi Coalition Against Sexual Assault. She is a certified sexual assault nurse examiner and trains others to work as examiners.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – Beginning in 2013, Oklahoma attorney and college instructor John Maisch made dozens of 700-mile trips over four years to visit the alcohol-soaked village of Whiteclay, Nebraska.
Maisch, who grew up in Grand Island, had earned a reputation as a tough prosecutor of liquor violations in Oklahoma.
When he stumbled almost accidently onto the story of Whiteclay – an unincorporated village on the South Dakota border where beer stores sold more than 3 million cans a year to the adjacent and officially dry Pine Ridge Indian Reservation – he knew he had to do something.
The more he learned, the more he became outraged.
Fact finder
His trips became fact-finding missions, building a case against what he saw as violations of liquor laws. Without any background in movie making, Maisch produced a documentary on the “wounds” caused by Whiteclay – an epidemic of alcoholism, fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol-related assaults on the reservation, where alcohol possession and sales were outlawed.


How to find the book
The book, “Whiteclay: An American Tragedy,” is expected to be available in book stores in January. Meanwhile, copies can be ordered via the website, johnmaisch.com.


Maisch’s crusade, which culminated in the closing of the Whiteclay beer stores in 2017, is now detailed in a book, “Whiteclay: An American Tragedy,” written by Maisch before his death in 2022.
Maisch’s widow, Julia, took up the task of getting the book published, because she knew her husband wanted people to know about the long-ignored injustice delivered by the beer sales in Whiteclay, especially to the babies born on the reservation with lifelong disabilities due to drinking by their mothers.
“When you have an opportunity to speak up, to help the voiceless, the children who can’t rely on adults to care for them, it’s our responsibility to do something about it,” Julia Maisch told the Nebraska Examiner.
The closings were an historic accomplishment, one that few thought would happen.

The 186-page book details the ups and downs of the campaign to close the beer stores, from fiery exchanges with liquor regulators and cordial meetings with then-Gov. Pete Ricketts and his wife, Susanne, to a disappointing lack of action by Sheridan County officials.
Alcohol had flowed from Whiteclay to the reservation for decades, but the remote village was far from the media spotlight, and in the northwest corner of Nebraska, it had become accepted that in Whiteclay you’d find drunken men and women, urinating, defecating and passing out on the highway through town.
In the book, he wondered if attitudes would change, given the large haul of taxes paid by the beer stores.

Focus on the law
But Maisch knew that legally, alcohol could not be sold in places where there was inadequate law enforcement, and Whiteclay had no local police and the county sheriff’s office was 23 miles away. He eventually began researching the economic cost to Sheridan County and the state of jailing vagrants and those who committed assaults in Whiteclay and treating the children scarred by fetal alcohol syndrome.
His documentary, “Sober Indian/Dangerous Indian,” introduced many to the lives of four men who lived, panhandled and drank on the streets of Whiteclay. The book provided more detail about their struggles with alcoholism and flirts with sobriety, and of the toll it took on their families.
Along with Native American activist Frank LaMere – a longtime advocate to close the beer stores – Maisch criss-crossed the state and nation, screening the documentary and exposing the misery of Whiteclay. It led to testimony at legislative hearings and those of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, and the appointment of task forces. Like an investigator, he dug up data and personal stories of those damaged by the flood of beer coming from a village of less than 20 residents.

“Although most public officials I encountered may disagree, my objective was always to engage – not enrage – those who were involved in the Whiteclay issue,” Maisch wrote. “But more times than not, I found myself getting into verbal spats with elected and appointed officials because, in my opinion, they lacked the moral courage to do what their oaths required them to do.”
The misery of Whiteclay hit the national radar in 1999, when two Native American men who frequented the beer-soaked village were found dead a few yards from the beer stores.
LaMere, a member of the Winnebago tribe who lived across Nebraska from Whiteclay, began calls for change at the village. Nebraskans for Peace, as well as activists from the American Indian Movement took up the call, organizing protest walks and seeking legislative changes. A documentary, “The Battle for Whiteclay,” detailed the sordid history of alcohol sales from the village.
But bills in the Nebraska Legislature died in legislative committees, and attention to Whiteclay often fell from the radar, to be reignited, sporadically, by a protest march or discovery of a death on the streets.
Concerned citizens gather
Maisch began assembling a group of other concerned citizens, like Dennis Carlson, a retired attorney who investigated cases of legal malpractice for the Nebraska Supreme Court, and Alan Jacobson, a Lincoln business owner appalled by what he saw in Whiteclay.
This sign, on the fence of a closed Whiteclay business, is a remnant of the village’s notorious past when street people drank openly on the streets and four stores sold up to 3.5 million cans of beer a year. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
There also were people involved in the fight against fetal alcohol syndrome, caused when a pregnant woman consumed alcohol. A key ally was Nora Boesem, a former pediatric nurse from Newell, South Dakota, whose family had become foster parents for dozens of kids from the reservation who suffered from fetal alcohol-related impacts.
Through Maisch, reporters learned about, and published stories about, one of Boesem’s foster children, Arianna, who was born prematurely, with damage to almost every internal organ due to fetal alcohol syndrome. She required several taxpayer-funded surgeries, daily pain medications and required almost constant care.
Lasting impacts
The book includes other heart-wrenching stories about those scarred by alcohol-fueled domestic abuse, women sexually assaulted and left on Whiteclay streets, and men seeking sobriety and later relapsing to the beer stores.
More than once in the book, Maisch expresses surprise at how forthcoming those impacted by Whiteclay’s alcohol were about the sordid impact on their lives.
“As a Christian, I was convinced that God was with us every step of the way as we battled to close Whiteclay’s beer stores,” he said.
In the end, Maisch saw signs of hope in Whiteclay. Ambulance and law enforcement calls fell, and the village was no longer a contributor to the woes of the reservation, and new programs involving children and providing a “maker’s space” for Native artists and crafters were established.
“Nothing changes if we protect our own comfort at the expense of others’ pain,” he wrote. “Nothing changes when we refuse to be unsettled, But when we are willing to feel that discomfort and step across the line and stay with it, something begins to shift.”
“That is where the healing begins. That is where justice takes root.”

More about the author
John Maisch’s activism on a social issue – the misery caused by alcohol sales from a Nebraska village to an officially dry South Dakota reservation – spawned an effort at Central Oklahoma University, where Maisch was an associate professor of business law.
The “John Maisch Collective for the Greater Good,” launched in 2022, is an effort to engage students and faculty on social issues and foster collaboration to address them.
“The intent was to be able to take on more complex issues,” said Sunshine Cowan, the center’s director.
“Dr. John Maisch was a part of those early discussions, and his work with communities was well known and respected,” Cowan said. “He deeply engaged with the community in a way that The Collective and our campus want to honor and emulate.”
The main goal of The Collective, she said, is to “build a collaborative network that works together on meaningful community work,” involving faculty, staff and students.
One outgrowth of that is an annual college scholarship, the “Dr. John A. Maisch Social Impact Scholarship,” which recognizes students who engage with their communities “in meaningful ways,” Cowan said.
The Collaborative will hold a spring workshop with an author experienced in community building and holds “coffee connection” times each month where individuals can drop in for casual conversation.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office has received over 220 complaints of open records violations this year, with the numbers increasing since a public complaint form launched, officials said. 
Anthony Sykes, the assistant attorney general in the Public Access Counselor unit, said between January and July, 128 complaints were received, or about 18 per month. After the complaint form launched in August after House Bill 2163 became law in May, that number has grown to be about 25 per month.
The law gave the Attorney General’s Office the power to enforce violations of the Open Records Act and outlined a review process for denied public records requests through a complaint form monitored by the Public Access Counselor Unit. The agency can seek “legal enforcement” when government entities fail to comply with open records laws.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

Filing a complaint for review is prohibited if the person requesting to inspect a public record is doing so for “commercial purposes.” 
About 42% of the complaints to the form were against a state agency, state records show. A third pertained to a city while nearly a quarter of complaints were about a county. Records show 2% of complaints were about a school board.
Records from the Attorney General’s Office show that 70 of the complaints to the portal have been closed. Over 30 of these were deemed “unfounded” complaints while decisions were issued in nine were issued a decision. Records showed another 12 were resolved by the parties involved and 10 considered were “not timely.” Some complaints were also closed because they were either withdrawn or for commercial purposes. 
Two-thirds of complaint filers were members of the public, 26% were members of the media and the rest were either commercial complaints or classified as “attorney discovery,” according to data provided by the Attorney General’s Office. 
Of the remaining 18 open complaints, 10 have a decision being drafted, three are awaiting a response from an agency and five were incomplete, records showed. 
Sykes is the only full-time employee assigned to this unit but he said the agency is working to onboard another employee for administrative support. 
“The complaint form has been a great improvement as it details the circumstances and explains that the complaint must be accompanied by the request for records and any response by the public body,” Sykes said in a statement. “This allows the complaint process to begin with a more complete picture.”
The agency evaluates a complaint to determine whether further action is needed within seven business days, Sykes said. The time needed to resolve complaints varies “substantially,” he said, but all complaints are resolved 60 days after the public body has responded. 
“It’s also worth noting that many of these complaints involve multiple violations or issues, so the total number of concerns we’re addressing is even higher than these figures suggest,” he said.
The Attorney General’s Office issues a decision, or “formal advisement,” on a complaint to the public body in question, Sykes said. 
Some decisions issued have included complaints against the Attorney General’s Office, the Oklahoma Department of Health, the City of Coweta, the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety, the City of Oklahoma City, and the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. 
The complaints were made by journalists, private citizens and attorneys.
In all of the provided examples, Sykes wrote that the public body either had had a “reasonable” response to the complainant, was justified in denying public records, or had “a good faith legal basis to deny access to the information and records referenced in the Complaint.”

As the Trump administration dramatically increased deportations across the country, both federal and state officials have made sure the state contributed to the effort, making it largely hostile territory for undocumented immigrants. 
The post Wyoming officials leaned into Trump’s immigration agenda in 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","At times during the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency, it seemed Wyoming would be left out of the upheaval of his administration’s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
Though exact numbers are unknown, the state has a low population of such folks.  A 2023 estimate by the American Immigration Council put the number of undocumented immigrants in Wyoming — a challenging statistic to document — at around 9,800, largely of working-age adults. 
Wyoming also lacks a major city with liberal-leaning politics — the type of places where the Trump administration performed some of its most headline-grabbing enforcement actions, like the president’s use of military and national guard troops in Los Angeles or the intensive activities of federal agents in Chicago. 
But by summer, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducted operations in Teton County and other parts of the state, it had become clear Wyoming was not isolated from the Trump administration’s efforts to dramatically increase deportations. Wyoming’s undocumented population also encountered more hostile policies at the state and local level than it did a year ago, driven by state legislators, Gov. Mark Gordon and some county sheriffs. 



The year began with conservative lawmakers in Cheyenne seeking to thrust the state into immigration enforcement, long the purview of the federal government. Lawmakers passed several bills to that end. One new law bans sanctuary cities (though Wyoming has none, technically). Another invalidates driver’s licenses that some other states issue to undocumented immigrants.
The Wyoming Senate rejected one of the more extreme measures, a bill from Torrington Republican Cheri Steinmetz that, as originally written, would have forced state law enforcement officers to question people about their immigration status during routine police work. Other parts of the bill made it a crime to carry an undocumented person in your car — something opponents said would criminalize large swathes of U.S. citizens, including friends and family members of immigrants. 
Senators, worried about unforeseen consequences, tossed the bill in February, about halfway through the 2025 legislative session. 
But over the next nine months, officials governing large swathes of Wyoming upped their involvement with immigration enforcement. Gov. Gordon directed the Wyoming Highway Patrol and the state’s National Guard to ink agreements with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to play varying roles in immigration enforcement. Six county sheriffs signed on as well.
The most significant example is likely Sheriff Brian Kozak of Laramie County, who in October announced that he and 25 of his deputies had all joined a federal program where they received training on checking immigration status and detaining people on behalf of ICE. Though Kozak promised deputies would detain people only following interdictions on suspicion of other law breaking, his strong alliance with ICE sparked fears among local immigrant advocates that deputies would engage in racial profiling.

Kozak’s disclosure in late November that his deputies had detained an estimated 30 people for ICE, largely following traffic stops, fueled advocates’ criticism. 
But Kozak’s partnership with ICE is popular with Wyoming conservatives. That same week, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus cheered a special operation by Kozak’s department, ICE and the Wyoming Highway Patrol that led to the detention of 40 truck drivers. “Countries have borders. Wyoming is proud to help enforce ours,” the caucus wrote on Facebook. 
The post’s unnamed author drew a connection between this year’s new law to outlaw driver’s licenses that other states issue to undocumented immigrants — a priority of the Freedom Caucus — and the enforcement operation. It’s unclear whether any of the truckers arrested during the three-day November campaign were driving with such a license. 
In the upcoming legislative session, lawmakers are likely to push for more restrictions on people living in and traveling through the state without legal U.S. residency. Already, the Legislature’s Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee has advanced a bill draft to mirror in Wyoming statute a federal crackdown on the English proficiency of commercial drivers.

Wyoming sheriffs, like Trump and officials in his administration, have pitched the enhanced enforcement as targeting people not only here illegally, but who also have a criminal record, a group they have referred to as “the worst of the worst.” ICE’s arrest data, however, shows that the majority of people being placed in immigration detention by federal agents do not have criminal convictions. That trend holds true for arrest numbers from Wyoming and Colorado, which WyoFile analyzed in collaboration with the Colorado Sun in July. 
Over the course of the year, WyoFile spoke to undocumented immigrants who work in the state’s energy industry, its construction industry and in health care. Those workers described stalled asylum cases and logistical and financial hurdles barring access to legal status, despite paying taxes and participating in Wyoming’s economy for years. And as the Trump administration ramped up its deportation dragnet, they also described living in increasing fear. 
An exact accounting of who has been arrested and deported from the state is difficult to come by. But WyoFile and reporters at other outlets we collaborated with tracked some people into ICE’s detention system. They included a Mexican laborer who was a 25-year resident of Jackson Hole, a Romanian national with a misdemeanor DUI, a Nicaraguan barber in Cheyenne and a Cuban immigrant who was detained at a regular check-in with ICE in Miami. 
The Cuban man, who was attempting to renew his work permit when detained, came to Wyoming through the Natrona County Sheriff’s agreement with ICE to hold people when the federal agency needs more bed space for people it’s holding in the region. He described his 40-day stay in a Casper jail cell, far from home and uncertain at the time what his fate may be, as “hell” that wore on his psyche. Other men placed in the jail with him on July 18 remained there at least through the end of November. 
When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Cuban immigrant Josue Rodriguez Perez at a check in appointment in July, it began a months-long saga of imprisonment that led him to detention centers around the United States, including the Natrona County jail. In September, he was deported to Mexico, a country where he does not have ties. (courtesy photo/Josue Rodriguez/illustration by Tennessee Watson/WyoFile)
The Cuban immigrant, Josue Rodriguez, was then deported to Mexico, a country to which he had no ties. 
Rodriguez’s saga showed how ICE agreements entangle local agencies in the Trump administration’s crackdown well beyond Wyoming’s borders. 
In Uinta County, Sheriff Andy Kopp has offered his jail beds to ICE as a lucrative revenue source. He is using the money to raise his deputies’ salaries in tough fiscal times driven, in part, by the Wyoming Legislature’s cuts to property taxes.
This fall, that arrangement briefly drew Kopp’s appearance in federal court, although in a nominal and procedural capacity, after one Mexican national captured by ICE during a sprawling operation in Idaho sued for his freedom. Though Kopp, like other sheriffs and elected officials at the state and national level, has said they want to remove dangerous criminals from the country, the Idaho man doesn’t fit that bill. He appears to have no criminal record and is the father of five children who are U.S. citizens, who were left without his support during his detention.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan) It’s almost impossible to fathom the extent of the fall of democracy in our nation in one year — but 2025 indeed saw an assault on our freedoms across the board from the most authoritarian president and administration in recent history.  Unfortunately, those same tendencies have trickled down through various state governments as well — and Montana is no exception.
But take heart, fellow citizens, while we were numbed by the shock and awe attack on our institutions, laws, policies, and liberties, there are significant signs that the people and the courts are realizing we must fight back and demand adherence to the law, the Constitution, and the tenets of humane treatment for our people and the environment.
In that regard, the new year opens with a tremendous court victory here in Montana that found the Department of Environmental Quality illegally approved a Big Sky area subdivision. The state’s approval of septic systems for eight lots in the Quarry 1 subdivision was challenged by Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, which contended the agency failed to fully analyze the likely impacts to the already impaired Gallatin River.
The ruling, which granted Waterkeeper summary judgment on their claims, found the state’s water quality regulatory agency “was arbitrary, capricious and unlawful and in violation of the Montana Constitution, MEPA [Montana Environmental Policy Act] and the WQA [Water Quality Act].”
The significance of the Court’s decision cannot be understated, since coming right behind Quarry 1 is another major subdivision, Quarry 2 — which will face many of the same problems. Namely, too close to the river, sitting on top of porous river gravels, and a very active downgradient layer of groundwater that ultimately carries pollutants and nutrients directly to the Gallatin River.
The “development at any cost” policies of Montana’s current administration are indeed coming with costs — and those costs affect us all in the loss of our clean and healthy environment, our incredible fisheries and wildlife legacy, and the destruction of our natural landscapes. As the impacts stack up, so do the court challenges — from gravel pits to subdivisions to mines as Montanans say “enough is enough.”
On the national scene, we are likewise seeing a rising and determined resistance to the destructive and divisive policies of the current administration. Once again, the challenges are arising across the nation as Americans realize the freedoms, liberties, and norms of governance we once took for granted must now be actively, fiercely, and continually defended.
The Supreme Court recently ruled the administration cannot send the National Guard into Chicago because the president lacks the legal authority to do so. Likewise, the administration’s policies are being challenged on a host of issues from the brutal and racist immigration raids to the lawless slaughter of those merely suspected of transporting drugs to undeclared wars and bombing sovereign nations without Congressional approval.
Despite the constant barrage of self-aggrandizing proclamations from the president, he is not everyone’s “favorite president.” Across the board, polls show more than six in 10 Americans do not approve of him, his administration, or his illegal policies and actions.
Make no mistake, 2026 is the year we must stand together and stand up to defy the intimidation of the press, attacks on free speech, and disregard for the law and Constitution.
Renowned actor George Clooney just rendered some sage advice to those who capitulated to Trump’s threats saying: “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f— yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country. That’s simply the truth.” Indeed, it is — enough is enough.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0079-1024x678.jpg,,,2026-01-02 06:56:39.487004

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)During the holidays, we’re bringing back our journalists’ favorite stories of 2025. This one is from May.
Brandon Kingdollar: “I had the exciting opportunity to watch a crucial labor fight up close in 2025 as North Carolina Amazon warehouse workers sought to unionize against one of the largest corporations in the world. After seeing them lose their first election by a three-to-one margin, I used public records requests to peel back the curtain on allegations of union-busting and retaliation leveled by the union campaign.”
After losing their bid to unionize the Amazon warehouse in Garner by a three-to-one margin in February, labor organizers with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment are challenging the election results, arguing Amazon coerced employees into voting against the union campaign.
In a filing with the National Labor Relations Board on Feb. 24, CAUSE alleges that Amazon misled workers into believing that they would lose existing benefits and wages if they voted in favor of the union, brought in a speaker who said the union would deport workers, and targeted pro-union workers for discipline throughout the election period.
“The Employer engaged in improper surveillance of employees, created the impression of surveillance, and interrogated employees regarding their Union support and Union activity,” the CAUSE objection reads. “The Employer selectively enforced workplace rules regarding performance standards and appearance, targeting known Union supporters for discipline and enforcement while ignoring similar violations by workers who were not known Union supporters.”
Though more than 30% of workers comprising the bargaining unit signed union cards in 2024 — representing the support of more than 1,000 warehouse associates — fewer ultimately voted in favor of the union, with just 829 voting in favor and 2,447 voting against, according to the NLRB. That left the union campaign far short of the majority vote necessary to win the right to bargain on behalf of the warehouse staff.
In response to the objection filing, Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment on general allegations of coercion, surveillance, and selective discipline, but expressed satisfaction with the result of the election.
“Our team in Garner overwhelmingly chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,” Hards wrote in an emailed statement. “We look forward to continuing to make RDU1 a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.”
In March, the NLRB placed the union campaign’s challenge on hold while complaints around the company’s conduct during the election period are vetted. Meanwhile, labor activists are gearing up for renewed efforts at Garner’s RDU1 warehouse as well as additional facilities throughout the Carolinas.
‘We desperately need the protection of the NLRB’
Since 2022, CAUSE has brought more than a dozen unfair labor practice complaints against Amazon, largely focusing on employee terminations, discipline of union organizers, and a general climate of surveillance.
The first of these complaints, coming in June 2022, soon after the union campaign’s formation, cited warehouse rules forbidding discussion of wages, hours, and other working conditions as an illegal prohibition on union activity. It also pointed to the end of site-specific COVID-19 updates, restrictions on the company’s internal discussion board, and the removal of a “web clock punch” feature on the employee app as impediments to protected labor activities.

The most extensive labor litigation pursued by the union surrounded disciplinary action against its co-founder, Rev. Ryan Brown, who alleged in 2022 that his complaints about warehouse conditions and racial discrimination were met with retaliation from supervisors, including a “final written warning.”
In a May 2024 response to the complaint, Amazon conceded that it issued the warning but denied that “such discipline was issued for any unlawful purpose” and was instead purely due to violation of company policy.
Arguing that the complaint should be dismissed, attorneys for Amazon went further than the facts of the individual case: they claimed the NLRB’s adjudicative procedures themselves are inherently unconstitutional, as board administrators are “improperly insulated from the President’s removal power.”
“The Complaint should be dismissed because the agency procedures through which the Complaint will be resolved violate Article II of the United States Constitution,” attorneys for Amazon wrote. “The National Labor Relations Board’s concurrent exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial power in this proceeding violates the separation of powers established by the United States Constitution and the guarantee of due process found in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”
Though Amazon was ordered in September 2024 — nearly two years after the initial complaint — to produce documents relating to policy complaints and allegations of discrimination that Brown and other employees voiced, the union withdrew its complaint the following month, due to the time and expense of the lengthy appeals process.
CAUSE has alleged that several employees have lost their jobs as a result of union organizing leading up to and during the election period, including Brown and Duke professor Orin Starn. Those terminations have continued in the wake of the election, organizers say, including that of Diedre King in March. According to CAUSE, she worked at the Garner warehouse for four years with an unblemished disciplinary record and was an “active, dedicated, and visible” member of the union organizing committee before she was accused of slapping a coworker during the election period, a claim she denies.
King said in the wake of her termination, she has received “amazing” support from other members of CAUSE. Organizers set up a fundraiser that has raised more than $5,500 for her as of Friday, and she said she also received a flood of calls offering support, even from colleagues she did not know before. “They call, they check up on me and see what I’m doing, get me out, get me involved in stuff — and not want me to sit at home and, like, be really depressed.”
Starn, the Duke professor, pointed to King’s termination and that of another employee afterwards as evidence of a “mass purge” targeting union organizers. A worker on the warehouse’s loading dock and an active organizer with the union, Starn was let go in December 2023 after a social media post in which he toasted the union effort with a sip of rum in the parking lot after work.

While the company cited its drug and alcohol policy as grounds for the dismissal, Starn wrote in an October 2024 NLRB appeal letter that he was instead let go for the “real and illegal reason” of openly campaigning for the union, one of just three workers doing so at the time.
“My firing damaged our effort by keeping me out of the facility and the chance to mobilize workers there, although we are making strong progress in our card collection nonetheless,” he wrote. “We desperately need the protection of the NLRB in supporting rightful complaints like mine to keep a powerful company from getting away with demoralizing illegal tactics in trying to suppress worker efforts to have a voice in the workplace.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, wrote in a statement that Starn’s termination was not related to his union activities and disputed his characterization of selective enforcement of the company’s drug and alcohol policy.
“The decision to terminate Mr. Starn was unrelated to whether he supported any particular cause or group. Mr. Starn was terminated for violating Amazon’s drug and alcohol policy, a violation that has resulted in several other terminations at RDU1 in the past,” she wrote. “We expect all of our employees to follow our policies, and we take appropriate action when those policies are violated.”
Ultimately, of the 13 labor complaints brought by CAUSE organizers, all but two have been dismissed or withdrawn. But the most recent of those complaints, an expansive Feb. 7 complaint alleging a campaign of surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation by Amazon throughout the election period, remains open, as does a Jan. 15 complaint citing the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property in December. A Feb. 12 complaint that Amazon brought against the union over the removal of company posters is also still active.
A resolution to CAUSE’s election objections will come only after their prior complaints are adjudicated. “I have determined to postpone the objections hearing until I determine the merits of the related pending unfair labor practice allegations and whether consolidation of the pending objections with an unfair labor practice proceeding before an administrative law judge is warranted,” NLRB regional director Michael Turner wrote in March.
With President Donald Trump’s election, however, it appears CAUSE’s claims may well face an uphill battle with the NLRB. In March, Trump nominated Crystal Carey as the board’s next general counsel — a management-side labor lawyer whose firm has represented Amazon in labor disputes and advanced the claim that the board itself is unconstitutional.
Union supporters allege ‘a total fear campaign’
At the center of the ongoing dispute over the labor election results is the conduct of Amazon and the union campaign during the election period, from late 2024 to early 2025.
Organizers say Amazon carried out a campaign of intimidation and union-busting, culminating in the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property, while the company says the campaign went too far in its efforts to reach workers on the premises and counter company messaging, accusing them of trespassing and vandalism.
In their Feb. 24 election challenge, lawyers for CAUSE wrote that the thrust of Amazon’s messaging campaign was that unionizing would be “futile” and was likely to lead to the rollback of higher wages, benefits like volunteer and unpaid time off, and other employment protections that the company had granted in the absence of organized representation.
“[Amazon] threatened employees with the loss of benefits and/or pay if workers voted in favor of being represented by the Union,” the attorneys wrote. “[They] solicited employees to participate in the production of anti-Union marketing materials, and took video footage of employees to use in anti-Union videos without the employees’ knowledge or consent.”

Italo Medelius, a CAUSE organizer who worked the warehouse’s shipping dock, said managers and employee relations consultants would walk the warehouse floor, soliciting workers and discouraging them from joining the union. This was paired with a “Vote No” promotional video that aired on repeat on televisions across the facility’s lobbies and break rooms, which he said featured a former Teamster making the case that union representation would only harm the workers. “So just a total fear campaign, 24/7 inside of that warehouse,” he said.
According to a report by LaborLab, a pro-union nonprofit corporate watchdog, Amazon paid management-side consulting firm Road Warrior Productions more than $366,000 over the span of roughly a month to create anti-union materials used in the election, which the organization condemned as “union-busting services.”
“Amazon is one of the greatest union busters in the history of the world,” said Medelius. “They cover every single inch of that warehouse in some way, shape, or form with anti-union propaganda.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, cited the extensive organizing efforts across Amazon facilities throughout the U.S. as necessitating the use of labor consulting firms. She pointed to “tens of billions of dollars in benefits” including health care, a 401K program with a company match, and pre-paid college tuition as evidence that investments in workers vastly outweigh the use of those services.
“We also know that there are outside organizations working hard and spending heavily to spread inaccurate information about us to our teams. Which is also why we work to ensure our employees are fully informed about their rights and how decisions about outside representation could impact their day-to-day lives working at Amazon,” Hards wrote in a statement.
Medelius also described an anti-union persuasion campaign that he said targeted Spanish-speaking workers specifically, which he said invoked racial stereotypes in an attempt to divide workers. Medelius, who is bilingual, said he was individually banned from Amazon’s Spanish-language informational meetings after speaking out against these tactics. He added that on one occasion, he was required to report for a random drug test minutes after speaking out at one of these meetings, an experience he said other organizers reported as well.

“The crazy thing is that we’ve been fighting for translation in Human Resources. So, if somebody that’s a Spanish speaker has an issue that needs to be resolved by HR, I have to go with them to translate for them,” Medelius said. “But when it comes to union busting, everything is in Spanish, so it’s kind of a little bit dystopian there.”
Starn recounted a town hall meeting in which a manager sought to associate CAUSE with immigrant deportation efforts to “raise fear and uncertainty” among workers and scare them out of supporting the union effort.
“At one of the town hall meetings, one of the mangers says, you know, ‘We’ve been hearing that CAUSE is telling people that if they vote no, they’ll be deported, and we don’t think anybody should be deported,’” Starn said. “This is a completely outlandish charge, but it’s the kind of thing Amazon does.”
This incident was also detailed in the election challenge, with attorneys for the union campaign writing that Amazon “coerced and intimidated employees into voting against Union representation by falsely accusing the Union of suggesting workers could be deported for voting no” and themselves “suggesting that workers’ immigration status could be impacted by the results of the election.”
According to Hards, employees came forward with complaints that union organizers told them if they did not vote in favor of the union, they could face deportation, and the comments during the informational session were intended to rebut those claims.
The complaint also alleges that Amazon took action against specific employees to prevent them from voting in favor of the union, including delaying a known union supporter’s return-to-work date until after the election had concluded. And it details a culture of surveillance in which workers’ social media accounts were allegedly monitored for statements about the campaign and where workers were “interrogated” about support for the union.
Many of these allegations were also the subject of a Feb. 7 unfair labor practice complaint filed by CAUSE that remains open, including a claim that workers were explicitly asked to report union activity to management and that Amazon selectively targeted known union supporters for disciplinary action.

These claims have been a persistent subject of CAUSE’s labor complaints long before the union card campaign concluded, with their attorneys writing in a May 2023 unfair labor practice complaint that Amazon was “instructing its employees to file internal complaints against supporters of [CAUSE]” and launching investigations against organizers to search for cause to terminate them.
The union alleges that interference with the election effort came to a head on Dec. 7, 2024, when three organizers not employed by Amazon were arrested by Garner Police on trespassing charges as they sought to pass out food and collect union cards outside the warehouse. Days later, Amazon also terminated Brown, the union co-founder, citing inflammatory remarks likening company management to slaveholders and labeling a defender of the company an “Uncle Tom.”
Hards declined to comment on the broader allegations of coercion and surveillance, but wrote that the company was within its rights to seek the removal of non-employees from its property during the Dec. 7 incident.
“Last December, several individuals who aren’t Amazon employees or partners came on to our property and refused multiple requests to leave,” Hards wrote. “After repeated attempts to remedy the situation and consistent with our standard protocols, we engaged law enforcement for assistance. Those individuals were eventually arrested after refusing to follow the police officer’s orders.”
She also condemned Brown for what she described as efforts to “push misinformation to the media” on his arrest and said his dismissal was the result of “repeated misconduct” including the use of “derogatory and racist language,” which the company had previously investigated. “His most recent violation resulted in his termination because we don’t tolerate that type of inappropriate behavior at Amazon.”

During this same period, Amazon alleges that union supporters tore down posters encouraging workers to vote no, labeling the actions as “acts of property damage.” CAUSE contends in its own complaint that scores of pro-union posters and signage from inside and outside the facility were destroyed — including signs posted in the break room and banners supporting the union hanging on the public sidewalk outside the warehouse.
Despite these setbacks, the card campaign succeeded in January after organizers collected signatures from more than 30% of workers comprising the prospective bargaining unit. But in February, they lost by a roughly three-to-one margin, a result that indicated there had been a falloff of support in the critical month leading up to the election — a result that Medelius said came as “a blow” in the moment.
“Ultimately, just looking at it, we knew that historically and logically we were facing an uphill battle from the very beginning,” Medelius said. “Everybody that’s a professional labor organizer has told us, you’re never gonna win the first time.”
‘This election hasn’t stopped the train’
On Friday, organizers with CAUSE once again set up their tents outside RDU1 — their first demonstration on-site since the election. As they renewed their pitch to workers, the company began work on a new eight-foot fence along the property line.
“My biggest fear leading up to the election was if there is a loss, or if there is a big loss with a big margin like what happened, that we would just collapse — that’s what Amazon pretty much hopes, right?” Medelius said. “But with us, I mean, the next day we had a meeting, that Sunday, and it was one of our most attended meetings. There were even people that voted no that were there and trying to figure out how we can build a better union.”

He described a mood of “optimism and hope” among organizers as the fight moves forward and called the 829 supporters in the warehouse a strong foothold to come back and succeed in the next effort. According to NLRB rules, a union campaign can file for a new election 12 months after the conclusion of the previous one. That means organizers could give Amazon “another Christmas present this year” with a renewed card authorization campaign, Medelius said.
King said she has heard from workers who voted no and who have had a change of heart since, pointing to issues like a wave of terminations after the election and excessive enforcement of policies like cell phone restrictions and “time off task” discipline.
“That’s why we’re out here today, to let people know that we’re still here,” she said on Friday, sitting under one of the tents to meet and persuade former coworkers. “We’re not going anywhere, and we have your back, but we need y’all to have ours as well.”
After the first election effort, Medelius said, organizers now have firsthand experience with the company’s anti-union tactics, giving them a better chance at countering their messaging among workers.
“Now we know the rules, we know what we’ve got to do, and we can come in with a better strategy,” Medelius said. “It’s kind of like a boxing match, right? You lose one round, but then you jump back and win the next three, so we’re very excited to do that.”

In particular, he outlined plans to strengthen CAUSE’s Hispanic Organizing Committee and day shift and night shift organizing committees, and to begin collecting authorization cards year-round. He added that organizers had been in contact with workers at the RDU5 and DRT8 warehouses in Durham as well as facilities in South Carolina who want to begin their own efforts, but declined to offer specific information about potential future campaigns, citing the need for secrecy around organizing strategies.
Benny Koval, chair of CAUSE’s night shift organizing committee, said the immediate priority was “what we can do on the shop floor,” pushing back on issues like excessive temperatures in the facility, post-holiday rush layoffs, and mandatory overtime days — one of which was slated to be on Mother’s Day before the company backtracked after employee outcries, Koval said.
“I feel like they’re just stepping on us to see how much we’ll take to a certain extent,” Koval said.
Meanwhile, efforts to unionize Amazon continue throughout the U.S., particularly across the South. In Louisville, Kentucky, workers at the company’s KCVG Air Hub are seeking to organize through the Teamsters, and in Bessemer, Alabama, labor officials have ordered Amazon to hold a third union election after finding unlawful interference in previous attempts.
Abraham Walker, a sociology professor at Fayetteville State University, said the South poses some structural obstacles for union campaigns. Every state in the region is a “right-to-work” state, meaning that workplaces cannot make union membership compulsory and all workers are entitled to the same benefits regardless of union affiliation, creating what Walker called a “free rider problem” in which workers reap the rewards of union-bargained contracts without paying dues to support organizing efforts. And because of the low rates of union membership throughout the South, many workers do not know anyone who is a member of a union, leaving them susceptible to misinformation about union impacts, Walker said.

He noted that in Chattanooga, Tennessee, it took three elections before workers at the city’s Volkswagen plant voted to unionize the facility in 2024. Walker said a benefit of CAUSE’s status as an independent grassroots campaign is that “they’re not going anywhere.” He cited “very strong coalitions” the organizers built across the Research Triangle as a source of structural support that will allow the union to renew its efforts going forward.
“Despite the final tally, I see a lot of promise in CAUSE’s future,” Walker said. “There’s going to be a process of reassessment, I think, going forward. They will in all likelihood try to do this again — it might not be a year, it might be a few years from now, but one of the things about Amazon warehouses, which is both challenging and potentially an advantage, is the turnover’s high.”
The New York Times reported in 2021 that Amazon sees a roughly 150% turnover rate among its hourly associates each year. Medelius said this was a source of difficulty in this year’s election because many of those who signed authorization cards were already gone from the warehouse by February. But that fact can also be turned to the union campaign’s advantage, he said: many, if not most, of the 2,447 who voted against the union will no longer be with at RDU1 in a year’s time, giving organizers “a brand-new warehouse” for its next effort.
“All we’ve gotta do is keep our supporters, make sure that we keep telling them our motto, ‘Don’t quit, organize,’ and that’s the way that we’re going to out-organize them, so the plan right now is keep calling for an election — if we lose, do it again,” Medelius said.
“We’re going to organize as if we had won the election, we’re going to continue building our movement, and we’re gonna continue not just within RDU1, but all across the Carolinas,” he added. “This election hasn’t stopped the train.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P2080246-scaled-e1741104680670-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-02 06:11:57.954642

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)State and federal changes to food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are expected to start affecting Idahoans in 2026. 
The Idaho Legislature in 2025 approved restrictions on candy and soda purchases through the program, and the U.S. Congress approved an expansion of work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents on the program through the sweeping tax and spending package, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
The federal bill also removed SNAP eligibility for refugees who don’t yet have a green card; this change was implemented immediately upon its passage in July. 
There are 124,714 Idahoans receiving food assistance through SNAP as of Dec. 12. The average recipient gets around $182 monthly per beneficiary to use for groceries. 
SNAP benefits are paid for by the federal government and administered by the state. Starting in fiscal year 2028, states will for the first time in the program’s history be required to pay for some of the benefits, as well as an increased share of the administrative costs. Idaho’s expenditure on the program is expected to increase by $6 million annually, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
 Candy and soda ban to take place in early in the new year 

SNAP recipients won’t be able to purchase candy or soda with program funds starting Feb. 15, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Program payments are made through an “Electronic Benefits Transfer,” or EBT card, which can be used like a debit card at the grocery store for eligible purchases. 
Amid hearings for the candy and soda SNAP bill in the 2025 legislative session, retailers largely opposed it because of the broad definitions, which included: 

“‘Candy’ means a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops, or pieces.”
“‘Candy’ shall not include any preparation containing flour and shall require no refrigeration.” 
“‘Soda’ means any nonalcoholic beverage that contains natural or artificial sweeteners.”
“’Soda’ does not include any beverages that contain milk or milk substitutes, that are greater than 50% vegetable juice or fruit juice by volume, or that require preparation before consumption, such as powders or concentrates.” 

To enact the changes to the food program, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare had to receive permission from federal authorities through a waiver. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. signed three similar waivers in June, approving the candy soda restrictions for Idaho, Utah and Arkansas.

 Updated SNAP work requirements, delayed by government shutdown, to begin in April 

Changes made in the federal “Big Beautiful Bill” to work requirements for some SNAP beneficiaries were supposed to be implemented in November. However, disruptions caused by the federal government shutdown delayed implementation.
Idaho Health and Welfare spokesman AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun on Dec. 22 the agency was on track to make the changes in April. He said the agency intended “to absorb the changes with no request for additional staff or funding.” 
The changes will mean more people will be subject to work requirements to receive benefits. 
For able-bodied adults without dependents, there are additional work requirements to be able to use SNAP for more than three months within three years. 
To receive benefits for more than the time limit, these beneficiaries must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month, participate in a work program at least 80 hours a month, participate in a combination of work and work program for a total of at least 80 hours a month, or participate in public “workfare” for assigned number of hours a month. 
Prior to the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill, there were exemptions from this time limit for veterans, people experiencing homelessness, young people aging out of foster care, parents with children under 18, and people aged 54 and older — meaning they could continue to receive SNAP assistance for more than three months even if they weren’t working. 
The changes to these exemptions mean the following able-bodied adults will be subject to work requirements:

Removal of exemptions for veterans, those experiencing homelessness and youth aging out of foster care
Narrowed exception for parents with responsibility of children under 18 years old, to those of children under age 14
Increase of the upper age limit for the exception from 54 to 64 years old

The bill also added time-limit exemptions for Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and tribal members. 
For states to waive the work requirements, they must now show an unemployment rate over 10%, with exceptions for Alaska and Hawaii. The prior waiver allowed states to identify areas that lack sufficient jobs.

(Moe Clark/Colorado Newsline) Colorado lawmakers in 2018 unanimously approved a law that was meant to speed up the release of eligible people behind bars when state prisons got too full. But the law hasn’t worked as intended since it was triggered for the first time in mid-2025.
The so-called prison population management measures have barely made a dent in the Colorado Department of Corrections’ vacancy rate after four months, meaning state prisons remain at or near capacity without enough room for the growing prison population.
The vacancy rate in state prisons stood at 1.92% as of Aug. 16, marking the 30th consecutive day the department maintained a vacancy rate below 3%. House Bill 18-1410 requires that once that threshold is reached, the department must begin to take steps to reduce the incarcerated population in coordination with the state parole board and the Office of Community Corrections, which oversees halfway houses. At the end of December, the vacancy rate in prisons stood at 2.91%.

The law was intended to expedite existing processes to better manage the state’s prison population, not release additional people who are not eligible for parole, Christie Donner, executive director of the Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, said. 
“There aren’t going to be big numbers of releases — it’s not intended to be that — but it’s a way of identifying and expediting processes, removing some of the barriers so that there can be a responsiveness to when they’re running out of beds,” Donner said. 
Rändi Moore, chair of the Colorado State Board of Parole, said the board has reviewed 88 people who met the criteria of the prison population management measures law. Of those reviewed, only 29 have been released from prison.
An incarcerated person needs to have a parole plan approved by the DOC’s Division of Adult Parole before the parole board evaluates the viability of housing and employment options in the plan, Moore said. DOC spokesperson Alondra Garcia-Gonzalez said the department secures and vets housing for someone eligible for parole, but the parole board has the final authority to approve a plan.










I think the short answer is it's not doing much.


– Justin Brakke, legislative policy analyst


Some paroles, when they occur after an incarcerated person’s eligibility but before their mandatory parole date, are discretionary. But discretionary parole releases have dropped since the law took effect.
When during a recent meeting Colorado lawmakers asked about the effectiveness of the state’s prison population management measures, Justin Brakke, a nonpartisan legislative policy analyst, said, “I think the short answer is it’s not doing much.”
Parole qualifications under the law are very restrictive, and it excludes certain violent crimes, Brakke said. The Office of Community Corrections is required by the law to identify open beds that DOC can use on a weekly basis until the vacancy rate rises above 4% for 30 consecutive days. But Brakke said the DOC doesn’t have authority to put people in those beds — the local boards of those community corrections centers do. 
Community corrections has higher turnover rates, which makes bed counts more fluid, and many halfway houses are coed with fewer women than men, while the need remains higher for men, said Brian Hulse, chair-elect for the Colorado Community Corrections Coalition.
The average length of stay for someone in community corrections during the 2024-2025 fiscal year was 259 days, Division of Criminal Justice spokesperson Paula Vargas said. People can be sentenced right to community corrections so they don’t have to go to prison, but others go to community corrections while transitioning out of prison.

Community corrections programs that are coed have a set number of beds for men and for women, Hulse said, but when there aren’t women to fill their designated beds, those available beds will sit empty despite the demand for the male population. 
The location of open community corrections beds affects availability too, because halfway houses are meant to reintegrate people back into the community they came from, Hulse said. 
“We might have beds open in a rural area, but not necessarily the right fit for clients that need to go to that community, whereas the demand might be in an urban area where a particular program or jurisdiction might be at capacity too,” Hulse said. 
Mark Wester, the outgoing chair of the Colorado Community Corrections Coalition, said that while there is always opportunity to maximize unused capacity in community corrections, providers have seen an uptick since the prison population management measures took effect. But the need for more community corrections beds is there, too. 
“I think that the entire system is trying to respond to the increased demand from prisons, and we’re very aware that the Department of Corrections is at the 3% vacancy threshold,” Wester said. “So the coalition members have been really working hard to make sure that we accommodate as many people as possible.”
County jail backlog
The backlog of people in county jail waiting to be transferred to state prisons further exacerbates population issues. The Joint Budget Committee approved funding in September for 153 additional beds specifically intended to address the backlog. While those beds helped the department make progress in October and November, when the backlog dropped to about 330 people, Garcia-Gonzalez said it is back up to 590 people awaiting intake. The state budgets for just over 250 people to be temporarily held in county jails. 
Now that the prison population management measures law has been “beta tested,” Donner said, she hopes the department and state legislators will seek to make changes to improve the effectiveness of the law. 
“There are things that we can be doing to manage the prison population, so our hope is there’s appetite for that,” Donner said.
Donner said she would want to see more specific actions outlined that everyone within the system needs to take to reduce the prison population, because the law in its current form only requires that state leaders — including the governor, the parole board and district attorneys — are notified of the low vacancy threshold. Hulse said the law has heightened awareness among providers, at least in community corrections, of the need and the demand. 
“Awareness around what the state is facing from a prison population management standpoint I think brings more acuity to decisions made and efficiency in which those decisions are made,” Hulse said.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Pennsylvania is likely to play a crucial role in determining the balance of power in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections, with four U.S. House seats expected to be competitive — more than any other state. 
“Each of these districts are within a couple of points,” said pollster Berwood Yost of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. “There aren’t a lot of competitive districts across the United States, and so both parties want to retain those districts.” 
Yost is the director of the Center for Opinion Research and the director of the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at the school
Tight margins in three races — two of which were Republican pick-ups in 2024 — make them targets for Democrats looking to regain control of the House. Another seat in the Philadelphia suburbs is a perennial goal for the Democratic Party, but voters have remained loyal to the GOP.
Though all 19 of the commonwealth’s congressional districts will be on the ballot next year, the four closely watched races and their incumbents are: 

First Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick
7th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie
8th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan 
10th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Scott Perry

But Yost noted challenges for the quartet.
October poll results from F&M, overseen by Yost, reported 36% of respondents felt “worse off” financially than they were a year ago in the commonwealth. One area where prices will increase substantially in 2026 are health care costs for moderate-income Pennsylvanians using marketplace plans. 
Congress opted not to extend enhanced subsidies at this time, which Yost said would be “an albatross” on candidates.

“It makes all of these people vulnerable,” he continued. “Because everybody’s going to know somebody who either drops their coverage or is complaining about what they’re paying for coverage.”
Three of those Republicans — Fitzpatrick, Mackenzie and Bresnahan — signed onto a discharge petition on Dec. 17 to force a vote on extending subsidies, breaking with party leadership.
That poll also identified a drop in President Donald Trump’s popularity, with 41% believing he was doing an “excellent” or “good” job, compared to 58% who believed he was doing a “fair” or “poor” job.
“There’s a relationship between seats lost and presidential popularity,” said Yost. “The less popular the president, the more seats they tend to lose.” 
Neither Mackenzie nor Bresnahan have a long congressional record in their districts, making them more at risk, Yost said. Fitzpatrick and Perry, on the other hand, have both held onto their seats against previous challenges. 
 The greater political climate

James Markley, a spokesperson for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, told the Capital-Star that next year wouldn’t be much different from previous cycles.
“2026 will be a challenge, but Pennsylvania is the ultimate swing state. Our elections are always competitive,” he said. 
Wins from 2024 — from Trump down to two congressional seats that flipped from Democratic to Republican — were “tremendous victories,” he added.
“New members like Congressman Ryan MacKenzie and Congressman Rob Bresnahan are already leaving their mark on our country. Our goal is to make sure we send them back to D.C. to continue the hard work they’re doing everyday for our commonwealth and our country.”
Congressional health insurance tug-o-war puts Pennsylvanians in a lurch

But as Trump’s approval ratings fall, Democrats across the nation hope to tie sitting Republicans to his administration. 
“All four of Pennsylvania’s swing-seat Republican congressmen are uniquely vulnerable due to their own failures and self-inflicted wounds: Bresnahan has become the poster-child of Washington corruption and is stock trading away his seat, Mackenzie is a late-night TV punchline for taking marching orders from his party bosses, Fitzpatrick has become Trump’s doormat, and Perry is so extreme that he disparaged veterans who don’t share his politics,” said Eli Cousin, the Mid-Atlantic regional press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
“What Bresnahan, Mackenzie, Fitzpatrick, and Perry all have in common is the fact that they have overseen skyrocketing costs on everything from health care to groceries to electricity – and they will be held accountable for their records at the ballot box next November,” he continued.
Voters in midterm elections frequently turn to the minority party in Congress, but could also boost a Pennsylvania politician who is believed to have national ambitions. 
As reported by Axios, Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is running for re-election next year, seeks to “engineer a blowout” in the 2026 midterms in order to gain an edge ahead of the 2028 presidential primaries. At the heart of the strategy: flipping all four congressional seats.
Two candidates openly have the backing of Shapiro in central Pennsylvania, and he appears to have favorites in the other districts, according to the publication. 
 1st Congressional District: a Philly suburb
Straddling two Philadelphia collar counties — Bucks County and part of Montgomery County — U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican, has retained the seat even as the district swung between the two parties in 2020 and 2024 elections. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, PA-01. (Official photo)
A former special assistant U.S. attorney and FBI agent, Fitzpatrick succeeded his brother, Mike, and won a seat for the first time in 2016. A Fitzpatrick has represented the area since 2008.
In 2024, Fitzpatrick earned re-election with 56% of the vote, more than 59,000 votes ahead of Democratic challenger Ashley Ehasz. 
Politico analysts believe that the 2025 election results could spell trouble for the incumbent, however, after Democrats won several local seats. Most recently, Inside Elections moved the district from “likely Republican” to “leans,” citing November’s results in the area. 
Across the aisle, a slate of Democrats have filed to to run against Fitzpatrick, including: 

Bucks County Commission Chair Bob Harvie
Delaware Valley University professor Tracy Hunt
Attorney Lucia Dora Simonelli 
And eyewear company manager Robert Strickler

Axios reported that Shapiro has “quietly” backed Harvie, though it isn’t official. John Hoban, an independent, is also running for the seat.
 7th Congressional District: A Lehigh Valley “toss-up”

Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, PA-07. (Official photo)
One of the most competitive seats in the country is expected to be the 7th Congressional District, nestled in the Lehigh Valley. 
Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican, edged out incumbent Democrat Susan Wild with 50.5% of the vote, a 4,000-vote margin, in 2024. Wild had two terms under her belt. 
Roll Call ranks Mackenzie as the fourth most “vulnerable” incumbent, and all three major election forecasters (The Cook Political Report, Sabato’s Crystal Ball and Inside Elections) label the race as a “toss-up.”
But the national Republican fundraising arm seems to hope for a bruising primary, pointing to a December Politico report on “deep divisions” within Democrat ranks. A Dec. 1 post from the GOP called the primary “a microcosm of the whole party: messy, out of touch, and having no clear direction.” 
Running for the Democratic nomination: 

Bob Brooks, firefighter and president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association 
Former federal prosecutor Ryan Crosswell
Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure 
Former PPL Electrics Utilities executive Carol Obando-Derstine
Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley

Combined, the six Democratic contenders raised more than $1.5 million by October, months ahead of the May 19 primary vote. 
Shapiro endorsed Brooks in December, headlining a fundraiser for the candidate later that month. Obando-Derstine has the support of Wild, who previously held the seat, and an endorsement from Emily’s List, an abortion rights organization. 
 8th Congressional District: Stocks and Scranton

Though Trump solidly won the Pocono-based district, boosting Republican Rob Bresnahan’s 2024 victory to flip the longtime Democrat-held seat, questions over stock trades have plagued the incumbent.
Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, PA-08. (Official photo)
In 2024, Bresnahan defeated incumbent Democrat Matt Cartwright with nearly 51% of the vote, or more than 6,000 votes. In that time, he has made over 600 stock trades, some of which came ahead of crucial votes — spurring accusations that he used his position to make advantageous trading decisions.
One such vote includes the decision to sharply cut federal Medicaid funding by adding work requirements and limiting state oversight on provider taxes. The New York Times reports that Bresnahan sold between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of bonds issued by the Allegheny County Hospital Development Authority for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
He also sold up to $15,000 of stock in Centene, the country’s largest Medicaid plan provider. NBC News additionally reported another $130,000 in Medicaid-related stocks Bresnahan sold. 
In defense of his moves, Bresnahan said he doesn’t tell his financial advisors what to do with stock purchases. 
The freshman lawmaker, whose initial wealth came from the sale of his family’s construction business, campaigned on the promise to end lawmaker stock trading. In December, he signed a petition to force a vote on a bill to ban congressional stock trading. 
The Democratic contenders are: 

Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti
Francis McHale, a former attorney with the state Dept. of Labor and Industry 
And Scranton-based Eric Stone

Cognetti launched her bid for the seat while running for reelection this fall, followed by McHale, who criticized Cognetti for the dual campaigns. 
Shapiro has “quietly” backed Cognetti, according to Axios. 
 10th Congressional District: a 2024 rematch

While the other three Republicans don’t yet have challengers within their own party, the same can’t be said for U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a retired Army National Guard brigadier general who served in Iraq. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, PA-10. (Official photo)
Representing the 10th Congressional District, which includes all of Dauphin County and parts of Cumberland and York counties, at least two GOP challengers have lined up: Karen Dalton, a former staff attorney at the capitol, and Josh Hall.
Along with Mackenzie’s Lehigh Valley seat, Perry’s race is considered to be a toss-up by election ratings agencies. Perry has held a seat in Congress since 2013 and previously served in the state legislature.
He won re-election two years ago by less than 51%, just over 5,000 votes ahead of Democrat Janelle Stelson, a former television news anchor. Stelson has the nod from Shapiro, who headlined a fundraiser campaign launch for her in July. 
Stelson also faces a primary before a potential rematch against Perry. Also running for the Democratic nomination are: 

Carlisle-based Jason Cass
Dauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas
And Army veteran William Lillich

Independent Isabella Harman, also an Army veteran, is also running for the seat. 
Within this district and other competitive primaries, Yost noted that the right primary candidate can make a difference. 
“For both parties, there have been times when base primary voters deliver a candidate that suffers at the general election,” said Yost. 
Following the May primaries, the general election will be Nov. 3, 2026.
“I think the fundamental question underlying all of these races is, ‘How big is the anti-Trump sentiment? How large is the wave or how well can these congressional Republicans separate themselves from people’s feelings about Trump?” Yost said. “We’ll have to wait and see.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7425-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-02 10:11:41.531426

Joseph Shekarchi, background. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Heading into his sixth year leading the chamber, Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has mastered the art of satisfying a flurry of funding requests despite an ever-present budget deficit.
This year feels different. 
“It’s going to be a challenging year,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat, said in an interview in mid-December. “It’s going to be by far, the most challenging year I’ve had as speaker.”
The biggest source of his holiday headache: the federal government, which under President Donald Trump has upended once-reliable federal funding streams for state and local government. 
Nearly $135 million in federal grants for state energy programs, infrastructure projects, public health initiatives and education programs have been cut off, or rendered inaccessible due to new strings attached to the money, according to an Oct. 30 analysis by the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget. Meanwhile, major changes to federal health care and food assistance programs under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will kick tens of thousands of vulnerable residents off critical safety net programs, simultaneously forcing state agencies to invest millions of dollars in personnel, IT and consultants to meet new federal mandates. 
The most sweeping changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) don’t kick in for one or more years. But legislative leaders are trying to prepare now for the financial and human costs.
“Everything is on the table,” Senate President Valarie Lawson said in a separate interview. “There’s tremendous need here in Rhode Island, and we can’t abandon these people.” 
Lawson is fresh to the role, having ascended in the final throes of the 2025 session. Her rise to power was fraught with tension and grief after the death of her predecessor, former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, in April. 
Lawson, an East Providence Democrat and president of the state teachers union, acknowledged the public controversy permeating the upper chamber even before Ruggerio’s death. But the wounds inflicted by the Trump administration might offer a chance for lawmakers to find common ground in standing against federal funding cuts and policy changes.
“Most people who are here really feel like their priority is to get things done for Rhode Island, just like it’s my priority, and that’s our driving force here,” Lawson said. “We’re all professional here, and I really do think that members of this chamber care about policy, and this is where they want the energy of the chamber to be as well.”

Here are the top talking points when the gavel bangs on Tuesday, Jan. 6, marking the start to a new session: 
Health care 
Looming Medicaid cuts will kick 33,500 Rhode Islanders off the government health benefits program by the end of 2026. But Rhode Island’s fragile health care system is already suffering. 
Uncompetitive reimbursement rates with neighboring states have sapped the state’s supply of health care providers, including primary care doctors and nurses. 
Insurance premiums have spiked by double-digit percentages, yet insurance companies are still struggling to remain solvent amid rising health care costs of their own. Cash-strapped hospitals can’t keep up with the volume or cost of uninsured patients, a situation that will grow more dire if the buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital can’t close the deal by mid-January.
The two safety net hospitals have ridden a roller coaster of uncertainty since their owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, filed for bankruptcy in January 2024. Prospective buyer The Centurion Foundation is still struggling to secure the investor-backed bonds needed to finalize the purchase and prevent the facilities from imminent closure.
The two hospitals treated 50,000 emergency room visitors last year and employ more than 2,700 people. But legislative leaders have not yet suggested forking over state funding to keep them afloat as Mass Gov. Maura Healey did in 2024 after Steward Health Care filed for bankruptcy and sold its Massachusetts hospitals.
Shekarchi and Lawson are still hoping Centurion will close the sale by a Jan. 15 deadline set in federal bankruptcy court in Texas. If not?
“Then there might be more efforts in the state,” Shekarchi said. 
Even if Centurion closes the sale successfully, he’s anticipating some “asks” from the nonprofit buyer, though what and from whom remain unclear.
“We’ll address that when we get there, but we have to close the deal first,” Shekarchi said.
Lawson said keeping Roger Williams and Fatima open is “paramount to our health care system.” 
The Senate’s 2026 policy wish list features other health care items, too: creating a medical school at the University of Rhode Island, banning insurance companies from requiring pre-authorization for mental health visits — piggybacking on the 2025 law that ended pre-authorizations for primary care — and regulating pharmacy benefit managers to make prescriptions more affordable. 
“When we talk about health care, we’re looking at short-term, medium- and long-term,” Lawson said. “We need a fully functioning health care system so we have affordable, attainable access to health care.”
Creating a medical school at URI would cost $225 million over the first decade, including substantial state contributions along with private and philanthropic funding, according to a preliminary report commissioned by a state consultant. 
“It’s an expensive proposition, and it’s long,” Shekarchi said, noting the 10 years it would take before doctors graduated and were serving the community. 
A legislative commission exploring the topic is expected to issue a final report in January.

Education, housing 
Also costly: drastic changes to the education funding formula. A task force created by the Rhode Island Foundation has recommended major overhauls to the calculations that fund local education districts, including placing a greater responsibility on the state to level the playing field for low-income students and non-native English speakers.
Lawson and Shekarchi both said they were aware of the forthcoming report, but said it was too early to comment.  
Lawson, who spent more than three decades as a teacher in East Providence Public Schools, remains hungry to expand access to free school meals to all students, regardless of income, as nine other states have done.
“I still think it’s really important, because it’s removing an obstacle for kids to succeed,” Lawson said. “Kids who are fed, they achieve higher standards and test scores.”
The $40 million price tag has been a sticking point in recent years across both sides of the rotunda, but lawmakers are exploring ways to boost federal spending to cover the costs, Lawson said.
If education is Lawson’s strong suit, Shekarchi has made housing his focus tackling the many local land use rules making it harder to build and renovate fast and affordably. He again expects to release a multi-bill housing package this year that would cut red tape in local and state housing laws, though he’s awaiting final recommendations from the pair of legislative commissions considering housing affordability and land use. 
Workforce 
Intertwined with housing availability and affordability is the state’s talent pool. Fresh off the loss of Hasbro Inc., which cemented plans to abandon its century-old Rhode Island roots for a fresh new office in Boston’s Seaport district by the end of 2026, Shekarchi is keeping in close contact with other major state employers like CVS Health and FM. So far, executives at these companies have not given any hints they intend to abandon or reduce their local footprints, Shekarchi said.
Keeping major corporations happy relies not only on face time with Smith Hill leaders; they want access to workers, something Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said was a major reason why the toy and gaming empire is moving to Boston. 
That’s why the Rhode Island Senate has thrown its weight behind a $65 million “workforce innovation center” at the Community College of Rhode Island’s Warwick campus. The new building, funded via borrowing put to voters on the November 2026 ballot, would serve as a centralized hub for career and technical programs in critical industries like health care, defense, manufacturing, IT, construction and renewable energy, according to informational materials provided by the Senate on CCRI’s behalf.

Eye on 2026 elections 
Eleven months out, conversations over candidates seeking state office in 2026 are flowing, including speculation over whether Shekarchi will run for governor. Shekarchi remained tight-lipped, promising an announcement sometime in the first quarter. 
Gov. Dan McKee and his 2022 rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes, are already jousting in what is shaping up to be a competitive Democratic primary, while a handful of Republicans have declared their candidacies, including former aide to Gov. Don Carcieri, Aaron Guckian.
All 113 members of the legislature will also be up for reelection in 2026 — an unspoken yet obvious factor that hangs over Smith Hill every two years. A trio of incumbent Democrats already face challengers propped up by a new, conservative-leaning political action committee, The League of RI Businesses. 
Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone and Majority Whip David Tikoian’s attendance at fundraisers for two of the legislative challengers raised eyebrows. But Lawson has stayed away from the debate, and even Ciccone said he has not decided whether he will back his niece, Laura Turini, in her campaign to unseat Sen. Bridget Valverde of  North Kingstown.
Lawson and Ciccone appeared an unlikely pairing when matched in April, with starkly different views on guns, abortion and other social issues. But Lawson sees value in a number two with different opinions; after all, it’s the same dynamic that characterized her relationship with Ruggerio as his majority leader last year.
“We all have to deal with different opinions and thoughts in the chamber, so I think it’s an asset,” she said.
And without major gun safety legislation on the horizon this year — at least, not yet — their policy differences might remain more veiled.

Tax the rich revisited 
Ciccone and Lawson share interest in a tax on top earners, though Ciccone draws the line at $1 million minimum. 
In 2025, proposed legislation sought to add a 3% surtax on the top 1% of earners, which would affect roughly 5,700 state tax filers who earned $625,000 or more. It failed to advance in either chamber.
“Those are middle class people, still saving,” Ciccone said of the lower threshold.
Lawson said she was open to either version of a tax on top earners, noting the need to generate more income as federal funding shrinks. A 3% tax on the top 1% of earners would bring in $190 million annually for the state, according to analysis coupled with the 2025 bill.
Shekarchi reverted to his signature phrase when asked about his interest in a wealth tax.
“It’s all on the table,” he said.
Massachusetts voters in 2022 approved a ballot measure adding a 4% surtax on income over $1 million. But the Commonwealth exempts taxes after death on estates up to $2 million — a higher threshold than the $1.8 million exemption limit in Rhode Island..
“We need to be comparable to what our neighbors are doing,” Shekarchi said.
McKee, who gets first crack at a fiscal 2027 spending plan, also signaled new openness to a tax on high earners in an interview with the Providence Journal.

Washington Bridge
While legislative leaders get final say in the state’s annual tax and spending plan, Shekarchi deferred to the executive branch on what’s next for the Washington Bridge.
Coming off what he considered a “successful” oversight hearing in November led by former U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha, Shekarchi did not see additional action items for the legislature to take on.
“This is an executive function, and we’re waiting for the governor’s budget, we’re waiting for the transcript from the hearing, and we’re also waiting for some information to come from the [Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT)]” Shekarchi said.
Lawson, who travels the traffic-snarled span each day to and from work, said she was focused on restoring both the infrastructure and public faith in government.

RIPTA
The cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority faces a projected deficit of nearly $15 million for fiscal 2027, despite lawmakers directing new revenue sources to the transit agency through gas taxes and the state highway maintenance account in 2025. Yet RIPTA was still forced to enact sweeping service cuts to two-thirds of its routes starting last fall. 
Shekarchi still sees room to “right-size” the agency, reducing frequency of low-ridership routes and overhead cost. The long-awaited efficiency study published in August also focused on slashing service to close the perennial agency budget gap.
Transit advocates have questioned the seemingly singular focus among lawmakers on cutting costs at RIPTA, while expenses at other behemoth state agencies, including RIDOT, swell.
Shekarchi acknowledged that other branches of government could benefit from some scrutiny of returns on investment. 
But, he continued, “We’re not a business, we’re not a corporation. We serve people.”

Lightning round Q & A
Will Sen. Frank Ciccone keep his federal firearms license? 
Yes. The Providence Democrat says he has “no interest” in giving up the license, and recently received a call from “someone looking for something,” although he hasn’t sold a gun since December 2024. 
Is Sen. Val Lawson reconsidering giving up her day job amid continued scrutiny of ethical conflicts?
No. The Senate President insists she is no different than any other member of the part-time legislature, many of whom also face personal and professional conflicts in certain bills.
Has House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi smoothed things over with Gov. Dan McKee?
It seems like it. Despite the governor refusing to sign the fiscal 2026 budget, prompting harsh words exchanged with legislative leaders, Shekarchi said he still has a “good working relationship” with the executive branch.
Will there be legislation related to the Brown University mass shooting?
Too soon to tell. House Majority Leader Christopher Blazejewski, who lives in the East Side neighborhood where the shooting occurred, said his family and the wider community will be “forever changed” by the tragedy.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/Maine Morning Star) When Maine lawmakers return to Augusta in January, they will face an agenda shaped as much by federal policy shifts as by ongoing state issues held over from last session, including rising health care and energy costs, immigration enforcement, tribal sovereignty, and a justice system strained by chronic underfunding.
Hundreds of bills were carried over from the first of the two-year session of the 132nd Legislature. But since then, the future of several safety net programs that help Mainers with food, health care and utility costs have become increasingly uncertain due to federal policy changes: tens of thousands of Mainers are bracing for higher insurance premiums, electricity rates are slated to increase, and new work requirements go into place for federal food assistance programs. 
The Legislature will have to decide if and how the state can fill in funding gaps left by federal changes.
At the same time, lawmakers are expected to revisit contentious debates that stalled last year, including over data privacy protections, tribal sovereignty, and how far Maine should go in insulating local communities from federal immigration enforcement.
Many of the issues lawmakers will confront next year are not new, but advocates have told Maine Morning Star the stakes are higher now. In several policy areas, legislators will be forced to choose between incremental fixes and broader structural reforms, which could shape Maine’s economic and legal landscape for years to come.
Here’s a look at some of the major issues lawmakers will consider:
Health care
Approximately 60,000 Mainers are expecting to see health care costs skyrocket because of the pending expiration of enhanced premium tax credits, which subsidize the cost of marketplace health insurance for millions of Americans. That combined with federal changes to eligibility for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program that provides coverage for thousands of low-income families, health care will be a priority for the Legislature to tackle next session.
The increasing cost of MaineCare was the source of last year’s $118 million budget shortfall, which Democrats plugged with the two-year budget passed by the majority party in March.

While there are no specific bills carried over from last session to address additional health care funding gaps projected due to federal rollbacks, lawmakers can utilize placeholder bills, such as LD 378, titled “An Act to Strengthen Health Care in Maine,” as well as the supplemental budget to appropriate needed funds. 
The Legislature’s health insurance committee will take up at least two relevant bills  —  LD 910, which would increase transparency in health insurance reporting, and LD 961, which would remove some barriers for nurse practitioners to provide care — carried over from last session when lawmakers reconvene.
Immigration 
Gov. Janet Mills last month announced her intention to allow certain restrictions on local involvement in federal immigration enforcement to become law (though that won’t take effect until later in 2026). 
But that does not mean lawmakers won’t be continuing to debate how the state should intervene in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. 
The bill the governor is letting become law, LD 1971, places restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements with federal authorities, which is currently the case for all local and state agencies in Maine. But lawmakers carried over into the next session a related bill LD 1259, which would explicitly prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from entering into formal agreements of that sort. 
Lawmakers will also consider several new immigration-related bills, including proposals focused on protecting against erroneous detentions, preventing immigration enforcement in places like schools and hospitals, and clarifying language to ensure jails can refuse to detain people on civil immigration offenses on behalf of federal authorities. 
Read more about these bills here. 
Energy costs
As energy costs continue to rise, lawmakers across the political spectrum have said they are committed to finding ways to alleviate the pressure on Maine ratepayers. 
In late November, the Public Utilities Commission announced new electricity prices for 2026. Both Central Maine Power and Versant customers can expect to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
Last session, legislators passed a law that is meant to lower the cost of net energy billing, a renewable energy credit program that receives a lot of blame for rising costs, though regulators have said the increases have more to do with the volatility of natural gas and other fossil fuel prices.
One idea that will be on the table in 2026 is an energy tax credit. There are two proposals — one from a Republican and one from a Democrat — seeking to use this as a mechanism to offset costs for Maine households. 
With one of the bills carried over from last session, Rep. Kilton Webb (D-Durham) is proposing new legislation that would create a $50 a month tax credit for qualifying low-income ratepayers.
Details are not yet available for another new bill, sponsored by Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc), titled: “An Act to Reduce Household Energy Costs and Increase Appliance Affordability in Response to Federal Cuts.”
Wabanaki rights 
The movement to return more sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations is poised to continue in the upcoming legislative session with both sweeping and piecemeal proposals. 
The Penobscot Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and Mi’kmaq Nation — collectively known as the Wabanaki Nations — are treated differently than other federally recognized tribes, more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations because of a 1980 land settlement agreement. 
Wabanaki leaders reflect on gains as Legislature poised to revisit sovereignty proposals

Wabanaki leaders have said that their Tribes signed the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act to get fair compensation for stolen lands, not to give up the level of sovereignty that has been interpreted by the state and courts to date. 
Two bills that the Legislature will contemplate next year are nearly identical to past proposals that were blocked either by Mills or through the Legislature’s opaque funding process.  
LD 785 is omnibus legislation that would implement the remaining recommendations of the 2019 state task force that studied the issue, while LD 395 focuses on just one of the recommendations, restoring the Wabanaki Nations’ access to beneficial federal laws. 
Among the many federal laws that do not apply to the Wabanaki Nations is one that offers federally recognized tribes the right to exclusively regulate and take in revenue from gambling on tribal lands.
Lawmakers earlier this year attempted to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine and afford the Tribes more revenue from gambling at private casinos. The latter legislation is being carried over into next session, while the igaming bill was held by the governor, meaning Mills can either veto it within the first three days of session or allow it to become law without her signature.
Data privacy 
The Maine Legislature has debated how aggressive the state should be in protecting consumer privacy online for the past several years. But competing proposals — along with sizable behind-the-scenes influence from lobbyists — have left the state without a comprehensive data privacy law. 
When lawmakers return in January, the issue will again be in play. 
There remains stiff opposition from some lawmakers and local businesses to the stricter proposal, even though it’s been the favorite of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee so far. 
This plan mirrors a law that took effect in Maryland in October, a deviation from the more than a dozen states that have adopted a model favored by industry groups. 
Some of the resistance is similar to that seen in Maryland, including concerns about untested language, but businesses are also worried about financial impacts on top of an already uncertain economic landscape, including President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Indigent defense 
Despite a dire lack in funding for Maine’s public defender system and hundreds of indigent defendants waiting for their court-appointed attorneys, the Legislature last session failed to make up for a $13 million budget shortfall. The Maine Commission on Public Defense Services needs that money to continue to pay their rostered attorneys, who take up a bulk of indigent defense cases, past April. 
As Maine continues internet privacy debate, another state’s law could provide insight

Lawmakers on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee were caught between two competing realities, co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) explained in September: “The need for [Public Defense Services] to have additional funding and the lack of a surplus of resources for the Legislature to appropriate.”
Several bills related to indigent defense, including some broader reforms that were carried over, will be taken up this coming session. These include LD 1941, which would reestablish parole, and LD 449, which proposes conditional discharge for certain defendants — reforms that advocates believe would help alleviate the backlog and the hundreds of Mainers that have routinely be held in jail awaiting representation
Waste
With the facility that takes more than half of Maine’s landfill waste expected to reach capacity in just a couple years, lawmakers have been trying to balance environmental concerns with the state’s growing trash problem. 
Last legislative session more than half a dozen bills were introduced to address relations between the Juniper Ridge Landfill and its Old Town neighbors, as well as the waste itself that ends up in the landfill. 
Lawmakers and advocates in October toured three waste facilities to see for themselves how the state is handling the roughly 1.8 million tons of waste generated each year. 
Much of the debate last session involved loopholes that permit out-of-state construction debris to be trucked into Maine. Casella, which operates Juniper Ridge, has argued it’s necessary to stabilize the wet sludge waste at the facility.
Legislative leaders approved an emergency proposal, LD 2070 from Rep. James Dill (D-Old Town),that would prohibit the state Department of Environmental Protection from issuing landfill expansion permits that would alter freshwater wetlands. 
This proposal comes after the state signaled its support for expanding Juniper Ridge, despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation. Environmental advocates argued against the expansion in court this summer.

(Photo by Marcus Ingram for the Virginia Mercury)When the Indiana state Senate recently rejected a mid-cycle partisan redistricting of its congressional delegation, it was not only a rebuke to President Donald J. Trump; it also upheld a norm that has guided American democracy for more than a century.
Since the early 1900s, states have almost never redrawn congressional maps outside the decennial census, except to comply with court orders or to make minor technical corrections. That restraint has served an important stabilizing function. 
History suggests that midcycle gerrymanders lead to greater division and polarization, and more volatility in the Congress. And the impact may hit closer to home, if Virginia voters uphold Democratic legislators’ current effort to reshape the state’s political maps.
 Earlier fights

America has experienced mid-decade redistricting battles before, including a failed attempt in Virginia’s legislature by GOP leaders in 2013 but they have largely been confined to the 19th century.Between 1870 and 1896, mapmaking became a weapon in a relentless partisan war. And the federal courts largely ignored review of these plans.
During this period, “partisan gerrymandering” was indistinguishable from “racial gerrymandering,” as Black voters were a monolithic Republican voting bloc targeted by Democrats, primarily in the South, which was rebuilding after losing the Civil War and facing scores of newly franchised voters who had previously been enslaved. Democrats in Alabama redrew congressional maps in the mid-1870s to pack nearly all Black Belt counties into a single district to reduce Republican seats.
Ill-fated GOP plot foreshadowed Democrats’ plans for 2026 redistricting redo

Ohio was the biggest culprit in the 19th century redistricting wars. It had the third-largest congressional delegation at the time behind New York and Pennsylvania. As control of the state’s General Assembly flipped between Republicans and Democrats between 1876 and 1892, partisans in the legislature redrew maps seven times, creating massive swings in the makeup of their congressional delegation, and influencing which party had the majority in the U.S. House.
Like today, the impetus for these state actions came from national leaders. In 1878, the Democratic Speaker of the House implored Ohio and Missouri to act to save their majority. The two states complied, flipping nine seats to the Democrats and preserving their slim majority in the House.
Because the U.S. House was smaller then (293 members in 1878 versus 435  today), small swings in congressional delegations had greater impact. And, like today, small party majorities in the House made partisan gerrymanders attractive options to gain an advantage or fight the opposition.
In 1888, for example, Republicans in Pennsylvania responded to Ohio’s efforts by carving 21 pro-Republican districts out of 28 statewide, just enough to move the House into GOP hands.
The era was marked by shifting majorities, rapidly redrawn maps, and sudden swings in the size and orientation of state delegations. There were fewer states, no “one person, one vote” standard, no independent commissions and virtually no judicial review. Redistricting was a political free-for-all. Party leaders gradually concluded that midcycle redistricting was creating too much chaos, and their numbers dramatically decreased after 1896.
For more than a century, we believed we had left this chaos behind.
 Back to the future: Why Texas matters

Apart from Texas in 2003 and Georgia in 2005, recent mid-cycle revisions have been rare and used mainly to correct errors or comply with court orders. 
The 2025 Texas mid-cycle gerrymander marks a return to this earlier era and has opened a new front in our partisan conflict. Conservative legislatures in Missouri and North Carolina quickly joined this Trump-supported effort to influence the mid-terms by passing new maps. 
Democrats felt they had no option and moved forward with their own plans. California voters have now authorized a new Democratically flavored map for 2026, and Virginia Democratic state legislators proclaim their desire to create a 10-1 Democratic congressional majority in a state where Republicans received 42.2% of the vote in the last gubernatorial election. New York and Illinois may soon follow, even if they wait until next year.  
States race to outmaneuver rivals, each pushing the envelope of partisan advantage. The redistricting process risks becoming a rolling, perpetual conflict rather than a once-a-decade recalibration.
 The Supreme Court’s retreat

The Supreme Court’s role is central to this shift. The  court, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, has been eroding  50 years of federal court redistricting oversight since landmark cases like Baker v. Carr (1962), which established the “one person, one vote” principle and forced states to draw districts of equal population size.  
In LULAC v. Perry (2005), the Court upheld the practice of mid-decade redistricting for partisan purposes.But its most significant decision was Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), where the Supreme Court held that federal courts should not review partisan gerrymanders, defining such disputes as “political questions.” And, in the recent Texas case, the majority ignored evidence that race was considered by the legislators and upheld the map as a “purely partisan” action — thereby shielding it from federal scrutiny.
Racial gerrymandering remains reviewable under Shaw v. Reno (1993), but the pending case of Louisiana v. Callais could restrict that avenue as well. The erosion of federal oversight returns primary authority to the states — just as in the 19th century.
 The gamble

History shows hyper-partisan maps can backfire. In the 1880s and 90s, parties would gain power in state legislatures and proceed to draw new maps with small margins for error. Missouri Democrats in 1892 engineered a 13–2 partisan advantage in its delegation — only to lose eight seats two years later when the national tides shifted and the Republican landslide brought GOP control of the U.S. House.
Texas may face similar risks. The state’s new map relies heavily on 2024 voting patterns. By 2026, an anti-Trump backlash coupled with demographic shifts — especially among Hispanic voters — could make several engineered “safe” seats unexpectedly competitive.
Barriers exist in other states as well. California has provided itself some protection against court challenges because its map enjoys the imprimatur of a constitutional amendment approved by the voters. 
Virginia legislators are trying to do the same but will need to convince voters to approve a constitutional amendment before new maps are adopted.  
Missouri’s plans are now threatened by a 300,000-signature petition drive that mayplace the GOP’s new maps directly before the public for an up-or-down vote. Expect court challenges to these maps to include arguments they are too late in the cycle to be implemented,  a claim that the Supreme Court has found appealing in the past.  
 Power in the states

As the U.S. Supreme Court withdraws from oversight, state laws and constitutions grow more significant. The problem is that every state has its own constitution, laws and precedents.  Today, eleven states already restrict mid-decade redistricting, including Colorado, where its Supreme Court struck down a 2003 Republican attempt to redraw congressional districts after the party gained control of the legislature.  Several other states permit challenges to partisan gerrymanders. 

In 2022, the Alaska Supreme Court invalidated two state senate districts as constitutional violations of equal protection. 
Michigan and Wisconsin courts have historically shown willingness to engage such claims. 
Oregon and New York constitutions explicitly prohibit map-drawing that favors or disfavors parties or incumbents.
Courts in New Mexico and Kentucky acknowledge a willingness to evaluate partisan-gerrymander claims, even as they have not yet overturned them.  
State supreme courts in North Carolina and Ohio struck down partisan gerrymanders, only to reverse themselves after political turnover on the bench.

Yet uniformity remains elusive. Courts in Kansas, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Carolina presently embrace the U.S. Supreme Court’s view that partisan gerrymanders are “political questions” better left to legislatures.  And the composition of state Supreme Courts can change dramatically, and with it, rulings on the constitutionality of partisan maps. This patchwork ensures that challenges will succeed in some states but not others, deepening an already troubling trend toward national division.
 A nation dividing itself

Texas did merely not redraw its congressional lines. It revived an old practice at precisely the moment when federal oversight is diminishing and partisan stakes are growing. The result is a redistricting system that increasingly resembles the volatile 19th-century environment — only now with a larger Congress, more diverse electorate, sophisticated data tools and far more at stake.
If this trend continues, redistricting will shift from a decennial process to a continuous political battlefield, intensifying division among the states and accelerating the geographic, political and cultural split already reshaping the nation.

(Photo illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)As pennies vanish from the American landscape, many businesses are clamoring for federal guidance on how to handle cash transactions in a penniless world.
Should retailers round up or down? Should they round in favor of the customer? Or in favor of the business?
So far, calls for federal direction have gone unanswered. Some businesses are setting their own policies, but states are now beginning to act amid growing uncertainty.
While the question revolves around only a few cents per transaction, it does raise important consumer protection and legal questions for states to consider. Retailers must weigh threats of potential lawsuits, while policymakers worry about protecting the most vulnerable consumers who rely on cash for everyday purchases.
President Donald Trump in February moved to eliminate the penny from U.S. pocketbooks, citing the high cost of minting them — about 3.7 cents per penny. But even before the coin’s final production run last month, U.S. retailers and banks were reporting widespread penny shortages.
To provide clarity, lawmakers in New York have proposed legislation mirroring Canada’s rounding standard — up or down to the nearest five cents. And officials in Georgia and Utah have issued nonbinding guidance to businesses.
“States do not have the luxury of waiting for the federal government,” said Katherine Tschopp, senior associate at government relations firm MultiState.
Complicating the issue are the growing number of jurisdictions requiring businesses to accept cash — a move aimed at protecting vulnerable consumers who may not have access to credit cards or electronic payment systems.
In November, New York became the ninth state to add such a rule, according to tracking from MultiState. At least eight major cities also require businesses to accept cash.
A bipartisan group of federal lawmakers have proposed legislation in the U.S. House and Senate to require all cash transactions be rounded to the nearest five cents, but neither proposal has made it to a floor vote.
The record-breaking federal government shutdown and heated debate on health insurance subsidies have sidelined the penny discussion, Tschopp said. She thinks the federal government will likely determine a national rounding policy — eventually. But in the meantime, she expects more states to weigh in.
New York Democratic Assemblymember John T. McDonald III said he agreed with Trump’s move to phase out the costly production of the penny. But businesses are asking for some kind of guidance now, he said.
“In the absence of federal action, I think it’s important that the states act to provide clarity — clarity for everybody: clarity for the consumer, as well as the merchant and the state,” McDonald told Stateline.
Approaches to rounding
McDonald’s proposed legislation mirrors Canada’s rounding policy following the 2012 elimination of its one-cent coin. His bill calls for so-called symmetrical rounding of after-tax cash purchases to the nearest five-cent mark. Purchases ending with one, two, six or seven cents would be rounded down. And purchases ending in three, four, eight or nine cents would be rounded up.
So, a consumer would get no cash back from a $1.99 purchase. But a retailer would hand over a nickel to someone spending $1.97.
McDonald sits on the National Conference of State Legislature’s State and Local Taxation Task Force that has been examining the penny issue. That task force has recommended symmetrical rounding as the fairest method for merchants and consumers.
McDonald noted that the NCSL group reached a bipartisan consensus on the issue. And he said he’s found no opposition from New York businesses or consumer groups on his bill.
“In this day and age where we seem to have a lot of fractious conversations on other issues, it’d be nice to find something that actually we can all agree on,” he said. “And to have it start with the good old little penny would be a good spot.”
Last month, South Dakota Republican state Sen. Tim Reed urged state lawmakers to start communicating with agencies, retailers and the public over the issue.
A co-chair of the NCSL task force, he said businesses need guidance and consumers may need reassurance. While he acknowledged concerns about “strategic pricing” — in which retailers set prices to push rounding to their advantage — the group’s report characterized that as a “limited risk.”
“Everybody’s thinking, ‘Oh, I’ll get overcharged, or I’ll get undercharged,’” Reed said at an NCSL virtual event about the penny. He said it would be good for people to know that “really this is all going to kind of wash out in the end.”
New York Democratic state Sen. James Sanders Jr. said the cash acceptance law he sponsored in 2025 ensures people without access to smartphones or banking are not excluded from commerce. That law also says customers paying with cash cannot be charged more than other buyers.
“Otherwise, you absolutely have a two-tiered system,” he said, noting that cash is “a lifeline” for working families, older adults, immigrants and small businesses.
Sanders said he would prefer for retailers to round down to the nearest nickel on cash transactions to protect consumers.
“For the large corporations, this could be a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they are steadily rounding up,” he said. While each rounding transaction represents a loss or gain of only a few cents, Sanders said, “multiply that by tens of thousands of people, and you’ve effectively raised the price of your product without any type of sanction.”
Sanders said he plans to introduce legislation on the matter soon, but added that he remains open to McDonald’s current proposal of symmetrical rounding. More than anything, he said, businesses desire some kind of guidance.
“We’re not trying to cheat business. We’re just trying not to be cheated by business,” he said. “The people I’ve been speaking to are honest souls, and they just want to know the right thing to do in a penniless society.”
A rapid change
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia struck the last penny on Nov. 12, but pennies were already scarce at that time.
By mid-November, more than 100 of the government’s 165 coin distribution sites across the country were without pennies, according to the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents major chains including CVS, Target and 7-Eleven.
In a November survey of its members, that organization found six national chains had more than 1,000 stores that had no pennies.
The association said most of its survey respondents were rounding cash transactions to the benefit of customers — always down to the nearest five cents. While it’s fair for shoppers, it’s “costing businesses millions of dollars as small amounts add up across thousands of daily cash transactions.”
While states weigh the issue, the association is pushing for a federal answer.
“We are urging the federal government to quickly address the problem, to allow for uniform adjustments by retailers that operate in a multitude of states,” Austen Jensen, the organization’s senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement to Stateline.
Other groups, including the American Bankers Association, have also pushed for federal action.
“They’re obviously concerned about it and wanting a federal fix,” said Christopher Phillips, a partner at law firm Holland & Knight. “The government fairly abruptly decided they weren’t going to mint any more pennies and these shortages of pennies spread fairly quickly across the country.”
For retailers, the problem is both practical and legal, said Phillips, who represents payment system companies and financial technology firms.
In many of the jurisdictions that require merchants to accept cash, the laws explicitly forbid charging cash customers more — and have a per-transaction fine for violations, raising the possibility of big fees. And Phillips said merchants could face class-action lawsuits for rounding policies in which plaintiffs argue they are charged more than advertised or face unfair or deceptive business practices.
Federal regulations also ban retailers from charging more for purchases made with food stamps, through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP. Cash rounding policies complicate that rule, as some customers would be charged less for certain cash purchases than those using SNAP cards.
“The unintended consequences of these administrative actions, and these laws and how they flow together to create real problems that were certainly never envisioned,” Phillips said.
So far, merchants have come up with their own policies.
Because of the penny shortage, the East Coast convenience store chain Sheetz asked customers to move to cashless payments or round up to support charitable causes. It even offered free beverages for those willing to cash in 100 pennies.
Kwik Trip, which operates convenience stores across the Midwest, in October announced its registers would automatically round down cash transactions to the nearest nickel in favor of customers.
But without a federal standard, the landscape is patchy, Phillips said. Rounding creates a winner and a loser in each cash transaction. Some companies have pushed to standardize their practice across the country, but others will only choose to round down if required.
“Others are like, ‘You know what? This is actual money for us,’” he said. “‘We’re not just going to give it up for the sake of convenience.’”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderA key program aimed at helping individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities gain access to home care may be getting a refresh in 2026.
Officials at Georgia’s Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities unveiled a series of proposals during a December board meeting aimed at restructuring the waiting list for a state-run Medicaid program that provides waivers to people with disabilities designed to keep them out of institutional settings. The waivers can be used to provide services like medical supplies, personal care assistants and emergency alert systems.
However, the proposals made to the board are just recommendations, and a timeline to move forward with the plan has not yet been set.
Georgia had over 7,800 people on a waiting list for waivers as of this past March, though the agency says not everyone who is on the list has an urgent need for services. Boosting state funding to provide services to more people has long been a perennial issue at the state Capitol, and there’s been a push in recent years to work toward ending the wait list entirely. 
Senate panel pushes for new money to support Georgians with disabilities, pay hike for caregivers

Members of an advisory council dedicated to addressing the issue say the first step to revamping the program will be to identify which applicants have the most urgent needs so their applications can be prioritized.
“When I hear on the street that we’ve got 7,000 people on a planning list, everybody panics,” said Bruce Lindemann, who serves as the chair of the state’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Advisory Council. “We need to understand, first, what comprises that planning list.”
Under a new proposal, Georgia’s existing waiting list would be restructured into a three-tiered system that distinguishes between those with urgent needs, those who are expected to need services in the next one to five years and those who may need services even further in the future. The council also recommended that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities create a new type of waiver for individuals with disabilities who don’t currently qualify for the New Option Waiver or Comprehensive Support Waiver Program, and implement a new assessment tool to improve data collection.
“Our charge is to ensure Georgia’s planning list assessment process is fair, accurate and aligned with national best practices, while remaining workable for DBHDD staff,” said Rita Young, the executive director of Participant Directed Advocates of Georgia, a nonprofit that supports individuals and families who participate in the two waiver programs.
Georgia leaders are also taking inspiration from states like Louisiana and Pennsylvania, which already have systems in place to prioritize waiver services based on the urgency of the applicant’s need.
D’Arcy Robb, the executive director of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, expressed cautious optimism about the board’s recommendations.
“I think the key is really going to be the implementation,” she said. “It’s going to require an ongoing commitment from the state, and I think in order to be done well, DBHDD needs to continue having very serious input and shared decision-making power with people with disabilities, their families and with organizations.”
As the state grapples with the impact of Medicaid funding cuts under the federal budget reconciliation package, colloquially known as the “big, beautiful bill,” Robb said she hopes state leaders will ensure that Georgians with disabilities continue to have access to the services they need.
“The problem is that [the bill] makes such big cuts to Medicaid, states are going to have to make hard choices,” Robb said. “We want to make sure that our state leaders are aware of the many ways Medicaid touches the lives of people with [disabilities], and that those are not impacted.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2122-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 05:11:41.309453

We talk about how aging, disability, grief, policy, public health, serious illness, long-term care, loneliness, stigma, silence, fear, culture, history, can impact the health of LGBTQ+ people.
We also discuss the dangers of the “single story” about the LGBTQ+ community and how it impacts the way this community is cared for, an idea drawn from a powerful talk by author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
Essentially, she explains, the single story creates stereotypes. And the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story. And it turns out, if we show a group of people as one thing over and over, they become only that one thing. Unfortunately, we do it all the time. Immigrants, people who are unhoused, people living with Medicaid and many more.

The class I teach takes stories and storytelling seriously. Their power in shaping how people think, feel and talk about LGBTQ+ people, and how to tell more complete stories and why it matters for creating a society and healthcare system where more people can actually thrive.
For their final exam, the students deliver a 5-minute talk challenging the single story around the LGBTQ+ community. Every semester, the stories literally take my breath away for their compassion, honesty, authenticity, creativity and humanity. This year, they were especially powerful.
Throughout the semester, 7 guest speakers come to talk with the class. We hear from a physician who is trans and taking care of patients on the East Coast; an assisted living manager caring for the some of the most vulnerable to fight loneliness, hopelessness and boredom among older adults; a researcher who studies cancer disparities among LGBTQ+ people; a grief counselor who specializes in the many ways grief impacts the LGBTQ+ community, especially disenfranchised grief, which is so common in this community; and a queer community historian that explains the role history has played in generating stigma, silence and fear.
Many of the students are queer. Many more are there because they love someone who is queer. Some are communication majors, but most of them are not. Attendance is so high and consistent, I don’t even need to take it.
Over the years, teaching this class has made me worry about the safety of my students and my own, because across the country, classes like this have been banned — or if not yet banned, targeted with demands that we be forced to stop teaching.
But do we really know what we won’t learn if these classes are banned?
Last month, our class had the final exam. One student told me that when her mom calls at the end of each week, this class is the only one she talks about with her — all the things she learned that week, like how the stress of living with chronic stigma takes up to 12 years off the life of LGBTQ+ people.
The student also told her mom about how a guest speaker described a grade school assignment. He was shown pictures of a dog, cat, tree, squirrel and told to circle the category that was not like the others. He circled the dog because the rest all could climb a tree. He was penalized in class for not choosing the tree. The guest speaker talked about how early these associations are taught and rewarded, and how quickly the conversations about why one is more right than the other becomes the single story.
The student also told me (and her mom) how she has fallen in love with writing for the first time. She said she appreciates how our course assignments break some of our common scripts in a way that gives people more space to answer questions and talk about their life.
Another student told me that this class is where she found “safety in a moment of chaos.” She said the class taught her “the importance of caring for others while also taking care of herself.” And that having this class for a few hours each week “gave her hope and made her believe in a better future.”
Another student told me it’s been the “best class she’s had all of college,” and that “she felt safe, heard and supported in every single class.”
One student brought a handwritten note to the final exam giving thanks for the semester, saying, “it was truly everything I needed and more.” After talking about disability for most of her assignments and final, after her father was in a horrific accident leaving him wheelchair-bound, she said she was leaving class inspired to do more.
Another student wrote after the class to say, it was “truly life-changing.”
I’m sharing their stories because this is what most professors want students to feel — safe, heard, seen, inspired, hopeful. Students don’t learn a specialized vocabulary in an LGBTQ+ course. We don’t have special books. Special slides. Students are not tested on queer facts or other queer things.
This class, like many LGBTQ+ classes, are about creating empathy, learning how to have better conversations, and ultimately, learning to take better care of each other.

A family huddled over the kitchen table, staring at their electric bill. Chalkboard signs in a coffee shop bemoaning Connecticut’s high energy costs. The incumbent Democratic governor promising to open new power plants, even if it means expanding natural gas.
As issues of affordability take center stage in this year’s midterm elections, Connecticut’s nagging struggle with high electricity bills is making its way to the top of early messaging in the state’s budding 2026 gubernatorial race.
Politicians and voters in Connecticut are no strangers to frustrations over their utility bills and the vexing efforts to lower them. For years, and across several election cycles, the state has ranked near the top in the nation for the highest average cost of electricity.
But with electricity prices nationally now rising faster than inflation, candidates in other states have begun to tackle the issue in ways that serve as a prelude to this year’s races.
In a handful of recent elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia, for example, Democrats outperformed expectations by running on keeping utility rate hikes in check and raising warnings about the proliferation of power-guzzling AI data centers. The party’s earlier focus on adopting renewable, carbon-free power has given way to promoting the development of new nuclear reactors — and even natural gas — as a way of meeting rising demand without harming voters’ pocketbooks.

The shift in attention toward energy prices was evident at the 2025 national convention of state utility regulators in Seattle, according to Elin Swanson Katz, who previously led Connecticut’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of utility customers.
Katz, who now works as a consultant on energy issues, said the convention schedule was packed with panels discussing the trends that are driving up prices, as well as ways to maintain affordability while making investments in grid infrastructure and new sources of electricity.
“As someone who has spent my career largely as a consumer advocate and somebody who thinks about public engagement, it was a real sea change, something that I think we should have been talking about all along,” Katz said. “There’s no doubt, based on national polling, that consumers — customers — want affordable energy, but they also want investments in renewable so, I mean, there’s definitely tension on that.”
In April, a poll conducted by Ipsos and the consumer nonprofit PowerLines found that nearly three-quarters of Americans were concerned about rising energy costs, and nearly 60% said they felt their state governments were not doing enough to protect ratepayers.
Already, efforts have been made over the last year to address Connecticut’s energy costs. The results have been mixed.
In June, Gov. Ned Lamont — who is seeking a third term — signed legislation promising to save customers roughly $100 a year on their electric bills, mostly by borrowing money to offset portions of what’s known as the public benefits charge on customer bills.
Those savings were quickly dissipated, however, by a new rate hike for United Illuminating customers and the announcement of higher winter supply rates. 
The legislature’s efforts were also largely overshadowed by a clash between utility companies and their regulators at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority that resulted in the agency’s leader, Marissa Gillett, stepping down in October. While Gillett had been hailed by some, including Lamont, as a champion of consumers, critics accused her of skirting laws to exert control over the agency — a charge that was largely upheld in court.
At the same time, President Donald Trump’s efforts to steer federal energy policy in the direction of more fossil fuels has upended long-term investments that states like Connecticut have already made in pursuing cleaner forms of electricity such as solar and wind.
Noah Kaufman, an economist at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, published a paper in November citing rising electric prices as an obstacle to Connecticut’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions. A lack of local fuel resources combined with high delivery costs and certain clean-energy programs all contributed to the state’s high cost of electricity, the paper found.
In an interview, Kaufman said candidates here may have to adjust their pitches to appeal to voters who are concerned about both costs and the climate.
“We have very ambitious decarbonization targets without an obvious plan for how to achieve them at this point,” Kaufman said. “Politicians may have to consider strategies that would have been off the table a few years ago — might not have seemed politically viable — because any sort of reforms are going to go up against constituencies that like the policies in place now.”

Recent elections elsewhere
Historically, electricity prices have tended to take a backseat to other pocketbook issues, such as taxes and gas prices, in political campaigns. That has changed as electricity prices have risen faster than inflation, on average, since 2022.
In New Jersey, one of two states that held gubernatorial elections in November, summer electric rates were up 22% compared to the previous year. 
“The No. 1, 2 and 3 issues in our race was Trump,” said Matthew Hale, an expert on New Jersey politics and professor at Seton Hall University. “But four, five and six were all affordability, and so energy was certainly a big deal,” he said. 
“Energy costs are something people see every single day. When they jump right in the middle of a campaign, it’s a big issue,” Hale said.
The winner of that race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, promised to freeze electric rates during her first year in office, though experts as well as New Jersey’s regulated utility companies questioned her ability to do so. She also criticized the state’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, for approving rate hikes as well as the Trump administration for scrapping federal support for solar panels and energy efficiency programs.
At the same time, Sherrill faced a barrage of attack ads from her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli, that used selectively-edited footage of Sherrill appearing to say that voters should support renewable energy programs even if it costs them “an arm and a leg.” Sherrill was actually critiquing how other Democrats had spoken about such issues.
Hale said that Sherrill neutralized those attacks by talking about modernizing natural gas infrastructure and building new nuclear power reactors as part of her energy platform, in addition to her support for renewable energy.
“She didn’t lean into the environmentalists’ wing,” Hale said. “She just sort of said, ‘We need to do better.’ She didn’t back the idea that it was going to be nothing but renewables.”
In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her own affordability plan that focused on developing more generation from offshore wind, solar panels and small modular reactors — in addition to energy efficiency programs — as a way to bring down bills.
Spanberger also warned that the proliferation of data centers in Virginia was pushing the state toward an “energy crisis.” Her plan called for data center owners to pay their share of the cost to build the new power plants and transmission lines needed to power the facilities.
The Republican in that race, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, said in interviews that Virginia’s data centers were “here to stay” and that she supported an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that included older, dirtier forms of generation such as coal.
Both Spanberger and Sherrill won their respective states by healthy margins. 
The 2025 elections also saw Democrats in Georgia flip two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility companies. The winning candidates in those races focused on recent price hikes and the need to transition away from fossil fuels.
Still, experts caution that elected officials generally have a limited ability to actually lower the price of electricity.
That’s because a large percentage of customers’ bills go to pay for things like the maintenance of the transmission and distribution system, which is also growing more expensive. In many states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, utilities purchase electricity from power plants, then sell that power to customers without any markup. While elected officials may appoint regulators to approve utility rates — in Connecticut, appointments to PURA are made by the governor — those regulators are typically expected to approve justifiable costs.
“Politicians make those decisions, and it’s going to affect things a little bit, but that’s not going to fundamentally fix the fact that Connecticut has really high energy prices,” said Erik Katovich, a professor of energy and resource economics at the University of Connecticut.
Katz, the former Connecticut consumer counsel, echoed that sentiment saying candidates such as Sherrill and Spanberger now face the tough task of formulating policies that will fulfill their promises to voters.
“I don’t think there’s any really fully developed policy in any of these states, because it’s really, really hard to do,” Katz said. “If there were simple answers we would have done it already. But, I do feel encouraged that so many smart, skilled, experienced professionals are now recognizing that affordability should be in the top two issues that we address around our electric system.”

What Connecticut candidates are saying
Since taking office seven years ago, Lamont has signed numerous climate-related measures, including a 2022 law that promised to eliminate greenhouse gases from the electricity supplied to Connecticut customers by 2040.
But with the cost of utility bills proving a perennial issue throughout his tenure, the centrist Democrat has been wary of pursuing a more immediate decarbonization agenda sought by many environmental advocates and those on the Left.
In a recent interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Lamont said that his is an “all-the-above” energy strategy that includes support for renewable such as solar and wind along with natural gas and the nuclear power supplied by the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford.
“In most cases, a lot of the renewables are also part of our long term solution to hold down costs,” Lamont said. “Natural gas — which I’ve been talking to our neighboring states and the White House about how it can replace some of the liquefied natural gas with more piped-in natural gas — that would be a lot less expensive and always on as well.”

Early last year, Lamont met with Trump administration officials in Washington, D.C., to discuss an expansion of pipelines that could deliver more natural gas into Connecticut and the rest of New England. In August, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection signaled its intent to approve a pair of compressor stations in Brookfield, expanding the capacity of the existing Iroquois Pipeline.
And while Lamont was an early backer of efforts to grow New England’s offshore wind industry, his administration has opted against buying into any new projects with the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, citing the rising costs of wind power.
Now, the governor faces challenges from both sides of the aisle over the cost of electricity and his commitment to the climate.

On the Republican side, state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart have both launched campaigns that zero in on the state’s high cost of electricity. 
(Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, is also reportedly mulling a run for governor but has yet to formally launch a campaign. Appearing on Newsmax in late December, she criticized offshore wind projects supported by Connecticut and other New England states.)
Fazio, who serves as the ranking Republican on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, has been one of the leading voices among lawmakers in favor of eliminating — or at least sharply reducing — the public benefits charge that pays for things such as energy efficiency programs, financial aid and investments in renewable energy that have been mandated by state lawmakers.
Fazio also criticized the costs of some of the renewable investments supported by customers as “obscenely expensive.”
“I think the evidence is there that it’s important to Connecticut residents and voters who are becoming increasingly wise to the fact that it’s actually elected officials in the state government who have been inflating the cost of the public benefits charge and electricity rates in general,” Fazio said. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Fazio proposed shifting the cost of the public benefits charge — currently around $1 billion a year — onto the state’s budget. When that effort failed to gain traction, Fazio worked with Democratic leaders and Lamont’s office on a compromise measure, Senate Bill 4, that ultimately passed with bipartisan support. The bill authorized officials to borrow up to $250 million over two years to pay off some of the public benefits charge.
Moving forward, Fazio said lawmakers should examine each of the programs in the public benefits charge to determine whether they should remain a charge to customers, be covered in the state budget or be ended entirely. That would include making decisions over whether to provide public funding for certain programs, such as the low-income discount rate, that are intended to help some customers pay their bills.
“Should we have more of this program, less of this program? That’s, I think, a conversation for the appropriations process,” Fazio said. “On its face, it is not something you just shove in the electricity bill.”

Stewart’s campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview on energy policy. In April, then-Mayor Stewart posted on X that she attended a signing ceremony for Trump’s executive order supporting the coal industry, where she said she met with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and talked about the state’s “affordable energy future.” Connecticut’s last coal plant, Bridgeport Harbor Station, closed down in 2021 and was partially demolished last year.
In another social media post, Stewart also criticized the bipartisan effort to borrow money to reduce the public benefits charge as “fake relief” because that money would have to be paid back, with interest, by taxpayers. She also called for an end to the public benefits charge and an increase in energy supply, without going into details.
While Lamont supported the bonds included in S.B. 4, he expressed skepticism of proposals for the state to pick up more of the public benefits tab, saying it would merely move around costs without achieving savings.
“Ratepayers and taxpayers are the same people,” Lamont said. “What you’ve really got to do is generate more electricity that will reduce the great spikes … that’s what really drives the cost.”

Lamont is also facing a primary challenge from state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a self-described progressive who has said he wants to push Democrats to adopt more left-wing stances.
“The governor wants to be seen as progressive, so he wants the top line to be ‘historic investment in renewable energy,’ and then at his very next breath, he says ‘historic investment in natural gas,'” Elliott said.
If elected, Elliott said that he would seek to finance the cost of building solar and other renewable energy projects through state bonds that are paid back by taxpayers instead of being tacked onto customers’ electric bills. He also said he would take a tougher approach toward the development of data centers than either Lamont or Fazio — both of whom said they would support such projects if the developers agreed to pay their share of the cost to build the electric infrastructure needed to run them.
Elliott said any power plants built for data centers should have to run off of renewable electricity, not natural gas or petroleum. He also questioned the economic benefit of large data centers, noting that they tend to employ relatively few people outside of the construction workers it takes to build them. 
“What looks like a boon to our economy ends up being something that, over the long run, is a really bad decision,” Elliott said.
Lori Brown, executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, criticized both Lamont and Republicans for embracing natural gas, which she pointed out is subject to volatile price spikes that can increase the cost of energy, particularly in the winter.
“In Connecticut, the narrative is just being driven as if clean energy is the reason for all the woes in in electric bills,” Brown said. “That’s just such a false narrative.”
Additionally, Brown and other environmental advocates argue that investing in clean energy helps avoid other long-term costs associated with climate change, such as damage from storms and health care costs for people with respiratory illnesses.
Both CTLCV and the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club endorsed Lamont during each of his previous two runs for governor. The split over the issue of gas pipeline expansions, however, could push those groups to withhold their endorsements or consider backing Elliott in the primary.
Steve Lewis, the chair of the Connecticut Sierra Club’s political committee, said the group has yet to meet to discuss endorsements but said the pipeline issue is “something we need to consider very seriously.”
In response, Lamont pointed to his administration’s support for solar and wind projects, as well as efforts to improve energy efficiency. He added that any projects to expand pipeline capacity would be subject to the “highest environmental standards,” and compared against other energy resources to determine which have the lowest costs. 
“You’re not serious about affordability if you’re not serious about an all-the-above strategy,” Lamont said.

Federal impact
In addition to their Connecticut-specific pitches, each of the the candidates for governor must also navigate the seismic — and at times unpredictable — shifts in federal energy policy being introduced by the Trump administration.
In October, the Trump administration ordered a sudden halt to work on a massive offshore wind farm, Revolution Wind, off the coast of Rhode Island. At the time, the project was nearly 80% completed and employed more than 100 workers at the State Pier in New London.
The move drew swift criticism from Lamont and other proponents of offshore wind, who predicted that the loss of Revolution Wind would increase the risk of blackouts while pushing additional supply costs onto electric customers. Eventually, a lawsuit by the project’s developer succeeded in getting work to resume.
Then, three days before Christmas, the Trump administration again ordered a pause for Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects under development.
Even Republicans such as Fazio and Stewart expressed some unease over Trump’s intervention in Revolution Wind, despite their criticisms of wind power.
“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish,” Stewart said in an interview with CT Mirror in December, prior to the administration’s second effort to halt the project.
Fazio has criticized the cost of the power purchase agreement Connecticut entered into with Revolution Wind’s developers, which he said is likely to result in additional charges on customers’ monthly electric bills. 
“On the other end, you know, the project is down the path,” Fazio said. “There’s a tradeoff there and I hope that the concerns that the federal government has, that the state and feds can communicate about [them] and work [them] out.”
Trump has also complicated ongoing efforts in Connecticut to utilize federal money to spur investments in climate-friendly programs. As part of a wide-ranging tax and spending bill passed last year, the federal government began phasing out tax incentives and other subsidies for electric vehicles, solar panels and energy efficiency upgrades that had been a centerpiece of President Joe Biden’s energy policy.
“It’s huge,” said Kaufman, the Columbia professor. “The whole premise of [Biden’s] Inflation Reduction Act and the subsidies for clean energy within that law was that the federal government was going to pick up the tab for a lot of investments in clean energy, or energy efficiency, or conservation actions.”
While the Trump administration and Congress have continued to support some investments in low- and zero-emission technologies, particularly nuclear, Kaufman said the changes in federal policy will generally force state officials to choose between picking up the cost of clean energy programs or discontinuing them.
“To keep moving forward, that means more of those costs are going to going to have to be incurred by Connecticut ratepayers and residents,” he added. “That’s a big deal… we’re just in a very different situation here than we were a few years ago.”
In Connecticut, Kaufman said officials could also look to trim some of the costs of clean energy programs — such as subsidies for rooftop solar or tradable credits for renewable energy — without imperiling the broader public push to adopt those technologies.
Last February, Trump announced new tariffs on Canadian energy imports, sparking confusion as to whether they would apply to electricity crossing the U.S.-Canadian border on transmission lines. New England imports about 11% of its electricity from Canada. 
A spokesperson for the regional grid operator, ISO New England, said in an email that the federal government has yet to levy tariffs on those imports, and that the additional duties announced by the administration are not believed to apply to electricity.
Meanwhile, the president’s promises to lower electricity costs by keeping open aging coal power plants is unlikely to have much of an impact in New England, where the only operating coal plant shut down in September.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The recent war of words between a prominent local Jewish leader and U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) over Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza is a reminder of how volatile the issue has become in American politics.
The punching and counter-punching between Van Hollen, who has become a leading congressional critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ron Halber, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington, brings the controversy home.
But this was hardly the only reminder that the Israel-Gaza war is a potent political issue in American politics – or that it is likely to become a factor in multiple Maryland elections in 2026 and beyond.
Several developments this year, large and small, abroad and at home, have brought the conflict in Gaza and its political fallout into sharp relief, with untold ramifications for state politics. These include:

The election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York;
A decision by the JCRC to bestow its inaugural Community Champion Award on a leading candidate for Montgomery County executive;
A vote by the University of Maryland student government – on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar – calling on the university to divest from companies and institutions with ties to Israel’s military;
A Jewish state senator suggesting a fellow Jewish Democrat hated Jews because he was advocating against government funding for an entity that seeks to build business partnerships between Maryland and Israel;
Ongoing criticism of Van Hollen by certain Maryland Jewish leaders;
The Trump administration negotiating a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza;
The deadly attack on Australian Jews celebrating Hanukkah at a beach resort

War of words over Israel heats up between Van Hollen and Halber

What it all adds up to, as a determinative political issue for 2026, is hard to say. But it’s hard to ignore the idea that the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and Americans’ reaction to it, could be very impactful in the midterm elections, even in Maryland.
Over the past six months, Maryland Matters interviewed close to 20 people about how Israel and Gaza could influence the 2026 elections here – elected officials and political strategists, civic and religious leaders, activists and academics. Pointedly, only a few agreed to be interviewed for the record – though a handful said they would consider putting some of their remarks on the record eventually.
The brutal Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, which killed at least 1,200 people, and the political violence and humanitarian catastrophe that has followed, resulting in a reported 70,000 Palestinian deaths, has created a pivot point in American politics.
But in a nation that has been pro-Israel for so long, no one can really say what we’re pivoting to. Multiple polls show public opinion shifting, on U.S. support for Israel, on Palestinian rights and on a host of adjacent issues.
This has caused a reckoning for Democrats and Republicans, and for Jewish voters themselves – and has revealed deep fissures within these and other segments of the electorate. In heavily blue Maryland, the impact of the war on Democratic voters may matter the most.
“In the Democratic Party, I think it’s going to be part of the conversation and part of the evaluation process of candidates,” said former Chevy Chase Town Councilmember Joel Rubin, who is also a former Obama administration official and one-time foreign policy adviser to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He writes frequently about Middle East affairs and Jewish-American politics.
Beyond federal elections
In congressional elections, foreign policy will of course be a topic of debate. But even in state and local elections next year, the crisis in the Middle East may carry an emotional wallop – and could help candidates distinguish themselves from one another. We saw that in the recent election for mayor of New York City.
In the year since President Donald Trump was reelected, Democrats have been cleaved by several divides – ideological and generational and tactical – even with their victories in November’s off-year elections. But it’s also apparent that the conflict in Gaza is another source of division and controversy among Democrats, every bit as important as the other internal debates.

“The U.S.-Israel relationship is definitely an issue that Democratic candidates use to differentiate themselves from other candidates,” said Tali deGroot, vice president of political and digital strategy at J Street, a liberal Jewish organization seeking a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
In some ways, at least among Democrats, the divide over Israel and Gaza has become a stand-in for other issues, or is being used as short-hand for voters to evaluate and discuss candidates’ overall perspectives.
“I think a lot of voters would like to see politicians have moral clarity on this issue,” deGroot said.
Rubin calls the debate part of a “values platform,” especially for progressive Democrats. And former state Del. Saqib Ali (D-Montgomery), who has been pressing Maryland Democrats for years to stake out pro-Palestinian positions and to criticize the current Israeli regime, said, “To me, it’s kind of a litmus test: What are your human rights values?”
But one voter’s idea of moral clarity on the Israel-Palestine divide is another’s misguided prejudice, and any statement on the conflict carries risks of misinterpretation and political attack. The world is full of social media warriors, and their weapons are especially sharp when discussing Israel and Gaza. There are broader issues of antisemitism and Islamophobia at work that transcend state and local politics.
Still, Gaza will resonate in Maryland next year.
Most obviously, it will be a factor in the congressional 5th District, if the dean of the Maryland delegation, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D), decides to retire in 2026 at the age of 87.
State, federal lawmakers vow to fight antisemitism at Rockville legislative event

An open-seat race should attract several Democratic contenders, and there will be a range of opinions on Israel and Gaza – some genuine, others pure political calculations. In the past two election cycles alone, a super PAC affiliated with the pro-Israel political powerhouse American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the United Democracy Project (UDP), has dropped more than $8 million into open congressional races in Maryland, according to Open Secrets, a website that tracks money in politics. That included $4.2 million to defeat ex-Rep. Donna Edwards (D) in the 2022 Democratic primary that now-Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) won; and another $4.2 million on behalf of now-Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) last year.
UDP did not respond to a request for comment this fall about its 2026 strategy, but it seems inconceivable that the PAC wouldn’t play in a race to replace Hoyer, either to aid a strong pro-Israel Democrat or to oppose a candidate that AIPAC deems insufficiently supportive. Hoyer has been a huge backer of Israel through his 44-year congressional career; one of the longshot Democrats seeking to unseat him, Harry Jarin, who is Jewish, has blasted the incumbent for his steadfast support of Netanyahu – suggesting the congressman’s stance is out of touch with most Democrats, especially younger voters.
Beyond federal races, there are other ways Gaza and Israel will come up next year. In state elections, and in Montgomery County, there could be questions about annual government contributions to the Maryland Israel Development Center, a public-private partnership that works to forge business ties between the state and Israel.
This year, the state government invested $225,000 in the MIDC, compared to $275,000 in recent fiscal years. Those allocations are set directly by the Maryland Department of Commerce, not by the governor or the legislature, but the executive or legislature could try to end that arrangement. The Montgomery County government set aside $47,000 for the center this year, as the Montgomery Perspective website first reported.
Although attempts in the legislature to strip the funding have so far gone nowhere, conversations about keeping that allocation intact can get heated. In November, when Montgomery County’s legislative delegation held an online hearing about priorities for the 2026 General Assembly session, Nathan Feldman, a former member of the county’s Democratic central committee, urged lawmakers to strip out the MIDC funding.
“The Jew-hate fest continues,” said Sen. Ben Kramer (D), the chair of the county’s Senate delegation, just before Feldman spoke.
Feldman is Jewish.
Fair game for any candidate
Throughout the state, even if the offices they are seeking have absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy, candidates may be asked about where they stand on Israel and Gaza and related issues – the vibey, morality questions that Rubin, deGroot, Ali and others who were interviewed for this article anticipate.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The issue will almost certainly be a factor in the county executive race in Montgomery County, where more than 40% of Maryland’s Jews live. Montgomery County voters are different from those in the rest of the state, given the county’s proximity to Washington, D.C., and their overall fixation on the federal government.
Already, County Councilmember Will Jawando, one of the three leading contenders in the Democratic primary for county executive, has expressed some trepidation about the MIDC funding. In a statement he provided to Montgomery Perspective in late September, he said he wanted to find out if the money is being used to develop weapons, calling continued financial support “a non-starter” if that turns out to be the case.
Earlier this year, Halber’s organization, one of the most prominent Jewish organizations in the Washington region, announced it was bestowing its inaugural Community Champion Award on Montgomery County Councilmember Andrew Friedson (D), a leading candidate for county executive next year. Although the JCRC does not endorse candidates for office or operate a political action committee, the award effectively felt like an attempt by the group to put its finger on the scale in the election.
“Since the day he took office, Councilmember Friedson has been a stalwart supporter of the Jewish community — from delivering much-needed security funding for synagogues and other Jewish community institutions to standing up against antisemitism,” Bob Budoff, president of the JCRC Board of Directors, said in a statement. “The Community Champion Award reflects Councilmember Friedson’s commitment to Jewish children and families and making Montgomery County a better place for everybody. We look forward to partnering with him for years to come.”
Coincidentally and tragically, the May 21 award ceremony, at a temple in Washington, D.C., took place on the same evening two Israeli embassy workers were gunned down in front of a Jewish museum across town.
Moments after those murders, Friedson and his two principal opponents for the Democratic nomination, Jawando and Councilmember Evan Glass, put out statements condemning the violence and the antisemitism that allegedly motivated the alleged attack.
Jewish voters are hardly a monolith in Montgomery County (or anywhere else). Like all county voters, Jewish voters in Maryland’s most populous county are divided by geography, age, overall ideology and income level – and that surely comes into play with their views on Israel.
Competing Oct. 7 events pass without incident on University of Maryland campus

And most Montgomery voters will still be swayed by the candidates’ positions on education, housing, transportation, public safety, economic development and taxes next year. But it doesn’t mean the Middle East won’t carry some import.
Which brings us back to Van Hollen, a giant figure in Montgomery County politics, with a 35-year record of electoral success.
Van Hollen has surprised and disappointed several of his allies by criticizing the Israeli government so vociferously for its military strikes in Gaza – even as he’s heartened others. He along, with Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th), say they want to curtail some funding for the Israeli military.
DeGroot, of J Street, hailed Van Hollen’s “strong moral leadership” on Gaza. Ali said Van Hollen’s stance epitomizes the evolution of public opinion among Democratic leaders and voters – and compared the rapid change of opinion on Israel to the public’s quick turnaround on supporting gay marriage several years ago.
“I used to feel like it was a stretch to convince [elected officials] to be on my side,” he said.
In private conversations over the past few months, several friends and admirers of Van Hollen’s have fretted that his public criticism of Israel could have consequences if he seeks reelection in 2028. In a withering op-ed in The Baltimore Sun this fall, former state Sen. Bobby Zirkin (D-Baltimore County) blasted Van Hollen for his criticism of Israel and for endorsing Mamdani in New York, and he accused them both of spreading Hamas propaganda.
Some Jewish allies have quietly suggested that Van Hollen’s political survival will be something of a reclamation project – or they express hope that passions over Israel and Gaza will have cooled by 2028.
Considering the progression of voters’ opinions on Israel, this seems like an antiquated view, and also a premature one: The 2026 election cycle is going to have more twists and turns than anyone can anticipate, and Israel and Gaza will be part of the political narrative. 2028 is a lifetime away.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/UMD-SJP-10-7-2024-1024x639.jpg,,,2026-01-02 04:57:28.620574

(Eric Thomas)Most coverage of the Kansas City Chiefs’ new stadium on the Kansas side of the state line has sensibly focused on either the competition between Kansas and Missouri or the related financing of the stadium with public funds. Those concerns matter most politically and fiscally. 
The transition from an outdoor venue at Arrowhead Stadium to a domed stadium has attracted less attention. When people have written about the dome of it all, they have spotlighted the likelihood that a Super Bowl might come to Kansas City. 
After all, cold-weather cities risk brutal game conditions during February for the NFL’s marquee game. Recent Super Bowl host cities illustrate the point: New Orleans, Las Vegas, Arizona, Los Angeles, Tampa, Miami and Atlanta. The most recent cold-weather city? Minneapolis with its U.S. Bank Stadium hosted in 2018. 
But the Super Bowl is just one game. How will a domed stadium change games at the most vital stadium in our state and region? 
Let’s stick with the weather for a moment. The NFL preseason begins in early August, meaning that players and fans can swelter, with temperatures routinely reaching the mid-90s. Expect that to only get worse with climate change. A dome would help (if only through air conditioning that further imperils the environment).
Hermetically, sealed stadiums offer more certainty of a pleasant game. But that doesn’t mean that they deliver dramatic contests. 
Consider the Chiefs’ frigid playoff win against the Miami Dolphins in 2024. Temperatures dipped so low that quarterback Patrick Mahomes shattered his helmet on a run near the goal line, producing an iconic photo and a memorable game. 
The cost of gathering people on such a tundra became clear in the following weeks, when local hospitals reported that they performed several amputation surgeries on frostbitten fans. You could use that example to argue for a domed stadium, but the game could have been postponed or relocated. 
The Chiefs’ new stadium, scheduled to open in 2031, will certainly be the most important in the heartland. The next closest major domed stadium is in St. Louis: The Dome at America’s Center. Ask St. Louis locals, and they will tell you how the dome has descended into disrepair and languor since the Rams left for California. The venue’s schedule of upcoming events is cautionary and lackluster indeed: a Monster Jam truck show this month followed by truck, RV and auto shows. 
The next closest domed stadiums are hefty drives: the retractable-roof stadium of the Dallas Cowboys, plus domes in Indianapolis and Minneapolis. With each of those locations seven hours away by car, the new Chiefs stadium should become a destination for mega-concerts and more. 
Let’s hope that the best parts of Arrowhead Stadium aren’t lost with the move to a dome. Many of my best Chiefs memories come from the tailgate culture of the parking lot — a mix of smoked meats, light beers and elaborately retrofitted school buses. I never thought I would ask for a new sprawling parking lot, especially one that cozies up to the stadium. But the concrete savannah of Arrowhead makes games more fun. 
Following the announcement of the Chiefs’ move to Kansas, I photographed the team’s loss to the Denver Broncos at field level for Getty Images. Even with a crowd diminished by the team’s losing record, the stadium was still loud. That volume is another Arrowhead signature. 
If you are wondering about Kansas City’s status as the loudest place to play, a dome might tilt things a bit. Perhaps the building plans will call for noise reduction to ensure that trapped crowd sound in the dome doesn’t become uncomfortable. Or perhaps the new dome will be even louder than the Chiefs’ record for an outdoor stadium: 142.2 decibels, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. 
As Kansans, our central worry in building should be longevity — because few stadiums are as gray and miserable as old domes. If you visited the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis before it was pushed aside for the Colts’ new home, you know what I mean. The echo of the music and announcements could make you queasy, not to mention the intense air pressure that would essentially suck you into the revolving doors. 
An aging dome is the worst kind — it sends a team looking for a new stadium in a new city. 
Can the Chiefs build a dome that lasts as long as Arrowhead? The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans suggests so. Built in 1975, the stadium hosted the most recent Super Bowl. (Although, as someone who attended the game, I can testify that the Superdome shows its age, especially in bathroom concourse areas.)
If you are already nostalgic for Arrowhead, there’s good news. The move won’t come for a handful of seasons, so plan your trip to Missouri. 
And be sure to pack the right wardrobe for both the tailgate and the game.

The Rebels move to the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, where they’ll face Miami in the Fiesta Bowl next Thursday in Tempe, Arizona.","NEW ORLEANS — For much of Thursday night’s Sugar Bowl showdown with Georgia, it looked as if Ole Miss’ dream football season was careening toward a rude wake-up call.
Luckily for Rebel fans, Trinidad Chambliss found the snooze button.
The Ole Miss quarterback put together a performance for the ages, passing for 362 yards and two touchdowns to rally his team to a stunning 39-34 win over the SEC Champion Bulldogs.

With the win, the Rebels (13-1) punched their ticket to the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, where they’ll face Miami in the Fiesta Bowl next Thursday in Tempe, Arizona.
And if that round goes anything like the second one did, the Magnolia State may have to invest in more respirators.
Down 9 points at the half, the Rebels scored back-to-back touchdowns to open the fourth quarter and held off a fierce Georgia rally.
Chambliss was the star — the senior passed for 362 yards and two touchdowns — but there were no shortages of heroic performances.
Despite coming in as a six-point underdog Ole Miss out-gained Georgia 473 yards to 343, and won despite several bad breaks.

The Rebels settled for field goals on two of their first three possessions in the first quarter, taking an early 6-0 lead.
Georgia’s splendid quarterback Gunner Stockton responded with scoring runs to cap back-to-back 75-yard touchdown drives and put Georgia ahead 14-12.
Ole Miss was driving to take the lead back before the halftime break, but Georgia defender Daylen Everette scooped up a rare fumble from Ole Miss tailback Kewan Lacy and raced 47 yards to extend the Georgia lead to 21-12.

“We definitely didn’t play our cleanest football in the first half on either side of the ball,” Ole Miss coach Pete Golding said. “I kind of challenged them at halftime and said, you know, look, we were up nine on these guys going into the fourth quarter last time. Let’s play 30 minutes of football and out-physical them and execute. They just responded like they have all year.”
The Rebels traded a touchdown — a fumble-redeeming seven-yard bruising run for Lacy — for a Georgia field goal in the third quarter to trim the Bulldogs’ lead to 24-19.

That’s when the real fun started.
Lacy’s second touchdown came on a five-yard run and put Ole Miss ahead 27-24 with 11:29 to go.
Georgia coach Kirby Smart rolled the dice on the Bulldogs’ ensuing possession, opting to try to convert a 4th-and-2 situation at the Georgia 33-yard line.
Stockton rolled to his right looking for a receiver downfield, but didn’t see Ole Miss defender Suntarine Perkins coming from his blind side. Perkins drilled Stockton for a sack, forcing a fumble which he recovered at the Bulldogs’ 23-yard line.

“We knew that was going to be a big play in the game,” Ole Miss defensive MVP Will Echoles said. “I’m not going to say I was surprised, but Perkins made a great play.”
The turnover set Ole Miss up with a short field, and Chambliss cashed it in two plays later with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Harrison Wallace to put Ole Miss ahead 34-24 with nine minutes left.
But the Bulldogs had a response of their own: a seven-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that trimmed the Ole Miss lead down to three, at 34-31 with 7:03 to go. They tied the game with 56 seconds left on a 24-yard Peyton Woodring field goal.
Luckily, Chambliss had a little magic left in his back pocket.

Facing a third-and-five at his own 30, the senior found receiver De’Zhaun Stribling streaking down the home sideline for a 40-yard completion that gave the Rebels a new set of downs at the Georgia 30.
Two plays later, Ole Miss’ splendid kicker Lucas Carniero drilled a 47-yard field goal to regain the lead, 37-34, with just six seconds left.
Georgia tried a trick play on the ensuing kickoff and lateraled the ball out of bounds on their own goal-line, giving Ole Miss two points for a safety and extending the lead to 39-34.

Georgia got the ball back on an onside kick, but a final play that featured 11 laterals ended with a 12-yard loss and Ole Miss storming the field.
It was a strange, almost surreal ending to a marvelously competitive game.
“It was an incredible college football game,” Smart said. “It’s what the college football playoff was built for, to have battles like that.”

(Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission)In Florida, the environmental beat during 2025 featured land purchases and development rights, which tied in to immigration efforts, plus the first bear hunt in a decade and a big electric utility rate increase. 
Bear hunt reopens
Fifty-two black bears were “harvested” during the 2025 Florida black bear hunt, the first of its kind in a decade, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced this week.
Members of the FWC  agreed earlier this year to allow hunters to kill 172 black bears within four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 31 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in a South hunting area.
Bear Warriors United tried unsuccessfully to shut down the 23-day hunt, arguing that the FWC relied on outdated data and that the hunt was politically motivated; agency staff had not initially recommended a hunt during a December 2024 presentation about its Florida Black Bear Management Plan.
But Leon County Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey denied the organization’s request for an injunction. 
Florida bear hunt to take place next month after judge rejects injunction

Hunters were allowed to kill bears at game feeding stations, using food to bait the animals. And in 2027 hunters will be allowed use to use dogs to assist them in the hunt.
The bear population in Florida is estimated at around 4,050. The 2025 hunt was the first since 2015, when the state shut down that hunt at the end of its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
Legislature bans building in state parks
In 2024, the DeSantis administration proposed building lodges, pickleball courts, golf courses, and other facilities to state parks. In 2025, he signed a bill to outlaw doing any such things in the parks. 
To block another golf course debacle, Florida lawmakers try protecting state parks

What came in between those two events was widespread, bipartisan pushback and protest against the idea of building inside of the state’s natural destinations. 
Earlier this year, lawmakers unanimously supported the State Park Preservation Act. Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman, a Republican from Highland Beach, said she received more than 1,500 emails from members of the public following the initial development plan. 
The law now requires more transparent notification of meetings; in 2024, the state tried to quietly advance the development proposals. Originally, the state gave the public six days’ warning before simultaneous meetings across the state to discuss the proposals. Those meetings were rescheduled amid widespread public concern.
The 2024 proposal was one of the Phoenix’s Top 10 political developments of that year. 
Although the DeSantis administration had pushed for development, the governor claimed — after the public pushback — that he’d never seen the proposal. However, DeSantis’ public schedule showed that earlier that year he’d met with the organization involved in the plans. 
The state employee who leaked the proposal was fired. 
In 2011, former Gov. Rick Scott had attempted to put golf courses in state parks, but after pushback then, too, it was scrapped.

Guana River land swap
It started out quietly but opposition grew quickly and got loud.
The Upland LLC in May pitched the idea of a land swap in an application to the Acquisition and Restoration Council (ARC), a state panel that, among other things, evaluates, selects, and ranks state land acquisition projects and evaluates proposed uses of state-owned conservation land.
The state would exchange roughly 600 acres in the Guana River Wildlife Management Area in St. Johns County to the developer. In return, the state would get more than 3,000 acres of land across four parcels scattered across Lafayette, Volusia, Osceola, and St. Johns counties.
Horses riding on trails in Guana River WMA via FWC
The state parcel, managed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, includes a pedestrian trail and is accessible to the public for waterfowl hunting, fishing, paddling, and wildlife viewing. It contains flatwoods, salt and freshwater marshes, wet flatwoods, wet and dry hammock, and scrub. Threatened gopher tortoises and Eastern indigo snakes inhabit the area, according to the application. 
The land swap, agreed to by the FWC, was quickly included on the May 21 ARC meeting agenda. That gave the public just one week’s notice to oppose the proposal.
But it was enough.
Conservation and environmental groups swung into action and St. Johns County residents who opposed the deal circulated a petition. The proposal transcended local politics though, with state and even national leaders coming out against it.
“Guana Preserve and its beauty, familiarity and serenity is woven into the fabric of our communities and is, indeed, a treasure in northeast Florida. To allow — even enable — this land grab to occur is outrageous and completely contrary to what our community desires. Elected and appointed leaders should vote against this development wolf in sheep’s clothing and preserve this extraordinary natural bounty,” President Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told The Tributary. 
Florida Republican U.S. and gubernatorial hopeful Byron Donalds posted on X, “I stand with the residents of St. Johns County: Guana Preserve is NOT for sale.”

As a member of Florida’s Congressional delegation, I believe this is a bad deal for Florida and should be VOTED DOWN. https://t.co/rRvWbmZsdV

One day before the ARC meeting, Upland pulled its proposal from the agenda.
Gov. Ron DeSantis denied any personal role in the proposed land swap.
FPL rate increases
The public community came in high in February, asking for a near-$10 billion rate increase for its customers over the next four years. Critics argue that Florida Power & Light also settled high, getting approval in November from Public Service Commission members to increase rates by about $6.9 billion.
Opponents claim it’s the largest utility rate hike in U.S. history.
FPL is the state’s largest utility with approximately six million accounts and about 12 million customers. FPL’s parent company, NextEra Energy, is Florida-based and publicly traded. 
The five-member PSC holds regulatory authority over rates charged for electric, natural gas, telephone, water, and wastewater. The governor appoints PSC members from a list of candidates recommended by the Public Service Commission Nominating Council.
The months-long debate over the proposed rate hikes could impel the Legislature to change how the PSC operates. Crestview Republican Sen. Don Gaetz pushed for changes during the 2025 session, filing SB 354, but found no support in the House.
Not dissuaded, Gaetz in October filed SB 126, which already has been approved by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Environment, and General Government.
Building back better banned under SB 180
Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie says the goal of 2025’s SB 180 was to streamline restoration and improve emergency response coordination following major hurricanes.
But the controversial legislation is the subject of two lawsuits.
Twenty-five local governments have filed in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County, arguing the new law unconstitutionally infringes on their authority to govern their day-to-day operations.
The second suit was filed by 1000 Friends of Florida and east Orange County resident Rachel Hildebrand, also in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County.
Legislature wants to make it impossible for local governments to build back better after hurricanes

Specifically, SB 180 retroactively prevents cities and counties listed in federal disaster declarations for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton from adopting tougher development rules until October 2027. 
The ban could extend beyond 2027, though. Another section of the law allows a similar one-year ban to take effect anytime a local government is listed in a federal disaster declaration and lies within 100 miles of a hurricane’s path.
Signed into law by Gov Ron DeSantis on June 30, SB 180 gives “any person” standing to sue a local government’s amendment, regulation, or development order and, if successful, to receive their attorney fees.
Local governments have 14 days to repeal any restriction that draws a legal challenge. If a municipality declines, the lawsuit can be filed.
DeSantis defended the legislation, telling reporters over the summer that it gives homeowners battered by hurricanes the ability to rebuild their homes according to pre-storm building codes.
“They want to go out and restore their home to what it was like before the storm hits, and the local governments are telling them, ‘You can’t do it. You gotta do something else,’” DeSantis said. “What right do they have to tell you that you can’t rebuild your home? This isn’t California. This is Florida.”
Destin land purchase
A piece of land in Destin made headlines this year after the state paid the landowner, a political donor, 10 times more for it than the owner purchased it for nearly 10 years ago. 
Campaign contributor skips line, gets big payday from Florida governor and Cabinet

In September, the governor and Cabinet voted to purchase about four acres in Destin without a state-sponsored assessment. Instead, they relied on an appraisal conducted by the seller. 
The previous landowner purchased the land for about $8 million in 2016 and 2017. The governor and Cabinet purchased it from the landowner for more than $80 million. 
The land was previously owned by two LLCs, operated by a Louisiana businessman with a history of contributing to Florida politicians, including those locally in Destin. 
The Legislature, in a last-second budget proposal, made room for the deal. The language lawmakers approved allowed the state to create a park in Okaloosa County without requiring an appraisal.
Legislative Democrats, in announcing their 2026 session agenda, included a bill asking the state to investigate the deal. 
Everglades restoration
This year, the state completed a reservoir on the Caloosahatchee River, a key prevention measure against toxic algae blooms. The project represented a major milestone in Everglades restoration, something the state has focused on for decades. 
The state budget for the current fiscal year, DeSantis’ second-to-last before term limiting out of office, provides $1.3 billion for protection and restoration in the Everglades, a major increase from the previous year. Of that, approximately $800 million is for restoration.
DeSantis asked President Donald Trump early in the year for permission to finish the long-going Everglades restoration project by itself, maintaining federal funding through block grants.

In July, DeSantis’ administration signed an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to accelerate restoration efforts. His office says the agreement will accelerate the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir construction timeline by five years, putting its completion date in 2029.
Those are some of the bright points of 2025 when it comes to the Florida Everglades.
But when the state opened a 3,000-bed immigrant holding facility in the Everglades, environmental groups, worried that state may not have followed federal environmental regulations and concerned that the project could harm the unique ecosystem, sued the state.
The Everglades facility, built of tents and temporary infrastructure, has been the subject of political debate, the Democrats decrying it and the GOP fundraising off of it. 
It was built at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, advertised with the promise of using wild alligators as a deterrent to escape.
A judge called for the facility to close by the time September ended, but a federal appellate panel reversed that.
“He can’t claim to be the Everglades governor on one hand, and then plunk down this mass facility in the heart of the Everglades on the other hand,” attorney Tania Galloni, representing Friends of the Everglades, said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix earlier this year.

It is urgent.","Alzheimer’s disease is not a distant crisis. It is a present, accelerating public health emergency – one that touches families in every city and town in Connecticut.
Yet despite its scale and its profound human impact, Alzheimer’s still does not receive the coordinated attention, funding, or urgency that other major health threats demand. That’s why Alzheimer’s advocacy has never been more important than it is right now.
More than 80,000 Connecticut residents live with Alzheimer’s or another dementia. Behind every diagnosis is a family navigating fear, role changes, and the overwhelming responsibility of providing care. Unpaid caregivers in our state contribute nearly 100 million hours of care annually, often while juggling full-time jobs, raising children, or managing their own health concerns. The emotional and financial strain is immense — and often invisible.
Yet a deeper challenge is quietly growing beneath the surface: the demographic shift accelerating the crisis.  By 2030, one in five Americans will be over the age of 65. Connecticut is already one of the oldest states in the nation, meaning we will feel the impact of this aging wave earlier and more intensely than most. The need for a strong, dementia-capable public health infrastructure is not theoretical. It is urgent.
The encouraging news is that meaningful solutions do exist – and advocacy is how those solutions become reality.
Recent federal legislation such as the BOLD Act and the Alzheimer’s Accountability and Investment Act has transformed the national response to dementia by strengthening public health systems, supporting Centers of Excellence, and — critically — requiring the National Institutes of Health to clearly outline the annual funding needed to achieve the goals of the National Alzheimer’s Plan. That accountability requirement matters. It ensures that Alzheimer’s research and care receive stable, transparent investment rather than slipping to the margins of federal priorities.
Connecticut is also stepping up. In 2025, the state passed legislation that will require all state-regulated health insurance plans to cover biomarker testing— including for conditions like Alzheimer’s — starting January 1, 2026. This coverage improvement will help democratize access to advanced diagnostics and accelerate earlier detection and treatment — a major win for families who have historically faced disparities in access to care.


And these legislative wins didn’t happen by accident. They happened because ordinary people — caregivers, community members, and advocates — raised their voices. They wrote letters, called their representatives, shared their stories, and refused to let Alzheimer’s be ignored. 
I’ve seen firsthand how powerful advocacy can be. Years ago, while serving as an Ambassador to Rep. John Larson through the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement, I wrote to his office encouraging him to support the BOLD Act shortly after it was introduced. Within days, his district office called to say he would co-sponsor. That legislation is now law, and its Centers of Excellence are shaping how states – including Connecticut – respond to Alzheimer’s. It is living proof that individual advocacy can influence national policy.
But our work is far from finished. New treatments are emerging, yet access remains uneven. Early detection tools are improving, but most people are still diagnosed far too late. Caregivers continue to bear an unsustainable load without adequate support. And health equity gaps persist, especially in communities of color that face both higher risk and lower access to diagnostic care.
Alzheimer’s takes memories, independence, and time — but it should not take hope. Advocacy is how we preserve that hope. It ensures that families are not left to navigate dementia alone, that science continues to advance, and that government meets the scale of the challenge with urgency and compassion.
We cannot afford to wait for the crisis to deepen. The moment for action is now –and every voice matters.

Changes coming to Health Department

Maryland Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott will leave the position she has held since the start of the Moore administration to make room for Meena Seshamani, who until recently was deputy administrator at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The governor’s office said Thursday that Herrera Scott, who has been secretary since January 2023, will stay until the end of this month, when she will be temporarily succeeded by Deputy Secretary for Health Care Financing Ryan Moran. Seshamani will take over on April 8, pending Senate approval of her appointment.
Herrera Scott’s departure comes as her agency is at the center of a budget storm, with a $200 million cut to the Developmental Disabilities Administration among the biggest single cuts as the state struggles to close a $3 billion gap in the fiscal 2026 budget. That proposal has sparked emotional rallies by members of the disabilities community as well as pushback from lawmakers.
The department last spring also announced that it had underestimated Medicaid expenses by $236 million, sending lawmakers scrambling to find funds in the final month of the legislative session. And Herrera Scott came under fire in December for her handling of complaints at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, a high-security hospital that has been riddled with complaints of patient abuse and violence. (GO TO STORY)

Senate warns of $500 million more in budget cuts, ahead of likely ‘disastrous’ federal action

Senate leaders said the legislature is preparing for as much as $500 million in additional cuts to an already strapped fiscal 2026 budget, as they brace for federal reductions and look to rework Gov. Wes Moore’s tax proposals.
“We do believe in the next couple of weeks we will get a better picture as to the extent of the, honestly, disastrous cuts that are likely going to be shifted to the states ahead of the March 14 shutdown date,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said during a weekly meeting with reporters.
Ferguson said he is hopeful that when other states start seeing cuts from a Republican-controlled White House and Congress, “be it Medicaid, FEMA, public education — that they speak to their congressional representatives and explain the pain that would be ahead for cost shifts. But we don’t know where that’s going to land yet, and so that’s a big uncertainty.”
In addition to uncertainty about the federal budget, Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said fiscal committees in the House and Senate are looking at a full range of options, which he predicts could include $200-$500 million in cuts to offset likely changes to unpopular parts of the governor’s budget.

Legislature overrides Moore’s veto, approves creation of reparations commission

It took years to pass — and another eight months to override the governor’s veto — but lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that creates a Maryland Reparations Commission.
The bill establishes a 23-member voluntary commission to assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, and to examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from policies that led to discrimination. The commission is also charged with recommending appropriate reparations, from a statement of apology to monetary compensation or social service assistance.
The bill had been a priority of the Legislative Black Caucus and its veto in May by Gov. Wes Moore (D), the first Black governor of Maryland, stunned many lawmakers and advocates, in Maryland and nationwide. Legislators immediately vowed an override, which they did by comfortable margins during Tuesday’s special session.
“It’s been a long time coming, and I’m so very grateful that this body saw fit to do that,” Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), the lead Senate sponsor, said in a brief interview after the vote. “I think the study will go a long way in revealing some of the things that we’re talking about. I’m happy that it’s happened.” (GO TO STORY)

Federal worker protection bill passes House, but not without a scrap

About the only thing lawmakers agreed on Tuesday was a bipartisan chorus of boos, after one House member resorted to calling Elon Musk a neo-Nazi during an increasingly contentious 30-minute debate over a bill to protect federal workers.
The Protect Our Federal Workers Act ended up passing the House, but not before the debate strayed to support for farmers, the state’s reliance on the federal government, President Donald Trump – and Musk.
“Right now, Republicans have empowered an unelected neo-Nazi with no security clearance or Senate confirmation to essentially determine what cuts should be made and who should be fired,” Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) said of Musk. “That’s the reality of it.”
It was not long after that that the House suspended debate to move to a vote.
House Bill 1424 would reallocate state funds to assist federal workers affected by Trump-directed layoffs and expand the authority of Attorney General Anthony Brown to pursue related litigation. It was portrayed as necessary by Democrats and an overstep by Republicans, who said Democrats were focusing too much on laid-off federal workers, and not enough on other workers in the state.

Vehicle registration costs set to go up July 1

Maryland motorists will have to dig a little deeper after July 1 when they renew their vehicle registrations.
The cost of registering a passenger vehicle will increase 60-75% under new rates that take effect on July 1. The new fees, passed as part of a budget compromise between the House and Senate, include changes to weight classes of vehicles.
“As directed by state law, the MVA is required to adjust vehicle registration fees that will help provide critical revenue for the Transportation Trust Fund, which ensures all of the state’s infrastructure is in a state of good repair,” Motor Vehicle Administrator Chrissy Nizer said. “In order to make these new fees as affordable as possible, the MVA is now offering customers the convenient option to choose either a one or two-year registration at time of their renewal.”
The new fees and a coming surcharge on electric and hybrid vehicles are part of an effort to close a $3 billion projected gap in highway and transit spending. Lawmakers said earlier this year that projects would be delayed unless the state modernizes how it pays for transportation projects.
Currently, owners of passenger cars weighing up to 3,700 pounds pay $137 every two years. Effective July 1, the registration fee for a passenger vehicle up to 3,500 pounds will be $221 every two years, or $110.50 annually. (GO TO STORY)

Bumps AHEAD: Trump administration evaluating Maryland’s authority to set Medicare rates
A look at Western Maryland Hospital Center in Washington County. (Photo by Hannah Gaskill/Maryland Matters).
The Trump administration has signaled an interest in reining in Maryland’s ability to set rates for Medicare services – an authority the state has held for about 40 years.
Maryland’s system, unusual among states, gives the state significant say over the costs of health care services across different coverage plans to keep costs low and consistent. The state hopes to have a similar authority as it transitions into a federal program called the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
But advocates worry that the feds’ apparent interest in changing who sets Medicare rates could disrupt health care payments for consumers, governments and providers.
The state’s ability to set Medicare rates has been in place for about 40 years under a waiver granted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI).
In the time since, the state’s health care system has evolved and the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission now determines the rates for care across all hospitals in the state, so that health care service costs are similar whether someone has private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.

Justices asked to decide when a cell phone ‘touch’ becomes reason for a traffic stop

Maryland’s highest court was asked Friday to determine how much a driver has to be handling a phone before police have sufficient reason to pull the driver over for using a cell phone while driving.
The case stems from Michael Eugene Stone’s 2023 stop and subsequent arrest on drug charges in Hagerstown, after police saw him “touch” or tap the screen of his dash-mounted phone in a way they said looked like he might be texting or making a call.
After stopping Stone for “using the phone while driving,” the officers discovered that he was driving on a suspended license, and in a subsequent search of him and his car they found drugs, drug paraphernalia and brass knuckles.
At trial, Stone tried to get the search evidence suppressed, arguing that police did not have the reasonable suspicion needed to stop him in the first place. The trial judge disagreed and let the evidence be submitted, but the Appellate Court of Maryland reversed that ruling in January, saying the officers had not shown they had reason to make a stop.

Peña-Melnyk elected unanimously as House speaker, making history in the process

Maryland lawmakers made history Tuesday, electing the first Afro-Latina and the first immigrant to serve as House speaker.
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) is the 109th person to serve as speaker of the House of Delegate but just the second woman of color in the job, following her predecessor, Del. Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County). Her rise to the speaker’s rostrum caps a nearly two-decade career in Annapolis, but got its start in an unlikely place: a small home with a leaky roof in the Dominican Republic.
“My journey did not begin in these chambers,” Peña-Melnyk said. Instead it began “in a small wooden house with a thick tin roof, one that had holes where the rain will come through…. That’s how I grew up.”
She said the family used corn husks and newspaper for toilet paper and often had little or nothing to eat. “Those memories are not shared for sympathy,” she said. “They are reminders of where I come from and the resilience that hardship can forge.”
The memories are also the foundation of what her legislative colleagues — Democrats and Republicans alike — said is Peña-Melnyk’s empathy for others and her desire to work hard to improve the lives of her constituents. (GO TO STORY)

Maryland launches new loan program for laid-off federal workers

Marylanders affected by federal layoffs this year can now apply for an interest-free state loan to help them pay the bills in the short term, according a press release Thursday from the state Department of Labor.
The Federal Emergency Loan Program is directed at the thousands of Maryland residents who have lost jobs in the federal government so far since the Trump administration began slashing the federal workforce to cut down federal spending.
The loan program was created this year under the new Protect Our Federal Workers Act, sponsored this year by Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) and signed into law in April. The law expands the use of two current employee-assistance funds so they apply to federal workers laid off as the Trump administration rushes to slash the size of government. It also expands the authority of the attorney general’s office to take legal action on behalf of laid-off federal workers in some instances, and it creates an expedited state hiring program for workers who lost jobs due to administration cuts.
The program offers a $700 interest-free loan for residents who qualify. Those residents must have been terminated from a federal job since Trump took office, in a mass layoff, relocation, or closure of a unit of the federal government, or in a similar situation beyond their control. (GO TO STORY)

Fish fry: Maryland uses electrofishing to glimpse blue catfish invasion

There is no bright flash or loud bang, no sharp crackling sound. But the rushing waters of the Potomac River have just been electrified.
And for a moment, nothing changes.
But suddenly, they rise to the surface one by one, writhing briefly before they lie still — dozens and dozens of invasive blue and flathead catfish, previously hidden in the gray-blue depths beneath the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, connecting Maryland’s Oxon Hill to Virginia’s Alexandria.
The fish, with their white bellies and small fins pointed skyward, aren’t dead — just stunned. But the biologists aboard the small Maryland Department of Natural Resources jon boat only have a a few minutes before the fish come to their senses and descend once more.
In that time, the small group of scientists can’t hope to collect every fish — at least a hundred in all — in their handheld dip nets, even though extricating the invasive species from the Chesapeake Bay is the ultimate goal.
This experiment in electrofishing, as it’s known, is more to give scientists a snapshot of what is normally concealed: Just how many of the whiskered invaders lurk in one stretch of the Potomac, in a roughly 50-yard radius surrounding the tiny motorboat delivering the shock. (GO TO STORY)

Two men indicted for $86,000 fraud scheme in Prince George’s

Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Tara Jackson announced indictments Thursday of two men charged with defrauding a 59-year-old county resident out of $86,000.
Jackson and county police said Zheng Hui Xie, 30, of Flushing, New York, and Jianwei Wang, 27, of Monterey Park, California, impersonated Federal Trade Commission officials in order to convince the resident, who was not named, that there had been fraudulent activity on her Apple ID and that several accounts were compromised.
The resident received a text message on April 28 about a large purchase made on her account, and called a number provided. The person who answered claimed to be with a fraud department, and transferred the woman to an individual who claimed to be an FTC agent.
On two separate occasions, the resident was asked to withdraw money from her bank in order to secure her money. She handed the money over to the fake agents who came to her home. When the resident received another phone call May 15 from an unknown number, and was told to withdraw $24,000, she contacted police. On May 23, investigators with the Prince George’s County Police Department’s Financial Crimes Unit arrested Xie and Wang. (GO TO STORY)

Senate Republicans score budget win as spending plan clears preliminary hurdle

Maryland Senate Republicans scored a victory in Monday’s budget debate, winning an amendment that dedicates a new per tire fee to state highways and bridges.
It was a rare win for the minority party in floor debate, as the Senate gave preliminary approval to a $67 billion budget for fiscal 2026 that includes a tax and fee package that will raise an estimated $1 billion.
While Republicans protested the new tire fee — $5 per tire — they were able to convince Democrats to dedicate the money specifically to state highway projects instead of the Transportation Trust Fund, which goes to transit as well as roads.
“I think that was an amendment that did make a lot of sense,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore). “You know, the $5 tire tax is new. They talked about it going to the Transportation Trust Fund. We just wanted to make sure that it actually goes to roads and bridges.”
On Monday night, Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) stepped in before the amendment could be rejected by budget subcommittee leaders. “I can see the nexus on this one, so I’m going to suggest we support this one,” Guzzone said, as he quickly called for a roll call vote.

Disabilities community ‘distressed,’ ‘scared’ by proposed $200 million cut to state services

Advocates are reeling at recent proposals to cut $200 million from a state agency that administers resources for people with developmental disabilities — cuts that advocates call inhumane and harmful for the people who need those services.
“We are deeply distressed by the nature of a number of these proposals,” said Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services, who said the plans “are absolutely going to hurt people.”
The fiscal 2026 budget unveiled last week by Gov. Wes Moore (D) calls for a $200 million cut from the Developmental Disabilities Administration, one of the tough choices Moore said state officials and lawmakers face as they grapple with a $3 billion budget shortfall.
“We will be advocating strenuously in the General Assembly to try to find a way to reverse some of this, if not all of it,” Howell said. “I think it’s going to be a really tall order, given the size of the cut.” (GO TO STORY)

$7 million payment to substitute among issues in Prince George’s schools audit

A Prince George’s County substitute teacher was paid more than $7 million in 2022 — and two months passed before the school system recouped the funds.
That was the most remarkable finding in a new legislative audit of the county school system, which described a number of ongoing issues with the system’s payroll, procurement and human resources procedures.
The Maryland Department of Legislative Services audit also found that the school system failed to consistently complete a screening process for employees who have contact with children, and that it failed to investigate 9,376 missing items identified in a 2023 inventory, which were valued at about $6.3 million.
The audit said the 2022 overpayment occurred when a school system employee mistakenly entered the teacher’s identification number in the “hours” field, leading to the teacher being paid for approximately 73,000 work days, rather than three. School system officials didn’t realize the overpayment had occurred for more than 50 days, but recovered the funds within a few days, the audit said. (GO TO STORY)

It’s done.
The House of Delegates gave final approval Wednesday evening to a bill that would create a Maryland Reparations Commission, sending the measure to the governor for his signature.
The 101-36 party-line vote would make Maryland one of the few states in the nation with a statewide body to study the inequality endured by African descendants. California became the first state in 2020 to pass legislation; then Illinois in 2021 and New York in 2023.
If approved, the commission would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras. Those years “have led to economic disparities based on race, including housing segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies,” according to the bill.
The commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives and child care costs.
Passage Wednesday followed 90 minutes of sometimes emotional debate and attempts to amend the bill, which could have blocked its passage with just five days left in the General Assembly session. (GO TO STORY)

Weeks after his release from prison, Franklin hired back to Prince George’s council job by Hawkins

At-large Prince George’s County Councilmember Calvin Hawkins II believes in second chances.
He’s led a career marked by overcoming past mistakes, and now he hopes to play a role in a “comeback story” for an old colleague: former At-Large Councilmember Mel Franklin, whom he hired as his new chief of staff earlier this summer.
Franklin’s hiring comes weeks after he was released early from a one-year sentence for a criminal scheme to steal campaign funds to cover personal expenses — and the efforts taken to hide his actions. He resigned from the council last year before later pleading guilty to charges of felony theft and perjury, and was sentenced in November to five years in prison with all but one suspended and three years probation.
Hawkins (D-At Large) did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but said in a statement Tuesday that he chose to hire Franklin after speaking with him recently and finding that “his contrition was sincere and evident…. His call to serve still shone brightly,” Hawkins’ statement said. “In that moment, I was moved to offer him the role as my Chief of Staff.” A county council spokesperson said Franklin started on July 14 at a salary of $72,000.

To lead the Prince George’s County Department of the Environment, County Executive Aisha N. Braveboy (D) is turning to someone who was fired from that very department a decade ago.
Samuel Belsham Moki was terminated from the agency in February 2014 for “gross negligence,” after county officials determined that he failed to manage the county’s stormwater pollution management program, which led to the county having to pay thousands of dollars in fines.
Moki challenged the termination before a county personnel board and then in circuit court and in the court now known as the Appellate Court of Maryland. At every turn, judges upheld his firing as justified.
Braveboy acknowledged that “questions have been raised” about Moki’s appointment. But in a news release Wednesday — issued after Maryland Matters inquired about the appointment — she argued that Moki is a “distinguished” former county employee, listing his academic degrees, including a doctorate in political science, and his prior roles with county government. He took on the role in an “acting” status on June 26. (GO TO STORY)

A majority of Marylanders said they have considered moving from the state in the near future even though they believe it is a good place to raise children, according to a poll released Thursday.
Many of those participating in the survey by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, expressed concerns with the state’s business climate, job market and friendliness toward retirees. The poll highlights a potential problem as Gov. Wes Moore (D) attempts to focus on growing the state’s economy.
“For a majority of Marylanders, the state is a great place to live and raise a family,” said Mileah Kromer, a pollster and director of the Institute of Politics.
Many who responded rated Maryland favorably on questions about family, health care and education. A majority of respondents — 56% — said Maryland is a good or excellent place to raise a family. Another 27% said it was a fair place to raise a family and 16% rated the state as poor. (GO TO STORY)

Another federal judge orders AmeriCorps to reinstate workers, restore funds

A second federal district judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate AmeriCorps workers who were laid off without notice in April and to restore $400 million in funding and grants to nonprofit organizations.
The preliminary injunction handed down Monday by District Judge Matthew Maddox comes a month and two days after a similar ruling in a separate AmeriCorps case in Maryland by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman — whose ruling is quoted heavily by Maddox.
Both judges blocked moves by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to shut down AmeriCorps programs, including the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and various state and private grant programs.
Boardman ruled in favor of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued to block the DOGE cuts. Maddox ruled in favor of a number of nonprofits from around the country, members of an AmeriCorps labor union and three AmeriCorps service members. (GO TO STORY)

A Maryland Health Department Police captain faces criminal charges, including theft and two counts of misconduct in office, related to college classes she attended when she was supposed to be working.
According to documents filed in Baltimore County Circuit Court, Capt. Astarte Hunt attended classes at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County from January to May 2025. During that time, she was assigned as an officer at Spring Grove Hospital, located in Catonsville near the university.
Prosecutors allege that Hunt, a nine-year veteran of the department who earns $120,140 annually, attended two psychology classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the spring semester, during hours that she was supposed to be working. Hunt is accused of falsifying time sheets and claiming she was working when she was attending those classes.
She faces one count of misconduct in office for attending those classes while providing timecards that said she was working the hours she was in class. She is also charged with theft related to the more than $5,100 in pay she received due to falsifying those timecards. (GO TO STORY)

Budget agreement could generate more than $1 billion in new revenue

A compromise spending plan for the coming budget year includes more than $1 billion in tax increases, including a proposal to let local governments increase the maximum local piggyback tax rate.
The revenues were unveiled Thursday by the governor and legislative leaders as part of a broad budget “framework” that will guide negotiators in the next few weeks, as they rush toward the end of the session.
The new revenues, coupled with an estimated $2.5 billion in budget cuts, are designed to cover a projected $3 billion deficit in the fiscal 2026 budget, and leave a reserve for fiscal 2027. The budget will also include “federal government spending triggers” that would activate in response to likely federal budget cuts.
Topping the list of new taxes unveiled Thursday is nearly $500 million from a 3% sales tax on data and IT services, according to budget documents shared with Maryland Matters. The tax, originally proposed as a business-to-business tax, would apply to anyone who uses such a service. (GO TO STORY)

Moore changes tone after encounter with Trump

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore appears to have dismissed any possibility of working with President Donald Trump after a meeting at the White House with the National Governors Association.
In a meeting with reporters Monday, Moore said an interaction between Trump and the roughly four dozen governors in attendance ended any thoughts he may have harbored about working with the president. The first-term Democrat said Maryland and other states must rise to the threat of massive layoffs and slash-and-burn federal budgeting coming from the administration.
“I come back from Washington with no illusion about what kind of partnership that this administration is trying to forge with our nation’s governors,” Moore told reporters, “and … with a clear understanding that if this first month is any indication of where things are going, we as lawmakers had better take this moment seriously and make sure that we’re moving forward.” (GO TO STORY)

‘We had to do something’: Maryland rolls out mandatory reservation system for two state parks

At Greenbrier State Park in Western Maryland, the line of cars sometimes started forming as early as midnight, with visitors desperate to secure a coveted spot beside the park’s popular lake after the sun came up.
On the busiest days, the line could stretch a few miles from the park entrance as more and more cars arrived, said Tim Hamilton of the Maryland Park Service. The resulting traffic is just one of the reasons why the park service will begin requiring advance reservations from all Greenbrier visitors on weekends and holidays from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Hamilton said.
The reservation website rolls out Monday, and reservations will be required starting next weekend for the Memorial Day weekend — both at Greenbrier and Sandy Point State Park, which hosts a popular swimming beach on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Anne Arundel County.
Some time later this summer, the reservation requirement will expand to include Point Lookout, Newtowne Neck and North Point State Parks. Hamilton starts the story in 2019, when there were 14.9 million visitors to Maryland state parks, which “shattered” all previous records. But another storm was coming. (GO TO STORY)

Federal court says Social Security can’t dismiss complaints of fibromyalgia sufferers

Their complaints are often ignored or brushed aside, but fibromyalgia sufferers see some hope in a recent court ruling that Social Security Administration officials were wrong to discount an Anne Arundel County woman’s description of the suffering the condition caused her.
Crystal Hultz was first denied Social Security disability benefits back in 2014. Throughout her many attempts to challenge the decision, administrative law judges believed her subjective testimony was not properly supported by medical evidence.
But in a Dec. 15 opinion, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that in cases where there are no objective medical tests or markers to identify debilitating conditions, like fibromyalgia, subjective testimony must have more weight.
“This case is about crediting a patient’s accounts of the chronic, debilitating, and little-understood illness fibromyalgia,” Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote in the opinion. (GO TO STORY)

Hidden no more: Butterflies on licenses, ID cards alert police to hidden disabilities

Several people showed up at Motor Vehicle Administration offices Wednesday to get new identification cards with a special butterfly logo, but it’s hardly surprising that the first one went to Montgomery County resident Eric Carpenter-Grantham.
After all, “Eric’s ID Law,” which allowed for the creation of the new cards, is named after Carpenter-Grantham.
The law requires that the MVA add the butterfly logo above the words “hidden disability” on cards for those who request it, like Carpenter-Grantham, who has high-functioning autism. The logo is meant to help police identify Marylanders with developmental or intellectual disabilities that are not immediately noticeable.
Dozens of elected officials, disability advocates and other supporters traveled to the MVA’s White Oak location to celebrate “Eric’s ID Law” that went into effect Wednesday.

It’s not hard to understand why, and our leaders in Annapolis would be wise to listen to their constituents and fight back against Republican power grabs.
For months, Republican-led states across the country have been engaged in an assault on fair maps and fair elections, redrawing congressional districts in states like Texas, Missouri and now Florida to give them an unfair advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. They know that voters are fed up with their unpopular agenda, which is hurting the working class, raising our costs and weakening protections for workers across Maryland and the country.

Sensing the inevitability of voters running them from office next November, these politicians have turned to gerrymandering in an attempt to rig the elections and silence the will of the voters. Maryland has the chance to fight back and ensure fair representation in Congress by redrawing our maps to better represent this state’s communities and interests at the federal level.
Maryland voters have made it clear that they want Annapolis to fight for them, fight back against this administration and their state-government cronies, and help deliver a Congress that puts the interests of working families first. If we fail to protect the voices of voters and communities across our state in the face of these unprecedented acts in Republican-led states, we risk untold damage to Maryland communities from a government that will not represent us.
Our state has already been rocked by the actions of the current Congress and administration. Federal workers have been fired or left without pay for weeks during the prolonged shutdown. Our communities have been denied disaster aid, our infrastructure projects have had their funding threatened, and other projects critical to our communities have seen their funding cut completely. The only way that Maryland can stand up for ourselves and our interests is through our votes.
Next November, we can head to the ballot box and bring an end to the unchecked, callous actions of Republicans in Washington. But it will be for naught if we cannot overcome the machinations of Texas, Florida and the like.
Maryland voters recognize that unfair elections elsewhere undermine their power as voters. We must protect that power by putting Maryland at the forefront of the fight for our democracy and for fair representation in Congress. Failing to respond to Republican attacks on our elections is tantamount to surrender, and as this week’s polling demonstrates, there will almost certainly be electoral consequences for surrendering.
Maryland’s working families have had enough of Republican attacks on our democracy. If our elected officials won’t stand up and fight for us to have fair representation in Congress, we’ll find some who will.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 21:12:25.829528

(Photo courtesy of Delicias del Pan’s Facebook page)Kneading dough and baking bread is an art that requires patience, skill, and time to master, according to Leidy Cristancho. A Colombian entrepreneur, Cristancho recently ventured into the bakery business alongside her husband, Luis Moreno Peña, with Delicias del Pan, in Council Bluffs, Iowa.
In 2019, the couple and their children left Bogotá and moved to California to build a new life. Two years later, they packed their belongings and drove to Iowa, where they had family connections and a supportive Colombian community waiting for them.
Like many immigrants with limited or no English skills, they took whatever jobs were available. Moreno Peña worked long hours as a cook at a burger chain, and Cristancho spent her days stocking shelves at a supermarket.
The long shifts came at a heavy price — physical exhaustion, mental stress, and strain on their marriage. Eventually, they reached a breaking point. Something had to change.
When faced with the demands of a grueling 14-hour workday, Cristancho knew it was time to explore options. “I’m tired and fed up. Tell me what you want to do, and I’ll take care of the rest,” she told her husband, her swollen feet aching from endless hours on the supermarket floor. She knew Moreno Peña, who came from a family of bakers in Colombia, was also eager for change. He had the talent but not the time.
Launching a Colombian bakery in Council Bluffs
Despite knowing nothing about dough or how to mix butter and eggs, Cristancho marched into the Latino Market in Council Bluffs, ready to sell Colombian buñuelos and bread.
“It was tough. We needed permits for everything. Don Saúl from the market was kind enough to let us sell there, but at first, nobody wanted to try our bread,” Cristancho recalls. “He started offering discounts, and that’s when people began to show interest.”
Competing against well-established bakeries hasn’t been easy. “We visited other Hispanic bakeries, like La Internacional, to understand their flavors. But their bread isn’t like Colombian bread. People are very attached to their traditions and sometimes don’t want to try new things,” she explains.
When they spotted an upcoming event on social media, they seized the opportunity. Cristancho came up with an idea to make their products more approachable: curated boxes filled with a variety of baked goods. They sold over 60 boxes and made $1,500 in just a few hours. It was their first taste of success — and they were hooked.
Learning the ropes of running a bakery

Beyond learning English, Cristancho, the creative force behind Delicias del Pan, faced the harsh reality of massive losses in both products and money. As any entrepreneur knows, the first years of a business are often the hardest.
Determined to succeed, Cristancho sought help from La Fuente’s Women Entrepreneurs Program. There, she got a crash course in everything it takes to run a business: crafting a business plan, managing finances, bookkeeping, marketing, taxes, permits, and more.
Through the program, they found a shared commercial kitchen at the Hoff Family Arts & Culture Center in Council Bluffs, where Cristancho rolls up her sleeves, handles dough, mans the ovens, and learns the art of patience — whether she likes it or not.
Moreno Peña may be the baker, but Cristancho is the boss. She manages operations, builds relationships, and creates opportunities to keep their business thriving. “I’m the one who solves the chicharrones (problems),” she says with a laugh, borrowing a Colombian expression.
A Colombian bakery’s impact in Iowa
Today, Cristancho feels pride in her role. Where once she viewed baking as her husband’s dream, she is now the heart of the business. Her days are no longer defined by exhausting shifts working for someone else, but by crafting pastries that tell a story — croissants that whisper of Colombia, cakes that bridge continents, each creation carefully tailored to their community’s evolving tastes.
Beyond bread, they’re carving out space for South American-style deliciousness, baked treats that are a bit more savory with a hint of sweetness. They use high-quality ingredients, avoid shortcuts, and aim to bring the flavors of their homeland to their community. Their commitment to quality is paying off. In October 2025, they were selected as one of the spotlight businesses for the 2025 REV Event, a small business pitch competition organized by TS Bank and Advance Southwest Iowa Corporation.
Cristancho’s journey goes beyond being a jefa (mom/boss) for her family and her growing business. She embodies the ingenuity of immigrants who find opportunities amid struggle and pull together to thrive.
Her goal? To win over the palates and hearts of anyone who bites into one of her creations at Delicias del Pan. If her story thus far is any indication, she’s well on her way.

But prominent leaders in this state see change as an inherent part of who we are — just as much as those persistently steady habits we hold dear. 
We challenged a handful of leading Connecticut voices to tell us what they’d like to see change in the coming year. Here are a few of their answers.
Sarah Bodley, reSET

In 2026, reSET wants to see Connecticut companies — from startups to established corporations — recognize that doing business for social impact is good economics. reSET entrepreneurs prove this daily: Businesses solving food insecurity, creating accessible retail opportunities, and building inclusive supply chains generate revenue while strengthening the entire economic ecosystem.
When businesses center social impact in their missions and daily operations, they invite innovation that builds wealth in underresourced communities, develop more sustainable products, foster customer loyalty transcending price competition, and intersect across sectors to create lasting positive change. In an increasingly values-driven marketplace, Connecticut businesses can stand out with this approach.
Since 2013 reSET has helped over 500 entrepreneurs launch and grow with impact, creating over 450 jobs, raising over $19 million in funding and generating over $30 million in revenue. Connecticut’s economy grows stronger when businesses measure success not just in quarterly earnings, but in community wealth creation, environmental sustainability and equitable opportunity.
In 2026, we challenge Connecticut’s business community to ask: What social challenge can our business help solve? That shift in mindset toward profit through purpose will define our state’s economic resilience and competitive edge for decades to come.
Antoinette Brim-Bell, Connecticut’s State Poet Laureate

My answer is not so much a change, but perhaps a deepening commitment to the installation of additional municipal poet laureates. Municipal poet laureates are literary advocates tasked with making poetry more accessible to their communities through readings, writing workshops and craft lectures. They curate voices whose lived experiences offer comfort, encourage empathy, learning and collaboration, thus bolstering community pride and engagement. 
Often, laureates collaborate with public libraries, educational institutions, and historical societies, using the literary arts to enhance understanding of history, science, and communication. Types of programming and collaborations in Connecticut have included ekphrastic exhibits, poetry inspired by visual art, where the poetry is shown alongside the paintings; Vietnam veterans writing about their wartime experiences; grade-schoolers sharing their immigration stories; elders embarking on poetic journeys of memory; intergenerational writing workshops where parents, grandparents and children share musings and meditations; and writing workshops hosted by historical sites and museums that provide historical context and inspire writers of all levels. 
The beauty of the municipal poet laureate is that they are of that community, a present resource. Additionally, the collaboration between municipal poet laureates and the state poet laureate ensures that Connecticut remains culturally rich with a confluence of poetic voices.

In 2026 my primary wish is for us to work toward ONE Connecticut.
Second, I want a transparent government that embraces integrity, honesty and the good will of all Connecticut residents. 2025 brought countless investigative stories exposing several levels of corruption within the current administration. Corruption has no place in government of the people, by the people and for the people because it undermines the people’s trust. We need leadership that commands integrity and holds those accountable who falter.
Third, I would like to see legislation signed into law be enforced. For laws to impact unscrupulous behavior, enforcement is crucial. Absence of enforcement indicates a lack of respect for the law, a breeding ground for violations.
Fourth, I would like to see mandated reporting include a mandated plan of action for alleviating the issue. Far too many show little to no improvement in the conditions they report. From year to year, conditions remain constant or worsen. In the end one must question: Is that a good return on investments of millions of dollars?
Last, we need an end to bureaucracy that suffocates the life out of change.
Tessa Hallinan, Connecticut’s Kid Governor



I chose inclusion for kids with disabilities as my platform for running for Connecticut’s Kid Governor because I have many relatives who have disabilities. My cousin has dyslexia, my step-cousin is teased because he is a cancer survivor and has to wear bags around his waist, and my step-cousin has autism. 
In 2026, I plan to work on my three point plan which includes sharing videos on my web page about including, accepting and understanding kids with disabilities; inviting schools to start buddy systems that pairs fifth grade leaders with kids with disabilities; and encouraging schools to designate a “Buddy Lunch Table” in the cafeteria where students can sit if they feel left out or need a friend.
Steven Hernández, Connecticut Coalition for Achievement Now



In 2026, Connecticut has to treat student achievement like the defining work of our public education system, not one priority among many. Too many children are moving through school without mastering reading and math, particularly children of color and those living in poverty, and we all know what that means: fewer doors open later, and fewer chances to build the life they deserve. We cannot normalize that.
The path forward is not mysterious. First, we should deliver on the early literacy commitments already made and match that same level of seriousness in math, starting early. Early numeracy is not just another subject. It is how children learn patterns, logic and problem solving, the building blocks that unlock confidence and future potential in a changing economy and emerging careers. Connecticut should extend strong instruction and supports in reading and math into the upper elementary and middle grades, not wait for failure to show up in algebra. Second, we should make high-impact tutoring in reading and math a reliable part of the school day for students who fall behind, with clear statewide standards and sustained funding, not short-term pilots.
Finally, families need a system they can actually use. That means language access built in from the start, real public options held to the same expectation of results, and investing in the educators who carry this work, especially in high-need schools.
If we act with urgency and align around what works, 2026 can be a turning point for students and for Connecticut.

Next year, I want more young people to feel they can build their future in Connecticut. We’re making it easier to create housing, expanding universal childcare, investing in our colleges and universities, rebuilding our cities, and maintaining the best K–12 schools in the country. Still, many young people feel left behind. I want them starting families here, buying homes, launching businesses, and knowing they can truly thrive. Together, we can keep building the most family-friendly state in the nation and ensure every child has the chance to learn, grow and succeed.
The earliest years of education are especially critical. Parents across Connecticut often tell me their child’s success began with strong early learning and the dedicated teachers who made it possible. That’s why expanding childcare and early education for every family, regardless of income or ZIP code, remains a top priority. In January 2026, Connecticut will add 1,000 new Early Start CT spaces to increase access to affordable, high-quality early childhood care. It’s real progress, and only the beginning.
Finally, the past year has shown the importance of lowering the temperature of our public discourse and treating one another with respect. Connecticut has avoided many of the divisions seen elsewhere, and that tone must continue with elected officials, me included, as we embrace positive change.
Ben Proto, Connecticut Republican Party

As chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party, the obvious answer is new, dynamic leadership for Connecticut: a Republican Governor, more Republican members of the General Assembly and Republicans holding statewide and federal offices.
However, to achieve that change, we need a Connecticut Republican Party that is focused, disciplined, and relentlessly committed to winning.
Republicans must put results ahead of ego, teamwork ahead of self-promotion, and winning ahead of personal squabbles. Republicans cannot afford internal distractions. Every ounce of our energy must be directed toward earning the trust of families who feel squeezed by the high taxes, unaffordable housing, rising energy costs and a state government that too often seems disconnected from their daily lives.
We must speak clearly and honestly. Our voice must be strong, authentic and without apology. We need a united Republican Party that recognizes we are judged not only by our actions but also by our ability to lead Connecticut.
If we stay focused and work together, 2026 can be the year we begin to restore to Connecticut what is so desperately needed: balance, accountability and common sense to Connecticut government.
A strong two-party system is the change Connecticut needs in 2026.
Bill Shufelt and John Walker, Athletic Brewing Co.



One thing we’d love to see in 2026 is Connecticut fully embracing and promoting everything that already makes it special. Connecticut is not only an outstanding travel destination, but also a place where people can lay down roots, start families and build lasting businesses.
Connecticut is widely regarded as the pizza capital of the U.S., earning national praise year after year, but the story doesn’t stop at thin-crust pies. From Gioia in New Haven and Community Table in New Preston, to Bar Bouchée in Madison, The Whelk in Westport, and Fresh Salt in Old Saybrook, the dining scene is exceptional, with local products — including Athletic — proudly on the menu. That quality was recently recognized when Athletic received the 2025 CRAZIES Vendor of the Year award from the Connecticut Restaurant Association.
Beyond food and drink, Connecticut offers incredible beaches, trails and outdoor spaces that make it a unique place to visit and live. Through our Two For The Trails environmental grant program, we’re proud to help support and protect many of these natural destinations. Connecticut is also an excellent place to launch your startup. With a strong talent pool, a supportive business climate, and partners like Connecticut Innovations, we’ve seen firsthand how the state can help entrepreneurs bring their ideas to life and turn them into enduring businesses.

A Gallatin County District Court judge ruled that the Montana Department of Environmental Quality didn’t take a “hard look” at the water quality impacts of a proposed subdivision a quarter mile from the Gallatin River.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper filed a lawsuit against DEQ in 2023, arguing a project at an old quarry to build eight high-density housing buildings could harm an already impaired river.
The lawsuit focused on the development’s septic system permits and the state approval process for the build.
“DEQ has consistently failed to evaluate what’s happening in a river as a whole with many sources of nutrient pollution and seems to find individual new sources insignificant,” Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “But it never goes and looks at the system as a whole.
“And so when the agency doesn’t look at the system as a whole, you can’t render an evidence-based decision on whether or not something is going to cause harm. And that’s the penultimate question that not only the Water Quality Act, but the Montana Constitution requires.”
The project was approved in 2022, the same year the Environmental Protection Agency declared the Gallatin River to be “impaired,” due to an increased number of algae blooms and other contributing factors.
The blooms harm fish and plant life and are a growing problem and concern for environmental groups, anglers and those enjoying other outdoor water recreation activities. The Gallatin River has seen an increasing number of algae blooms, which the state has investigated.
The court ruling said DEQ’s failure to assess cumulative impacts of the project, and approval of the permit despite not knowing the cause of algal blooms, was “arbitrary, capricious and unlawful and in violation of the Montana Constitution, (Montana Environmental Policy Act) and the (Water Quality Act).”
DEQ generally does not comment on litigation, a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email on Wednesday afternoon.
In the decision issued on Dec. 29, the court did rule in favor of DEQ on two claims. It said the agency did not violate administrative procedures or otherwise constitute unlawful rulemaking. 
Additionally, the court said the DEQ did not violate the Montana Water Quality Act’s nondegradation policy, meant to protect the state’s natural resources. In this case, the court did not reach a conclusion about whether there had been violation of the policy because any potential pollution hasn’t happened yet.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper called the decision a major win. Other litigation pending, from Citizens for a Better Flathead, in the Flathead Valley, the Lakeside Sewer and Water case, still has a claim out regarding the “hard look” mentioned in the Quarry subdivision, which found that scrutiny is required in all cases.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) SLATER — In a snow-covered field north of Des Moines, Lee Tesdell’s sheep seem comfortable, grazing in a paddock of Kernza, a perennial grain cultivated by The Land Institute in Kansas. 
Tesdell is one of just two farmers in Iowa that grow the deep-rooted grain that boasts low inputs, nutritional grain and roots that are highly effective at absorbing nitrate before it can leach into waterways. 
While Tesdell sells a bag of the grain here and there and gets to graze “the woolies” as he calls the flock, on the harvested field, the crop is more of an experiment. It has been grown in drier climates like Kansas and Nebraska, but Tesdell, and researchers at The Land Institute don’t know how the grain performs in Iowa.

Kernza is the grain produced from intermediate wheatgrass and was cultivated with the goal of creating a perennial grain for human consumption that would also reduce inputs and labor for farmers while providing environmental benefits. 
Tammy Kimbler, chief communications officer at The Land Institute, said the institute is working to analyze the conditions under which Kernza could be optimally grown across the country.

Kimbler said the institute has a “pretty good feel” for the purpose Kernza can serve in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, Kansas and Nebraska, where most of the grain has been planted. But it’s seeking a more “robust understanding” of the soil types, water, climate, historic crops and farmer knowledge in other states, like Iowa, that would impact Kernza adoption. 
In drier climates, Kernza is valuable for its drought tolerance and ability to hold onto the soil. Studies in Minnesota have shown Kernza can absorb 96% more nitrate from soils than soybeans and corn. The crop has been planted around certain wellheads in Minnesota to evaluate if the crop could reduce the concentration of nitrate in drinking water. 
High nitrate concentrations in Iowa drinking water sources has been an issue for decades. Recently, the issue was top of mind for central Iowans as Central Iowa Water Works issued its first-ever lawn watering ban to control demand on the system and remain compliant with federal drinking water standards while nitrate concentrations in the rivers soared.
“Kernza is a potential solution to that, because of the roots — and because of its perennial nature, it’s doing work all year, as opposed to just during the growing season,” Kimbler said. 
In addition to the environmental benefits, as a perennial, versus an annual grain, Kernza reduces the number of times a farmer has to drive a tractor over the field to seed a crop, which The Land Institute also views as a benefit.

What’s it like growing Kernza? 
Tesdell, who is in his third year with the crop, called it a “robust” plant. The first season he planted his seven-acre plot, he was worried it would be overtaken by weeds and other species in the field, but in the second year in the field, he said, the Kernza “just took over.” 
His only input is some nitrogen fertilizer, but he said it takes a small amount compared to a crop like corn. 
Tesdell gets three products out of the Kernza. The grain, which he takes to Nebraska for processing with the Sustain-a-Grain group where it is turned into the “flakes” he can sell to as a breakfast cereal or to breweries in the area. He also bales the plant and is able to sell it and use it like hay and finally, Tesdell grazes his sheep on the harvested Kernza fields. 
But even with the multiple uses, marketing the grain is enough of a challenge right now, that Tesdell said it probably won’t take off as a popular crop in Iowa. 
“For me, I’m interested in science; I’m interested in experimenting with crops,” Tesdell said. “I like the environmental benefits, system benefits because you get these really deep roots and there’s absolutely no surface erosion coming off that (field) there’s no way anything could escape.” 
In addition to the Kernza plot, Tesdell has strips of his family property dedicated to prairie and even though he personally doesn’t grow corn and soybeans, he seeds cover crops on the portions of his land that he rents to neighboring row-crop farmers. 
“That’s one thing I want to do is keep the top soil where it should be,” Tesdell said. 
Because it’s still a bit of an experimental crop in Iowa, Tesdell said he’s not sure how long the plants will have a high grain yield. He plans to harvest for grain again next year, which would be the fourth year of the plants, and then assess if it needs to be replanted.
“I just, I have no idea,” Tesdell said.

Developing the Kernza market 
Tesdell said he hasn’t filled out his spreadsheets for the year, but said he’d be “lucky to be breaking even” on the crop. 
“It’s not going to be a popular type of crop in row-crop Iowa, because it doesn’t yield very much,” Tesdell said. “And then the marketing is a challenge.” 
Tesdell travels to Nebraska, or pays to ship his Kernza harvest to Nebraska, to be processed into “flakes,” an oatmeal-like product, at a miller that works with other Kernza growers. It’s a bit more complicated, and expensive, than hauling his harvest to the local farm cooperative and selling it in one go.
Kimbler said in addition to understanding the practicalities around farming Kernza, farmers need access to processors and viable markets if the grain is to become more popular. The crop has been used like oatmeal, ground into flours and used as a brewing ingredient in beer.
Beer doesn’t offer a huge market for Kernza, but Kimbler said a Kernza beer gives people an opportunity to engage with the grain and its agricultural significance. 
“Because beer is such a social product, it has a tradition of storytelling that carries with it, it’s turned out beer, and brewers in particular, are amazing ambassadors,” Kimbler said. 
Farm Hand on tap 
Kernza has been a featured ingredient in select beers at breweries in Kansas, Oregon and other states but is now in a beer on tap at Brightside Aleworks in Altoona.
Andrew Frana, the head brewer and owner of Brightside, said he tries to feature local ingredients and producers as often as he can. 
The brewery hosts farmers’ markets, is a member of the state’s Choose Iowa program and collaborates with the Iowa Food Cooperative, where he first met Tesdell.

Frana learned about Tesdell’s perennial crop and decided to give it a try. 
“We found that it acts similarly to rye and wheat, and it’s a fairly high protein grain compared to those two, so it works well in our hazy IPAs,” Frana said. “It adds body, mouth feel, head retention – foam on top of the beer – it does similar things to those grains, but it’s more sustainable and super local.” 
Farm Hand is a hazy IPA — India pale ale — brewed with Nelson and Riwaka hops and has 7.0% alcohol by volume. 
Frana said the Kernza in the beer acts like the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG) or rice wine vinegar in cooking. 
“It just makes everything pop and brighten up so much,” he said. 
Right now, Kernza is a fairly pricey grain to work with, but Frana cares about conservation practices, regenerative agriculture and wants to support the endeavor.
“It is close to our heart to work as much as we can reducing our impacts,” Frana said. “… we would like to be a first mover in this project to bring notoriety to (Kernza) as a sustainable product here in Iowa.
Frana said when he works with a local ingredient, be it Tesdell’s Kernza or tea from Gong Fu in Des Moines’ East Village, he tries to build the beer so it highlights the ingredient. 
Farm Hand is on tap currently and he said it should last into the first half of January before the keg is dry. 
“But we do intend to work with Kernza in the future,” Frana said.

Records of the Iowa Board of Respiratory Care and Polysomnography show that respiratory therapist Philip A. Kester, 41, has been charged with habitual intoxication or addiction including the excessive use of alcohol or drugs in a manner that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice skill and safety.
He is also charged with negligence in the practice of the profession, failure to cooperate with an investigation of the board, and failure to respond within 30 days to a communication from the board.

The board has not publicly disclosed any of the alleged actions that led to the filing of the charges other than to say they occurred at some unspecified time in the past when Kester was practicing in Des Moines.
A board hearing on the matter is scheduled for Feb. 3, 2026.
State records indicate Kester was first issued an Iowa respiratory care practitioner’s license in May 2012.
Court records indicate that in November 2019, Kester was arrested and charged with drunken driving. According to a police report, he was stopped for driving the wrong way on E.P. True Parkway in West Des Moines, showed signs of being intoxicated, and then refused to submit to a preliminary breath test. After pleading guilty to a charge of first-offense drunken driving, Kester was sentenced to one year of probation.
In February 2021, Kester was arrested again on a charge of drunken driving. In that case, Ames police alleged they found Kester’s vehicle in a ditch with Kester still inside the car. According to the police report, Kester showed signs of inebriation and testing showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.275 – more than three times the legal limit for driving. After pleading guilty to second-offense drunken driving, Kester was sentenced to one week in jail and one year of probation.

(amygdala_imagery/Getty Images)New Mexico communities big and small have worked for a year or longer to unveil their celebrations next year for the 100-year anniversary of Route 66.
Along the 487-mile historic corridor crossing New Mexico from east to west, they’re restoring gas stations, painting murals, installing public art and fixing up neon signs. They’re planning community-wide parties featuring vintage cars, air shows and historical presentations about how the “Mother Road” shaped life in their communities.

That’s according to a list of roughly $4 million in grants the state Tourism Department has offered over the last two years to promote the centennial. Grants for infrastructure, marketing and special events range from $4,000, like for the Pinto Bean Route 66 Centennial Fiesta in Moriarty, to $250,000 for art installations in Albuquerque. 
New Mexico State Historian Rob Martinez told Source New Mexico the celebrations are fitting to celebrate a road that connected the country and had profound impacts on tiny towns alongside it. Like the Camino Real and Santa Fe Trail, Route 66 created a “crossroads” of people and culture, he said. 
“These trails and roads are very important in not just promoting New Mexico, but establishing our culture and changing it, bringing new peoples and new technologies and new ideas on the asphalt,” he said.

Beginning in 1926, with the help of congressional legislation creating a public highway system, the United States began building Route 66, seeking to connect growing cities and rural communities across the country with the help of the automobile.
Doing so in the state of New Mexico proved challenging due to its topography, according to the state Tourism Department. The first iteration of Route 66 entered New Mexico via Texas and shot northward to Santa Fe through Santa Rosa and Tucumcari, before dropping to Albuquerque through Los Lunas, heading back toward Laguna Pueblo and entering into Arizona just past Gallup.
Depression-era public works spending allowed the route to be straightened — eliminating the Los Lunas section — and paved. It was the first paved road in history. From there, it became the most famous American road in history, Martinez said.

New Mexico’s slice of Route 66 has appeared in multiple works of art since then, according to Martinez. He remembers an episode of “I Love Lucy” featuring a road trip on Route 66 through Albuquerque. Nat King Cole sings about “Gallup, New Mexico” in the classic 1946 “Get Your Kicks,” and the 1940 film adaptation of John Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath” starring Henry Fonda features the state prominently. 
“Tulsa, Oklahoma is considered the capital of Route 66, although I would say it should be Gallup or Albuquerque,” Martinez said. “Though, I’m biased.”
Other projects the Tourism Department funded are beautification of highway overpasses in Guadalupe County, an improved gateway in Albuquerque’s Old Town and upgrades to the State Fair Tower and RV village at the New Mexico State Fair grounds.
Santa Rosa received $60,000 for a “musical road” along a half-mile stretch of Route 66 east of the village, paying local company San Bar Construction to install custom rumble strips on the shoulder of the road. At the right speed, drivers who steer their tires onto the rumble strips will hear “Get Your Kicks” playing.

Lisa Brassell, part of the town’s Route 66 committee, told Source that not all of the funding has come together yet. First, the village will need to secure the rights for the song, and the New Mexico Transportation Department will have to re-pave the road to remove any potholes that might cause a false note, she said.
“Otherwise, nobody can tell what the song is,” she said, laughing.
But even without the musical rumble strips, she said Santa Rosa has festivities planned throughout the year, including the regular use of one local man and his 1926 vintage car. “He’s become kind of a mascot,” she said. 
She said Santa Rosa is just one of dozens of New Mexico communities putting their own local flavor on the celebration. 
“It depends on each individual community, on how they capture that essence, that contribution that the Mother Road has made for our communities, especially in rural New Mexico,” she said. “We’re working hard in our communities to celebrate the birthday.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Route66GettyRF-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-01 10:12:02.452677

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A Myrtle Beach Democrat wants voters to know he’s still challenging U.S. Rep. Russell Fry: Never mind his social media post months ago about suspending his campaign.
It was a rookie mistake, John Vincent recently told the SC Daily Gazette.

The retired Navy officer explained that his Facebook announcement in mid-May — saying “we’ve decided to suspend our campaign and focus on activism” — was just a nine-day pause, not an exit from his bid to flip the 7th District.
“I didn’t realize that’s a word in politics that basically means ‘I quit,’” the first-time candidate told the Gazette, referring to the word “suspend.”
He added: “I only wish that my fundraising emails would get as much attention.”
It’s exceedingly rare for a candidate to announce the suspension of a campaign, then jump back into the same race.
After doing a little research, Vincent’s communications director, Scott Billings, pointed to one other candidate for state or federal office who’d done so: In 2006, Republican Michele Bachmann, then a Minnesota state senator, suspended her bid for Congress for her own medical treatment, then came back and won. (However, when she suspended her presidential run in January 2012 ahead of the South Carolina primary, that meant — as it normally does — that she dropped out.)
Vincent’s post, one month after his campaign’s public launch in Florence, came amid his mother-in-law’s rapidly declining health. He needed to go to Iowa to help coordinate her care and didn’t want to ask for donations or volunteers when he expected to be gone for several months, he said.
But by June, Vincent had renewed his effort to become the first Democrat in modern history to represent the 7th District, which spans the Grand Strand and much of the Pee Dee. And he has an expanded campaign staff to help.
After his mother-in-law’s death in August, Vincent hosted the Fighting for Democracy Festival in North Myrtle Beach, which he said roughly 400 people attended.
Vincent, who retired in 2003 as command master chief petty officer after 20 years in the Navy, has called Myrtle Beach home for over two years. His campaign website sums up his campaign platform with three broad messages: “fight government chaos,” “support families,” and “honor veterans and those who serve.”
Asked about his opponent, Fry said he wasn’t aware he still had one.
“John Vincent hasn’t dropped out again? That’s news to me,” the Horry County Republican said in a statement to the Gazette. “He’s a socialist wannabe pretending to be an everyday guy, pushing higher taxes, more regulations, and open-border policies that hurt our economy and make our communities less safe.”

Voters first sent Fry, a former state House legislator, to Washington in 2022, after he ousted five-term incumbent Tom Rice in that year’s GOP primary.
Rice had angered many Republicans by voting to impeach President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, prompting a crowded field of Republican challengers. Trump endorsed Fry, who won a seven-way race with 51% of the vote, avoiding a runoff with Rice, who trailed by 26.5 percentage points, according to results from the state Election Commission.
In his November 2024 re-election contest, Fry received 65% of the vote, the most decisive win for the 7th District this century.
A Democrat last represented the 7th District in the early 1930s, when it dissolved with the state’s population loss. South Carolina re-gained a seventh congressional district with the 2010 census. Since voting maps were redrawn to add a district anchored by Horry County, Rice and Fry have been its only representatives.
The Grand Strand hasn’t been represented by a Democrat since the early 1990s, when it still was part of the 6th District.
“South Carolina — and the people of the 7th District — will reject the reckless agenda of Zohran Mamdani and his fanboy John Vincent, or whoever Democrats decide to install next,” Fry said in his statement to this outlet.
Vincent called the comparison to Mamdani a reach. “He is a very, very progressive guy; I’m a very moderate guy,” Vincent said of the Democrat recently elected mayor of New York City.
In his May 13 social media post to suspend his campaign, Vincent sounded dejected about his chances: “The door is not shut, but we can’t win without people who believe, and this district is not close today,” the post read.
Navy veteran hopes to be first Democrat this century to represent Grand Strand, Pee Dee in Congress

At the time, Vincent told the Gazette, he was disheartened by the lack of infrastructure for Democratic candidates in the district, and the roughly dozen volunteers working on his campaign all had very little political experience.
Days later, Vincent resumed posting about the race and criticizing Fry.
He hired JGS Strategies (JGS is short for Just Getting Started), a consulting firm that touts helping candidates win office in South Carolina and beyond since 2021. And he’s learned how to adapt his “off-the-cuff” public speaking style to politics, he said.
For example, he said, “I’ve learned jokes aren’t good.”
As of Sept. 30, Vincent had raised about $69,000 total for the campaign. After expenses, his campaign had just over $15,000 available when the third quarter ended, according to his latest filing with the Federal Election Commission.
By comparison, Fry had almost $762,000 cash on hand Sept. 30, according to his third-quarter filing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-1024x769.jpg,,,2026-01-01 09:11:40.400802

Legal experts say easy fixes could amplify people’s voices,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/01/constituents-mississippi-legislature/,"Unlike some other statehouses in the U.S., there are no formal opportunities for constituents in Mississippi to provide public comment or testimony in committee hearings, remotely or in writing.","When the Mississippi Legislature reconvenes in the Capitol’s marbled halls in January, one voice will scarcely be heard: constituents’. 
Citizens and advocates are occasionally invited by lawmakers to speak at the Capitol. But unlike some other statehouses in the U.S., there are no formal opportunities for constituents in Mississippi to provide public comment or testimony in committee hearings, remotely or in writing. 
“Constituents should have a voice when it comes to policy making,” said Sarah Moreland-Russell, an associate professor in the School of Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied testimony’s impact on the lawmaking process. 
Moreland-Russell said she was “very surprised” to learn that there are no opportunities for Mississippi’s citizens to regularly provide testimony at the statehouse. 
“If you’re not hearing from the people that are actually being affected by a policy, then how do you know it’s truly going to be effective?” she asked.
In Louisiana, House and Senate rules mandate proponents and opponents of bills have the opportunity to speak on a piece of legislation. In Alaska, a network of 22 offices across the state provide opportunities to participate in legislative meetings and submit written public comment, as well as provide legislative information to constituents in remote parts of the state. Every bill in Colorado receives a hearing with public comment. And in Arizona, an online system allows residents to register opinions and request to testify on bills from their homes. 
Moreland-Russell’s research showed that most legislators, regardless of political party, find testimony from constituents and experts influential. Testimony increased lawmakers’ awareness of issues, encouraged them to conduct additional research and sometimes even changed their votes. 
“Stories can be extremely influential,” Moreland-Russell said. She said legislators found personal anecdotes paired with data to back it up most impactful. 
In Mississippi, bills frequently fly through the committee process, oftentimes with little discussion by lawmakers and no input from the public. The Senate’s typo-riddled bill to phase out the income tax — one of the most notable bills to come out of the 2025 legislative session — quickly passed through committee with little debate. 
Senate Public Health Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory who has served in the Legislature since 1984, said committee hearings used to involve frequent debate, amendments and discussion among subcommittees.
“Everything now is just perfunctory,” he said, meaning it is routine or superficial. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many state legislatures implemented new ways for the public  to participate remotely, including options to present remote testimony or gather constituent feedback online.
But Mississippians who do not live in Jackson or can not attend the Legislature still do not have the opportunity to watch many of the state’s committee proceedings. The Mississippi House of Representatives does not livestream or record its committee meetings, though it does livestream proceedings in the House chamber.
Meanwhile, the Mississippi Senate livestreams most of its committee meetings and all of its full chamber proceedings. This is a marker of Lt. Gov Delbert Hosemann’s commitment to transparency, spokesperson Hannah Milliet said in an email. 
House Speaker Jason White, a Republican from West, told Mississippi Today in 2024 that he has no objection to livestreaming committee hearings and said the Rules Committee would look into the policy. 
House Rules Chairman Fred Shanks, a Republican from Brandon, said in November there has not been any talk of livestreaming the meetings. White did not respond to a request for comment. 
Simple changes, such as requiring committees to provide notice of hearings and publish agendas ahead of time, would give constituents more opportunities to participate in the legislative process, said Safia Malin, interim policy director for Jackson-based civic engagement nonprofit, One Voice.
The Senate has a page on the Legislature’s website to publish agendas, though they are not always shared. The House does not post agendas online. And committee hearings in both chambers occasionally occur at the last minute. 
Rep. Jeramey Anderson, a Democrat from Escatawpa, has proposed a rule to require House committees to post agendas 24 hours before meeting for the past seven years. None have ever made it out of committee. 
“Mississippians deserve to know what bills are being taken up before they walk into a committee room — not five minutes before, and not after the decisions are already made,” Anderson said in a written statement to Mississippi Today. 
“The refusal to provide even basic notice isn’t an accident,” he said. “It’s a deliberate choice that keeps the public from testifying, keeps advocates from participating, and keeps voters from holding their elected officials accountable.” 
The state Legislature is allowed to meet behind closed doors. The Mississippi Ethics Commission has repeatedly ruled that the Legislature is not covered by the state’s open meetings law. Hinds County Chancellor Dewayne Thomas affirmed the ruling in February. 
The House Republican Caucus — which holds a strong majority — frequently meets behind closed doors before committee meetings, effectively shielding discussion on legislation from the public.  
Shanks said he has never had a constituent ask him about speaking at the Capitol. He said he makes his phone number available for constituents to call him at any time.  
“As far as somebody making a public comment at a committee meeting, a lot of our committee meetings are pretty quick, and some of them are last minute. They may have one right after (floor) session,” Shanks said. 
“It would be pretty hard to do.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06124146/3X0A2518-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-01 09:11:40.400802

Trump is suing to block it,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2026/01/california-labor-law-under-fire/,A new law backed by California unions gives a state board the right to regulate working conditions and labor rights as the federal labor board’s fate is in limbo.,"In summary
A new law backed by California unions gives a state board the right to regulate working conditions and labor rights as the federal labor board’s fate is in limbo. 


California under a law taking effect today seeks to uphold the labor and unionization rights of private-sector employees, as the federal agency that has held that power for decades is in limbo. 
But the new law’s future is unclear because the Trump administration is challenging it. 
The law, which grants more powers to the California Public Employment Relations Board, is a response to the National Labor Relations Board lacking a quorum.
President Donald Trump fired the NLRB’s chairperson, Gwynne Wilcox, days after he began his second term in January. His two nominees to the board have yet to be confirmed, so the federal board has been without the three members it needs for a quorum for months. 
Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the Inglewood Democrat who wrote the bill, said when the governor signed it in September that “California will not sit idly as its workers are systematically denied the right to organize due to employer intransigence or federal inaction.”

The NLRB sued California over the law in October, saying in its lawsuit that the state is trying to assert authority over “areas explicitly reserved for federal oversight.”
On the legal challenge to the law, Terry Schanz, McKinnor’s chief of staff, referred CalMatters to the state attorney general. Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office is responsible for defending the law in court. A spokesperson for Bonta said the office would have nothing to say about it. 
With the NLRB unable to fulfill its duties, states are trying to fill the gap in enforcing the National Labor Relations Act, which Congress passed in 1935. But labor experts contacted by CalMatters do not have high hopes for the California law, which is similar to a law passed in New York this year. They said courts, including the Supreme Court, have ruled that states cannot decide matters pertaining to federal labor law because of preemption, the doctrine that a higher authority of law overrides a lower authority.
“It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where the courts do not overturn these (state) laws,” said John Logan, professor and chairperson of Labor and Employment Studies at San Francisco State University. 
William Gould, a former chairperson of the National Labor Relations Board during the Clinton administration and a professor emeritus at Stanford University, agreed: “In the courts the matter is a dead letter unless (the Supreme Court) shifts gears.” 
That’s what the California and U.S. chambers of commerce, along with other business groups, are hoping, according to their amicus brief in support of the Trump administration’s lawsuit against California: “Under California’s view, every state could have its own labor law for private-sector workers. Dozens of laws would overlap and collide.” 
The California Labor Federation, an umbrella organization for unions that represents about 2 million California workers, said in an amicus brief that even before Trump fired the NLRB chief, the federal agency’s backlog had been a problem, leading to companies being able to delay bargaining in good faith with their employees’ unions without consequences.
If the California law is overturned, employees who have formed unions but have not succeeded in securing contracts with employers such as Amazon and Starbucks — which are among the companies seeking to have the NLRB declared unconstitutional — may continue to face delays, according to Logan. Or, he said, it’s not clear what would happen if other workers tried to organize and their companies simply fired them. 
“The NLRB defunctness is a scandal which cries out for political reform,” Gould said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/121924_Amazon_Strike_SF-02-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-01 08:57:06.539886

New Safe Homes grants program, taking effect on Jan. 1, 2026, could begin taking applications in the spring, CA insurance department says.


Some homeowners in areas of California with high wildfire risk could eventually get money for new roofs or to build fire-resistant zones around their properties under a new state law that goes into effect today.
The Safe Homes grant program is designed to help low- and middle-income homeowners with fire mitigation. People who qualify could use grants to create 5-foot ember-resistant zones around properties, also known as Zone Zero, as required by law in some areas. The program will also contribute toward costs for fire-safe roofs.
The state’s Insurance Department, which is responsible for implementing the program, is working out the details around eligibility, the amount of and the distribution of grants. It is now developing an application portal that it hopes to have ready by March, said Michael Soller, spokesperson for the department.
The insurance department will be handling all the details of the grants, said Mike Dayton, chief of staff of Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, the Los Angeles-area Democrat and chair of the Assembly Insurance Committee who wrote the law, and has so far secured $3 million in the state budget to get the program started.

Soller said homeowners who have policies with admitted insurance carriers or the last-resort FAIR Plan and who live in high-risk areas will have to meet income limits set by the state housing department to be eligible for the grants, whose amounts have not been determined. Communities, cities and counties with mitigation projects could also apply for grants. 
He also said the insurance department plans to advocate for additional and ongoing funding for the program. 
Another source of funding could be the federal government, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Soller said. But Gov. Gavin Newsom recently tried to meet with FEMA to talk about disaster aid related to the Los Angeles County fires and was unsuccessful. 
Also, two Californians in Congress have proposed legislation that would establish a federal grant program and tax credits for mitigation. U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson, a Napa Democrat, and Doug LaMalfa, an Oroville Republican, have introduced their bill for the past two sessions, but it has not made it to a floor vote. 
The California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection recently extended the finalization of rules regarding Zone Zero buffers around properties to the first half of next year. The rules are expected to take effect for existing homes in 2029.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/090722-ROOFTOP-SOLAR-AP-RP-CM_1.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-01 08:57:06.539886

Orr is exploring a new funding model for higher education. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Senator chair for Alabama’s education budget committee is working on drafting a bill that could change how some higher education institutions are funded.
Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, said in an interview Friday the new model, called outcomes based funding, could push the public colleges and universities in the state to attain better graduation rates, increase workforce participation and help with research.
“How can we incentivize certain institutions to help them keep those students in school? Well, it all takes money. It takes resources. So the money that we would provide, we would say, ‘Okay, college, your four year graduation right now is 8%. We’d like to see that next year get to 10% or 12%.’ It’s gonna take time, but we’re going to reward movement.”

At the Nov. 12 Joint Modernizing Higher Education Funding Committee, Orr said he was using the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) Act as a model for how the new higher education funding bill would look. 
The RAISE Act, which passed in the 2025 regular session, gives K-12 schools extra funding to help certain classes of students, such as English language learners and special education students.
Orr said other states use a similar method to fund higher education institutions.
“What we’d like to do is follow the models other states have used called outcome based funding,” he said. “We will challenge the various schools, our 14 schools of higher education, plus community colleges to attain goals that we would like to see.”
Other states that use outcomes based funding include Tennessee, Texas, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri among others.
Under the proposal, larger schools in the state like Auburn University and the University of Alabama that have higher graduation rates will get funding help in research areas.
“We wouldn’t challenge them with that, it’d be like you do pretty good. It’s not, it’s not worth quibbling over,” Orr said. “There’s not really a return on that investment. So the flagships are in a little bit of a different area. They do a lot more research. So I think we’ll focus more on research for them than things like graduation rates.”
Other outcomes Orr’s bill will focus on are innovation and workforce development.
“What are the job needs of Alabama in the future? Well, I can tell you today, it’s teachers and educators. It’s nurses and people in the healthcare field. It’s engineers and people like that,” he said “So can we reward schools for increasing their output of students in these high demand vocations? And we may not reward them for — we’re not gonna penalize them — an ancient languages studies department, that’s probably not a needed area here in Alabama. It’s a must to help move our state forward.”
Innovation includes how the colleges and universities offer degrees, weekend classes and impact on the state.
Orr said roughly 30% of the funding for higher education in the Educational Opportunity Fund is for higher education while the other 70% is for K-12. The Educational Opportunity Fund is part of the Education Trust Fund.
“That Educational Opportunity Fund has about a billion dollars in it right now. We took over $300 million last year, and put it in, I’m calling it the RAISE Act fund, so that was strictly for K-12,” he said.
Jim Purcell, executive director for the Alabama Commission on Higher Education, said in a statement Friday the new plan could be difficult due to differences in the institutions.
“Designing performance-based funding incentives across a diverse range of university types presents challenges, given differences in mission, size, and student populations,” the statement said. “It is anticipated that any future incentive structure would include institution-specific considerations.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC05050-e1744232188836-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-01 08:13:33.263369

As Congress debates whether to extend the temporary federal subsidies that have helped millions of Americans buy health coverage, a crucial underlying reality is sometimes overlooked: Those subsidies are merely a band-aid covering the often unaffordable cost of health care.
California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and five other states have set caps on health care spending in a bid to rein in the intense financial pressure felt by many families, individuals, and employers who every year face increases in premiums, deductibles, and other health-related expenses.
Hospitals and other health care providers are citing Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, as one more reason to challenge those limits.
The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade, which mathematically should help the overall health care system meet the caps. But the law is also expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans, mostly Medicaid beneficiaries, by an estimated 10 million people. Health care analysts predict hospitals and other providers will raise prices to cover the double whammy of lost Medicaid revenue and the cost of caring for an influx of newly uninsured patients.
Whether regulators in some states will allow providers to justify higher prices and exceed the spending caps is unclear. Only California and Oregon can penalize providers financially if they fail to meet targets.
“Are we going to say, ‘That’s OK’? Or are we going to say, ‘Well, you exceeded the target. We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board. “That has not yet been decided.”
The California Hospital Association, the industry’s main state lobbying group, filed a lawsuit in October asking a state court to strike down the spending caps, which it argued fail to account for all the cost pressures hospitals face. Those pressures, it said, include an aging, sicker population; the rising cost of labor; expensive advances in medical technology; large capital outlays on required seismic retrofitting; and changes in federal policy, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The hospital group’s lawsuit also asserted that the state affordability office, by hastily imposing ill-considered cost-cutting targets, was undermining its other key mission of improving health care access, quality, and equity.
California’s affordability office in 2024 set a five-year target to cap statewide spending growth, starting at 3.5% in 2025 and declining to 3% by 2029. The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers, and other payers.
In 2025, it imposed much lower spending growth caps — starting at 1.8% in 2026 and declining to 1.6% by 2029 — for seven “high-cost” hospitals.
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding, and losing access to critical services,” Carmela Coyle, the hospital association’s president and CEO, said in an October press release.
The California attorney general’s office, which will represent the affordability agency, has not yet filed a response to the hospital group’s complaint and did not respond to a request for comment.
Hospitals’ pushback
California is not the only state taking a close look at hospital prices, which are widely considered a primary driver of health care costs.
“States, armed with information that points to payments to hospitals as a driver of what is way beyond affordable commercial premiums, have begun to take increasingly targeted actions focused on commercial hospital prices,” said Michael Bailit, founder of the Needham, Massachusetts-based consultancy Bailit Health, which has advised multiple states, including California, on ways to tame health care spending. “It is not surprising that the hospital industry is going to oppose such state actions.”
In its lawsuit, the California Hospital Association said the affordability office’s own report showed that pharmaceutical and insurance companies are largely responsible for high costs.
Hospitals in some states with cost growth limits, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, have expressed objections similar to the ones raised in the California lawsuit. They could follow their counterparts in California if their lawsuit succeeds, said Peter Lee, who led California’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, Covered California, for over a decade and is now a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.
Lee said the work of California’s affordability office and similar agencies in other states is just about the only systemwide effort being made to cut health care costs. They are basically saying, “‘Look, health care is taking money away from education, it is taking money away from the environment, it is taking money away from everything in the public sector, and in the private sector it is taking money away from wages,’” he said. “‘We don’t know how you, the health system, are going to do it, but it is your job not just to provide quality but to lower costs. Here’s the target.’”
To be sure, achieving the cost savings that California and those other states are seeking is no easy lift. It will ultimately require persuading large, financially powerful players that compete fiercely for health care dollars to adopt a different mindset and begin cooperating to reduce costs instead. And that, in many cases, will mean lower revenue.
But the status quo, as many people know all too well, means continued financial pain for millions.
In early 2020, Estevan Rodriguez, a bartender at California’s Monterey Beach Hotel, had surgery for a staph infection in his leg. The bill came to nearly $168,000. His insurance paid most of it, but he still owed $5,665, which took him two years to pay, more than $200 every month. “It may not be a lot to some people, but it was a lot to me,” Rodriguez said.
He said he dropped his Hulu subscription, switched to a lower-cost cellphone, and got cheaper car insurance. He started going to food banks rather than the grocery store, he said, and had a lot less time with his kids, because he was constantly working to pay off the hospital bill.
Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where Rodriguez had his surgery, is one of the seven hospitals identified by California’s affordability office as high-cost. A study by the office attributed high hospital prices in Monterey County to a lack of market competition “rather than higher operating costs or superior quality of care.”
The Monterey hospital referred a request for comment about its “high-cost” designation to the California Hospital Association. CHA spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea declined to comment beyond the language of the lawsuit and Coyle’s press release statement.
Reduced competition
Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close. One study estimates 338 rural hospitals are at risk of closing nationwide.
Less competition, in addition to fewer Medicaid dollars and an increase in uninsured patients, will only strengthen the incentive of health systems with the requisite market clout to raise their commercial prices, increasing premiums for employers and individuals.
“We think commercial prices will continue to increase as health care providers, and hospitals in particular, will seek to preserve or increase their revenue,” said Rachel Block, a program officer at the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation that focuses on health equity.
That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.
California’s affordability office is required to consider mitigating factors, including changes in federal and state laws. But some of its board members have expressed skepticism about letting hospitals offset Medicaid losses with higher commercial prices.
“There’s a lot of talk about using HR 1 and other federal policies as an excuse to raise prices on commercial payers,” Ian Lewis, an affordability office board member and policy director for UNITE HERE Local 2, a hospitality workers union in the Bay Area, said at the agency’s July board meeting, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s no more blood to be squeezed from this stone.”

Laura Kelly holds a Chiefs jersey with team owner Clark Hunt ahead of a news conference Dec. 22, 2025, at the Kansas Docking State Office Building in Topeka. (Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)The Kansas Chiefs are dead to me.
After Kansas jayhawked Missouri’s last NFL team last week, I vowed I would never again watch them. I cursed the day the team formed and Clark Hunt’s performance in Topeka reminded of Mark Twain’s quote about gratitude: 
“If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite you. This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.”
When Lamar Hunt founded the AFL, he put his team in Dallas. When the NFL countered by creating the Dallas Cowboys and the team was starving for fans, Kansas City welcomed him and made the rebranded team prosperous.
That’s Kansas City, Missouri. Like the Chiefs last week, Kansas’ envy of and desire to steal everything good about our state showed when it named a border town as Kansas City, Kansas, in 1872, more than 20 years after the real Kansas City was named.
Anyway, Kansas City made the Chiefs prosperous, and now the Hunt family is biting it.
The NFL has been a part of my Sunday for most of my life, beginning with dreams of playing professional football when I was a child in grade-school YMCA leagues.
I am old enough to remember the Chiefs winning Super Bowl IV. I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, a place without its own team. My older brother had adopted the Minnesota Vikings as his favorite, and I took great pleasure in their defeat in the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl until 2020.
I wasn’t a Chiefs fan until I moved to Missouri and I didn’t switch my childhood allegiance from the Cleveland Browns to the Chiefs until 1989, when the team hired Marty Schottenheimer after he was fired by the Browns.
I thought it was stupid because the only thing Schottenheimer hadn’t done for the Browns is get them to the Super Bowl. It was what the owner, Art Modell, wanted more than anything because the Browns had five chances — two before the 1969 NFL-AFL merger and three since — to get there.
Modell got his wish after moving the team to Baltimore, rebranded as the Ravens, and the Browns were reborn as an expansion team to be one of the doormats of the NFL.
For the Chiefs. Schottenheimer’s hiring ushered in one of the best eras for being a fan. Joe Montana finished his career alongside Marcus Allen and the team made it all the way to an AFC Championship game.
But it is the current era under Andy Reid, another coach fired by a previous team for the sin of not winning a Super Bowl, that brought the team global fame. The dazzling play of Patrick Mahomes, the adorably wholesome romance of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, and playing in five of six Super Bowls has helped burnish the image of Kansas City, MISSOURI, to the point where jayhawking the team became the only important issue in Kansas.
‘Jennison’s Jayhawkers,’ a drawing published in 1864 depicting Kansas guerrillas under Col. Charles ‘Doc’ Jennison pillaging civilians in Missouri (Library of Congress image).
The term jayhawk, by the way, does not refer to a bird. It is steeped in the history of our state, coined even before the Civil War to describe the activity of Kansas outlaws who rustled cattle and stole property on a grand scale.
This summer, in a panic, Gov. Mike Kehoe called Missouri lawmakers into a special session to offer a lucrative handout package for the Chiefs to stay. 
Missouri’s hand has bite marks because Clark Hunt wanted more, and got it. The Kansas funding scheme is, according to one analysis, the most lopsided stadium deal in sports history.
I love my adopted state. I love its history and its sports teams make me proud. I have never had a team I rooted for in bad and good times have the kind of successful run that the Chiefs have had — in venerable Arrowhead Stadium in MISSOURI — in recent years.
But their luck changed this year. After winning almost every one-score game in 2024 on their way to Super Bowl LIX, they won only one this year and won’t make the playoffs.
I hope they never win another game and I will never watch the Chiefs again.
I’m going back to rooting for the Browns.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC220319-1024x576-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 08:13:33.263369

New Jersey drivers will shell out more for tolls as the new year starts.
Motorists using the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway will see 3% increases on all vehicle classes, hikes approved by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in November as part of its 2026 budget.
Tolls at the Parkway’s barrier plazas will spike 8 cents, while tolls at entries and exits will increase by 3 cents. The average Turnpike toll will go up by approximately 16 cents. The Turnpike Authority in 2020 approved a plan to automatically increase tolls by 3% annually.
The Atlantic City Expressway will overhaul its tolling system beginning Jan. 4, when the state’s first all-electronic toll collection system becomes operational. A new fee will be implemented for Expressway drivers who don’t use E-ZPass and will instead be charged a fee of $13.60, more than double the E-ZPass rate. Tolls for drivers using E-ZPass will rise 3%.
Drivers using Delaware River bridges will also see an increase, approved by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission at its Nov. 24 meeting. E-ZPass tolls will increase from $1.50 to $2, and toll-by-plate charges will go up from $3 to $5.
The tolls at the bridges and tunnels overseen by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will also increase in the new year. The agency’s board approved 3% increases and an additional 25 cents to help fund its $45 billion capital plan. E-ZPass tolls during peak travel will increase from $16.06 to $16.79, and off-peak tolls will go up from $14.06 to $14.73. Pay-by-plate drivers will see the current toll of $22.38 go up to $23.05.

“It’s here to stay,” people declare, and shrug their shoulders defeatedly. “We live in a digital world, and today’s kids are digital natives. They need to learn how to survive an AI driven future.”
Most leave it at that, convinced of the same lies that Big Tech has successfully sold us for years. How hard the tech giants must be laughing, some of whom reportedly would never let their own kids near the products they make: smart devices, social media, video games, the lot!
They know how unnecessary – and detrimental – such products are to children’s successful development. Yet they have little to fear when it comes to accountability. Mark Zuckerberg’s social media products have been linked by some to thousands of teen users who have lost their lives within recent years, and many adults respond by saying, “Our kids need to learn how to use Instagram responsibly.”
That terrifies me.
As a 14-year-old without a smart device, social media or video games, I’ve watched as my peers are promised optimal social connection and the joyride of their lives as they’re handed their first smartphones and social media accounts. I then see youth isolation and depression skyrocket, academic performance plummet and the child become addicted. Their flowering promise wilts, and their caregiver knows no better until it’s too late. It’s a tragic tale, which keeps happening again and again.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Where are the adults who are supposed to say “no” to health- harming products that have been killing children under their noses for more than a decade? I, the adolescent, shouldn’t have to spread awareness. I shouldn’t have to write this op-ed pleading with parents, educators, legislators and every other responsible community member to wake up.
Yet here I am, spelling out how all those kids became connected to drug dealers by Snapchat (and died), mimicked self- strangulation TikTok videos (and died) and were led to predators and sex traffickers on Instagram (and also died). They were just like your kid. 
They are that one sitting on her smartphone on the sofa over there. A naturally curious, loved, cherished kiddo, prone to making mistakes for which she doesn’t deserve to die. I’m referring to kids who were healthy, happy prior to depression and no less loved. They didn’t deserve addiction and the garbage social media algorithms threw at them to make the tech billionaires richer. It’s atrociously unjustifiable, and no kid deserves it.
But as long as they have that smartphone in their hand – with or without parental controls – some risk is still there.
I’m actually not here to shame and blame. Why should I, if you know no better? I’m here because I’m afraid for my peers who’ve been dropped in shark-infested waters with no way of getting themselves out. 
Every kid deserves better. Still, only a precious few adults seem to accept why giving a teen the latest version of the iPhone is a poor idea. 
Lawmakers, it would significantly help parents to have an age 18 minimum law on social media use. Start treating social media like cigarettes and every other addictive product on the market.
Parents, you have the authority to remove what’s essentially a drug. You owe it to your child to do so. The prospect may be scary: denying any addict their drug is formidable. But difficulty has never been an excuse to ignore convalescence. And when caregivers begin to act based on fear of their child’s backlash, they’re not putting the child’s best interests first.
But why let a child experiment with a drug at all? Trust me as a teen with no social media or video games: I’m not left out of anything worth my time, and my health isn’t being risked to “fit in.” I have a perfectly functional landline. 
Children don’t need smart devices. Children need childhood, crucial elements of which are eliminated when they’re given digital products that are addictive by design. 
My peers need you to say “no” to these products, like you would to drugs and alcohol. We need to be able to trust that you’ll keep us from harm. But how can we, while one of the most addictive products on the market is what you’ve put under the Christmas tree for your 14-year-old? How can we, while you almost consistently choose satisfying children’s desires over caring for them responsibly? 
But you can make change. Minors need you to, because the movement we have already isn’t enough.
We need you to say “no.” The alternative price is your child.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)Six days after a senior official at the Food and Drug Administration sent a sweeping internal email claiming that covid vaccines had caused the deaths of “at least 10 children,” 12 former FDA commissioners released an extraordinary warning in the Dec. 3 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
They wrote that the claims and policy changes in the memo from Vinay Prasad, the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose “a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security” and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.
What is unfolding inside the FDA is not a narrow dispute over covid vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system — how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.

KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism. Learn more about KFF.

Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. “Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it,” he wrote, telling employees the agency’s mission, and its “worldview,” would change.
Prasad’s email reopened old arguments about covid vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that FDA staff had found “at least 10” deaths in children that happened “after and because of” covid vaccination, using reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.
On Substack, Inside Medicine reported Dec. 11 that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from covid shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, “The FDA’s investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there’s no final count yet of those deaths.”
Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have “harmed more children than we saved,” adding that “we do not know if we saved lives on balance.”
By comparison, more than 2,100 American children died of covid itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.
Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about covid vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.
Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it’s unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.

“There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.
Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an “evidence-based catastrophe,” questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new “worldview” and said anyone who disagreed with his “core principles” should resign.
The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to covid to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.
“This is really different. And it’s really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions,” former FDA commissioner Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad’s proposed policies — which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist — could shake the entire vaccine market.
“The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.,” he said. If the proposals advance, he added, “it won’t be a viable business.”
Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: “The American people deserve evidence-based science. Prasad’s email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children’s deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate.”
For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad’s ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.
Fueling Parental Doubt
Prasad’s memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children’s deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an “early warning system” for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.
“VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies,” said Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.
Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.
“Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence,” said Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
Prasad’s framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.
Experts fear this doubt won’t stay limited to covid vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA’s honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough — shots that have protected children for decades.
“Science must be transparent,” Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. “There’s a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that’s not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet.”
Delicate Vaccine Pipeline
Prasad’s new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, “would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses.”
For fast-changing viruses like flu and covid, this could be disastrous. There’s simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.
There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.
‘Checks and Balances’
Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad’s memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks “unethical” and “illegal.”
Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA’s Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. “If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest,” she said.
Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. “You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible,” said Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the covid pandemic.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1140192021-1024x7371744799798-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 07:11:40.700920

(photo submitted).During the upcoming spring semester, University of Missouri sophomore Cade Carman will spend a lot of his time in the state Capitol Building as a student intern.
Over summer break, Carman will head to Washington, D.C., on a scholarship to enhance his study of political science. And while he’s there, he’ll get to spend time with the biggest contributor to his education, Yasmine Arrington Brooks, founder of ScholarCHIPS, which provides grants to aid children with incarcerated parents.
Carman, who grew up in Ralls County, saved his money from helping on the family farm and jobs with the Army Corps of Engineers and a private marina at Mark Twain Lake. But without the $3,500 of annual aid and $1,000 allowance for books, he said, he wouldn’t be studying at the Columbia campus.
“This was by far the biggest scholarship I received,” Carman said in a recent interview with The Independent. “It’s a huge reason why I’m even here at all.”
Carman, who received his award in 2024, is the first of seven ScholarCHIPS scholars from outside the Washington-Northern Virginia area. The program expanded with support from Securus Technologies, a company that contracts with the Missouri Department of Corrections to provide communication services like telephone calls and email over a tablet provided to each person serving a sentence.
At the end of 2023, Brooks said, ScholarCHIPS ships was named a CNN hero for its focus on supporting children of people serving prison sentences. The relationship with Securus came soon after.
“That was the first time that ScholarCHIPS was put on a national stage, and we were starting to get inquiries and letters and postcards from people across the country,” Brooks said. “I just felt like it was a good time to open up our eligibility.”
The key eligibility criteria is pretty simple: Applicants must be the child of someone who is now or has been incarcerated and have a demonstrated financial need. The application window for 2026 scholarships opens in January.
Carman’s mother is serving a 10-year sentence for assault. She told him about the grant program after seeing an ad for it on the tablet computer provided to each inmate by Securus.
“She called me up one day and she said, ‘you know, I think you should apply for this. It looks like a pretty good program. And you might get it,’” Carman said. “And so then that’s exactly what I did.”
He sees his mother one or two times each month, Carman said. She won’t be released in time to see him graduate in 2028, he said.
He’s studying political science with a goal of attending law school after graduation.

“I’ve really always been interested in politics and civics education,” he said. “I like to study history, and so that kind of plays into it a lot.”
The need to make sure students like Carman can attend college is immense, Brooks said. She was raised by her grandmother, she said, and her father has been incarcerated for most of her life.
When she was a junior in high school, she said, she enrolled in a program provided by LearnServe International to develop a community-focused service project. She started with a big problem, mass incarceration, she said.
“I ended up narrowing my focus down to the effects of parental incarceration on children and families,” Brooks said.
Then, while seeking financial aid for college, her grandmother observed that there were no niche programs targeting those children.
“At that time, the statistic was that over 2 million young people in the United States have had an incarcerated parent at some time in their lives,” Brooks said, “and so that turned on a light bulb for me.”
When the time came to present her idea, she said, the judges were so impressed they suggested she create a not-for-profit organization to provide it.
“I do call it a ‘Shark Tank’ for teenagers, but it wasn’t as cutthroat,” she said of the presentation.
The scholarship program isn’t only for elite students — the minimum GPA is 2.5 — but applicants must show their ability and describe what they intend to do with the money in a series of three essays. One essay must discuss the impact of having an incarcerated parent.
“We’re definitely looking for achievers,” Brooks said. “We’re looking for young people who demonstrate the potential to excel in college and be successful and graduate from college.”
Carman impressed judges with his work ethic and his essays, Brooks said.
“He’s a great writer. He’s a great communicator,” she said. “And when we interviewed him, I just fell in love with him.”
In most years, ScholarCHIPS gave eight or fewer awards, depending on financial support, Brooks said. After the recognition from CNN and help from Securus, she decided to use reserves to award 24 grants in 2024, continue to increase the fund’s profile, and hope for the best to finance students throughout their college career.
“What I really wanted to do with this large cohort was to show the need, and also expand the diversity of scholars that we support,” Brooks said.
But the past year hasn’t been as strong as she hoped, she said, with some donors pulling out for a variety of reasons including losing their jobs in the federal government during cutbacks. 
“Anything that we thought was predictable has become unpredictable,” Brooks said. “ And we’ve communicated that with our scholars, including Cade and they’ve been extremely patient and understanding with us.”
Securus has 500,000 tablets in the hands of people incarcerated in 48 of the 50 states. It is the first — and so far the only — major corrections contractor that supports the scholarship fund.
Securus sees the contribution as an investment in the families using its communication services, Margita Thompson, chief corporate affairs officer, said in a statement to The Independent.
A ScholarCHIPS graduate who worked with Securus as a student intern is now employed by the company, she said. The support for seven scholars helps elevate ScholarCHIPS visibility and impact, she added.
“Education is a proven pathway to upward mobility, especially for children of incarcerated parents who face additional barriers,” Thompson said. “Supporting ScholarCHIPS extends that commitment to the next generation.”
Carman graduated high school in a class of 52 and is one of only a handful who are attending college, he said. His rural roots and work for the Corps of Engineers initially had him thinking he would pursue a career in environmental law, he said.
Now he’s not so sure, he said, adding that he’s also thinking about beginning his career as a public defender.
“With everything with my mom, it kind of introduced me to the criminal justice system, which I previously didn’t have a whole lot of interaction with,” Carman said. “It helped me better understand a lot of the problems inside the system.”

The residents there are strongly opposed to the idea. (Picture via Arden website)Happy New Year! How’s 2026 treating you so far? Looks to me like it’s got a new twist on the challenges of 2025, at least when it comes to AI.
“AI,” in case you’ve just awakened from 12 years in a coma, does not stand for a spicy alcoholic drink called “Avocado Inferno.” It’s short for Artificial Intelligence — sort of like the HAL 9000 talking computer in “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
A lot of people have strong opinions about the use of AI and what effect it’s having on education in particular and society in general. But what I want to talk about is how much the surging demand for something artificial is imperiling something very real: our water.
People in Palm Beach County found out recently about plans to build a huge AI data center on 202 acres in Loxahatchee. A lot of those people looked at the project and echoed HAL 9000 by saying: “I’m sorry, I can’t do that.”
A Change.org petition opposing the project drew more than 7,000 signatures in just a month.
The zoning for Project Tango, as it’s known (more on why in a minute) was first approved 10 years ago, long before AI became the flashpoint it is now. But the project’s developer recently sought to expand that zoning to include another 64 acres, which is what tipped off everyone to what was going on.
Mark Offerman via subject
“It wasn’t on anybody’s radar,” Mark Offerman, president of the Palm Beach County Environmental Alliance, told me.
Once they realized what was happening, people turned out in force to tell the Palm Beach County Commission to say no. The Dec. 10 commission meeting, according to WLRN-FM, featured “hours of emotional public comment from more than 50 residents worried about nonstop low-frequency hums, heavy water consumption, and long-term environmental impacts.”
They won — temporarily. But this is just one salvo in a war that’s starting to break out across the state.
A sidestep for Tango
Most of what I know about robots I learned from reading Isaac Aimov and watching “The Terminator.” But AI use has gone far beyond what science fiction envisioned.
Now people are turning to AI for assistance with everything from combating drug abuse to helping human fertility. Heck, you can’t even do a Google search now without tripping over an AI summary of questionable accuracy.
Turns out AI has a pretty bad track record when it comes to reflecting the real world. For proof, I refer you to the many court cases — including one in a Florida criminal case — in which attorneys filed motions written using AI. These lazy limabeans then wound up in hot water because their AI-written motions turned out to contain more fiction than Stephen King’s computer drive.
Stories like that are the reason Merriam-Webster chose “slop” — the mess left behind by careless use of AI — as its “Word of the Year.”
Yet the Florida Legislature, perhaps because it produces so much of its own kind of slop, feels a tremendous deference toward the big-money corporations pushing any sort of development. That’s why they allow these companies to hide their identities.
“State law allows the potential end-user’s identity to be shielded from public records,” Stet News reported. The supposed justification for the secrecy is “to improve the state’s competitive edge.” The fact that it prevents the neighbors from finding out who wants to move in and ruin the neighborhood is just too bad, I guess.
This explains why Palm Beach County officials are calling this AI data center “Project Tango” — apparently a reference to how they’re allowed to use fancy footwork to side-step the Sunshine Law.
To make matters worse, the Project Tango expansion first surfaced on the county commission’s consent agenda.
That’s supposed to be for uncontested items. Scheduling something controversial for the consent agenda is hardly a 2026 trick. It’s more of a throwback to the 1960s.
Fortunately, the anti-AI public showed up for real.
Once in a generation
The growing demand for AI is driving the growth of new AI data centers. As a result, data centers are popping up around the state like mushrooms after a hard rain.
A search of the website “datacenters.com” turns up 139 of them in Florida already, mostly in such urban locations as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Orlando, and Jacksonville.
Sites in more rural areas can sometimes make sense. In June, the Fort Meade City Commission approved a zoning change on 1,164 acres in Polk County to build an AI data center. That land used to be a phosphate mine. Given the environmental track record of phosphate mining, an AI data center could be an improvement.
But others are clearly not compatible with their neighborhood. Take the one that was proposed last fall on a former citrus grove in St. Lucie County.
“Sentinel Grove would be one of the largest data centers in the world, both by area and by energy consumption,” TCPalm.com reported in October. “The 1,218‑acre site would house up to 15 million square feet — more than 260 football fields — of computer systems, server racks and other data-center infrastructure across several buildings.”
Company officials called it “a once-in-a-generation economic project for St. Lucie County.” But the county didn’t agree.
St. Lucie County’s planning and zoning commission voted 4-2 to recommend against approving development, citing concerns of stormwater runoff, construction traffic, and urban sprawl.
“I just can’t even understand it, or see it, or compartmentalize that building being out in the middle of that area,” one of the commission members said.
The recommendation has yet to go before the full county commission. Instead, the developer is now “engaging with surrounding residents and property owners and exploring potential refinements” to the proposal, according to Benjamin Balcer, director of Planning and Zoning Services for St. Lucie County.
Or consider one proposed last year for Osceola County, near Yeehaw Junction (which I always feel compelled to mention was originally named “Jackass Junction” until our prissy DOT made them change it).
The project calls for “nine data center buildings, each three stories with 675,000 square feet and an adjacent equipment yard, for over 7 million square feet,” according to the Orlando Sentinel, which called it “slightly smaller than the world’s largest data center.”
To say this one would not fit with its neighbors is an understatement. It’s next door to the 27,000-acre DeLuca Preserve, one of the state’s largest nature preserves and crucial habitat for the endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow.
A million noisy computers
One of the people I talked to for this column knows a lot about AI data centers because he’s built some. It’s the reason why he opposes the one proposed for Palm Beach County.
Rudolph Tinker via Linkedin
Rudolph Tinker is a political science professor at Palm Beach State College and a licensed general contractor. One of the main problems with such centers, he said, is the noise.
“It’s like having your computer running, but you’ve got a million of them,” he explained.
To have such a tremendous number of components at work inevitably produces a tremendous amount of heat, he told me. Cooling things down requires millions of gallons of water.
“The water consumption by this plant is going to be tremendous,” he predicted.
The bipartisan Environmental and Energy Study Institute reports that AI data centers “can consume up to 5 million gallons per day, equivalent to the water use of a town populated by 10,000 to 50,000 people.” That’s more than 1 billion gallons a year.
Fresh drinking water is in increasingly short supply in this state, to the point that some places are calling for moratoriums on new connections. To let one factory slurp up more than 1 billion gallons every year seems absurdly excessive.
The plant’s electric consumption will be huge as well, Tinker predicted.
“As artificial intelligence data centers multiply across the state,” Medium reported in July, “their voracious appetite for power and water is triggering costly infrastructure upgrades and rate increases that are quietly being passed on to Floridians’ household budgets.”
Drew Martin via Sierra Club
In fact, Drew Martin of the Sierra Club’s Loxahatchee chapter predicted Project Tango will drive up electrical rates for everyone in the county. It doesn’t help that the nearest power plant runs on polluting natural gas, not clean solar power.
Even worse, the location chosen by whoever is behind Project Tango is right next door to the environmentally friendly Arden community, said Offerman of the Palm Beach County Environmental Alliance. The Arden residents were flabbergasted to see they would be on the front lines of the AI battle and fought back hard.
“A facility of this magnitude — operating around the clock with massive electrical usage, water demands, and constant mechanical systems — does not belong anywhere near these homes, farms, or equestrian properties,” one Arden resident wrote to county commissioners. She warned that “Project Tango will permanently alter the character of the region.”
As another Arden resident told the Palm Beach County Zoning Commission: “If you actually ask AI if it’s good to live next to a data center, it will tell you absolutely no.”
An unlikely ally
The zoning commissioners voted 7-2 to say yes to Project Tango, even though the project manager said they were only beginning to study the noise problem and the water usage. Despite Tango doing things backward, the zoning officials were ready to dance with them like Ginger Rogers matching steps with Fred Astaire.
But at the Palm Beach County Commission meeting, the commissioners looked at the angry crowd, listened to their objections — and pushed pause.
Instead of voting to halt the project, they voted to postpone any decision until April. That would give the company time to do all the studies that its project manager had promised.
Still, at least one commissioner got the message.
Maria Sachs via Palm Beach County Commission
“I want to reject the whole application,” said Commissioner Maria Sachs.
We’ll find out in a few months whether Sachs’ colleagues will see the light the way she did. In the meantime, the people opposed to this project picked up an unlikely ally.
I hope you’re sitting down. The ally’s name is Gov. Ron DeSantis. No, I’m not kidding. In early December, DeSantis announced he wants the Legislature to enact what he called “an AI Bill of Rights.”
Most of it involves children and chatbots, but there are two provisions of interest to the folks in Loxahatchee: giving local governments explicit permission to reject AI data centers and forbidding the data centers from being built in agricultural areas.

DeSantis has been on the wrong side of virtually every important environmental issue since he took office. I’m talking about everything from water pollution and toxic algae blooms to Everglades restoration and removal of the Rodman reservoir. Heck, this is the guy who thought it would be a nifty idea to put golf courses in the state parks!
But on this one point, he’s got a point. AI data centers are water-draining, energy-sucking polluters that drive up power bills and drive down residential property values. Local governments should be allowed to say no to them, period.
During the first of a series of legislative committee hearings on AI last month, one industry executive admitted that his colleagues know they’re about as welcome in Florida residential communities as a burning bag of dog poop on the porch.
“To say that data centers are unpopular right now is probably an understatement, to say the least,” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.
Nevertheless, they’re pushing these unpopular projects because they can rake in millions of dollars.
Here’s my proposed New Year’s resolution: Let’s pass a law that says any company that wants to build a massive AI data center in an area not zoned for industry can get a green light only if they put up a bond.
The bond has to cover any damage done — to the water supply, the energy grid, breathability of the air, you name it. The amount would be at least $10 million, with the cost higher for larger projects.

Dec. 16, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceUpon taking office in January President Donald Trump immediately began taking action to expand gas and oil production, driving environmental stories across the nation, and of course, at home here in Michigan. 
The president’s pursuit of energy dominance – despite the U.S. producing record levels of energy in 2024  – and his declaration of a widely disputed energy emergency sparked concerns among environmentalists and supporters of clean energy. 
These moves also brought movement in the battle against Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, the state’s efforts to move away from coal power and encouraged the build out of data centers – which have faced widespread pushback from communities throughout the state. 
With those stories in mind, the Advance is looking back on its biggest environmental stories of 2025.

Data centers draw the ire of residents across the state

As a state law offering tax breaks on data center construction and equipment took effect earlier this year, tech companies are flocking to Michigan in hopes of building out additional facilities to advance artificial intelligence development while communities are increasingly pushing back against these projects.
In the past month, frustration from residents against the lack of transparency into many of these deals – with local officials and landowners bound by non-disclosure agreements – has hit a fever pitch with a few hundred residents gathering at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to push back against these developments. 
While regulations specific to data centers are limited to the conditions for receiving the tax break, lawmakers are stepping up to address their constituents’ concerns, with a bipartisan group of House representatives introducing legislation to repeal the tax breaks for these resource-intensive facilities. 
Another group of lawmakers in the Senate has put forth regulations to bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use from obtaining a water withdrawal permit, require the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish reports on data centers’ energy and water use and ensure residents don’t bear the cost of upgrading water systems to serve these facilities.
 
Line 5 lawsuits continue as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expedites review of tunnel project

Following a years-long legal battle over whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case to remove Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline from the Great Lakes should be heard in state or federal courts, the case returned to the Ingham County’s 30th Judicial Circuit Court in Lansing at the start of the year. 
The United States Supreme Court has also agreed to hear an appeal of the decision that sent the case back to Michigan in the first place.
Additionally, attorneys for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether the state is immune from legal action for its decision to revoke Enbridge’s easement to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet.
A decision to take up this case could carry even further weight, with a federal judge barring the state from enforcing its notice terminating Enbridge’s easement to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes. 
In yet another legal challenge before the Michigan Supreme Court, justices agreed to review whether the Michigan Public Service Commission – which oversees siting matters for pipelines within the state – erred in its decision to issue one of the permits needed for Enbridge to begin construction on its tunnel project. 
The state’s highest court will hear two challenges, one filed by FLOW Water Advocates, and another filed by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs, including the Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center.
Opponents argue the commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac.
Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers’ long awaited environmental impact statement assessing the plan to replace the two segments of pipeline located in the Straits with a new segment placed in a tunnel embedded into the bedrock beneath the lake was issued in May. 
An executive order issued by the Trump Administration in January has also permitted the project’s environmental review to move forward under a shortened timeline.
 
EPA lifts emergency order on Flint water, residents mark milestones on lead line replacement

More than 11 years after the beginning of the Flint Water Crisis, the United States Environmental Protection Agency lifted its emergency order on the city’s drinking water, which was put in place in 2016. 
However, community members were quick to note that the decision, which came alongside the end of the city’s lead line replacement program, does not mean that the city’s pipes are lead free. 
While Flint and the state of Michigan have met their obligations under a 2017 settlement requiring them to replace all lead lines in the city, several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes. Additionally, not all residents have agreed to have their homes checked or their pipes replaced.
The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Residents who need their lead lines replaced can call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.
The city’s recovery could also be hampered by a loss in funding, as Michigan House Republicans voted to eliminate $8.3 million in funding to support services across the city, as the water crisis continues to impact residents and children.

In West Michigan, the first nuclear plant restart in the nation has entered its final phase, with plans to bring two small modular reactors online at the same site.
While the plant has not yet returned to energy production, it has been cleared to bring new fuel on site. 
However, a host of anti-nuclear groups continue to raise concerns about the safety of the restart, with a trio of organizations filing a federal lawsuit arguing the plant is legally barred from resuming operations after entering decommissioning status.
 
Energy emergency draws challenge from Michigan AG

Campbell coal plant in Port Sheldon Township to close. [ONN photo/Dirk Wierenga]Since its issuance on Jan. 20, the Trump Administration’s energy emergency order has drawn criticism from environmentalists across the nation, alongside a legal challenge from Michigan’s attorney general. 
Despite record breaking energy production in 2024, the Trump administration has proclaimed the nation’s energy resources to be insufficient, though Nessel and Democratic attorneys general from 14 other states are arguing the order is unlawful.
In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, and that the administration’s move to fast track permits for several activities tied to energy production undermine the rights of the states.
Alongside fast tracking the environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project, the Trump Administration has used the order as a justification to repeatedly extend operations at a West Michigan Coal plant that was slated to close at the end of May. 
According to the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million between the initial extension issued on May 23, and Sept. 30. The latest extension, issued on Nov. 18, will keep the plant operating through Feb. 17, 2026. Nessel has challenged the extension.
 
Trump commits to supporting project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes
Crews search for invasive Asian carp near Chicago , Aug. 2, 2011, following several recent discoveries of their genetic material in Lake Calumet. Teams swept the lake with half-mile-long nets.

A decades-long project aimed at keeping invasive carp from establishing a foothold in the Great Lakes, secured support from the White House in May, following efforts from the Whitmer administration to ensure the project would receive funding allocated under former President Joe Biden’s administration. 
The $1.15 billion dollar project, which secured its first construction contract in December 2024, is a joint effort sponsored by Michigan, Illinois and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The project targets a critical choke point near Joliet, Ill., instituting a series of deterrents to keep invasive carp and other nuisance species out of the Great Lakes. 
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that the carp could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region – including rivers and inland lakes – alongside  the region’s $20 billion fishing and boating industries.

House Constitution Chairman Price Wallace, a Republican from Mendenhall, and Senate Elections Chairman Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, told Mississippi Today that they will likely file bills to give Mississippians a way to circumvent the Legislature and place issues on a statewide ballot. 
“It’s important,” England said. “It’s important for the people to feel like ‘If our Legislature is not reacting to things we want, then we want to have this process available to us.’”

Mississippians had the constitutional right to a ballot initiative starting in 1914, but the state Supreme Court threw it out in 1922. The initiative went dormant until the Legislature and voters restored the right by passing a measure in 1992, allowing voters to amend the state constitution. But the Supreme Court again nullified it on technical grounds in 2021 in a ruling on a lawsuit over voters passing a medical marijuana initiative.
Ever since the Mississippi Supreme Court invalidated the ballot initiative then, legislators have been unable to reach a consensus on how to restore the right to voters. 
Since the court’s ruling, some lawmakers have questioned whether Mississippi needs an initiative and raised concerns that uber-wealthy out-of-state special interests can manipulate voters through ballot initiatives. 
To assuage these concerns, Senate leaders have proposed a new initiative process that requires petitioners to collect a larger number of voters’ signatures to have something placed on a ballot than in the previous process. 
“The process should be difficult because it goes around and goes outside our constitutional republic system of government,” England said. 
House leaders, on the other hand, have pushed for an initiative process similar to the previous one. Last year,  Rep. Wallace advocated for a process that required petitioners to gather around 140,000 signatures before it could be considered on the ballot. 
But the Simpson County Republican said he hopes lawmakers could work constructively this year to find some common ground on how to restore the process. 
“We’re all going to work on something,” Wallace said. 
Both House and Senate leaders agree that a new initiative process should only allow voters to make changes to state law, not the Constitution, and not allow voters to propose initiatives related to abortion and the public pension system. 
During the 30 years that the state had an initiative, only seven proposals made it to a statewide ballot: two initiatives for term limits, eminent domain reform, voter ID, a personhood amendment, medical marijuana, and a measure requiring lawmakers to fully fund public education.
Of those seven, only eminent domain, voter ID and medical marijuana were approved by voters. The rest were rejected.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/11114638/3X0A7482-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 07:11:40.700920

These stories broke news, uncovered accountability gaps and captured moments that shaped public conversation across the state.

From breaking news to deeply reported features and investigations, VTDigger’s journalism followed the issues shaping life in the state. Here’s what resonated with readers most.
More than 400,000 readers checked out our most-read story of 2025: Carly Berlin and Greta Solsaa’s intimate look at the hundreds of Vermonters forced out of housing when the state’s motel voucher program expired in July. The reporting humanized the policy shift, and its impact resonated widely.
Solsaa was also behind the second-most read story of the year, covering the protest sparked by Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Vermont in March. Earlier reporting by former intern Klara Bauters on Vance’s planned visit similarly drew heavy readership. 
Education coverage drew strong attention as well. Readers closely followed stories about the federal government withholding funds from Vermont schools and a controversial — and later reversed — Vermont Agency of Education directive that would have required school districts to certify compliance with a federal order banning what it described as “illegal” diversity, equity and inclusion-related programs. A local story about the South Burlington School District superintendent resigning following allegations of creating a toxic work environment also interested readers.
Public safety coverage ranked among the year’s most-read topics. Coverage by Alan Keays, Habib Sabet, Ethan Weinstein and Paul Heintz of the January fatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agent and a second person during a traffic stop in the Northeast Kingdom on the day President Donald Trump was inaugurated drew widespread interest. 
Environmental reporting resonated strongly, particularly Olivia Geiger’s coverage on states challenging Vermont’s Climate Superfund Law, K. Figenbaum’s reporting on rising brook trout populations and Solsaa’s examination of  Vermonters’ reactions to the Trump administration’s push for expanded logging in national forests. 
Readers also connected with Austyn Gaffney’s feature on the foreclosure of a century-old Norwich dairy farm and Kevin O’Connor’s remembrance of a 102-year-old Vermont World War II veteran. 
Other widely read stories included Peter D’Auria’s reporting on Vermont prisons being locked down in March as corrections staff searched for weapons and contraband, as well as several stories by intern Henry Fernandez examining the fallout from Gardener’s Supply’s bankruptcy, flooding in the NEK and Addison County and a Central Vermont business nonprofit leader being placed on leave pending an investigation.

Reporters also reflected on the stories that stayed with them most this year and why those pieces were especially meaningful to report. Here are some of their reflections.
Kevin O’Connor
As Vermont communities marked the anniversaries of the devastating floods of 2023 and 2024, O’Connor reported on how towns continued to struggle in 2025 with nearly $1 billion in estimated statewide damage, struggling to finance repairs while still rebuilding. He also covered Vermont’s ongoing battle with drug dependence, highlighting community-level efforts and profiling a Vermonter who moved from addiction and desperation to becoming part of a local solution. 
Shaun Robinson
Robinson’s reporting on behind-the-scenes political maneuvering that threatened a package of election law reforms was credited with contributed to the legislation’s passage. He also held elected officials accountable through records-based reporting, including stories revealing gaps in U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s public portrayal of her corporate fundraising and documenting how state Sen. Russ Ingalls switched all of the newscasts on his newly purchased radio stations in the Northeast Kingdom to Fox News. 
Greta Solsaa
Through a monthslong investigation, Solsaa worked with nursing home advocates, state officials and public records to uncover a pattern of care problems at some of Vermont’s most troubled nursing homes under new ownership. Her reporting traced the issues in part to a temporary state approval process that lacked transparency and failed to prevent problems. Solsaa also highlighted her on-the-ground reporting during Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Vermont, when national and international attention focused on Vermonters’ responses to President Donald Trump’s second election and the direction of his administration.
Corey McDonald
McDonald’s coverage of K–12 education reform captured a year marked by both uncertainty and optimism, as communities weighed the promise of Act 73 against fears about the future of local schools. Early reporting on the issue foreshadowed debates that would dominate the year. He also cited a memorable story from a Burlington Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting, where residents and city officials confronted the difficult realities of the city’s overdose and substance use crisis and debated whether an overdose prevention center could help.
Alan Keays
Keays highlighted reporting that brought new transparency to long-hidden information, including a secret report detailing police actions leading up to the death of a young Rutland City police trainee. He also pointed to a story that offered readers a deeper look into the drunken driving arrest of Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos.
Ethan Weinstein
Weinstein described his reporting on immigration enforcement as especially memorable, noting that internal communications from Vermont prison officials helped illuminate how ICE uses the state’s prisons and why that arrangement has created challenges for Vermont. He also pointed to a story examining the widespread problems caused by remote court hearings, which relied heavily on the perspectives of incarcerated people and revealed a largely unseen part of the justice system.
K. Figenbaum
Figenbaum pointed to a deep dive into why Greensboro voters rejected an affordable housing proposal for their town hall, a story that reflected broader trends facing communities statewide. Another favorite focused on a Vermont Fish & Wildlife project that began in the Northeast Kingdom and has since expanded across the state, the country and into Canada, improving fish populations while boosting flood resilience.
Theo Wells-Spackman
Wells-Spackman cited a story about the Holland food shelf, which was able to remain open thanks to an extraordinarily generous donation from a VTDigger reader after reading his piece. He also reflected on the challenges of reporting on food assistance for refugees, a story complicated by language barriers and the sensitivity of the subject matter, but shaped by the generosity of sources willing to share their experiences.
Austyn GaffneyGaffney pointed to investigations into a Koch-funded campaign aimed at reversing climate action in Vermont, and a reporting project examining how a routine Vermont traffic stop raised broader questions about racial profiling and border enforcement.

Vance at the Nebraska Republican Party booth at the Nebraska State Fair on Aug 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Like the last time President Donald Trump was in office, the White House and its political movement have influenced Nebraska’s political landscape and its top political stories of 2025, but not always to its liking. 
Nebraskans will see crops of national politicians, consultants and reporters visit. Reporters have already started coming, from Lexington to McCook. 
Once again, Trump motivates all sides.
Some of Trump’s agenda has directly affected the state, including the state budget, with lawmakers facing a projected $471 million deficit tied partly to changes made by a federal tax and spending bill the president calls “big” and “beautiful.” Gov. Jim Pillen has told the agencies under his control that he plans to balance the budget largely by cutting $500 million in state spending.
Nebraska has seen its economy face headwinds in 2025 that appear to be leveling out. Trump’s trade wars have had an economic impact, with Nebraska farmers bracing for another tough year, plagued by low corn and soybean prices. The Trump administration is trying to ease some of the disruption with $12 billion in ag-focused aid.

The president’s push for deportations also reached Nebraska, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha sent people to a North Platte jail. The raids spurred protests in the state’s two largest cities.
And Trump’s hold on GOP politics has influenced decisions made by top state officials, including the governor, who visited Washington, D.C. relentlessly. He matters in a state where Republicans hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage. 
As with most midterm elections, this year’s results could hinge on how people think the president, governor and party in power are handling things. 
The 2026 midterms start early
The Cornhusker State is used to national political attention in the competitive Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. But the spotlight on the slightly right-leaning swing district is brighter with Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring. He decided last summer not to seek reelection. 
Bacon, who often criticized Trump but typically voted with Republicans, fended off Democratic challengers for nearly a decade as the district became a “blue dot” in the Electoral College, electing Trump once in 2016 and rejecting him in 2020 and 2024.  
Bacon told reporters he could win re-election but said it’s time for “a new Republican” to win and hold the seat. Two Republicans are vying for the nomination.

But losing the incumbent advantage has local and national political experts viewing the 2nd District as a possible pickup opportunity for Democrats. That optimism is reflected in the number of Democratic candidates running, six.
Nebraska Democratic leaders, speaking during a visit to Omaha by former President Joe Biden, pointed to John Ewing Jr.’s mayoral win last year over three-time incumbent GOP Mayor Jean Stothert as the latest evidence of the kind of blue “wave” Democrats hope is coming in 2026. Even the 1st Congressional District in eastern Nebraska has a Democratic primary.
Another Nebraska race drawing an unusual number of national eyeballs is the U.S. Senate race between U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and former labor union leader Dan Osborn, who is running as a nonpartisan. 


Among Nebraska’s top political stories from 2025

Nebraska and ICE remake state prison in McCook into migrant detention center.


U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., retires, and the fight to replace him in NE-02 heats up.


President Donald Trump endorses Gov. Jim Pillen in governor’s race that might include rematch of 2022 GOP primary with Charles Herbster.


Democratic Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing wins mayor’s race against three-term Republican incumbent Mayor Jean Stothert.


Registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn challenges GOP U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts.


Legislative Bill 89 passes, defining male and female for Nebraska K-12 and college sports.


Nebraska’s state budget faces another projected deficit in 2026 after budget cuts, fund transfers in 2025.



Osborn gained national attention for his 2024 bid against Nebraska’s senior senator, U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., whose six percentage point win was closer than expected. He has built a brand around his Navy veteran hat and flannel shirts, fed in part by hosting meet-and-greets in bars across Nebraska.
Osborn argues Washington, D.C., and Nebraska have forgotten working people and serve donors and special interests. He argues, among other things, that unions need federal help to protect workers’ rights and wants to make the tax code fairer. 
Ricketts has emphasized his conservative record of service, including two spending restraint-driven terms as governor until Pillen appointed him to the seat in 2023. Ricketts won a special election in 2024 to serve Sasse’s final two years.
The race has already been heated, with both campaigns wasting no opportunity to trade blows. 
Ricketts and his team have tried framing Osborn as a “fake independent,” pointing to Osborn receiving donations and support from Democrats and using fundraising infrastructure that’s often used by Democrats and criticizing him paying himself and his wife — which is legal.
Osborn has said Ricketts represents the people and corporate interests that the current “rigged” system tilted towards.
State budget woes
During this year’s legislative session, some Nebraska lawmakers embraced culture wars, while others pushed back against new voter-approved laws. 
GOP majorities in the Legislature, often with gubernatorial support and at least one Democratic lawmaker, tried to slow voter-approved increases in the minimum wage. And a bipartisan group of senators fought over whether legislation was needed to help implement legalizing medical cannabis. 
But the main story of the last legislative session is likely to be repeated in 2026, work to fill a state budget deficit that at one point grew to $432 million. After making numerous cuts senators acknowledged as painful, the session concluded with the state’s two-year budget projecting a modest $4 million surplus.
The surplus didn’t last. New economic projections made in July put Nebraska back into a deficit. When Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board met again in October, projections brought the expected shortfall to $471 million.

Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is expected to cost Nebraska’s state government about $406 million over the next four fiscal years, according to the state Department of Revenue.
Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista told the Examiner, “There is the budget, and then there’s everything else.” His top priority is filling the budget hole by Day 50 of the 60-day session that starts Jan. 7.
Other political issues that lawmakers will likely face include the possible expulsion of a senator, discord over the repurposing of a state prison facility into an ICE detention center and a continued push for property tax relief. 
Last year and this, Pillen has made offsetting property taxes with broadened sales taxes a centerpiece of his agenda, including a special session that took a different approach.  
His preferred approach faces an uphill climb this year, with four Republican lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Unicameral pledging not to raise taxes during the 2026 session. They argue spending should be cut.
That could set up an interesting dynamic in the governor’s race.
Trump and the Nebraska Governor’s Mansion 
One of the biggest subplots of the 2026 governor’s race reared its head early and often in 2025, the prospect of Pillen facing a potential GOP primary race rematch with multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster, a longtime donor of Trump’s.
Herbster lost to Pillen in the 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary, finishing second in a three-way race that also included then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd District. 
Herbster is expected to decide whether to run again as early as this month. But this time, unlike 2022, Herbster will have to run without Trump’s endorsement. Former Democratic State Sen. Lynne Walz is also exploring a bid.
Pillen secured Trump’s endorsement in November after visiting the White House at least nine times in 2025.  Political strategist Perre Neilan of the Neilan Strategy Group in Lincoln has called the Trump endorsement a “big get” in a GOP primary.

Herbster told the Examiner that “Pillen’s shortcomings make it hard to say no” to running in 2026 and that he will decide closer to the new year. The businessman said that while he is disappointed in Trump’s endorsement, he said, “It is entirely reasonable that he would endorse the incumbent Republican governor.” 
Pillen told Politico that the 2022 GOP race is “history.” He told the Lincoln Journal Star that the ICE facility and other ways he supports Trump aren’t politically motivated. 
Pillen tried unsuccessfully to push Winner-Take-All in the statehouse again this year, a change Trump has personally supported on social media despite lacking the votes to pass in the Legislature. He has praised Trump repeatedly since his return to the presidency. Trump’s White House also quietly tried to push the state to consider mid-decade congressional redistricting, but failed to gain traction. 
The governor has stayed supportive of Trump’s approach to trade, which some in agriculture have criticized as economically disruptive.
Nebraska, under Pillen, volunteered to be the first state in the country to implement new federal work requirements for Medicaid recipients, beginning May 1 of this year. 
Pillen administration staffers initiated conversations with the federal government about the possibility of assisting ICE, offering a new migrant detention center at a state prison facility in McCook. 
McCook is now home to an ICE facility that aims to be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement, though its small capacity shows it is “largely symbolic.”

Hand-crafted gifts keep a faithful domestic servant humming, writes columnist David Romtvedt.
The post The refrigerator and resisting planned obsolescence appeared first on WyoFile .","Whenever I go away for more than a few days I come home to find something broken. The cable over the spring-loaded pulley that allows the garage door to open and close somehow tangled itself up in my absence, so the door was stuck. The storm door was missing a pane of glass, maybe attacked by the wind or an errant stone. A hinge had fallen off a cupboard door. The water faucet in the bathroom sink dripped. Or the bathtub faucet. Or the kitchen faucet. The drain in the basement was clogged and the floor covered in several inches of water. I turned the oven on and the element made a noise like pfs-zzt and went dead. Do these domestic objects miss me when I’m gone? Do they, as we all do, long for loving attention?

Opinion

Returning home from a trip a few years ago, I opened the refrigerator door and it flew away, both hinges having come undone in my absence so that it was held in place only by the magnetic insulating seals. I picked up the door along with everything that had flown out, turned off the refrigerator, emptied it, and began figuring out how to put things back together.
The refrigerator is a Danish model we bought 30 years ago. It’s tall and narrow with the upper two-thirds serving as the refrigerator and the lower third, the freezer. No bending over for things in the fridge, which is convenient. But the feature that really convinced us to buy it was dual compressors — one for the fridge and one for the freezer — which meant that the refrigerator-freezer unit would use less electricity, maintain more precise temperature control, and last longer than a similar unit with a single compressor.
Aside from the flying door, there is one other small problem — all the interior trays and compartments along with the handles to both the freezer and fridge are made of plastic. The lower tray inside the refrigerator door cracked first along both ends. The tray hung precariously out in space, bottles and jars leaning forward as if ready to launch themselves off a cliff and into the abyss below — the kitchen floor.
I slathered low-temperature glue along the broken edges of plastic then drilled small holes on either side of the split section and sewed the tray’s severed parts together using very light gauge woven wire. That worked for a good long time until the tray cracked in another spot. This time I drilled through the inside of the door and tray and wired the hanging section of tray to the door itself. It works great although it looks a bit like the stitching on Frankenstein’s forehead.
Then one day as I opened the fridge, the shiny white plastic door handle split much as the interior tray had — vertically from top to midway down its length. And on my return from my last trip — an entire month away — the freezer door handle split just as the fridge door handle had. I would have to make new handles for both doors. 
I went through my scrap lumber pile and found a relatively clean, smooth three-foot-long length of 1-by-4 finish-grade pine. To avoid possible splitting from the ends as I worked the wood, I drew a paper pattern of the handles and traced it in the center of the board’s length. Then came drawing, carving, cutting, drilling, sanding and oiling the wooden replacement handles. It’s the interior cut that’s the hardest. It took me several hours for each handle using my clumsy tools — a hand brace and bit that was my father’s, several chisels of various sizes, a hacksaw, and an electric drill, circular saw, and sander.
Perhaps you are wondering why I didn’t avoid all this home manufacturing and simply buy a replacement plastic tray and door handles. I’m guessing you know why. These parts are no longer available. You can’t buy the five-dollar tray or the seven-dollar molded plastic handles that allow you to open and close the doors of your $1,500 energy-efficient and long-lasting, dual-compressor refrigerator freezer. For 30 years, this faithful domestic servant has stood as a sentinel in our kitchen. Sewing up the tray and making wooden handles seemed the least I could do to show my gratitude. Little gifts to honor a machine that has served us so well and doesn’t deserve to be thrown away as just another victim of planned obsolescence.

Judges across Tennessee are now demanding greater accountability from people who have been ordered to give up their guns, a shift aimed at strengthening protections for domestic violence victims.
The change is being adopted county by county, after state lawmakers bowed to opposition from the National Rifle Association over a bill that would have taken that reform statewide.
The move follows reporting by WPLN and ProPublica over the past two years that found Tennessee’s lax gun laws and enforcement have allowed firearms to remain in dangerous hands. The state consistently has one of the highest rates of women killed by men, and most of those homicides are committed with guns. The news organizations’ analysis found that about 1 in 4 victims of domestic violence gun homicides were killed by someone who was barred from having a firearm.
In Tennessee, when someone is convicted of a domestic violence charge or is subject to an order of protection, they are not allowed to possess a gun. A person ordered to relinquish their firearm can turn it over to a third party, like a friend or relative, for safekeeping. But the state doesn’t require them to disclose whose hands the weapon ends up in. Advocates say that makes it hard to ensure that the guns were given up — and that they were given to someone who is legally allowed to hold on to them.
As part of its investigation, WPLN and ProPublica reported on an East Tennessee county that had transformed its justice system for domestic violence victims. Scott County’s reforms include a requirement that when a court is stripping domestic violence abusers of their guns, they must tell the court in a written affidavit who is going to take custody of their weapons. The county also asks for the address of that person, who is asked to sign an affidavit saying they are in receipt of the weapons. None of these extra measures of accountability, however, are required on the state’s standard gun-dispossession form.
“The [state’s] form is really incomplete,” said Becky Bullard with Nashville’s Office of Family Safety. “We can’t have someone dispossess of their firearm lawfully if we don’t know who they’re giving the gun to.”
At least nine counties, including Tennessee’s two largest, Davidson and Shelby, have amended the state’s gun dispossession affidavit to require information about who will be taking possession of the weapon. Other counties are also considering the change, advocates say.
“When I heard about what Scott County was doing, I was shocked,” said Shelby County Judge Greg Gilbert, who adjusted that court’s form when he found out that courts were able to do that themselves. “It does make it a little more likely that people will take this seriously.”
Last year, two Republican lawmakers introduced legislation that would have made Scott County’s form the default for the rest of the state, but the bill was pushed to 2026 after opposition from the Tennessee Firearms Association and the NRA. Neither association responded to requests for comment at the time. One of the lawmakers who introduced the bill, Sen. Becky Massey, a Knox County Republican, said she would move forward with the bill again if her House counterpart, Rep. Kelly Keisling, did. But Keisling, a Republican whose district includes Scott County, said he is “uncertain as to the future of this particular piece of legislation.”
This month, advocates for victims of domestic violence also pushed for a state council on domestic violence to recommend adoption of the amended form. That effort failed after a procedural mishap; the group plans to revisit the topic at its next meeting in March.
“We really do not have a minute to lose. This is a battle that we have been fighting around a form for years,” said Bullard, who has advocated for this reform since a deadly shooting in 2018 at a Waffle House where the man traveled with a gun that he was ordered to give up. “And it could affect someone in the next minute.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20240521-Kranitz-TNGunsRural-503-PDcrop_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-01 06:56:29.625232

It’s been a about two years since Army veteran James Watson moved into his neat, three-bedroom, traditional ranch-style home in southeast Raleigh.
On a visit in late February, the home, which Watson purchased through the Raleigh Area Land Trust, looked as though the proverbial GI party had taken place the night before — it was spotless and in perfect order.
The house was gutted and remodeled before Watson took ownership. He eagerly showed it off, first pointing out the modern kitchen, then taking a visitor to see each room. In a bedroom he uses for an office, Watson proudly shared family pictures and prized photos he took with former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.
 A dream come true
From Watson’s perspective, all that has happened to him over the past two-plus years has been nothing short of a miracle.  
The maintenance supervisor for a Raleigh housing provider and freelance handyman had been a renter his entire adult life. He lived a good chunk of it in Walnut Terrace, one of the city’s public housing communities.
Watson thought owning a home was improbable until 2023 when at age 62 he became able to purchase what he refers to as his “forever home.”
“I always wanted to be a homeowner but never thought I could be one because of my age,” Watson said. “The older you get, the less chance I thought I would have [to own a home].”
Watson’s once elusive dream of homeownership came true with the help of the Raleigh Area Land Trust (RALT). The nonprofit, which was founded in 2019, made Watson its first homeowner under the “community land trust model,” which is designed to ensure long-term affordability. RALT has one other land trust home in the same community and more planned throughout Wake County.
Watson purchased his 1,000 square-foot Southgate Drive home for just under $200,000. The house sits on a little more than a quarter-acre lot with a large, fenced backyard and an impressive deck that Watson added.
The mortgage payment on Watson’s dream home is around $850 a month. He was paying $900 to rent a house before moving to his new home.
“It was just a shotgun house,” Watson said. “I was still doing the maintenance. They didn’t have maintenance people to do the work, so it was really costing me more to stay there. If I’m going to be doing the maintenance, I might as well own my own.”

Kevin Campbell, executive director of RALT, said an affordable place to live for homebuyers like Watson is the reason RALT exists. “We’re trying to make an affordable homeownership opportunity with an ability to easily earn some equity along the way and at the same time, keeping property affordable permanently,” Campbell said.
Here’s how it works:

Once a home is ready, RALT sells the home at an affordable price to an eligible, qualified homebuyer household, but retains ownership of the land in trust for the community.
Ownership of the land is conveyed to the homeowner through a 99-year, inheritable and renewable ground lease.
To preserve the long-term affordability of the home, the ground lease agreement sets the resale price of the home should the owner ever decide to sell.
RALT homeowners agree to limit the amount of equity they will keep at resale so that the same opportunity and affordable price that was available to them can be made available to the next income-qualifying household.
This keeps the home affordable for generations to come and avoids rapidly increasing housing prices in neighborhoods.

Coping with a perfect storm of unaffordability 
The thing that makes community land trusts most appealing is the permanent affordability of the homes, Campbell said. That’s critical in fast-growing regions like the Research Triangle as they lose affordable housing units and populations grow, he said.
“I’ve been doing affordable housing for 35 years,” said Campbell who previously worked for Habitat for Humanity. “It’s the most stressed time I’ve seen by far. You have this perfect storm. You’ve got increased construction costs, you have higher mortgage rates for this area, you have a big population increase, so that’s putting pressure on supply.”    
According to the North Carolina Housing Coalition, nearly half of Wake County renters — 72,313 households — have difficulty affording their homes. Meanwhile 17% of homeowners — 48,177 households — have trouble affording their homes. Families that spend more than 30% of income on housing are considered “cost burdened.”
A Housing Supply Gap Analysis of North Carolina’s rental and for-sale housing supply funded by the NC Chamber Foundation projects Wake County will grow by 41,241 households by the end of the decade.
Campbell noted the Chamber’s report found a current housing gap of 53,000 units in Wake County.
“I think it’s expected to grow to 125,000 units over the next five years, so the trend is really bad and we’re trying to do what we can to address that,” Campbell said.
Chipping away at the problem
RALT is currently working on a $8.3 million, 18-unit project called The Cottages of Idlewild to serve lower income residents earning between 30% to 80% of the area median income. The project, which is located about a mile northeast of the city’s center on Lane Street and Idlewild Avenue, is a public/private partnership that received funding from the City of Raleigh. It will include four rental units and 14 for-sale units for first-time homebuyers.
Campbell said construction of the project, which will be developed based on the Community Land Trust model, will start this year and be completed in 2026.

N.C. Central University basketball coach LeVelle Moton is also a partner in the project through his company, Raleigh Raised Development. Moton grew up in the neighborhood. His grandmother lived on Lane Street and great-grandmother on Idlewild Avenue.
“A lot of people have been displaced,” Moton told NC Newsline in September. “There are a lot of people who didn’t understand gentrification. They either, Number One, sold their houses or were asked to move. So now, we’re trying to educate our community on the importance of homeownership and owning something.”
RALT received a grant from the Town of Cary and will develop four homes there, Campbell said. The nonprofit plans to purchase two homes in Apex and “hopefully” four others in Raleigh, he said.
“We’re building some momentum,” Campbell said. “I have to say that, even with the need as great as it is, the process is slow.”
RALT was incorporated in 2018. It is fairly new when compared to the Durham Community Land Trust, which was incorporated in 1987 and Community Home Trust in Orange County, which was established in 2001.
There are at least four more Community Land Trusts across the state; Asheville-Buncombe Community Land Trust, Cape Fear Community Land Trust, Inc., Watauga Community Housing Trust and West Side Community Land Trust in Charlotte.

Helping homebuyers negotiate the process
Angel Johnson, RALT’s director of homeownership and stewardship, guides homebuyers such as Watson through the process.
“I’m kind of holding their hand along this process, making sure they’re connected to whoever they’re connected with, meeting their financial obligations, making sure they’re not affecting their credit adding any debt,” Johnson said, describing her rule in the process.
Running up credit cards, not paying bills on time and co-signing loans are all common mistakes people in the process of buying homes can make to ruin their chance at homeownership, Johnson said.
In May, Watson is getting married. He laughs easily when asked if he understands he’ll be giving up his bachelor’s pad.
But life is good, and he is grateful.
“I really appreciate y’all for what you did for me,” Watson said, turning to Campbell and Johnson. “I always tell them if you ever need me for anything, I can’t say ‘no’.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSCN0103-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 06:12:16.006989

Oklahoma lawmakers have passed measures limiting foreign ownership of farmland in response to concerns about Chinese nationals and companies buying agricultural land in the state.
While approximately 4.3% of Oklahoma farmland is foreign-owned, according to the USDA’s most recent filings, most of that is held by Canadian and European companies for renewable energy projects. Less than 1% of that share is Chinese.
Still, anti-China rhetoric has largely driven legislation, and a recent poll shows Republicans nationwide are concerned about Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland. Despite that concern, this new state legislation includes exemptions for Chinese-owned food supply companies.
The carve-outs specifically exempt Smithfield Foods, the only Chinese-owned company with farmland in Oklahoma. Smithfield Foods, owned by China’s WH Group, is not affected by the restrictions and continues to raise hogs on roughly 2,575 acres in northwest Oklahoma.
Oklahoma’s restrictions mirror a broader national movement in mostly Republican states to curb foreign farmland ownership, driven by security concerns over countries the government deems “hostile.” Yet, unlike states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma lawmakers have shown little interest in forcing Chinese-owned companies already operating in the state to divest or limit their ability to expand.
In 2023, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin ordered the agri-chemical firm Syngenta, owned by the Chinese conglomerate ChemChina, to sell its 160-acre research site and fined the company $280,000. The move followed a new state law restricting foreign investments from certain countries.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted the decision during a press conference announcing the Trump Administration’s National Farm Security Action Plan, a twelve-page outline aimed at “addressing the imperative for agriculture security in America.”
“I’m so proud of the fact that Arkansas was the first state in the country to kick a Chinese-owned company off of our farmland and out of our state,” Sanders said at the press conference in July. “And we made them pay for it. Very Trump-esque.”
During the same press conference, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro brought up Smithfield Foods, noting that after its purchase by the WH Group, it “now basically controls an eighth of the world’s pork supply.” Counties where Smithfield operates in Oklahoma — Beaver, Harper, and Ellis — are even highlighted on a map included in Trump’s plan. Neither the plan nor those involved in its rollout specified any steps they might take to force Smithfield to divest.
The Smithfield exception 
Oklahoma Senate Bill 212 expanded existing restrictions on foreign ownership of farmland.
The law, which took effect in November 2023 — around the same time Arkansas ordered Syngenta to divest — could have impacted Smithfield Foods’ operations in Oklahoma. But the following year, lawmakers added an exception: landownership restrictions do not apply to foreign companies that have an agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS).
CFIUS is an interagency committee that reviews foreign investments in American companies and real estate to see if they pose national security risks. It can approve, block, or require changes to deals to protect U.S. interests.

WH Group’s 2013 acquisition of Smithfield was cleared by CFIUS, effectively shielding it from Oklahoma’s foreign ownership restrictions.
“We’re honoring the Constitution by those international corporations being vetted by the federal government,” says Oklahoma State Sen. Brent Howard, a Republican from Altus who introduced the legislation that shielded Smithfield.
Smithfield Foods has repeatedly rejected claims of “infiltration” of the U.S. pork industry by the Chinese Communist Party, emphasizing that it is managed by American executives. “We currently own approximately 85,000 acres of farmland [in the U.S.], and that number has declined considerably since the 2013 WH Group acquisition,” says Ray Atkinson, a senior director at Smithfield Foods. “The farmland we own does not present a national security risk and represents less than 1/100th of one percent of all American farmland.”
Enforcement remains selective 
During a September hearing at the Oklahoma State Capitol, a handful of lawmakers and state officials convened to discuss the perceived threat of the Chinese Communist Party in the state. Guest speakers at the hearing included Jan Jekielek, a journalist and editor for the far-right media outlet The Epoch Times, and Tom Rawlings, policy director of State Shield — both outspoken anti-China organizations.
Although the guest speakers provided no concrete examples of Chinese interference in state politics, they advocated for a state-level Foreign Agents Registration Act, which would require anyone acting on behalf of foreign governments to disclose their ties.
During his presentation, Brad Clark, general counsel with the Oklahoma attorney general’s office, turned the discussion to farmland. Clark explained how the new laws can bolster the state’s crackdown on illegal marijuana operations, some of which are run by Chinese individuals.

After Oklahoma legalized medical marijuana in 2018, the industry has drawn an influx of out-of-state growers. Alongside that growth, there have been reports of labor exploitation and illegally operated farms, including some linked to Chinese organized crime.
Clark says the attorney general’s office currently has 150 pending cases involving illegal marijuana farms. But in an interview with Investigate Midwest, he did not specify if any of those cases involve Chinese nationals or illegally owned farmland, citing the ongoing nature of the investigations.
The office says it has no closed cases related to illicit land use.
Absent from the discussion was Smithfield Foods, the only Chinese-owned company that has lobbied state officials nationwide while also owning farmland in Oklahoma.
In 2024 and 2025, Smithfield spent at least $1.58 million on lobbying and more than $90,000 in political contributions during the 2024 election cycle. The company is represented on the board of the Oklahoma Pork Council, a trade group with registered lobbyists.
During the hearing, Howard asked Clark whether SB 212 has forced any foreign companies in Oklahoma to divest.
“We received questions early on from corporations on mergers and acquisitions as they were going through those processes and came to the realization that SB 212 was taking effect soon,” Clark said, in response. “[They] needed to restructure that merger, that acquisition, so it’s highly likely that [divestment] has been involved.”
The attorney general’s office declined to answer Investigate Midwest’s questions about which corporations altered or abandoned their merger or acquisition plans, or answer specific questions about Smithfield Foods and potential divestment.
“The attorney general is against and will fight any individual or entity that exploits Oklahoma jobs to foreign nationalists or others who are not Oklahomans,” Clark says. “And that would certainly include foreign adversaries like China.”
Clark also noted that no one from the Trump administration has yet reached out to the attorney general’s office to work on the National Farm Security Action Plan, the administration’s report that highlights the counties where Smithfield Foods operates in the state.
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and other Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation have been vocal about what they see as the threat from China and the need to restrict foreign ownership of farmland. Last year, Stitt issued an executive order aimed at reducing Oklahoma’s exposure to the Chinese Communist Party.

On the federal level, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma introduced the bipartisan Security and Oversight of International Landholdings (SOIL) Act of 2025, calling for mandatory CFIUS review of foreign agricultural land purchases. Oklahoma U.S. Rep. Frank Lucas introduced the Agricultural Risk Review Act of 2025, which would make the secretary of agriculture a permanent member of CFIUS.
Stitt’s executive order, which directs the state’s retirement system to divest from foreign adversary countries like China, makes no mention of Smithfield Foods and potential divestment, and the bills introduced by Lankford and Lucas earlier this year are pending in Congress.
Stitt, Lankford, and Lucas did not respond to requests for comment.
Although Trump’s National Farm Security Action Plan emphasizes protecting the country’s farmland, it also calls for efforts to “strengthen domestic agricultural productivity.”
Smithfield Foods controls an estimated 23% of the U.S. pork market, while JBS, a Brazilian conglomerate, holds a similar share of the U.S. beef supply—a fact that was pointed out by Kansas senator Roger Marshall during the plan’s launch.

Both JBS and Smithfield went public this year, a move that could help them expand operations and further solidify their presence in the U.S. food system.
Despite introducing legislation across the country to restrict foreign ownership of farmland, lawmakers do not appear motivated to target companies like JBS or Smithfield, or to bring more of the food supply chain under domestic control.
A study from Michigan State University analyzed 143 bills aimed at restricting foreign ownership of agricultural land, introduced across 34 states, along with the actions of more than 6,700 state legislators. Despite China’s nominal makeup of total farmland in the state and across the country, the researchers found that fear and skepticism about Chinese influence in the US is what continues to drive the legislation.
“Of all the farmland that’s owned by foreigners, Chinese entities have a stake in less than 1% of that,” says Dr. David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University and one of the study’s authors. “We are targeting interests from specific countries that can lead to rises in xenophobia and discrimination.”

(Image courtesy of the Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection, Colorado State Library)At the Denver Theater, the Ladies’ Relief Society passed out New Year’s gifts to poor children. There were well-attended “hops” at Guard Hall and the Inter-Ocean Hotel. At midnight, as bells rang out in celebration of the nation’s Centennial, the men of the J.E. Bates Fire and Hose Company rang theirs so hard it cracked.
 

This story is part of Colorado at 150, featuring special reports on the people and history that define the state.

	But the place to be in Denver on New Year’s Eve 1875, according to William Byers’ Rocky Mountain News, was at the music hall recently opened by the city’s Maennerchor, or “men’s chorus,” a singing social club formed by members of its large German-American population.
“The Maennerchor ball was the big thing of last night, at their new hall,” reported the daily News of Jan. 1, 1876.  “Everybody and his wife or sweetheart was there. They remained long after the bells rang in the Centennial morn.”
Not quite everybody: 40 people began the New Year as inmates in the Arapahoe County jail, the News reported, and by the end of 1875 there were some 4,000 children enrolled in Denver’s public and private schools.
They were among a city population that had reportedly quadrupled in the previous five years to an estimated 20,000, and Denver’s numbers had swelled further in recent days and weeks. Members of the territorial legislature, along with delegates to its constitutional convention, were arriving from cities, towns and mining camps across the soon-to-be state. Colorado’s boosters claimed the territory’s population had reached 150,000 by 1875, though credible sources considered that an “extravagant” estimate.
“From daylight in the morning until midnight, little caucuses of from two to six gather at the hotels, restaurants, beer halls, street corners and other nooks and corners, to lay their plans for the coming events,” a correspondent from Denver wrote to the Pueblo Chieftain.

City, county and territorial offices were all closed on Jan. 1. Both the News and the Chieftain, which cited “one of the few holidays allowed newspaper men and printers,” told readers no paper would be issued on Jan. 2. The day off was an important social occasion for Denver’s burgeoning elite, and the News carried a “list of the ladies who are to receive New Year’s calls,” including the family of its publisher: “Mrs. Byers and her daughter, Mamie, assisted by Mrs. Judge Wells, the Misses Parcells and Miss Alice Hill, will receive from 12 (p.)m., at residence on Capitol Hill.”
Despite sub-zero temperatures, a revelrous atmosphere had descended on Denver as 1876 began — “the foundations of many Centennial headaches were liberally laid,” the News reported — and showed no signs of letting up for the holiday.
“It is believed that some few gentlemen, contrary to custom, will keep sober, but this announcement cannot be made authoritatively,” quipped the News.
Denver’s 50-odd saloonkeepers had recently colluded to fix the price of beer at 10 cents a glass. To make their way from one watering hole to the next, Denverites could pay a fare of a nickel to ride the City Railway, a horse-drawn streetcar with tracks that ran on Broadway, Champa and 23rd Streets.
Alongside the saloons, a city directory published in early 1876 contained listings for 22 hotels, four billiard halls, 54 grocers, three gun shops, three music shops, nine banks and nine newspapers, including William Witteborg’s German-language Colorado Journal. Two businesses that would last well into the 20th century, Joslin’s and Daniels & Fisher, were among the city’s five purveyors of dry goods. J.H. Vandeventer and T.H. Sanborn ran competing laundries downtown, while one Gustav Steup, at 114 15th Street, advertised his services as the city’s lone mustard maker.
In Pueblo — the Colorado Territory’s second city, with about 6,000 inhabitants — the main New Year’s entertainment was a day of horse racing at the fairgrounds. In the day’s final race, O.S. Sheldon’s Bay Billy beat John Davis’ Buckskin Joe to claim the $50 prize, but the real action was in the crowd, where “pool selling was lively and considerable money changed hands.”
Around the territory
Outside of Denver and Pueblo, Colorado’s next-largest population center was located in the gold-mining districts of Gilpin and Clear Creek counties, where for 15 years fortune seekers had flocked to stake claims or ply their wares in towns like Central City, Black Hawk, Idaho Springs and Georgetown. Since 1873 the region had been served by the Colorado Central Railroad, which allowed passengers to travel between Denver and its Floyd Hill terminus in two hours and 45 minutes.
Passengers could also step onto a train in Denver and step off into many of the small settlements — Boulder and Greeley to the north, Castle Rock and Colorado Springs to the south — that would grow into today’s Front Range urban corridor.
But in 1876, most of the rest of Colorado was still a long way from looking like it does today. Even in the San Luis Valley — the first part of the territory to have been settled by non-native people, Hispanos from New Mexico who arrived there in the 1840s — the town of Alamosa wouldn’t be founded for another two years. The Eastern Plains, where the Army and territorial militias had waged a bloody campaign against the Cheyenne and Arapaho that ended with 1864’s Sand Creek Massacre, were still largely deserted.

Most notably, under the terms of an 1868 treaty, nearly half of the territory west of the Continental Divide was still reserved for the Ute people, though they had recently been pressured into ceding a large portion of the mineral-rich San Juan Mountains, where a silver rush was underway. Grand Junction, Durango, Aspen, Gunnison and Glenwood Springs were among the many Colorado communities that didn’t yet exist.
The territory’s westernmost settlement in today’s Interstate 70 corridor was the tiny hamlet of Breckenridge, home to about 250 people. It had no newspaper, and bad weather and delinquent postal contractors could cause weeks-long delays in the mail arriving over snowy mountain wagon roads. Though it was a long way from Denver and its bustling nightlife, a Breckenridge resident wrote to Georgetown’s Colorado Miner to report its happy holiday mood.
“Quite a lot of jolly folks are in town this winter, and ladies enough to have a dance almost any time,” wrote the correspondent. “We have, once or twice each week, some nice music and singing at Mr. Ballou’s, and on Sunday evening church services. Our winter will pass without noticing it.”
Road to statehood
The 11th and final session of the Territorial Assembly — consisting of a 13-seat upper chamber called the Council, and a 26-seat House of Representatives — convened in Denver on Jan. 3. John Long Routt, the former Union infantry captain appointed governor the previous year by President Ulysses S. Grant, addressed the Legislature in a written message two days later.
“The progress Colorado has made during the past 15 years has excited the attention of the civilized world,” Routt wrote. “Let the efforts of all be generally directed to the furtherance of Colorado’s admission into the Union, when through the intelligence, energy and wealth of her people, she may be among the first of the states, as she has been first of the territories.”
After more than a decade of trying, territorial leaders entered 1876 confident that Colorado would soon enter the Union as the 38th state. An enabling act passed by Congress and signed into law by Grant in March 1875 had begun the process, instructing the territory to convene delegates to draft a state constitution and hold a popular vote ratifying the document by July of the following year.
As the enabling bill had made its way through Congress, and the timeline for Colorado’s long-awaited statehood came into view, an obvious nickname presented itself. Though Byers and the News would claim to have been the first to suggest it, it was in fact the rival Denver Times that first printed the words on Feb. 27, 1875.
“The delay in admission will prove no serious drawback to Colorado,” wrote the Times. “Colorado will be admitted upon the centennary of American independence, and will in the future be known as the ‘Centennial State.’”

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)For many people in eastern Pennsylvania, wintertime’s dropping temperatures signal more than just the approaching holidays. It’s also the time to break out Four Queens whiskey, oranges, honey and personalized spice blends to cook some boilo, a fragrant and alcoholic hot beverage with Eastern European roots. 
The heavily spiced and honeyed hot drink is thought to have its roots in krupnik, a liqueur from Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. But while the tradition of boilo is concentrated in the anthracite coal mining region of Pennsylvania, some have found recipes in other states, including Kentucky and West Virginia. 
Diana Prosymchak, the executive director of the Schuylkill County Historical Society, said boilo is a staple at her family celebrations, alongside kielbasa and pierogies. Her daughter now continues the family tradition.

A 2019 article from the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Laird & Company, the New Jersey business that distributes Four Queens, sold just 36,000 bottles of the whiskey annually. But 98% of those sales were in Pennsylvania, specifically in Schuylkill, Luzerne, Berks, Dauphin and Lehigh counties.

“We basically grew up on it. We never had it any other time except around the holidays,” said Prosymchak. “The house smells so wonderful when you’re cooking it.”
A sample recipe posted on Salon includes rye whiskey, whole black peppercorns, orange juice, oranges, caraway seeks, honey and grain alcohol — but most efforts are closely guarded family secrets with hundreds of variations. 
That’s one thing that makes the drink so appealing to Silas Chamberlin, who used to live in Pennsylvania’s coal country.
“The cool thing about boilo, in my opinion — and I think one of the reasons why it took me a while to make my own — is that the real recipe doesn’t exist,” said Chamberlin. 
Ann Dee has made the production of boilo a business, hosting popular classes, preserving recipes and curating spice mixes on one premise. To her, there’s no wrong way to boilo.
“There is no one way to make it. There’s no one recipe we could give you and say, ‘This is boilo,’” said Dee.
Purists will insist any spirit other than Four Queens Whiskey is unacceptable, but some versions call for vodka or moonshine. Each variation is highly individualized, down to the method used to cut the fruit.
Dee said, “There’s infinite ways to vary these recipes.”
 A taste of the holidays

Dee jokes that she was “fairy godmother-ed” into boilo, after moving to Schuylkill County at the age of 21 in 2002. Despite her curiosity, locals refused to share their recipes — until a bar patron where she worked took pity and shared the broad strokes, leaving her to figure out the details. 
The first batch turned out “awful,” Dee said, but she worked at it until, “I finally got it right.” 
Over time, she collected recipes that were starting to “die out” and preserved their unique ingredients, eventually creating a spice blend that could be purchased and used by others. Her business, Coal Country Boilo, started as a fundraiser for her community library and now shares tips for other aspiring crafters. 










There is no one way to make it. There’s no one recipe we could give you and say, ‘This is boilo.'


– Ann Dee, who hosts popular classes and has been preserving recipes. 


Prosymchak doesn’t have a specific family recipe, but does remember being prescribed the drink to cure any wintertime illness. 
“Reading the ingredients, you actually believe it is medicinal,” she said. “It was a cure-all for everything.”
Chamberlin said he made big batches to share after finding a recipe a few years ago — despite living in York County, which is outside the traditional boilo zone. 
“I’ve made it ever since,” he said. “Both to have with my family around the holidays, but also to bottle it and share with coworkers and friends.” 
For first-timers, Dee emphasized the need for patience. 
“Just let those ingredients simmer… the only thing you don’t want to let boil for too long is your citrus fruit, because it will go bitter. You want to get those rinds out of there in probably about 10-15 minutes,” said Dee. 
“There’s a lot of reasons why I feel like people should make it: it’s a lot of fun and your house smells great.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8129-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 06:12:16.006989

The country will celebrate its semiquincentennial on July 4, 2026, marking 250 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Less than a month later, Colorado, which entered the union as the Centennial State on Aug. 1, 1876, will commemorate 150 years of statehood with its sesquicentennial celebration.




Colorado Newsline is commemorating the sesquicentennial with Colorado at 150, a yearlong project reporting on the people and events that shaped our state’s history.
Click here to read the first entry in “Timeline 1876,” a special series chronicling the road to statehood and the daily lives of the territory’s residents 150 years ago.			


Colorado has been planning for the year’s festivities since 2022, when a bill passed by the Legislature established the America 250-Colorado 150 commission, a 15-member volunteer board assisted by staff at History Colorado, the state’s public historical society.
The commission has approved 12 “signature initiatives” for Colorado’s sesquicentennial year, including a documentary film series, a new historic marker program, a “digital passport” program to encourage travel and tourism around the state, and “A Portrait of Colorado at 150,” which will curate oral histories from at least 150 living Coloradans.

Another signature initiative, Colorado Heritage for All, aims to add 150 additional sites to the state Register of Historic Places by the end of 2026, with an emphasis on the historical experiences of communities of color, women and LGBTQ+ Coloradans, which previously only made up 4% of the state’s preserved buildings and sites. History Colorado says it’s already hit the halfway point in that goal, having added 75 new sites to the register as of October 2025.
At least one major sesquicentennial effort didn’t come to fruition: the Colorado 150 Pedestrian Walkway, a proposal initially backed by Gov. Jared Polis to build a pedestrian bridge across Lincoln Ave. near the state Capitol. Polis abandoned the idea after mounting public criticism and the completion of a survey in which respondents overwhelmingly opposed the $29 million project.
Events planned throughout the year
For 149 years, Coloradans have celebrated Colorado Day on Aug. 1, commemorating President Ulysses S. Grant’s statehood proclamation admitting Colorado to the union on that date in 1876.
Events currently planned for Aug. 1 include the Mile High 150 Expo at the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, and the Colorado 150 Celebration at Highlands Ranch Town Center.
A museum exhibit, “38th Star: Colorado Becomes the Centennial State,” is currently on display at the History Colorado Center in Denver and scheduled to run through Sept. 6, 2026.
The Colorado Department of Agriculture has partnered with artist Thomas Evans, also known as Detour, to create a mural at the National Western Stock Show highlighting the state’s agricultural roots. The mural’s official unveiling will take place on Jan. 10.
The U.S. Postal Service will recognize 150 years of Colorado statehood with a special forever stamp featuring a landscape by renowned Colorado nature photographer John Fielder. Officials will dedicate the stamp in a Jan. 24 event at the History Colorado Center.
Local and regional institutions across Colorado plan to hold events of their own, including the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum’s “We The People: Colorado at 150” lecture series. A local organizing committee for southwest Colorado is also planning its own program of events.
A list of events across the state can be found on the America 250-Colorado 150 website.

Janet Mills signed a law in June 2025 after several years of legislative efforts. (Photo by Hill Street Studios/ Getty Images)With the new year comes a new base wage for Maine workers, which now after several years of effort includes those who pick and grow food on farms across the state. As of Thursday, Maine’s minimum wage is increasing to $15.10. 
Throughout last year, the state’s minimum wage was $14.65 an hour, but the Maine Department of Labor announced in September the 45 cent increase that will take effect Jan. 1, 2026. The “tip wage,” or the minimum wage for service employees, will increase to $7.55 per hour. 
This is a slightly smaller jump than the 50 cent increase the state saw between 2024 and 2025. 
Per Maine law and a 2016 citizens referendum, the state is required to make an annual adjustment based on the cost-of-living index for the Northeast Region. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, there was a 3.1% increase in the cost-of-living index between August 2024 and August 2025. 
For the first time, the state’s minimum wage will pertain to agricultural workers since Gov. Janet Mills signed a law in June that now guarantees them the right.
An estimated 35,000 workers in Maine were paid hourly and received less than $15 an hour in 2024, according to the Current Population Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The cities of Portland and Rockland have their own minimum wages, which are typically higher than the state’s. Both cities usually update their minimum wage based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, so their rate for 2025 was $15.50.
However, Portland voters approved a question on the November ballot to incrementally raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 an hour over the next three years. The rate jumps to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027, and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage will keep pace with cost of living increases.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-482149439-2048x1365-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-01 05:56:18.624847

(Photo courtesy Sugar Bowl)

NEW ORLEANS — If 76-year-old Archie Manning was listed on the College Football Playoffs injury report for the Sugar Bowl it would say: Ole Miss quarterback Manning (lower back) extremely doubtful.
“My back has just been giving me fits lately. I can hardly get around,” Manning said Tuesday from the St. Charles Avenue condo where he and wife Olivia live. “I could get on the elevator to a suite in the Superdome. It’s just getting to the elevator that’s the problem. But I’ll be watching. You better believe I’ll be watching.”
Rick Cleveland 
Fifty-six years ago, on New Year’s Day, 1970, Manning, then 20, was most definitely ready to go. Legendary Clarion Ledger sports columnist Carl Walters described it this way in the next day’s paper: “The Ole Miss Rebels became the winningest team in Sugar Bowl history this bright but cold New Year’s Day, holding off the battling, third-ranked Arkansas Razorbacks for a 27-22 victory in a thrilling contest that will be ranked with the best ever played in post-season competition.”
Manning passed for 273 yards and a touchdown, ran for another touchdown and totaled 318 yards of total offense to win the Miller-Digby Trophy as the game’s Most Valuable Player. As was the case every time Manning took the field, the numbers don’t tell the entire story. It was the competitive flair with which he played – the zigging and zagging all over the field – that stole the Sugar Bowl show.
Says Skipper Jernigan, an outstanding Ole Miss guard back then and Manning’s long-time pal, “I just remember chasing his red-headed ass all over Tulane Stadium trying to block for him. Every time I’d go to block somebody, Archie would turn and go the other direction. He was all over the place and none of the rest of us were fast enough to keep up with him.”
And this will tell you something about Ole Miss’s rich Sugar Bowl history: Manning is one of six Rebel quarterbacks to have won the Sugar Bowl’s MVP trophy. Count them, six: Raymond Brown (1958), Bobby Ray Franklin (1960), Jake Gibbs (1961), Glynn Griffing (1963), Manning (1970) and Chad Kelly (2016).

“Seemed like when I was growing up, Coach Vaught had Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl about every other year,” Manning said. “We had a great Sugar Bowl experience. I’ll never forget it. We lost three games that season, but at the end of the year we were playing as well or better than anybody in the country.”
Jernigan put it another way: “When No. 18 was clicking, we were hard to handle.”
Tulane Stadium, packed with more than 80,000 fans, was what Manning remembers most.
“God, I loved that place,” Manning said. “It still had real grass back then, and there were hedges around the field. And, man, so many people were there. I had never seen that many people in one place before. I’ll tell you this much, I enjoyed playing in Tulane Stadium that day a whole lot more than I did my first four years with the Saints.”
Arkansas and Ole Miss chewed up the field so badly the field was still a mess 10 days later when the Kansas City Chiefs trounced the Minnesota Vikings 23-7 in Super Bowl IV. In fact, the NFL required the Saints to install artificial turf before the league would award the city another Super Bowl. The sad truth is that rock-hard Astroturf at Tulane Stadium and later in the Superdome might have something to do with Manning’s back issues today.
That Ole Miss made the Sugar Bowl that year was a story in itself. The Rebels suffered one-point losses early in the season to Kentucky and Alabama and was solidly defeated by Houston in the Astrodome at mid-season.
Then came November and upset victories over No. 8 LSU (26-23) and No. 3 Tennessee (38-0).
“Coach Vaught told us before the Tennessee game that if we somehow beat them, he guaranteed us he would get us in the Sugar Bowl,” Manning said. “And he did.”
But first, Ole Miss had to beat Mississippi State, no easy task at the time. “State had Tommy Pharr throwing and Sammy Milner and David Smith catching,” Manning said. “We had tied them in Oxford the year before and we had to play ‘em in Starkville that year and, man, they could really throw the football and put up some points.”
Ole Miss, with Manning leading the way, prevailed 48-22, and true to his word, Vaught lobbied the Rebels into the Sugar Bowl. There, they were to face the loser of the Dec. 6, Arkansas-Texas “Game of the Century,” a game so big even President Richard Nixon attended and declared the Dec. 6 game was for the national championship.
“We all thought Arkansas was the better team,” Manning said. “So did Coach Vaught. Arkansas had beaten Georgia in the Sugar Bowl the year before. We thought we would be playing Texas, not Arkansas”
Instead, Texas rallied from a 14-0 fourth quarter deficit to beat the Razorbacks 15-14.
“We really thought we were playing the best team in the country in Arkansas, but we knew we could play with them,” Manning said.
Fullback Bo Bowen got the Rebels off to a fantastic start, busting through a wide hole cleared by Jernigan and Worthy McClure for a 69-yard touchdown run. 
“Bo was just a great back,” Manning said. “He was really a tailback playing out of position at fullback but he really hit his stride the last half of that season.”
After that, Manning pretty much took control of the game, running and throwing the Rebels to a 24-6 first half lead. The Rebels got a lot more conservative offensively in the second half but hung on to win.
Fifty-six years later, Manning has vivid memories and not just of Tulane Stadium and the team headquarters, the old Fountainbleu Hotel, both long since gone. Among them:

Of a Sugar Bowl party the week of the game, during which a magician called up Rebel wide receiver Vernon Studdard to the stage to be part of his act. The joke was on the magician, because when Studdard returned to his seat, he had the magician’s watch.
Of how good that Arkansas team was. “They were coached by Frank Broyles, a Hall of Famer who was Coach Vaught’s good friend,” Manning said. “They had a great wide receiver Chuck Dicus, who had been the Sugar Bowl MVP the year before, and a great quarterback Bill Montgomery. Both those guys became great friends. So did Coach Broyles, who never did beat Coach Vaught. I ran into Broyles years and years later at Augusta National and he was still talking about Bo Bowen’s run.”
Of Arkansas All American middle linebacker Cliff Powell. “Man, that guy would ever more hit you,” Manning said.

Years and years later, Archie and Olivia Manning decided to watch a replay of that 1970 Sugar Bowl with ABC legends Chris Shenkel and Bud Wilkinson doing the call.
“About midway through the second half, Olivia said it looked like my good friend Jim Poole (a fantastic Rebel tight end) had his jersey on backwards,” Manning said. “Sure enough, I looked closely and the big numbers were on the front of Jim’s jersey. The little numbers, which were supposed to be on the front, were on the back.”
Turns out, Poole had suffered a first half neck injury, and Ole Miss trainer Doc Knight had taken his jersey and shoulder pads off to massage the neck at halftime. When they put Poole’s jersey back on, it was on backwards.
Turns out, Poole played that second half with fractured vertebrae in his neck. Back then, you just took a few aspirin and went back in – until they carried you off. So what will they be saying about this New Year’s Day Sugar Bowl in 56 years? That will be 2082.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/23132322/AP24101555365387.jpg,,,2026-01-01 05:56:18.624847

Not so fast, state environmental officials are reminding Rhode Islanders, as even after trees stop sparkling, they can still contribute something to the world. 
The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Rhode Island chapter of Trout Unlimited will hold their annual “Trees for Trout” collection on Saturday, Jan. 10, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Arcadia Check Station. 
The check station is located in the Wood River Arcadia Management Area at 2224 Ten Rod Road in Exeter. 
Since 2018, DEM and Trout Unlimited, a national nonprofit that works to conserve rivers to nurture fish populations, have collected Christmas trees to build conifer revetments in the state’s freshwater habitats. The revetments act like retaining walls and are used to build up the eroding banks of rivers, which can make rivers too wide and shallow to serve as suitable breeding and living grounds for fish, especially wild brook trout, or Salvelinus fontinalis.  
A 2021 article by DEM noted numerous poor land use practices that lead to these suboptimal waters: “Dams create barriers and discharge warm water to the otherwise cold stream below. Cattle trample stream banks causing instability, sedimentation and high nutrient run off. Clearcutting removes trees and brush which otherwise filter water before reaching a stream. And the list goes on.”
Building up the river banks with revetments helps to mimic the natural shape and habitat of rivers. The revetments are fashioned by bundling together several dozen conifer trees with stakes and biodegradable twine. The bundled trees are then attached along riverbanks and extend into the channel, where the trees help to stem the flow of water, trapping sediment, sands, and other organic matter over time. As the dead trees build their detritus collections, they form new chunks of riverbank.  
Conifers are evergreen trees that bear cones, and this group of trees includes most of the popular Christmas tree choices like firs, pines and spruces. The trees’ densely needled, many-branched bodies provide the perfect surface to fortify riverbanks against erosion.    
“Conifer revetments help to narrow the river channel and confine the flow so that during low flows, there is deeper water, thereby creating more habitat for fish,” the DEM article noted. 
Trees eligible for use in the trout project need to follow a few rules from DEM to be donated:

Only real trees can be used. Artificial or fire-retardant trees are not allowed.
All ornaments, decorations, stands and lights need to be removed.
Whole conifer trees are needed, so trimmings or clippings can’t be donated. 
Trees over 5 feet tall are preferable.

People who want to drop off five or more trees will need to email Rhode Island Trout Unlimited in advance of the Jan. 10 event.  
Other options and guidance for Christmas tree disposal can be looked up online via the website of the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation, the quasi-public agency which runs the state’s Johnston landfill.
State environmental officials also reminded residents that they shouldn’t dump Christmas trees in waterways or on beaches, as it’s illegal without permits.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderMost legislative races are pretty anti-climatic by the time general election voters cast a ballot in the fall, and that is by design.
The state Legislature has power to determine the boundaries of its own districts, and they tend to do it in a way that protects the party in power. That leads to a lot of races where only the incumbent runs or a long-shot candidate from the other party steps up and gets a small slice of the total vote.
But when a state gets closer to 50-50, like Georgia is getting, districts that were mostly safe become less safe.
That’s what happened around the turn of the century in Georgia, when Democrats ruled the roost and Republicans were hot on their heels.
Today, Democrats – bolstered by a surprise seat flip in a northeast Georgia special election and victories in the statewide Public Service Commission race before that – think the political winds are at their back and they’ve got a shot at making big gains in the state House this year.
“There’s nothing like an election to tell us what voters think,” said Georgia Democratic Party Chair Charlie Bailey. “That’s what matters, not what I think, but what voters think.”
Bailey said Democrats are gearing up for a tough fight.
“(Republicans) are not going to sit around and spend no money,” he said. “They’re going to spend money to keep people in power that reward billionaires and big corporations. They will spend a lot of money to do that, as they have, and so it is on us to raise the resources we need and deploy them in an effective way, like we did with the PSC, like we did with House District 121, and win as many seats as we can.”
Carmen Bergman, director of the House Republican Caucus, predicted that Democrats’ effort will fall flat.
“The Georgia House Republican Caucus has a full-time political operation so that we can recruit candidates, we can train candidates, we can prepare candidates for 2026 in addition to our existing members,” she said.
Currently, the House includes 98 Republicans and 81 Democrats, including two who were recently elected and have yet to be sworn in. There is one vacancy representing a Cherokee County district that is set to be filled by a special election before the legislative session begins Jan. 12.
Bailey said there are 17 GOP-controlled House districts that are more left-leaning than the Athens-area seat that flipped in December.
“Are we going to spend significant money in all 17 of those? I don’t know. We’ll see. It depends on what the environment is like,” he said.
Bailey said there’s no guarantee that the environment will be as favorable for Democrats this year, but he’s optimistic based on the results of last year’s races.
“What it shows is that voters are quite dissatisfied and fed up with the Republican betrayal of working people, and we’re going to carry that message across all of our races across this entire state, and we’re going to net a lot of wins,” he said.
Here are some of the state House races to watch as the 2026 campaigns heat up. 
Gwinnett grudge match
Buford Republican state Rep. Sandy Donatucci won her seat in 2024 by just 80 votes out of more than 30,000, defeating incumbent Democrat Farooq Mughal. Donatucci serves on the House education, transportation, and intragovernmental coordination committees.
Mughal thinks 2026 is the year he’ll make a comeback in the Gwinnett County district. He launched a campaign over the summer with an emphasis on economic issues.
Reeves rematch
Democrats think they have a fighting chance in another Gwinnett-based district that Duluth Republican Rep. Matt Reeves now represents.
Reeves, who is vice chair of the House judiciary committee and also sits on the appropriations and insurance committees, narrowly fought off Democratic challenger Michelle Kang in 2024 by around 600 votes or just about 2% of the vote.
Kang announced her comeback bid in July with a pledge to focus on kitchen table issues.
Democrat Shelly Abraham of Suwanee, who works in the architectural and engineering industry, has also filed paperwork to run against Reeves in 2026.
Silcox in the sights
Sandy Springs Republican Rep. Deborah Silcox was first elected to District 52 in 2016 but lost in 2020 to Democratic state Rep. Shea Roberts. Two years later, after Georgia redrew its legislative boundaries, Silcox went on to win in District 53, which had been drawn to favor a Republican.
But Democrats are hoping a swing in their direction will help send Silcox packing for a second time. In 2024, Silcox defeated Democrat Susie Greenberg by 1,351 votes, or just under 4%.
Democrat Beth Fuller, a former contractor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, has announced that she is seeking election in the district.
Cleveland takes on Hilton 
As a Republican in a district Joe Biden won in 2020, Peachtree Corners Rep. Scott Hilton was seen as at risk following that year’s election, but he won convincingly in 2022 and 2024, soundly defeating Democratic opponents both times.
Democrats are hoping that with Trump now in the White House, they can push the pendulum the other way in the Gwinnett and north Fulton-based district. Former Democratic state Rep. Mary Robichaux, who lost to Hilton in 2022, was recently elected mayor of North Fulton’s city of Roswell, defeating incumbent Kurt Wilson, who had the backing of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.
Attorney Adam Cleveland, a Democrat from Johns Creek, has filed paperwork to challenge Hilton in 2026.
Potential Republican Flips
The party in the White House usually faces some heat in a midterm, and Democrats are hoping that pattern holds.
But Bergman said Georgia Democrats should not read too much into Democratic wins in other parts of the country last year.
“A special election environment is just that: It is special, strange, and odd things can happen that typically wouldn’t happen in a midterm or a general election environment,” she said.
“When you look at polling, we know Georgians think the nation is on the wrong track,” she added. “We clearly think that as a country, we are moving in the wrong direction, but that Georgia is on the right track, and that’s because of conservative Republican leadership. Frankly, the Georgia Republican brand is different than the national Republican brand, and the onus is on us to make sure that voters know that.”
One of the districts that may be most ripe for Republicans to test that theory is that of Sandersville Democratic Rep. Mack Jackson in central Georgia.
Jackson in Jeopardy?
In 2024, Jackson squeaked out a victory by 128 votes, or just .18% over Republican Tracy Wheeler. Jackson, a pastor and retired probation officer, was first elected in 2008.
Republican Thomas Wilkerson of Warrenton has filed paperwork to run against Jackson, and Sandersville Republican Trey Sheppard, a co-president of a transportation and logistics company, has also announced plans to run.
Other Democratic lawmakers who won by narrow margins in 2024 include Macon state Rep. Tangie Herring, who won by about 1% against Republican Noah Harbuck, and Butler state Rep. Patty Stinson, who beat Republican Cary Moore by about 6.5%.
As of mid-December, no opponent has filed paperwork to run in either of those districts. The official qualifying process to run in 2026 is scheduled for the first week of March.
“We are going to be playing in all of those seats and more with quality candidates who are well prepared to be able to take on that race (in 2026),” Bergman said.

David Stevenson stood in a circle of friends and colleagues in an Orlando, Florida, hotel lobby. Everyone but him wore a lapel pin that read ​“I  Fossil Fuels.”
“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”
Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.
But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in U.S. waters.
The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​“The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.
Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”
And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.
The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.
Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes” — not wind development — were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.
At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power — the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance — appeared to be on the downswing, with many U.S. facilities having recently shuttered.
We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.
I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.
The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the U.S. seems impossible.
The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.
Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.
A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.
“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved. … I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.
Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own — namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.
“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction … and tactics that delay action.”


 The path to wind opposition



Stevenson, now 75, describes himself as ​“a lifelong conservationist.”
In the driveway of his Lewes, Delaware, home sits the hybrid vehicle he often drives to a nearby beach. Solar panels glint atop the roof, which Stevenson custom-designed in 2013 to be at the ​“optimum angle” to soak up the sun. A framed newspaper article about one of his cross-country bike rides hangs on the wall of his home office, nestled alongside photos of his seven children and 19 grandchildren.
His career has intersected with clean energy — and even wind — at various points.
While working for DuPont in the 1980s, Stevenson helped the chemical giant develop the long-lasting coatings used to make first-generation solar panels and wind turbine blades. In 1999, after leaving the company, he started his own construction business and acquired certifications in energy efficiency and home weatherization. He said he eventually co-founded the Delaware Green Building Council to promote this kind of work.
But despite Stevenson’s environmentally minded career and interests, he’s built a reputation as someone dedicated to preventing, rather than enabling, renewable energy.











After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”
According to the D.C.-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.
For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.
It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.
Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm — a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware — were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”
The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.
“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”
At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration — first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.
Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.
He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.
The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”
Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.
Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”
In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone — ​“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.
He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.
Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them — as the Brown University researchers put it — was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.
His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.
There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the east coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.
Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.


 Whales and wind



In January 2023, right-wing media took an interest in whales. There had been a slew of marine mammal deaths along the east coast of the U.S. in prior weeks — and conservative media put the blame on seismic surveys for the future offshore wind developments ramping up along the New Jersey coast. Fox News host Jesse Watters interviewed a leader of Protect Our Coasts NJ, a founding coalition member that Stevenson had helped become a nonprofit.
This wasn’t the first time the media had amplified baseless speculation about wind power killing whales. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, had run a similar story in 2017. But in early 2023, the claims were getting attention from Fox, local news, and even the Associated Press.
Stevenson was in near disbelief when he heard Tucker Carlson, then a commentator on Fox News, mention offshore wind and whales in multiple segments.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.
I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”
But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted that the campaign prompted a U.S. General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)
Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms.
Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”
The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the U.S. — during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities — and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.
Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.
As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”
In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”
In this ongoing phenomena, 40% of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.
I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”


 Projects halted



Trump wasted no time coming after offshore wind when he took office in January 2025. On day one, he issued an anti-wind executive order that paused all permitting activity and derided the installations as ​“big” and ​“ugly” to an indoor stadium full of supporters.
For Stevenson and a dozen others in his influential cohort, the executive order was a good step — but it wasn’t enough to simply block new projects from advancing. In February, they petitioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue stop-work orders to the installations already being built, alleging that the projects posed a risk to whales. This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.
And it wasn’t long before the Trump administration tried to give the Stevenson-led coalition what it wanted. All five of the offshore wind projects under construction in America either have been delayed by recent stop-work orders or are reportedly under threat of receiving one.
Some in the coalition opposed such moves, recognizing that stopping projects already underway would raise energy costs. Steve Haner, a senior fellow at the Virginia-based conservative think tank Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, refused to endorse Stevenson’s petition to pause the five projects under construction — objecting especially to halting America’s largest project, a 2.5-gigawatt wind farm being built off the Virginia coast.
Under a hypothetical cancellation, according to Haner, ​“the ratepayers are on the hook” for the billions in sunk costs.

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction — but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings” — an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf” — which helped secure a reversal from Trump.
Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.
At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.
Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built in America for the next decade — save for the five already under construction.
Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term.
“They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.
It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.
Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives — ones that go beyond whales — for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the U.S. vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)
Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”
The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change — and what to do about it — evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”
“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’ … A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”
These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”
Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​“Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment.” The book came out in early fall — just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life with a decade-long delay of U.S. offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.


 Anti-wind legacy



Nowadays, Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.
“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”
All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas — which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal — was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.
Republican moderates in Washington have expressed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, utility bills, which Stevenson called his ​“primary motivation” for his anti-wind work, have skyrocketed in the Northeast and are projected to only climb higher if Trump’s policies continue to strangle the offshore wind sector.
Stevenson has increasingly drifted from the direction that other coalition members are taking. Protect Our Coast NJ — which first fanned the flames of misleading claims about whales — has embarked on a different disinformation campaign: spreading the false idea that offshore wind cables cause cancer. Embracing outlandish claims — whether it’s whale-killing ​“windmills” or cancer-causing cables — is a broader trend among Republicans who buy into conspiracy theories with their party’s rise to power.









Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32% jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.
“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy. … You don’t want 100% believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Madison–Wisconsin who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the U.S. is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.
Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seemed relieved to be doing so.
On our most recent call, in late November, Stevenson told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)
He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” Stevenson told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry — and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.
Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed offshore wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.
Stevenson also told me on the phone that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. Exxon Mobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.
I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.
I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view — that readers might see it that way.
“I don’t care if people hate me or not,” he said. ​“I’m doing what I think is right.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/newstevensonarmchair-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-01 05:11:57.674949

(Photo by Shannon Finney/Getty Images for MGM National Harbor)Since legalized sports betting started in Ohio in 2023, bad consequences are piling up. Two pitchers for the Cleveland Guardians are accused of throwing wild pitches to rig bets. And the number of Ohioans seeking help for problem gambling is way up.
Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed the law allowing sports betting, now says he regrets doing so. 
A new study by two Rice University researchers might give DeWine another reason for regret. It found that legal sports betting is associated with big increases in crime — especially assaults after home games that result in upsets.
In those cases, assaults nearly doubled — rising 93% — from the start of games to four hours after conclusion when compared to the period before sports betting was legalized. The peer-reviewed study by Hua Gong and Wenche Wang was published in the Journal of Sports Economics on Nov. 13.
“Sports gambling is exciting for fans and financially attractive for states, but our findings show it can also lead to more crime,” Gong said in a Rice University press release. “When people lose their bets or go through very stressful game moments, that emotional volatility can translate into aggressive behavior.”
The researchers used a “difference-in-differences” strategy to determine whether legalized sports betting can be linked to assaults, larceny and vehicle thefts. That means it compared periods before and after legalization using crime data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System.
The study looked at markets with NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL teams in 12 states that had legalized sports betting after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way in 2018. The last of the studied states did so in 2021. So Ohio wasn’t included because it wouldn’t legalize sports betting for another two years.
“We find a significant increase in crime between the start of a game and four hours postgame following the introduction of sports betting,” the study said. “This impact is particularly notable when the local team plays at home, and it intensifies if the outcome of the game differs from what the betting odds had predicted.”
When a game turns out differently than the odds predicted, that means losers outnumber winners, and some of those losers are bound to be upset.
Overall, the researchers saw crime increase 30% to 70% between the start of games and four hours after they ended after states had legalized sports betting. 
They also found that the effects before covid were greater than the period after stadiums reopened. But part of that could be attributable to crowd limits and social-distancing measures that were still in place.
They also found that the increased crime and violence spilled over into nearby states that hadn’t legalized sports betting.
“What surprised us most was that the increase in crime isn’t limited to states that legalize sports gambling,” said Gong, an assistant professor of sport analytics at Rice University. “Even neighboring states that do not allow betting see more crime on game days, likely because people travel to place bets and then return home.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, who plans to step down on Jan. 5, speaks at a town hall in 2025. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWriting in the “Never Trump” outlet The Bulwark, columnist Jonathan V. Last says the transformation of Georgia’s own Marjorie Taylor Greene represents “the best hope for liberalism in America.” 
That’s probably not something you ever thought you would read.
By “liberalism,” Last makes clear, “we do not mean Democratic policy preferences. I do not expect MTG to change her views on the Second Amendment, climate change, abortion, the costs/benefits of immigration, the role of America in geopolitics, or any other issue.” 
While those issues are all important, they are disagreements that we can and should resolve through the democratic process, just as we have done for more than two centuries. By “liberalism,” Last means something more fundamental. He means a renewed commitment to that democratic process of dispute resolution, and with it a rejection of authoritarian government that defies our Constitution and national legacy.
Last is hardly alone in the national media in his embrace of Greene’s transformation as a deep-winter sign of a coming political spring. Writing in a lengthy profile in The New York Times, reporter Robert Draper tells us that Greene’s disenchantment has grown so deep that she no longer watches Fox News, “because she found it factually unreliable.” Draper proposes that in her newest incarnation, Greene “may yet again prove to be a harbinger of a sea change in the movement she once helped lead.”
Then there’s George Conway, the former high-level GOP attorney, former husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, and a man now running for Congress as a Democrat. 
“(Greene) is no angel, but this isn’t an act,” Conway writes in a social media post. “It isn’t some ploy for power.” As Conway sees it, “The heavy burden of cognitive dissonance and denial” required to remain a Trump supporter “finally became unbearable for her. And she’s done with it. To the point that she’s just letting it all out, consequences be damned. She’s liberated, and there’s no better feeling.”
Me, I’m still not buying any of it.  
Call me cynical – after a decade of watching Trump, I certainly qualify – but if Trump had agreed last spring to support Greene’s Senate candidacy against Jon Ossoff, she would still be Trump’s loyal follower today. She left the cult and resigned her House seat not out of some sudden road-to-Damascus conversion, and not because of some realization about Trump’s character, but because she understood that he would not be the pathway to her ambitions. It was a decision made largely out of self-interest.
On a human level, I can accept that’s not how Greene experiences it or explains it to others. Like all of us, she wants to think the best of herself, and if that means explaining her dramatic breach with Trump in terms of finally seeing the light, or coming back into line with her Christian beliefs, I’m OK with that. Good for her. 
However, that’s not how the phenomenon is going to play out in the future. I say that because by this point, most of those who might abandon Trump based on principle or patriotism have already done so, often at considerable professional and personal loss. 
Brad Raffensperger, for example, is never going to be governor of Georgia. Liz Cheney is never going to be speaker of the House. Mike Pence is never going to be president. They sacrificed those ambitions to preserve the republic as well as their own integrity, and we should always be grateful that they did so. I disagree with them on almost every political issue, but I also admire them. They are heroes, and what they did should not be confused with what Greene is doing.
If Trump’s support continues to erode, it will be because more and more people begin to understand what Greene understands, that it’s no longer in their own personal interest to stick with him. They will abandon him because they realize that Trump cannot give them what they want or need, because in many cases he never had any intention of doing so. 
That won’t be true of some people. Certainly, those who want cruelty to immigrants, white Christian nationalism and a government that squelches dissent will continue to be made happy by Trump. Those who have achieved positions of power through abject loyalty to Trump that they could never have earned by their own merit will continue to support him because they have no alternative. In poker terms, they are pot-committed.
But for others, it may be dawning on them that Trump is not going to lead a revolution against the elite. He is not going to defend the interests of the little guy against the billionaire class any more than he is going to release the Epstein files or defend Ukraine against Vladimir Putin, because he always sees the world through the eyes of the predator not the prey. 
And if Marjorie Greene can eventually see that, maybe others can as well.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC0162-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-01 05:11:57.674949

This story was originally published by CalMatters. 
A series of immigration raids across California in 2025 had one thing in common: Most of the federal agents detaining people wore masks over their faces.
This month, the state of California and its largest county will ban law enforcement officers from covering their faces, with a few exceptions, putting local and state police at odds with masked immigration agents.
The state law gives law enforcement officers a choice: If they cover their faces, they lose the ability to assert “qualified immunity,” the doctrine that protects officers from individual liability for their actions. That means they can be sued for assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest or malicious prosecution, and the law adds a clause that says the minimum penalty for committing those offenses while wearing a mask is $10,000.
Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat who co-authored the law, said it was necessary to rein in anonymous federal agents.
“We initially were under the understanding that, oh, they’re only targeting folks who were not citizens,” Gonzalez said, “And then actually over time you learn they don’t give a [crap] who you are, they’re attacking you no matter what, with no due process.”
The Trump administration has sued to block the bill, and more than a century of federal court precedent is on its side. An 1890 Supreme Court case provides that a state cannot prosecute a federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of their duties.
The Trump administration said in its brief to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that forcing agents to reveal their identities would put the agents at risk.
During Immigration and Customs Enforcement “actions, individuals can be heard threatening to doxx and find out who officers and their family members are and where they live,” the administration’s lawyers said in the Nov. 17 brief. “There are even public websites that seek and publish personal information about ICE and other federal officers to harass and threaten them and their families.”
ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said the issue may not be as cut-and-dried as one or two Supreme Court cases. He pointed to a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the case of a federal sniper who killed a woman during the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, standoff to go to trial.
“It basically says that a federal officer can be criminally prosecuted for unreasonable actions,” Chemerinsky said. “Federal officers, by virtue of being federal officers, do not get immunity from all state civil and criminal laws.”
Brian Marvel, president of an organization that represents California police unions, said the law will make life harder for local cops and county sheriffs’ deputies. The organizations that represent police chiefs, sheriffs, agents in the attorney general’s office and California Highway Patrol officers opposed the law, too.
“I think that the state has put us in a tenuous position with this battle they’re having with the Trump administration,” said Marvel of the Peace Officers Research Association of California. “We don’t want to be in the middle of this fight. But unfortunately, [with] the desire for higher name recognition and elections in 2026, they decided to create things that are much more political and not geared toward legitimate public safety issues.”
Marvel said another drawback of the law is giving “a false sense of hope to the immigrant community in California” that the law will force federal agents to leave the state.
Los Angeles County supervisors have also approved a local mask ban on law enforcement for unincorporated areas of the county, a measure that will go into effect in mid-January, unless a court decision comes sooner.
Gonzalez noted that masks have played a significant role in recent California history. First, California temporarily made masks mandatory in public and at work during the pandemic. Then, a couple of years later, a rush of smash-and-grab robberies were harder to solve because the suspects all wore masks. Now, California finds itself in its third back-and-forth over face coverings.
The law provides exemptions for N-95 or medical-grade masks to prevent infection transmission, and permits undercover operatives to wear a mask.
“This is specifically aimed to federal agents because we gotta combat these kidnappings somehow,” Gonzalez said, “and this was our way in.”

Who will be the next governor of Connecticut?

Connecticut’s election calendar brings certainty as to when voters will endorse, nominate and elect a governor in 2026. Nominating conventions are in May, primaries are Aug. 11 and Election Day is Nov. 3. The actual outcome?
Well, the gamblers who publicly forecast elections are liking the early chances of a threepeat for Gov. Ned Lamont. One, RacetotheWH.com, gives Lamont a 95.9% percent chance of retaining what pretty much everyone considers a safe Democratic seat and projects him winning by 18.6 percentage points.
Rep. Josh Elliot, D-Hamden, has shown little progress in his campaign to convince Democrats to deny a sitting governor the nomination to another term.
On the Republican side, former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart and state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich are doing their best to ignore each other and the prospect of a late entry by Betsy McCaughey, who was New York’s lieutenant governor in the last century and is teasing making her Connecticut electoral debut at age 77.

Will the economy enter recession?

The first half of last year came with worries about the economy — with post-pandemic fears about inflation, stagnant wages and affordability further complicated by uncertainty over changes to trade policy and waves of new tariffs. Many of those concerns remain, as a “K-shaped economy” — one where high-earners experience relative prosperity while lower-earners struggle — becomes a popular way for understanding the muddled national economic outlook.  
The ups and downs have stoked fears that the U.S. is entering a recession, defined as a period of widespread economic decline that usually lasts at least a few months. For some economists, several states — including Connecticut — could already be in one.
If the nation does reach the economic standard for a recession this year, Connecticut may be more prepared that some: The state has $4.3 billion in its rainy day fund and recent stress tests have shown the state has enough to survive a hypothetical downturn for several months. But the story of 2026 won’t just be the technicalities of the economy, but how people are experiencing it. And with state unemployment up slightly from the start of last year, the state’s labor force declining, and consumer costs on the rise, one thing to watch for is what further economic strain could mean for the everyday lives of Connecticut residents.

Will Connecticut keep its WNBA team?

Credit: Bryan Woolston / AP

After more than 20 years as Connecticut’s lone major league professional sports team, the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun face the possibility of moving out of state. News that the Mohegan Tribe, the team’s owners since 2003, were exploring a sale first popped up last spring. By August, a reported $325 million deal between the tribe and Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca emerged that would move the team to Boston in 2027, placing it in a larger New England market that could provide improved facilities.
The months since were confusing. The WNBA said the Boston deal wasn’t valid, arguing that any team sales must be handled through the league before they can be approved. There were other proposals for the Sun as well, including a deal that would keep the team in state but move games to Hartford, as well as a controversial state-backed proposal that would see Connecticut purchase a minority stake in the team using pension funds. 
So far, the league has effectively killed these proposals by ignoring them, discouraging the state from submitting any official offer. The Sun is definitely sticking around in Uncasville for the 2026 season, but with a new WNBA team potentially joining the regional market in Boston in 2033 or later, and the WNBA reportedly eyeing a sale to Houston, the Sun’s time in Connecticut could be setting.

Will there be a ‘blue wave’ in midterm elections?

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

Democrats are looking to build on their “blue wave” that swept local elections across Connecticut and a handful of states at the end of 2025. During this year’s midterm elections, they will test whether they can continue that trend. Republicans could defy the odds in a cycle that’s considered tough for the incumbent party.
This November, the U.S. House and U.S. Senate will be up for grabs — Republicans control both chambers with narrow margins. The party that controls the White House historically loses seats in a midterm year, and these elections tend to serve as a referendum on the current administration. Democrats’ last wave election was in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, when they took back the House and gained a net total of 41 seats.

Will Connecticut lawmakers consider a public option for health insurance?

This one’s probably not going to happen in 2026. On the campaign trail, Lamont has introduced the idea of “a Connecticut option” — some type of health plan that will offer residents access to high-quality health care at an affordable price. But the details are vague, and the governor himself has admitted the policy is still in very early stages. He’s said he thinks it will likely take a year to sort out the details and he expects to propose legislation related to a Connecticut option in 2027.

How many new units of housing will Connecticut towns add?

Credit: Stephen Busemeyer / CT Mirror

House Bill 8002 goes into effect this year. The sweeping bill addresses zoning and eliminates some off-street parking minimums, among other measures. We’ll start to see towns prepare for implementing some of the requirements and instituting others. 
Under the law, towns with populations of at least 15,000 must create fair rent commissions or join regional commissions by 2028. This means that 32 more towns have to create fair rent commissions.
We can also expect to see towns working on their housing growth plans, which are official plans to increase the number of designated affordable units in a town. The plans, required under the law and due every five years, must have specific goals, with the number of units towns think they’ll zone for.
Municipalities can decide whether to participate in a regional plan or develop their own. The first plans aren’t due until 2028, but towns will soon have decisions to make about how they want to move forward.

What effects will the Trump cuts have on Connecticut’s state budget?

Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror

Though President Trump and the GOP-led Congress likely will extract hundreds of millions of dollars from Connecticut’s budget starting in 2027, state policymakers will face many questions — and some financial hits — this year.
Should Connecticut replace some or all the roughly $350 million in federal premium assistance that about 140,000 enrollees in health insurance plans sold through the state exchange likely will lose to start the year?
What happens to an estimated 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness expected to have lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits by March 31 because of new work requirements or other rules changes? If Connecticut were to cover the monthly cost for this group, which involves one tenth of the state’s total SNAP caseload, legislators have said it likely would be less than $10 million.
And some federal tax changes — aimed primarily at the wealthy but also assisting corporations, will be in effect in the coming year. That means Connecticut — which links its state corporate tax system to the federal code — expects to lose about $70 million in revenues by June 30.

(Getty Images)I have had the same exact New Year’s Eve resolution for as long as I can remember: “Do better.”
It might seem easy and overly simplistic, but if you have spent any extended period of time attempting self-improvement, you know how difficult change can be to bring about. The marking of a new season can help measure change. I believe that is why we are celebrating a new year, or maybe it’s because we made it through another span of difficulty. 
Resolutions rarely stick. I watch the gym at the beginning of each year, packed to the brim, and 90 days later we are back to open treadmills.
Angela Duckworth wrote in “Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance” that “enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare.” I agree. We might start excited, but eventually our fortitude will be tested, and the fun time becomes a hard time. This is when the actual progress begins. 
I used to read John Knowles’ “A Separate Peace” every year during my 20s for fun. It was my yearly ritual. I would pick it up at the beginning of the year, right after New Year’s Day. The story never changed, but what I felt would, sometimes. “A Separate Peace” is a story of a friendship between Gene and Phineas. A tale of innocence lost, youthful rebellion, jealousy, and the encroaching tension of World War II. 
In one particular scene, there’s a visit to a tree at Devon Military School. It’s the summer of ’42, which Gene, the protagonist, refers to as his “sarcastic summer.” Gene and Finny were students at Devon, and at this moment, they were having fun as boys climbing a tree without a worry in the world, able to ignore the knowledge that they were being prepared for war. (The tree is a significant character in the story)
At one point, Gene says: “So the more things remain the same, the more they change after all — plus c’est la même chose, plus ça change. Nothing endures, not a tree, not love, not even a death by violence.”
I wrote this quote on the cover of my first diary when I arrived in Kansas. I understood that change is inevitable at a young age, growing up a military brat, following my father from one post to the next.
I was younger than my son, now 14, when I first read “A Separate Peace.” My son used to love climbing trees when he was younger. He would call out to me to watch how high he could get. I, too, loved to climb trees as a child. I think about those bright, soft moments of childish glee often when I look at the cottonwood out my window, changing with the season. Trees carry so much time within their bodies.
This New Year’s day, I will probably reread “A Separate Peace” again. I want to experience and try to understand those boys from a father’s perspective. When I look out my window at another tree stripped by the cold season, I wonder if I am the old giant, now shrunken by age in my son’s eyes, that Gene describes. 
I think about my child, and the tension of war that is encroaching on our peace, again. And I’m hoping we choose to “do better”, for our sons’ and daughters’ sakes. We already know how this story will unfold if we don’t.

(File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)As housing prices and monthly rents soar, advocates, lawmakers and the Moore administration say they share a goal of protecting Maryland families in an unstable housing market, even as the state faces its own financial woes.
But that means balancing protections for renters and families while courting developers to build new housing units, at a time of shrinking federal funding. It’s a tough task, says Matt Hill, attorney at the Public Justice Center, which is part of the Renters United Maryland coalition, but he says renter protections and affordable housing efforts are “needed now more than ever.”
“People are living on a knife’s edge because of the lack of affordable housing, because of the lack of stability in the economy and in their own lives,” Hill said.
Matt Losak, executive director of the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, said federal cuts to safety nets like food assistance and Medicaid will also affect people’s ability to afford housing. People waiting for emergency housing assistance “are literally hanging on for dear life,” he said.
“When they cut social benefits, like rental assistance program money or the federal impacts of cutting HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) money, [they] are going to add to the pain and disaster being felt by people on the low end of the spectrum, and the vast majority of them are renters,” Losak said.
For veterans of the housing fight, most of the issues will be familiar, while some are likely to have a bigger stage — like proposed wrongful detainer legislation, to cut down on people wrongfully living on someone else’s property, better known as “squatting.”
Housing officials, advocates warn shift in HUD funding could unhouse thousands in Maryland

Hill says some of the legislation proposed last year to expedite evictions in certain situations could have chipped away at due process for the person living in the space.
“We’re calling it the ‘Evict First, Ask Questions Later’ bills, because that’s really what the proposals are,” Hill said. “It’s going to allow for either the sheriff or the court to evict someone before they even had a chance to get a fair hearing.”
One bill that became law this year was Senate Bill 46, sponsored by Sen. Ron Watson (D- Prince George’s), which requires a hearing within 10 business days of a wrongful detainer complaint being filed. It took effect in October. Other wrongful detainer bills filed during the 2025 session.
Renters United Maryland said it anticipate other legislation that could threaten due process in eviction cases to reemerge in 2026, and worry that wrongful detainer bills could be used “as a tool for personal revenge.”
“Survivors of domestic abuse and their children are particularly at risk, as well as differently abled people. No matter the context of the allegation, Black women, who are already disproportionately affected by eviction, will suffer most under an evict-first approach,” the group said in a statement.
Emergency rental assistance
Advocates say they will push for a boost in funding for emergency rental assistance programs, particularly for a newly launched effort to keep lower-income families with kids housed during financial struggles.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) recently announced the opening of applications for the Community Schools Rental Assistance Program. It would let families of children in community schools, which have a relatively high number of low-income families, to get some extra money to help pay for housing when faced with eviction or utility cutoff because they are behind on their payments.
It’s a start, but not enough, advocates say: The program is limited to families in Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Frederick, Montgomery, Prince George’s, Washington and Wicomico counties, and they say it is “critically underfunded.” The 2024 bill creating the program allowed the governor to allocate up to $10 million, but it was funded at half that this year.
How many is 96,000? Key housing number cited by Moore is hard to explain

“Kids can’t learn if they slept in a homeless shelter the night before, or have to constantly transfer schools,” said Renters United Maryland in its list of legislative priorities. “Maryland should fully fund this program to help roughly 9,375 residents avoid eviction.”
‘Lessons learned’
Moore and Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day, meanwhile, said they will try again to streamline the housing development approval process to facilitate new development. The goal is to build new units across the state and reduce Maryland’s near 100,000 housing unit shortage, which state officials say contributes to the high housing costs in Maryland.
Administration officials say there were “lessons learned” during a rocky 2o25 session, when a relatively late start contributed to much of their housing package being scuttled.
Day began pitching Moore’s 2025 housing legislation to county officials in December 2024. That package, which aimed to tie housing development to areas with high job growth, immediately came under fire from county lobbyists who said it encroached on local decision making. It did not get a hearing until March, when it was heavily rewritten to grant vesting rights to developers, and ultimately died in a Senate committee as the session ended in April.
This year, Day has been working since August to get county officials on board with a bill to create “vesting rights” for developers, allowing them to keep the rights to develop a property once they have won approval for the project.
Some housing and renter advocates worry that the push for new housing comes at the expense of tenant protections, including the nearly 10-year effort to allow “good cause” evictions in the state.
“Our main concern is that that narrative not be used as a substitute for renter protections,” Losak said. “We are somewhat concerned of this idea that we can build our way into affordable ownership so that people don’t have to rent housing anymore.”
Renter advocates in recent years have been pushing bills that would let local jurisdictions decide whether to implement a “good cause” eviction policy, which requires a landlord to cite a specific reason why a tenant is getting evicted. The policy would be an option for counties under the bill, not a requirement.
Housing lobbyists say that regulations like good cause evictions or rent stabilization policies discourage developers from building in those areas.
Renter advocates gather in Annapolis to call on lawmakers to pass Good Cause Eviction legislation. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
A good cause bill passed the House in 2024, but died in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.
In 2025, the committee amended the bill to require that local jurisdictions choose either rent-control measures or good cause evictions. It was seen as an attempt to satisfy tenant advocates and developers, but Losak and others saw the amendment as a “poison pill” and momentum for the bill died.
Losak hopes the bill can come to a vote “in an acceptable form” this upcoming session.
“They may bring it to a vote, but if it includes poison amendments, like a requirement that local jurisdictions weaken rent stabilization programs, then it will be unacceptable,” Losak said. “That just becomes a vehicle to torpedo stable housing programs for renters.”
One big difference from recent years, Losak noted, is that 2026 is an election year, which could help the bill get over the finish line after almost a decade.
“We’re heading into an election year. The public … are more attuned to good cause now than they’ve ever been,” he said. “I think elected officials are aware that the public is concerned and that might have more influence this year … I think they’ll have to make a calculus as to whether it’s worth it if they play games.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Housing-1.jpg,,,2026-01-01 04:57:09.619294

There is Gov. Gavin Newsom’s all-but-announced campaign for president, centered on his self-appointed role of resistor-in-chief to Trump. As Newsom continues to troll Trump this year we may learn whether it continues to advance Newsom as a White House frontrunner or becomes tiresome and off-putting.
As 2025 ended Axios, a news website, reported that Newsom’s potential rivals are ratcheting up efforts to undermine his bid, arguing that, as a California progressive, he’s unelectable.
Another point of political fixation is Newsom’s successful effort to gerrymander California’s 52 congressional seats to help Democrats recapture control of the House in 2026. Whether it works is a question hanging over his presidential ambitions.
Still another is the campaign to choose a successor to Newsom. It so far has attracted a large contingent of Democrats without, as yet, a clear leader. There’s a theoretical possibility that with as many as a dozen Democrats in the field, the two Republicans could finish first and second in the June 2 primary and face each other for the governorship in November, despite the GOP’s very weak standing among voters.
This year’s election cycle also promises to be another showdown of moneyed interests via dueling ballot measures, with those either increasing or decreasing taxes at the top of the heap.
While political junkies can feed their habits this year, the more profound issue that faces California will be its moribund economy.
Newsom often brags that California’s $4 trillion economy, were it a nation, would rank fourth in the world. However, it has seen zero net job growth since the COVID-19 pandemic ended and recently has experienced employment shrinkage.
More than a million Californians in the labor force are jobless and the state’s unemployment rate, currently 5.6%, has been the highest or near the highest of any state for several years.
Employment doldrums have affected even the state’s hallmark sectors, most obviously Southern California’s withering film and TV production industry and the Bay Area’s high technology concentration.
The latter has almost single-handedly propped up the state’s economy and generated a huge portion of tax revenues, but layoffs have proliferated as artificial intelligence is increasingly employed — a syndrome that also affects Hollywood.

Stubborn, or even increasing, unemployment makes it more difficult for state and local governments to cover their budget deficits — thus underpinning the thrust for tax increases on state and local ballots. The sluggish economy also hampers efforts to improve two of the state’s most pressing socioeconomic issues, its highest-in-the-nation poverty and homelessness levels.
Even Californians who have homes and jobs are feeling the economic pinch. Combining economic data with polling results, the Public Policy Institute of California recently discovered rising economic angst among California residents.
“California is one of the largest economies in the world, but many working Californians do not feel economically secure (and) they struggle to pay their bills, save for the future, and balance the demands of work and daily life,” PPIC reported, adding that polling data “indicate that pessimism about future economic opportunity has become even more pervasive amid recent economic volatility.”
As he shifts into presidential campaign mode, Newsom has every reason to keep bragging about the state’s economy. But those running to replace him and state legislators should make 2026 the year to recognize that California has serious problems, to bore into the underlying causes and to do what they can to once again make California thrive.

(Photo by krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)There’s a new kind of “property insurance” being sold in Florida starting today, Jan 1.
And it’s for your pets.
The Florida Legislature passed HB 655 unanimously last spring and it was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis on April 22.  The bill amends the definition of property insurance to explicitly include insurance coverage for accidents and illnesses or diseases in pets and establishes a regulatory framework for pet insurance policies sold in Florida.
The bill also regulates the marketing and sale of pet wellness programs to prevent them from being misrepresented as insurance. If sold alongside pet insurance, wellness programs must be optional, clearly separated, and independently priced.
Florida is the 14th state to put such regulations into place, Insurance Newsnet reported.
A 2025 North American Pet health Insurance Association report shows that 7.03 million pets were insured in North America at the end of 2024. Total premium volume in the U.S. reached $4.7 billion at year end 2024. Florida is a lucrative market, the analysis shows, with the  more than 6% of the gross written premium nationwide coming from the state.
Specifically, HB 655 amends the Florida Insurance Code to include definitions for pet insurance and wellness programs. The former is defined as coverage for accidents, illnesses, and diseases of pets and reimburses a policyholder for expenses associated with medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment provided by a  veterinarian.
Pet wellness, meanwhile, is defined as a subscription- or reimbursement-based program separate from an insurance policy and that provides goods and services to promote the general health, safety, or well-being of the covered pet.

Laws can take effect immediately upon being signed, on July 1 with the start of the state’s fiscal year, on Oct. 1, or even on Jan. 1, which generally is the start date for insurance related bills because that’s often when insurance policies take effect.
Many of the laws that take effect today change the state’s criminal or civil statutes
HB 655 is one of two insurance-related bills that take effect Jan.1. The other, SB 158, prohibits the state group health insurance program from imposing any cost-sharing requirements with respect to coverage for diagnostic breast examinations and supplemental breast examinations.
A legislative staff analysis notes that while the state group health insurance plan provides diagnostic breast examinations without cost sharing requirements, “cost sharing for supplemental examinations among the current plans vary. ”
The bill provides parameters for what constitutes supplemental breast examinations, prohibiting cost sharing for examinations that are medically necessary and appropriate breast imaging examinations; used when no abnormality is seen or suspected; and based on personal or family medical history or other increased risk factors.
The Division of State Group Insurance within the Department of Management Services said the ban on cost sharing requirements could increase claims costs in the state group health insurance program by $3.6 million annually.
Bill sponsor and nine-year breast cancer survivor Sen.Lori Berman, D-Boynton Beach, said eliminating the cost sharing requirements will  help save lives.
“The reason why we’re doing it is because people often can’t afford the next step. When you do need the supplemental testing, an MRI …  or an ultrasound can cost as much as $1,000, so people delay,” she said. “And  we know that when breast cancer diagnoses are delayed it leads to worse outcomes.”
The new law only applies to the state group health insurance plan.

We learned pretty quickly that President Donald Trump was all he said he was going to be, and then some, and protests proliferated: No Kings, no ICE, Good Trouble and more No Kings.
State lawmakers closed a more than $3 billion budget gap with program cuts and tax increases, only to be presented with another $1 billion-plus budget hole in 2026 — when taxes are likely off the table because it’s an election year. Turnover in Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) Cabinet picked up and 2026 races started to take shape, with lots of blanks still to be filled in.
Immigration enforcement accelerated and a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador became the face of opposition to the Trump administration’s policies. Thousands of federal workers in Maryland lost their jobs and tens of thousands sat at home through the longest government shutdown in history.
The year also saw one young man realize his goal of making chromite the official state mineral, and another young man successfully push for markers — a butterfly symbol — on drivers licenses to alert police to hidden conditions, like autism. The states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreed on a new framework for improving the bay, and even though advocates wanted more, it was something.
As we turn from 2025 to 2026, we turn back for a minute to take a look at images from last year, some newsworthy, others newsworthy in retrospect and some because we just like the photo. We hope you do, too.

Campus and city officials do what they can, but say that it's limited.","Luxury student apartment buildings line Route 1 near the University of Maryland, including Tempo, right, and University View, left. Over the past decade, high-end developments have reshaped the corridor, driving up rents for students living near campus. (Photo by Mehedi Marof)The living room wasn’t meant to be a bedroom, but it’s the only space Ibrahim Mohammed can afford. His mattress sits against one wall beside a folding table that doubles as his study desk. There are no doors for privacy, and the kitchen light spills into the space where he sleeps.
It is not what he pictured when he left India for graduate school.
Mohammed, 25, pays $460 a month for that corner of a Graduate Hills apartment adjacent to the University of Maryland. The whole two-bedroom unit costs a little over $1,700 after an 18% discount the complex offers graduate students. His rent is low only because he sleeps in the hall. “It’s a huge degradation from how I lived back home,” said the data science master’s student at the university.
“Rent takes everything,” he said, with most of his $18-an-hour campus wages gone as soon as they come in. “I work in the catering section at Stamp [Student Union] between classes,” he said, a workload that “does hamper education.” He covers his tuition with a loan he took in India.
Mohammed’s experience reflects the pressures facing many of university’s graduate students. Riley Lankes, a Ph.D. student and an organizer with the Graduate Labor Union, said many graduate students are priced out of the College Park rental market and forced to live farther from campus, increasing commute times and transportation costs, while cutting into time for teaching, research and coursework.
The union has called on the university to raise graduate stipends, create guaranteed on-campus housing for grad students and cap rents in university-affiliated housing at a level tied to stipends. Union leaders say their rent should not exceed one-third of a graduate assistant’s income.
The university has taken steps to address graduate pay, even as it acknowledges that housing costs remain “a challenge in the Washington region,” said Dennis Passarella-George, campus director of Resident Life. The university sets a minimum graduate assistant stipend each year “to meet or exceed the university’s cost of attendance as calculated by the Office of Student Financial Aid,” with individual schools encouraged “to offer higher, discipline-specific pay,” he said.
Trump administration to garnish wages for defaulted student loans

The university increased minimum graduate assistant stipends by 64% between fall 2019 and fall 2025, Passarella-George said, including a 1% cost-of-living adjustment this academic year, amid what he described as “significant budget challenges.”
Still, students say housing costs continue to outpace those increases. Roughly 10,592 graduate students, including 4,232 grad assistants, are enrolled at Maryland, university data show, and Lankes said many of those assistants’ stipends “fall short in College Park’s rental market.” He pays around $2,000 a month for a one-bedroom apartment near campus, he said, while taking home roughly $2,100 after taxes for his 20-hour-per-week assistantship in the College of Information.
Federal housing guidelines recommend spending no more than 30 percent of a household’s income on rent, a benchmark that the Graduate Labor Union has adopted in its call for affordable housing. A first-year graduate student on a full assistantship earns a minimum of $35,074 for a 12-month appointment, requiring about 20 hours of work a week, graduate school data for fiscal 2025 show. Thirty percent of that  $2,917 monthly income would mean about $877 a month is available for rent.
It is rare to find stable housing in College Park — aside from improvised arrangements like Mohammed’s — that a graduate student can afford, Lankes said. “If my partner didn’t help me with half of the rent, I couldn’t cover my expenses,” he said.
One-bedroom apartments in College Park average $1,600 to $1,900, according to RentCafe, Apartments.com and Zillow. Two-bedroom units run $2,000 to $2,400, these sites show, and students often end up paying $1,000 to $1,400 per person for a single room in a shared apartment.
Those with part-time hourly campus jobs, like Mohammed, bring home even less each month than the graduate assistants. And for international students, federal rules restrict employment to only on-campus jobs for no more than 20 hours a week.
The university enrolled between 3,400 and 3,800 international graduate students over the past two years, according to International Student Services data.
Over the past decade, a wave of luxury-style student housing has risen along Route 1 — 16 complexes in total, according to College Park Mayor Fazlul Kabir and Nick DiSpirito, the campus student liaison to the city council.
City Councilmember Denise Mitchell said recent development patterns have pushed many students farther from Route 1 and the main campus. “The current housing stock is driving up the prices,” she said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
She said the strain now extends beyond the university to become a regionwide affordability issue. Rising rents across the region, she said, have pushed some students “from American, Georgetown, Howard and Bowie State [universities] into College Park.”
Passarella-George said the city offers a “wide range of housing options,” including apartments and rental homes, and said many graduate students prefer “independent, apartment-style living.” University-owned residence halls prioritize undergraduates in their first two years, he said, while graduate students have been directed to university-affiliated but privately owned housing operated by Southern Management Cos. at Graduate Hills and Graduate Gardens.
Those two complexes, located next to campus, offer a total of about 475 units. Published floor-plan pricing lists rents at about $1,422 for a studio, $1,650 for a one-bedroom and $1,970 for a two-bedroom — before an 18% discount available to university graduate students through the university’s partnership with the operator.
The university’s partnership with Southern Management helps students avoid “application fees and credit-check requirements often imposed by off-campus landlords,”  Passarella-George said.
Additionally, the university provides “a number of resources” to support international graduate students in their housing search, he added. Students can also seek guidance from the International Student and Scholar Services office and Graduate Legal Aid.
Students should weigh “distance, amenities, and the type of living environment they prefer,” adding that “at times, cost may need to outweigh the convenience of being located immediately adjacent to the university,” Passarella-George said.
When somewhat ‘affordable’ housing comes with inconvenience
For Ph.D. student Rahayu Adzhar, the affordability gap became clear even before she arrived on campus. Lab members told her Graduate Hills and Graduate Gardens were the only relatively cheaper options for graduate students, she said.
She put her name on the waitlist. It never moved.
Instead, she bypassed the system by taking over someone else’s lease: a $1,040 studio apartment at Graduate Hills. The price was considered “modest” because of the discount, she said, but it ate up nearly half of her monthly after-tax income of about $2,100.
Issues began immediately, Adzhar said: The heating and cooling were “often dysfunctional,” the basement unit smelled damp, and plumbing problems routinely made the shower barely usable.










Most of the developments are not in the affordable category based on the standard definition of affordability .... Property owners can set the rent as they wish. We cannot directly control rent. These are private entities. We don’t own them.


– College Park Mayor Fazlul Kabir, on the challenge affordable student housing


Maintenance staff fixed individual issues, like a broken shower nozzle, but later, she said, when another issue erupted, she decided to move out.
Finding affordable alternatives was no easier for her.
Adzhar now rents a $1,000 basement in a single-family home in Hyattsville. It is cleaner and quieter, she said, but several miles from campus. And transportation is becoming harder to manage.
Campus transportation services cut back the Hyattsville shuttle runs, from about five daily a year ago, according to archived schedules, to three times a day now. Adzhar said she often has to pay for rideshares to get to class.
Adzhar, who is also a member of the Graduate Labor Union, said the university should “provide more student housing,” including guaranteed on-campus options for at least “30 to 50% of the graduate student population,” and rents in university-affiliated housing of no more than a third of the lowest graduate stipend.
“If we are struggling every month to pay rent and buy our groceries, we cannot focus on research or education,” she said.
A system not built for affordability
College Park officials say the affordability crisis has been a decade in the making.
Mitchell said that historically, the city hadn’t differentiated between student housing need and general affordable housing need. “As long as I’ve been on the council, we never thought about student housing needs,” she said.
For years, she said, the city relied on the city–university partnership to discuss availability of student housing along Route 1, particularly for “undergraduate students who have to leave dorms after sophomore year.” But beyond that, she said, “there really hasn’t been definitive stakeholder work on student affordability.”
Kabir, the mayor, agreed new construction along Route 1 has skewed upscale. “Most of the developments are not in the affordable category based on the standard definition of affordability,” he said.
Maryland universities saw international student enrollment decline over past year

Part of the reason rents remain high, Kabir said, is that landlords have broad latitude. “Property owners can set the rent as they wish,” he said. “We cannot directly control rent. These are private entities. We don’t own them.”
He said the lack of affordability is  “not acceptable.”
Mitchell said the city lacks a key tool that might otherwise help.
“The city doesn’t have land-use authority,” she said. “We can’t control zoning. The county holds that power, and they’ve resisted letting municipalities have it.” Because of that, she said, College Park has little ability to influence what kinds of housing get built or to push developers toward affordability.
Kabir said the city is doing what it can by updating its Revitalization Tax Credit Program, which encourages developers to set aside affordable units in exchange for reduced city taxes. “We are sacrificing some tax revenue so these units can be affordable,” he said, noting the specifics are “negotiated case by case.”
Unfortunately, city student liaison DiSpirito said, “Landlords also use the timing of the market to their advantage.” Many complexes, he said, push students to renew leases for the following year almost as soon as they move in, while most single-family rentals don’t hit the market until late spring.
DiSpirito and fellow liaison Amira Abujuma have pressed for an ordinance that would bar landlords from requiring renewals more than 180 days before a lease ends. “It’s about restoring freedom of choice,” DiSpirito  said. The council delayed a vote on the proposal until February.
Students with nowhere else to turn can turn to the Thrive Center for Essential Needs, which supports those facing housing, food or financial emergencies, said the center’s case manager, Chamika Ellis. The center’s assistance includes emergency break housing, emergency grants, meal swipes, financial-aid interventions and connections to Prince George’s County youth homelessness programs when on-campus housing is not available, she said.
Ellis said the center routinely works with international, LGBTQ+, and Black and Latino students, as well as graduate students whose incomes “do not stretch far enough.”
“We’re trying to fill gaps,” she said. “But the need is bigger than what we can cover.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-30-at-5.33.49 PM-1024x675.jpeg,,,2025-12-31 21:57:07.606169

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)In a lengthy decision Wednesday, the Montana Supreme Court rejected a recommendation Attorney General Austin Knudsen should be suspended from practice for 90 days in a professional misconduct case.
The order cleared Knudsen of three professional misconduct allegations, but it found he violated two other codes of conduct.
However, the order said Knudsen’s due process rights had been violated in the case in multiple instances, as he had alleged, and the justices declined to take additional action.
“Due to the (Commission on Practice’s) violation of Knudsen’s due process guarantees, we dismiss this case without further action,” the order said.
A Supreme Court summary of the case said a six-member majority of the seven-member panel agreed with the decision to dismiss the case without suspension.
In a statement on the Department of Justice website, Knudsen thanked the Supreme Court.

“I appreciate the Supreme Court bringing this frivolous complaint to a long-overdue conclusion,” Knudsen said in the statement. “We’ve said it from the very beginning, this was nothing more than a political stunt.
“I’m glad this distraction is behind us as we continue our work at the Department of Justice to keep Montana the best place to live and raise a family.”

Most Supreme Court justices had recused themselves in the case, and the chief appointed district court judges to serve on the panel instead.
Heard in the Montana Supreme Court in March, the case stems from a dispute among the three different branches of government during the 2021 legislative session and allegations Knudsen improperly disparaged the court and defied court orders.
In the September 2023 complaint, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline against members of the state bar, alleged Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct in 41 separate counts — allegations one of his lawyers described as a “political stunt.”
In October 2024, the Commission on Practice, which regulates the profession, found Knudsen violated five rules of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, and it recommended the state Supreme Court suspend him for 90 days.
In an appeal, Knudsen not only objected to the recommendations, he alleged due process violations.
In March before the state Supreme Court, Knudsen’s lawyer argued the court should dismiss the case as a “highly irregular and unprecedented one.”
The Office of Disciplinary Counsel argued Knudsen deserved to be suspended to protect the integrity of the court, which his actions would otherwise undermine.
Five members of the state high court recused themselves in the case, and Chief Justice Cory Swanson appointed five district court judges to serve, in addition to himself and Justice Katherine Bidegaray.
The judges were unanimous in their decisions on four of the five alleged violations of professional misconduct, and six members came together in the fifth allegation, according to the case summary.
“There’s an old saying in our profession that ‘bad facts make bad law,'” the order said. “This case presents an unusual accumulation of bad facts.”
The order said the case was important to address the specific allegations against Knudsen but also provide guidance for the future conduct of attorneys and disciplinary proceedings.
In addressing allegations of rule violations, the order said Knudsen breached the conduct code when he failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s order to return materials obtained by a subpoena and also directed or approved of a subordinate doing the same.
But the order also said the Office of Disciplinary Counsel failed to show Knudsen, a Republican in his second term in office, made statements that were knowingly false when he criticized the court as alleged.
“Each of his statements critical of the court was either a factual statement, which ODC failed to prove was false, or a statement of opinion,” the order said.
It also said the Office of Disciplinary Counsel failed to prove his conduct improperly influenced a court proceeding.
The order rejected the recommendation for a 90-day suspension, and a summary said the opinion should be considered a public admonition.
The decision drew immediate praise from Republican leaders in Montana including U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy and state Senate President Matt Regier of Kalispell.
“We must draw a bright line for the public between true ethical violations in government and manufactured controversies like the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and Commission on Practice’s shameful political persecution of Austin Knudsen,” Regier said in a statement provided by the Senate Republican communications director.
In a statement provided by The Political Company, Sheehy also lauded the decision.
“It’s good to see this politically-motivated complaint finally come to a just conclusion. I look forward to continuing to work alongside Attorney General Knudsen and the rest of the Montana delegation to secure a safer and more prosperous future for all Montanans,” Sheehy said in the statement.

Here are the staff-selected top stories of the year.
 1.GOP fights and fractures 

Montana has grown increasingly more red in recent years, but this year showed Montanans a power struggle within the state GOP.
That battle took place within the 2025 Legislature and outside of it.

During the session, Republicans in the Senate elected more conservative leadership, but their power was quickly undercut when nine more moderate members of the party joined with Democrats to make deciding votes on critical legislation.
In the legal arena, a political fight in Ravalli County led to a court order that found Republican party leaders had disenfranchised voters.
The Republican plaintiff in the case said members of the Freedom Caucus are having undue influence on the state GOP.
In June, Montana Republicans elected hardliner Art Wittich as state party chair after the retirement of longtime chairperson Don “K” Kaltschmidt in a move that will shape elections in 2026.
 2. Property tax relief … or not

The Montana Legislature made property taxes a main character of the 2025 Legislative session, and discussion on the topic dominated the final weeks of lawmaking.
Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte pushed for a homestead tax exemption, with the idea that those with second homes would pay more of a share. With rises in home values, and thereby, property valuations, a worry in western Montana is that Legislative changes won’t end up having much of an impact.
The bill lawmakers finally approved at the last minute did give some reductions, including for residential owners, though frustration continues.
Additionally, there’s been long-running concern people who may be eligible for property tax relief aren’t being told they are and end up not getting the benefit.
Lawmakers eventually shifted the property tax burden around and didn’t reduce overall tax collection by the state.
  3. No Kings rallies all over Montana 

Residents in Montanan’s smallest and largest communities rallied multiple times throughout the year in solidarity with a national No Kings Protest movement standing against the Trump administration. Thousands gathered in cities like Bozeman, Billings and Missoula, with more than two-dozen different protests taking place during a June event.

At rallies coordinated in early October, the hamlet of Polebridge, outside Glacier National Park, saw its population exceeded by the more than 60 protesters, many in costumes, that gathered to sing and listen to elected officials talk about the importance of raising their voices.
In Dillon, about 200 people lined North Montana Street, waving signs and playing guitars. They were worried about energy costs, immigration raids and the protection of their public lands.
Crowds lined the streets in Hamilton as well, rallying for democracy, the U.S. Constitution, civil liberties, immigrants, health care, the proper use of military troops, and for science and research.
  4. Medicaid spared in Montana 

The Montana Legislature approved Medicaid expansion with bipartisan support, and Gianforte signed it into law.
The bill legislators approved, sponsored by Rep. Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls, essentially continues the program as reauthorized in 2019.
Eligible adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty limit qualify, and nearly 80,000 Montanans participated in Montana at the time the bill was passed.
During the session, some legislators argued an appetite to cut spending at the federal level would affect Medicaid in Montana.
This summer, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law with significant changes for federally-funded health care programs.
  5. Federal government shutdown hurts Montana’s tourism

When the government shut down this fall, a big front-facing indication of the gridlock came at national parks. Visitors could still enter them, but without employees to staff entrances, clean toilets, and provide communication and emergency services, revenue was lost and visitor experiences were limited.
Glacier saw roughly 70,000 fewer visitors in September and October compared to last year, dropping from being on pace for the 2nd highest visitation on record to being down 2.4% over last year’s number, though the park will still see the third highest visitation ever.
Yellowstone, meanwhile, is currently on pace for its second-highest year ever, but also saw a drop-off during the shutdown, with roughly 40,000 fewer visitors passing through the park than in 2024. However, more than one million visitors entered Yellowstone in September and October, straining staff and resources.
  6. New voting law causes more Montanans to have rejected ballots 

A new law sponsored by Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell passed the Legislature this year requiring a voter to write their birth year on their ballot next to their signature for verification purposes. The law, which was challenged in court, went into effect for the first time during November’s municipal elections across the state.
The results were mixed, with some counties, such as Lewis and Clark County, seeing little to no impact on rejected ballots, due mainly to a robust public awareness campaign and a trial run during a primary. But most of the other populous counties in Montana saw rejection rates up to 10 times the average, with thousands of ballots missing signatures. Some counties saw from 1% to 5% of ballots rejected, requiring county staff as well as hundreds of voters to take time to resolve the errors.
  7. Water crisis at prison 

Montana State Prison faced a prolonged water shortage in early October, leading the governor to call up the National Guard and creating frustration for the families of prisoners.

Tents were set up outside for prisoners to shower in, water bottles were passed out, and portable bathrooms were put up outside.
Officials attributed the water crisis to deferred maintenance, and they moved planned construction at the prison to the top of the state’s priority list.
The Legislature had previously budgeted $21 million for the project. Water quality has been a long-running issue at the facility, which is situated in a Superfund site.
Water was restored at the facility in late October and the state says the water at the prison is safe to consume.
  8. Montana wants to hunt more wolves as feds move to delist 

Just a few weeks into the 2025 Legislature, a marathon committee hearing saw a reinvigoration of a long-time debate in Montana: are there enough, or too many wolves in the state.

In 2021, the Legislature pushed through a law directing the state Fish, Wildlife and Parks commission to reduce wolf populations to a “sustainable level.” But wolves have stabilized around 1,140 wolves, give or take, for the last 10 years. While lawmakers in 2025 voted down bills that would have allowed unlimited, or near unlimited, wolf hunting seasons, the FWP commission did boost the state’s hunting and trapping quota by about 37%, to 458 animals, spawning multiple lawsuits.
Similar conversations are taking place at the national level, as lawmakers in Congress push to remove the species from the Endangered Species List and turn over full-time management to the states. In December, the U.S. House voted in favor of a bill co-sponsored by Montana Rep. Troy Downing to remove federal protections from gray wolves and prevent courts from reviewing the law.
  9. PSC tussles while NorthWestern contemplates merger

The Montana Public Service Commission stayed busy this year, taking on significant cases, reversing course in one, and managing internal conflict.
The PSC approved the controversial Yellowstone County Generating Station at $246 million, less than NorthWestern Energy wanted for the methane-fired electricity plant but more than some parties argued it should get. Customers will pay for the plant.
The monopoly utility also announced a proposed merger with Black Hills Corp in a deal the PSC will scrutinize in the coming year.
Late this year, commissioners quickly reversed course in a decision to call for a federal investigation of NorthWestern Energy’s formation of a shell company to take on new shares at Colstrip from Puget Sound Energy.
The case is still pending with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The PSC is made up of five elected commissioners, currently all Republican, and this year, the politicians squabbled, ousting PSC President Brad Molnar from leadership after less than one year and following the launch of an internal investigation that remains pending.
 10. Controversial bathroom bill among the first laws passed 

A sign outside one of the bathrooms in the Montana State Capitol. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)
Gianforte signed House Bill 121 in late March, which would require public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females, and require people use the one “designated for their sex” based on “external genitalia present at birth.”
The legislation almost immediately ended up in court, where it remains.
Plaintiffs in that case argue it’s a crystal-clear case of discrimination. Conservatives supporting the legislation have argued it’s about protecting women and girls.
A judge has already recused himself from the case, and the legislation is another in a long line of controversial bills leading to contentious litigation.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/No_Kings_Polebridge_01-1024x765.jpg,,,2025-12-31 20:12:28.493372

Five state senators, all Democrats, referred in their letter to correspondence with Evnen in October when they reminded him of an “obligation to protect Nebraska voter privacy from unwarranted federal overreach.”
They said Evnen had indicated in a response at the time that he would not comply with the federal government’s request to turn over detailed voter information due to pending litigation. 
Voting advocacy group Common Cause Nebraska has sued to block the sharing of that voter data with the U.S. Department of Justice.
But Wednesday’s letter was penned in light of a more recent news story published in the Nebraska Examiner Dec. 18, which led lawmakers to believe Evnen, a Republican, had been communicating with the DOJ regarding release of the data. 
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha was joined in the request by Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha,  Danielle Conrad and Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Victor Rountree of Bellevue.
Trump’s DOJ offers states confidential deal to remove voters flagged by feds

The group sought to know more about the “timing and results of negotiations” between Evnen’s office and the feds. 
It said in part: “If you are not forthcoming to this request, we will explore other remedies to fully understand what you are doing in Nebraskans names and with public resources which may risk their sensitive personal and voting information or contradict your prior position.”
Evnen could not immediately be reached for comment on the Wednesday letter. The news story that lawmakers referred to in their letter quoted a spokesperson for Evnen saying he plans to comply with the DOJ request, pending the outcome of an ongoing lawsuit.
Evnen has noted that he sought guidance from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, and was “fine” with handing over the information because Nebraska’s voter rolls are “complete and proper.” 
The Stateline story, published in the Examiner, revealed details of a confidential draft agreement the DOJ sent to more than a dozen states, including Nebraska, that would require election officials to remove any alleged ineligible voters identified during a federal review of their voter rolls.

The agreement would hand the federal government a major role in election administration, a responsibility that belongs to the states under the U.S. Constitution. While the DOJ has demanded states’ voter rolls since summer, Stateline said the draft agreement offered the most detailed picture yet of how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
Federal officials have said they need voters’ detailed information to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote. Critics have pushed back over concerns such as privacy, identity theft, national security and political targeting. 
Juarez said Wednesday the lawmakers’ letter to Evnen was prompted by concern over private discussions the secretary of state may be having regarding release of Nebraskans’ personal voting data.
“Really what is going on in those conversations?” she said. “It’s concerning.”

Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn denounces the Trump administration's freeze of child care funding to Minnesota at a press conference Wednesday Dec. 31, 2025. (Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Child care center owners and Minnesota Democratic leaders decried on Wednesday the Trump administration’s freeze on federal funding to the state, which they said would cripple an already fragile industry.
“Fraud is never acceptable. But cutting off child care funding to everyone in the state is not the answer, and it’s not acceptable,” said Amanda Schillinger, a child care center director, who said that her center will shut down if it loses the 75% of children it cares for whose families receive government help for child care.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday in an X post that it has frozen all child care payments to Minnesota in response to new fraud allegations from a viral YouTube video that has gotten over 2 million views. The video by right-wing social media influencer Nick Shirley showed Somali-run child care centers that receive state and federal funding but had no children, fueling the Trump administration’s latest attack on Minnesota, which is home to the largest Somali population in the U.S.
One provider, Naima Awes, said in an interview Wednesday that over 90% of the 52 kids at her Minneapolis day care receive Child Care Assistance Program funding, without which her business will shut down. Awes said that state inspectors visit her site every 6 months.
Awes, who is Somali, said that a group of teenagers came to her day care center on Monday in search of fraud, scaring employees and kids.
The Trump administration is also taking aim at other states. In the same X post announcing the funding freeze, Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said that the department will also start requiring states to provide “justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.”
The department could not offer many specifics on the new review process when asked about it Wednesday.
Decade-long history of fraud investigations
Minnesota receives about $185 million annually from the federal Child Care Assistance Program, which helps low-income families with child care so parents can work.
Over 20,000 Minnesota children will lose access to child care without that federal funding, Schillinger said Wednesday at a press conference at the state Capitol. Kids Count On Us, a child care advocacy group affiliated with the multifaith religious organization ISAIAH, hosted the press conference.
Fraud in Minnesota’s state- and federal-supported child care program is not new, with media reports and federal charges going back a decade. But new allegations come amidst a newly intense focus on Minnesota public programs arising out of federal prosecutions of public program fraud under both Democratic and Republican administrations, as well recent right-wing media accounts that have grabbed the attention of President Donald Trump and his administration.
The state’s child care system is already confronting a crisis of both affordability — Minnesota child care is among the most expensive in the nation — and a shortage of labor.
A statement from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison called into question the legality of the funding freeze: “This hasty, scorched earth-attack is not just wrong, it may well be illegal.”
A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office declined to elaborate on the possibility of a lawsuit from the state.
State investigates centers from video
State inspectors went out Monday to check that children were present at the day cares in the viral video, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families said in a Monday news conference. The commissioner also said that all the day cares in the video had been visited by a state inspector in the last six months. The same day, federal Homeland Security agents came to Minnesota to do their own inspections.
A representative from the Department of Children, Youth, and Families did not respond when asked to comment on the result of the Monday inspections.
Rep. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, DFL-Eden Prairie, said at the Wednesday conference that the investigation is ongoing.
Kotyza-Witthuhn said that the state has not been requiring photo evidence as part of its review process, adding that new federal requirements are “something that we can take under guidance when we return to the legislative session.”
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican who is challenging Gov. Tim Walz in next year’s election, said this week that her caucus steered Shirley to child care sites in Minnesota, Minnesota Public Radio reported.
The slashing of child care funding is just the latest crisis to engulf Walz’s administration — and his reelection campaign.
The widespread defrauding of safety net programs on Walz’s watch was already emerging as a key issue as he seeks an unprecedented third, four-year term in 2026. But that was before a report in the right-wing City Journal claimed money pilfered from Minnesota safety net programs was winding up in the hands of Somali terror group al-Shabbab, even though federal prosecutors have never brought terror financing charges in their vast investigation, and both chief prosecutor Joseph Thompson and former U.S. Attorney Andy Luger have downplayed the possibility.
Regardless, Trump then amped up racist language against Somali Americans — most of whom are American citizens — calling them “garbage.”
Trump’s supporters have joined in, putting Minnesota the center of a right-wing maelstrom, with new federal investigations announced regularly since then.
A spokeswoman for Walz said he “has worked for years to crack down on fraud and asked the state Legislature for more authority to take aggressive action.”

A Gallatin County District Court judge ruled that the Montana Department of Environmental Quality didn’t take a “hard look” at the water quality impacts of a proposed subdivision a quarter mile from the Gallatin River.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper filed a lawsuit against DEQ in 2023, arguing a project at an old quarry to build eight high-density housing buildings could harm an already impaired river.
The lawsuit focused on the development’s septic system permits and the state approval process for the build.
“DEQ has consistently failed to evaluate what’s happening in a river as a whole with many sources of nutrient pollution and seems to find individual new sources insignificant,” Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “But it never goes and looks at the system as a whole.
“And so when the agency doesn’t look at the system as a whole, you can’t render an evidence-based decision on whether or not something is going to cause harm. And that’s the penultimate question that not only the Water Quality Act, but the Montana Constitution requires.”
The project was approved in 2022, the same year the Environmental Protection Agency declared the Gallatin River to be “impaired,” due to an increased number of algae blooms and other contributing factors.
The blooms harm fish and plant life and are a growing problem and concern for environmental groups, anglers and those enjoying other outdoor water recreation activities. The Gallatin River has seen an increasing number of algae blooms, which the state has investigated.
The court ruling said DEQ’s failure to assess cumulative impacts of the project, and approval of the permit despite not knowing the cause of algal blooms, was “arbitrary, capricious and unlawful and in violation of the Montana Constitution, (Montana Environmental Policy Act) and the (Water Quality Act).”
DEQ generally does not comment on litigation, a spokesperson for the agency wrote in an email on Wednesday afternoon.
In the decision issued on Dec. 29, the court did rule in favor of DEQ on two claims. It said the agency did not violate administrative procedures or otherwise constitute unlawful rulemaking. 
Additionally, the court said the DEQ did not violate the Montana Water Quality Act’s nondegradation policy, meant to protect the state’s natural resources. In this case, the court did not reach a conclusion about whether there had been violation of the policy because any potential pollution hasn’t happened yet.
Upper Missouri Waterkeeper called the decision a major win. Other litigation pending, from Citizens for a Better Flathead, in the Flathead Valley, the Lakeside Sewer and Water case, still has a claim out regarding the “hard look” mentioned in the Quarry subdivision, which found that scrutiny is required in all cases.
“This decision reinforces that Montana law requires transparency, sound science, and accountability before approving new sources of pollution,” a press release from the organization stated. “If Phase 1 of the Quarry Project is to move forward, DEQ must redo its review and meaningfully analyze cumulative nutrient impacts on the Gallatin.”

“Sustained and consistent mixed-use or compact housing development will bring the TIF district into balance over the long run and result in higher overall annual revenues,” wrote Ilona Blanchard, the city's community development director.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Dec. 24, 2025.
The South Burlington Tax Increment Financing district is in good financial standing, but according to a recent report, for the city to realize the full benefits of its success, development and growth must continue.
The city will hold a “substantial change” hearing next month to update anticipated growing costs in the TIF district and financing plan, particularly for outstanding projects, with costs that have exceeded former projections.
TIF is one of the most powerful economic tools available to municipalities for financing public and private development. It is essentially a way a town or city pays for improvements in a specific area without raising taxes.
Once the area is designated — in South Burlington’s case, it’s a small subset of the 300-acre City Center — the current level of property taxes from that area continues to go to schools and government as usual. The municipality is then able to borrow money to build roads, sidewalks or other public infrastructure. As development happens, property values rise and generate extra tax revenue. That extra tax money is used to pay back the borrowed money.
The idea is that, as the infrastructure is built and improved, it attracts private sector investment in new and renovated buildings and increases the value of the grand list.
South Burlington’s TIF district was instituted in 2012, but the city didn’t incur its first debt until 2017, setting the 20-year increment retention period in motion. Since then, the city has made several advances in its own projects and in incentivizing the private sector to build up City Center. Over 650 new homes have been built in the area, along with approximately 80,000 square feet of first-floor commercial space. Ninety-six homes are currently under construction in the district.
And this year, the TIF district expenditures and revenues are in balance. As part of the city’s overall 2025 grand list, the TIF district grand list was $107.8 million higher than that area was in 2012 — almost three times the 2012 original taxable value. The city expects to add $1.77 million to the fund by the end of the current fiscal year, more than $600,000 than the prior year.
South Burlington’s community development director and unofficial TIF district guru, Ilona Blanchard, told the city council last month that, while the TIF district is performing well, projection models show lower revenues and a deeper need to cushion the TIF district fund if no future development occurs.
“Sustained and consistent mixed-use or compact housing development will bring the TIF district into balance over the long run and result in higher overall annual revenues,” Blanchard wrote in a memo. “Ongoing efforts to encourage additional development are promising, including recent actions to update zoning regulations, but permits have yet to be filed.”
Blanchard’s “break even forecast” estimates that 56 rental apartment homes need to be added each year to result in a positive balance at the end of the TIF district’s life — fiscal year 2038 — with no surplus revenue.
Growing project costs
The city has four remaining TIF district projects to complete, with four — including Market Street and the city’s municipal buildings —already complete.
But the costs for those projects are increasing. Most notable is a proposed bike and pedestrian bridge over Interstate 89, where the estimated cost has increased by nearly $13 million since 2021. The project is 30% eligible for TIF.
The city has received two major federal grants for the project, totaling $17.7 million, in addition to the roughly $70,000 in federal funds expended during the scoping period of the project.
The project was initially put out to bid in May, but when bids came back, both came in significantly higher than previously anticipated.
As this project is shovel-ready, the city is “value engineering” the project to rebid for construction, perhaps this winter, while also working to obtain an estimated $3.5 million of gap funding.
“We’re squeezing down that initial cost as much as we can, and we’ll be looking for more grant money,” Blanchard said, noting the project will likely be broken into phases. “We’re keeping the overall designs but there are a few things that will change.”
Other outstanding projects include the second and third phases of Garden Street, the City Center Park Phase 2 recreation path — connecting Market and Garden streets to the City Center Park — and the Williston Road Streetscape, which improves bicycle and pedestrian access on one of the city’s busiest corridors.

Data shows state workers are staying in their jobs. But critics argue the change is a waste of money and an unneeded burden.

When Gov. Phil Scott announced that state workers would need to return to offices at least three days per week starting Dec. 1, the state employees’ union warned the initiative could cause a mass exodus of top staff.
So far, that doesn’t appear to be the case. 
Comparing mid-September to mid-December of 2025 to the same period in 2024, retirements are up slightly from 66 to 76, according to data from the Vermont Department of Human Resources. Resignations, on the other hand, have fallen from 205 to 185, a drop of nearly 10% compared to last year.

Sarah Clark, Vermont’s secretary of administration, said in an interview earlier this month that the number of applicants for state jobs has actually risen. 
“When you look out at what’s happening both in the federal government and the private sector, I think state government is a very attractive employer,” Clark said, crediting in part the state’s health and pension benefits.
The Vermont state government and its employees’ union have been facing off since Gov. Phil Scott announced this summer that employees would need to return to work in-person at least three days a week. Like many employers around the country, Vermont’s government is navigating the challenge of trying to bring its workforce back into the office more regularly following the normalization of remote work during the Covid-19 pandemic.
As for how the first month of the three-day office mandate is going, Clark described it as relatively smooth, though navigating childcare and long commutes are top issues state employees have reported. 
“This is a big change for our workforce, and I’m empathetic to their concerns and needs,” she said. “But (I’m) also excited about the opportunity that it presents for us supporting Vermonters and also working collectively together.”
Despite the administration’s optimism, the Vermont State Employees’ Association — the union representing state workers — is continuing to pursue legal challenges to the mandate.
The administration “didn’t talk to employees. They just threw this out there, and said, ‘This is the way it is,’” Steve Howard, the union’s executive director, said. “We don’t agree with that. We think they have an obligation to bargain with us.”
In late November, the state employees’ union took the Scott administration to court, hoping a judge would deny or delay the return to office mandate. The judge ultimately did not issue an injunction, finding that state employees had sufficient relief available to them through the state’s exemption process, through which employees can make their case for working remotely more than two days per week. But the union has continued its legal challenges, with a Vermont Labor Relation Board hearing expected in February, according to Howard. 
Howard said employees have received “contradictory guidance” from managers about when to apply for exemptions and what might qualify a person for an exemption, and some supervisors “still don’t know what to tell people” about how to navigate the mandate.
As of mid-December, the Scott administration had received about 500 requests for exceptions to the in-office policy. About 40 had been approved, according to Clark, and the rest remained outstanding, with employees allowed to work their previous schedules while their requests are processed.  
State leaders have said they are reviewing all employee requests for more remote work flexibility on a case-by-base basis. It’s unclear if the approved requests have any similarities. While state-issued guidance has listed very limited circumstances when exemptions may be warranted, officials have said exceptions are not limited to those reasons. Any employee who believes they have a “compelling reason” for an exception can make their case, according to state guidance. 
Vermont’s flexible working arrangements law also allows employees to request changes to their working arrangements, such as remote work flexibility. Employers must consider an employee’s request and whether it “could be granted in a manner that is not inconsistent with its business operations or its legal or contractual obligations.”
Half to two-thirds of state employees had already been working in person more than three days per week and thus their work was not impacted by the hybrid mandate, Clark said.
In a tight budget year, the added cost of returning to offices has drawn criticism. The state is leasing new office space in Waterbury to accommodate workers, paying $430,000 in the first year and $2.3 million by the end of a five year lease. 
The new offices also require one-time costs to prepare the sites to be occupied by state workers, which total $385,000, according to Clark. 
While data doesn’t show a mass exodus of state employees, some have reported resigning as a result of the return to office. 
Matthew Grimo, a paralegal with the Vermont Agency of Transportation, said he had been commuting two days per week from Burlington to Barre. An extra day of the roughly 50-minute commute wasn’t a financial burden he could accept. Grimo submitted his resignation last week. 
“I love my team, I love working with my team,” he said, “One hundred percent I wouldn’t have considered this if the return to office had not cropped up.”
Grimo said he submitted a request to be exempted from the three-day requirement in November and had continued commuting two days per week since — the number of days he’d been told to commute when he was hired in 2024. But he had yet to hear back from the state, Grimo said, and felt he had to assume his exemption wouldn’t be approved and decided to resign accordingly. 
“The state, the administration was incredibly unclear, and to this day, is still incredibly unclear with exactly what they expect and what they will allow with employees,” he said.
In his new job, Grimo will actually need to commute more often, but the drive will be much shorter.
“It’s five minutes from my house versus an hour,” he said, “which makes all the difference to me.”

The devastation left by Typhoon Halong in Western Alaska was historic — and life-changing for many — this year. The storms prompted a massive disaster response and public safety effort, including the largest mass evacuation in state history. 
Gov. Dunleavy joined other Republican governors and approved the Trump administration’s request to deploy Alaska National Guard service members domestically for “civil disturbance operations” in Washington D.C. , and 100 service members are set to deploy in March. 
The Dunleavy administration also agreed to detain 42 men arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from out of state in June, amid a nationwide immigration crackdown. The move, and subsequent transfer of detainees back to Washington state, raised questions and concerns from lawmakers and advocates around why they were transferred to Alaska and conditions in Alaska prisons. 
This year, University of Alaska researchers told lawmakers that policy to mitigate crime should focus on violent crime because according to the most recently available crime data for 2023, violent crime rates remained “exceptionally” high, even though Alaska’s property crime was declining. 
Here are some of the top stories of the year: 

The remnants of Typhoon Halong caused massive storm surge and hurricane force winds that devastated coastal communities, particularly in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, and prompted the largest mass evacuation from Western Alaska in state history.

The catastrophic storm left one person dead and two more missing. Dozens of homes floated off their foundations, communities across the region sustained damage, and existential questions arose around the region’s future because of intensifying climate change factors that amplify environmental risks.
The Alaska Beacon was on the ground in Bethel at the time the storm hit, and documented the first evacuation flights as hundreds of residents from Kipnuk and Kwigilingok boarded Alaska National Guard flights from the National Guard Armory in Bethel to Anchorage. 
Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which oversees the Alaska National Guard said this was the largest off-the-road-system response for the National Guard in his 45-year career in the state.
Officials with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management put the process of repairs and debris clean up on pause for winter. The state’s disaster response effort  will pick up in the spring in coordination with federal agencies, regional tribal organizations, non-profits and local partners.. Both state and federal disaster assistance program application periods have been extended to February 2026, to allow more time for residents to apply for relief. 
The total cost of the storm damage is still unknown, and the Western Alaska region faces a long road to recovery. 

Gov. Dunleavy approved a request from the Trump administration to deploy 100 Alaska National Guard service members to Washington D.C in March of 2026.

Days prior to the announcement, lawmakers raised concerns about the Pentagon directive to the Alaska National Guard to prepare a quick response force for “civil disturbance operations” in American cities. 
Service members are directed to train for crowd control and to quell civil unrest. Officials with the Dunleavy administration said the Alaska National Guard is preparing such a force to align with national level requirements. 

Researchers with the University of Alaska Anchorage told lawmakers that policy to address crime should focus on violent crime, as the most recent data available shows that even though Alaska property crime was declining, violent crime rates remained “exceptionally” high.

According to 2023 data, the most recent year available, Alaska’s violent crime rate was 5.4 times the national rate, at 1,975.2 per 100,000 residents, dominated by aggravated assaults. That includes reported crimes, and actual prevalence of crime incidence is likely much higher, researchers said. 
“Alaska’s crime problem is really a violent crime problem,” Brad Myrstol, a professor with the UAA Justice Center at the University and director of the Alaska Justice Information Center told lawmakers in February. “If you want to understand crime in Alaska, you might want to look at violent crime first.”

The Dunleavy administration approved the transfer of 42 men arrested in other states by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement into Alaska’s correctional facilities. The men were detained at the Anchorage Correctional Complex for several weeks in June. 

Officials said the transfer was part of an ongoing agreement between the Alaska Department of Corrections and the U.S. Department of Justice, intended to alleviate overcrowding in the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington. The Alaska House Judiciary Committee held a fact-finding hearing where lawmakers and advocates raised concerns about the state’s agreement with federal law enforcement — and conditions within the Anchorage jail after reports of a pepper spray incident, use of criminal lockdown, and lack of access to medical care, attorneys, and translation services.

Advocates with the ACLU of Alaska reported that Alaska saw a significant increase in immigration arrests in Alaska this year. The organization tracked at least 70 arrests, a nearly 500% increase over last year. 

Officials grappled with the rising number of deaths in Alaska jails and prisons. The Alaska Department of Corrections reported a record-tying 18 deaths in custody this year. 

There have been at least 84 deaths in custody since 2020, which some lawmakers and advocates say is preventable. They are calling for the reinstatement of an independent oversight body to investigate deaths and provide recommendations for prevention. 
State corrections and medical officials testified to the Legislature in the spring that a higher number of deaths are attributed to natural causes within an aging prison population. Several incidents of alleged medical neglect and suicide in recent years prompted families to file wrongful death lawsuits against the department.

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, Lee Enterprises said in a news release Tuesday.
The agreement puts Hoffmann in line for chairperson of the board in place of longtime chairperson Mary Junck, who said the move will “create long-term value” for the company.
In Montana, Lee Enterprises owns the Billings Gazette, the Missoulian, the Helena Independent-Record, the Montana Standard, and the Ravalli Republic.
The company has been cutting newsrooms in the state for years. In spring 2023, Lee Enterprises eliminated at least 13 newsrooms positions in Montana representing one third to one half of existing editorial staff at its papers.
In 2024 in the span of three months, Lee newspapers in Montana lost 70 years worth of journalism experience when the company cut a managing editor and two veteran journalists chose to leave.
The news release from Lee Enterprises did not address whether the agreement came with a plan for investment in newsrooms, and in an email, a spokesperson for Lee said the company did not have further comment.
In a statement, Hoffmann said the deal strengthen’s the company’s balance sheet.
“With improved financial stability and a clear governance framework in place, the focus can now be on disciplined execution and long-term value creation,” Hoffmann said.
The deal was announced after Lee Enterprises canceled a special shareholder meeting set for Dec. 19 one day before it was scheduled.
The company was slated to review financing proposals in the face of financial challenges.
In November, Lee Enterprises reported a $36 million net loss for the 2025 fiscal year. It said a cyber attack earlier this year cost $4 million in restoration alone.
The new agreement is expected to save the company millions of dollars in interest payments.
It lowers the rate on $455.5 million of long-term debt from 9% to 5% for five years, “materially improving” the company’s “cash flow outlook,” according to Lee Enterprises.
The news release from Lee Enterprises said its board of directors unanimously approved the deal and “decisive action was required.”
A news story from a Lee reporter said the company found itself “without other options.”
The Quad City Business Journal described Hoffmann as “a renowed entrepreneur and philanthropist.” It said Hoffmann, as founder of Hoffmann Family of Companies, oversees a network of enterprises that employs more than 17,000 people around the world and includes properties in 30 countries.
In December 2024, Hoffmann declared an interest in becoming Lee’s largest shareholder. Hoffmann Media Group is a subsidiary of the Hoffmann Family of Companies.
“We believe in newspapers, local journalism, and digital media,” Hoffmann said in a statement at the time. “We have been and continue to be successful throughout the country with our media assets.
“I’m not going away, and we will continue to invest. We feel local journalism is a part of the fabric of America and will invest to protect it and help it prosper.”
The president of Lee Montana could not be reached Wednesday for comment; Dave Worstell is the outgoing president, retiring this year, and his out-of-office message directed emails to incoming head of Lee Montana Bill Merrill, who could not be reached by email on Wednesday morning.
According to the news release from Lee, CEO and President Kevin Mowbray is retiring as part of the deal. Chief Operating Officer Nathan Bekke is expected to serve as interim CEO, and a search is underway for a permanent CEO, according to the news release.

(Photo by Johner Images/Getty)The DeSantis administration said Wednesday it no longer will require some children to go uninsured for two months before enrolling them in the federal children’s health insurance program, or CHIP.
The Agency for Health Care Administration announced in the Florida Administrative Register that it was amending its CHIP State Plan to eliminate the 60-day waiting period for enrollment in Kidcare for children who previously were insured through an employer-sponsored or private health benefit plan.
The CHIP state plan represents Florida’s official agreement with the federal government laying out how the program will operate. The requirement that those children go uninsured for two months has been established in Florida law since the program was created in 1998 to prevent “crowd out.”
According to the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy Center for Children and Families, crowd out occurs when public funds substitute private dollars that otherwise would have been spent on health care.

There are nine exceptions to the crowd-out policy in Florida law that would allow those children not to have go uninsured for two months. Exceptions are made, for example, if:

The cost of participation in an employer-sponsored health benefit plan is greater than 5% of the family’s income;
The parent lost a job that provided an employer-sponsored health benefit plan for children;
The parent who had health benefits coverage for the child is deceased;
Domestic violence led to loss of coverage; or
The employer of the parent canceled health benefits coverage for children;

Wednesday’s announcement says the change in policy will bring the program in alignment with federal policy and will take effect Jan. 1.
Kidcare is Florida’s version of the federal state children’s health insurance program. It is an optional Medicaid expansion for children whose families earn too much to qualify for the traditional Medicaid program.
Congress authorized the federal children’s health insurance program in 1997 and agreed to pay states roughly 15 percentage points more than the traditional Medicaid match rate. The Florida Legislature created Kidcare a year later. The federal government pays about 69 cents of every dollar spent on the program in Florida today.
The DeSantis administration is willing to alter its policy for children who lose private coverage but the requirement that they be precluded from enrolling in Kidcare for two months remains in state law.
While it’s willing to ignore the statutory lock-out for previously insured children, the DeSantis administration claims a different section of the Kidcare law prevents it from abiding by another federal requirement: that eligible children remain enrolled in the program for 12 months even if the family misses a monthly premium.
The DeSantis administration filed a lawsuit against the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in federal court in Tampa over that mandate. The challenge has lingered with little activity.
Meanwhile, the DeSantis administration has dropped tens of thousands of children from the program for failure to pay premiums. The Florida Phoenix obtained a report that showed 43,000 children were disenrolled from Kidcare for nonpayment of premiums between Sept. 1, 2024, and Aug. 31, 2025.
Of those, 25,806 children were re-enrolled sometime during the 12 months after paying their premiums. Another 17,430 children were never re-enrolled and may have become uninsured.
The legal skirmish has prevented the state from implementing a 2023 Florida law (HB 121) that increased eligibility for the program by boosting the maximum qualifying family income from 200% to 300% of the federal poverty level. That’s the difference between earning $64,300 for a family of four versus $96,450.
In addition to eliminating the 60-day waiting period, the DeSantis administration also said it was amending the CHIP State Plan to continue certain Kidcare benefits for 30 days following release from the program.

Free.,"After Minnesota fraud allegations, HHS orders states to justify child care spending",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-minnesota-fraud-allegations-hhs-orders-states-justify-child-care-spending,,"WASHINGTON — States must now provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers in order to get those dollars, President Donald Trump’s administration announced. The Tuesday shift in policy came following allegations of fraud in Minnesota’s child care programs, which prompted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to freeze all child care payments to the state. HHS could not offer many specifics on how the review process will play out for other states, but clarified that the money in question is provided through the multibillion-dollar federal Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF. “States will be required to provide documentation, such as written justification, receipts, or photographic evidence, demonstrating that funds are supporting legitimate child care providers,” Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, said in a statement to States Newsroom on Wednesday. CCDF provides federal funding to states, territories and tribes to help low-income families obtain child care. The program, administered within the Office of Child Care under HHS’ Administration for Children and Families, combines funding from the Child Care and Development Block Grant, or CCDBG, and the Child Care Entitlement to States, or CCES. Funding for CCDF in fiscal year 2025 stood at roughly $12.3 billion — comprising $8.75 billion from CCDBG and $3.55 billion from CCES. Head Start — a separate program that provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families — does not appear to be affected. In a Tuesday social media post announcing the move, Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said he had “activated our defend the spend system for all ACF payments” and “starting today, all ACF payments across America will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.” He clarified in a separate post shortly after that “funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.” Funds undergo ‘regular audits’“Federal funding enables millions of parents in every state and Congressional district to access and afford quality child care,” Sarah Rittling, executive director of First Five Years Fund, a federal advocacy group, said in a Wednesday statement. Rittling added that “these funds are essential to the nation’s well-being, allowing parents to work while ensuring their children are cared for and safe.”   She also described the reports of potential fraud as “deeply concerning” and pointed out that “state oversight through regular audits is required by law to ensure that every dollar intended to protect and support young children is used properly and effectively.” “At the same time, we must ensure that nothing takes away from making sure funds for child care continue to reach the children and families who depend on them,” she said.",,,,2025-12-31 16:58:13.754305

Monday’s announcement that Wyoming will receive a large tranche of federal funds to implement rural health transformation initiatives is only the beginning.
The post $205M federal health grant kicks off flurry of policy work for Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Health care advocates are celebrating Monday’s announcement that Wyoming will be awarded $205 million in federal Rural Health Transformation Project funds in 2026. 
But the announcement is only step one in a process that will require drafting contracts, hiring staff, crafting bills and gaining legislative approval. State workers, contractors and healthcare providers will have to hustle to lay the groundwork for programs they hope will shore up health care for the long term. 
“There’s real potential for this money to meaningfully improve health care in Wyoming, I think, as long as the other pieces come together and our state works as a team to implement the varying aspects,” Wyoming Medical Society Executive Director Sheila Bush said. “We have a lot of work in front of us, but it’s exciting work.”
The state’s highly rural nature and large land area create steep challenges: Ambulance response times can be long, clinics struggle to hire and retain medical professionals and hospitals fighting to stay viable have shed services like labor and delivery. 
Even if the federal award doesn’t live up to its promise of “transforming” Wyoming’s health care system, it presents a huge opportunity for improvements, advocates say. 
Wyoming’s application sketches out what those improvements might look like. They incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to prop up the industry.
The opportunity 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The program will funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. It aims to offset a portion of the federal funds for health care that were cut by the same legislation.
The application process for states unfolded rapidly. In Wyoming, Department of Health staff held stakeholder conferences and 11 public meetings starting in September to gather input. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. The application was then drawn up and submitted by the Nov. 5 deadline.

“Our biggest challenge lies in access to basic medical care,” Wyoming’s 84-page application stated.  
It went on to identify the state’s priorities of building the state’s health care workforce, improving residents’ metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioral health and using technology to improve chronic disease management and bring care closer to home. Some of the initiatives proposed to address those priorities include:

Build cooperative agreements for EMS agencies to work together on a regional basis, using regional dispatch to coordinate things like interfacility transfers.
Establish a state-operated public insurance plan, dubbed “BearCare,” that would cover health care emergencies, such as car crashes or bear attacks, for dues-paying members. 
Fund, in perpetuity, annual awards to cover educational costs for individuals interested in joining one of four clinical pipelines: nursing, EMS, behavioral health and physician.
Implement the Presidential Fitness Test in Wyoming’s primary and secondary schools.
Limit the state’s SNAP benefits to healthy food purchases by excluding things like sodas and candy. 
Stand up a grant process for technology to improve care delivery closer to home or build systems that can work across providers.
Establish a system of investments that can generate revenue for health care programs in perpetuity.

Wyoming applied for an initial budget of $200 million. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Monday that all 50 states will receive awards in 2026 under the program. Texas claimed the biggest prize, $281 million, while New Jersey received the smallest at $147 million. Wyoming got $5 million more than it asked for.
“The State of Wyoming has a smart and targeted plan to address our unique healthcare challenges,” said U.S. Sen. John Barrasso. The Wyoming doctor and Republican Majority Whip has championed the Rural Transformation Fund as a sensible solution while railing against expansion of the Affordable Care Act subsidies that expired Wednesday, leaving thousands of Wyoming residents facing significant spikes in insurance premiums.
Work ahead 
Implementing the application’s ambitious vision will require more staff, organization, many hours of work and the collaboration of several parties. With almost 1,400 employees in four divisions, the Wyoming health department is a “superagency” that’s well-equipped to helm the challenge, the application states. Still, it anticipates hiring around 13 contractors to address the additional load. 
The agency’s first task is to revise its budget to incorporate the award amount, said Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs. 
Then, next week, the Joint Appropriations Committee, which holds the state’s purse strings, will consider draft legislation related to the Rural Health Transformation Program proposals. Based on the committee’s initial reaction to some of the application’s components, that could present challenges. 
When the committee discussed the application during a December meeting, several lawmakers frowned on the state-run catastrophic health insurance plan.
“I’m not inclined to want to compete in the private sector. I don’t think it’s the proper role of government to do so,” said Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette. Bear was also skeptical of the proposed investment fund’s ability to keep pace with ever-rising health costs and to remain effective.

Along with hiring staff and getting related bills passed by skeptical lawmakers, health department staff also need to issue requests for proposals for various initiatives and draw up the attending contracts. 
For providers interested in applying for the program initiatives, Fuchs said, those opportunities will likely come later in the spring. 
If states do not spend the initial tranche of money within a certain time frame, Fuchs said, the feds will claw it back and redistribute it. Since the program is designed to divvy out $50 billion over five years, Wyoming could receive close to $1 billion when it’s all said and done.  
‘A heavy lift’ 
Wyoming Hospital Association President Eric Boley’s organization has been involved and closely following the process.
“The workforce part of it holds a lot of promise for us as we look at the shortages we’re already facing and the projected shortages in our country coming up in the next decade,” Boley said. He is also encouraged by the technological improvements that could be realized, hopes emergency services can be stabilized and said struggling hospitals will jump at opportunities to help realize financial viability.
“It’s gonna be a heavy lift, but I think our folks are ready to sit down at the table and see how we can make it work,” he said. “The devil’s in the details now.”
Wyoming Primary Care Association Executive Director Jen Davis is “cautiously optimistic” about the massive grant. “The reason I say that is because it’s a great opportunity to really do some amazing things in Wyoming, but I think we need to be really intentional, and I think we really need to focus on infrastructure for long-term sustainability and not just put out money to put out money.”
That will likely involve some hard conversations, she said. “I hope that now that it’s been awarded, there’ll be opportunities for a lot more participation as we go forward and figuring out how that looks.”
The award opens doors to opportunities Wyoming has never been able to fully consider before, said Bush of the Wyoming Medical Association. “However, these opportunities will only become a reality if the state comes together to pursue a unified vision.”

The online educational materials for students in grades 3-12 were created by members of the four groups recognized as Abenaki by Vermont’s state government.

Leaders from four groups recognized as Abenaki by Vermont’s state government have created a new school curriculum about their communities’ history — but the material includes few references, they said, to two Abenaki nations centered in Quebec.
The distinction is notable because leaders of those Quebec-based nations continue to assert that many members of the groups in Vermont can’t claim legitimate Indigenous ancestry. Instead, the leaders from Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations say, members of the Vermont-based groups have been appropriating Abenaki identity and culture.
As the Quebec-based nations have made their case ever more forcefully in recent years, they’ve drawn sharp rebukes from leaders of the Vermont groups, who have moved to, as they tell it, defend their culture from attacks levied by former allies. 
Those groups, headquartered throughout Vermont, are the Elnu Abenaki, Nulhegan Abenaki, Koasek Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation and the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi. 
The new curriculum, announced earlier this month, is called the “American Abenaki Curriculum.” Its development was overseen by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs, which is a branch of state government tasked with advocating for the state-recognized groups. Some commissioners are also members of those groups. 
The educational materials include numerous digital resources and discussion topics for students in grades 3-12. Its central question, according to its website, is, “How have the Abenaki people survived and adapted to their environment for thousands of years?”
Odanak and Wôlinak’s tribal governments, in Canada, say they were wrongly excluded from the process of developing those materials. While the First Nations are headquartered north of Montreal, they have members in what they maintain is unceded territory in the northeastern U.S., including in Vermont.
The two nations’ governments issued a joint statement earlier this month assailing the American Abenaki Curriculum and calling it a “rewriting of history.”
“There is no such thing as ‘American Abenaki,’ as Abenaki identity and Ndakina — the ancestral homeland of the Abenaki people — predate colonial borders and cannot be redefined by modern administrative categories,” the nations’ press release said. 
“Presenting a curriculum in the name of a reconfigured identity to meet institutional imperatives amounts to trivializing the rewriting of history and normalizing cultural appropriation in public and educational spheres.”
Authors of the new curriculum said at a press conference Dec. 18 that they did not involve leaders from the Quebec-based nations because they were focused on history that is unique to the Vermont-recognized groups. The curriculum includes some of the same sources that the groups submitted to the state when applying for tribal recognition, the authors said.
The point of the curriculum is to focus “on the experiences of Vermonters,” said Dan Coutu, chair of the state Native American Affairs commission. Odanak and Wôlinak leaders “have their own voice,” he said, while the Vermont groups “have our voice.”
“They have their voice free to speak up, as they have. And now, it’s our turn,” Coutu added.
Vera Sheehan, a member of the Elnu group and one of the curriculum’s authors, said its website was largely complete but that more “bells and whistles” would be added in the coming months. The authors plan to create a printed version of the materials and launch a statewide outreach campaign to teachers, according to a press release from the Native American Affairs commission.
The press conference announcing the new curriculum turned contentious toward its end. After two reporters asked questions about the material, Denise Watso — an Odanak citizen who lives in Albany, New York, and said she was attending “as an observer” on behalf of the First Nation’s government — stood up and lambasted the curriculum as misleading. 
At that point, several people began speaking at the same time. Two other people then stood up and criticized the presentation, saying that it was wrong for Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations not to be consulted. Watso was escorted out of the room by a security guard.
The rollout of the curriculum is likely to spur at least some discussion in the Vermont Statehouse, too, after legislators return for a new session in January. That’s because Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, plans to introduce a bill that could, if passed, prevent the material as it’s been written from being used in schools.
Headrick’s legislation would require consultation with — and an endorsement from — Odanak and Wôlinak on any curriculum about Indigenous history before that material was used in any Vermont school, according to a draft of the bill.
“We’ve given these state-identified groups a foothold through the state recognition process,” Headrick said in an interview. “And they’re exploiting that foothold in a pretty significant way — taking control of the narrative in ways that completely erase any narrative provided by the Abenaki at Odanak and Wôlinak.”
Headrick said his bill has two additional sponsors, one Democratic and one Republican, though it’s not clear the proposal will have a clear path forward this session.

Headrick introduced a separate bill at the start of the 2025 legislative session, which ended this past June, that would create a task force to reexamine the state’s past tribal recognition decisions, among other points. The bill, H.362, got only a brief introductory hearing this year and did not see any substantive committee discussion time.
Conor Kennedy, chief of staff to Democratic House Speaker Jill Krowinski, said on Tuesday that he was not sure yet whether Headrick’s legislation would see more committee attention in the upcoming legislative session.
At the same time, the curriculum’s release comes as Odanak and Wôlinak leaders have made earnest appeals in Vermont this fall, including to state legislators, for the past tribal recognitions to be reconsidered. 
In October, the nations published a lengthy report that used public records to examine about 15 generations of ancestry for five prominent members of Vermont’s recognized groups, including Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan group; Brenda Gagne, chief of the ​​Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi; and Shirly Hook, chief of the Koasek group. 
The report also examined the heritage of some members of groups that claim Abenaki descent in New Hampshire, but that are not recognized by that state’s government. It concluded that all of the people studied were nearly 100% European.
Genealogical research for the report was conducted by Darryl Leroux, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa who has previously published research concluding that many members of Vermont’s state-recognized tribes have no ancestral ties to historic Abenaki communities. 
In a column published last month, Stevens, Gagne and Hook blasted the report and its findings as “junk science, compiled with bias and full of factual and interpretive errors.”
Odanak’s tribal government has emailed a link to the report to every state legislator in Vermont and New Hampshire, according to Suzie O’Bomsawin, the government’s assistant general manager.
Earlier this month, meanwhile, the First Nations launched a campaign on some of Vermont’s major television stations — ABC22, FOX44, WCAX and Vermont Public — which makes the case that the state-recognized tribes are not legitimate Indigenous communities. The campaign is set to air for a year, according to a press release. 
“It is essential that everyone understand the reality of our identity,” said Jacques Watso, one of Odanak First Nation’s tribal councilors, in the release. “We will continue this work with consistency and determination. The truth cannot be ignored.”

The Utah Transit Authority is offering to help cover the cost of Uber or Lyft rides for those who miss the last train or bus on New Year’s Eve.  
The agency announced on its website that it will pay up to $25 for Lyft or Uber rides for stranded drivers from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., “while supplies last.” 
Those looking to get a discounted ride home during the three-hour timeframe should call the UTA ReConnect program at 801-RIDE-UTA (801-743-3882) or check the agency’s transit app for a Lyft or Uber code. 
For Utahns seeking wheelchair-accessible vehicles, UTA police said they will help arrange transportation from Yellow Cab Utah for those who call (801) 287-3937. 
The Utah Department of Public Safety is also offering $10 Lyft credits to encourage people to plan sober rides home. The credits are accessible through a QR code on the department’s website. 
Alcohol-related deaths made up nearly 1 in 5 traffic fatalities from 2020 to 2024, according to the agency. It also said law enforcement agencies throughout the state have scheduled 300 extra DUI enforcement shifts from December 10 through New Year’s Day.
In 2018, Utah became the first state in the nation to lower its blood alcohol content limit for drivers from 0.08% to 0.05.

Now, he has exercised that constitutional authority again, this time to free Taylor’s twin brother Maurice. 
On Dec. 31, Reeves signed Executive Order 1591, directing the Mississippi Department of Corrections to release Maurice Taylor within five days. 
“A couple of weeks ago, my office was contacted for the first time by Maurice Taylor’s post-conviction counsel and provided a copy of Mr. Taylor’s indictment, plea petition, sentencing order, transcript of the sentencing hearing and other documents from the Circuit Court file,” Reeves posted on his X account Wednesday. “These documents confirm that, like his brother, Maurice Taylor received a sentence more than three times longer than allowed under Mississippi law.” 
In February 2015, Maurice Taylor pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to sell a controlled substance, an offense that carries a maximum sentence of five years. However, the Choctaw County Circuit Court in its judgment sentenced him to 20 years in MDOC custody with five suspended, a sentence 10 years longer than the maximum for his offense. 
According to court papers, the sentencing judgment misidentified the offense as business burglary and imposed an illegal sentence. In 2016, the trial court entered a corrected judgment identifying the proper offense but failed to correct the sentence.
Reeves’ executive order notes that Taylor began serving his sentence on March 6, 2014, meaning that he has, to date, served more than 11 years for an offense that carried a maximum sentence of five, thus constituting a “miscarriage of justice.”
“When justice is denied to even one Mississippian, it is denied to us all,” Reeves said.
Similarly, Marcus Taylor, who was indicted with his brother, was convicted in 2015 for a drug sale charge that was meant to have a five-year maximum sentence. Instead, he received 15 years. 
But unlike his brother, the Mississippi Court of Appeals voted 8-2 to release him. The attorney general’s office asked the court to vacate its decision after Reeves’ granted the 43-year-old clemency.

But fear not, we’ve assembled this year-end compilation to pry the cobwebs from your random-access memory. 
What follows is a collection of Louisiana political news you’ve simply forgotten or just don’t care to remember.
January
Some 290 employees at the University of New Orleans learned they would be furloughed through midyear to start 2025, and another 30 were laid off at the end of the month. Nearly every staff member making more than $30,000 annually was required to take unpaid time off during each two-week pay period. Lower-paid staff had to take a day and a half of unpaid time off per pay period, while the highest paid took three days off every two workweeks. UNO leaders also combined some posts, placing deans in charge of multiple colleges to eliminate administrative positions.   
The family-owned company once run by President Donald Trump’s campaign co-chair in Louisiana agreed to pay $1.025 million to resolve allegations that it hired workers ineligible to work in the United States.Bollinger Shipyard of Lockport was accused of violating the False Claims Act for knowingly billing the U.S. Coast Guard for the labor the illegal workers performed. The company’s settlement with the federal government is not an admission of guilt but effectively brought the matter to a close. 
Federal authorities released the findings of an investigation that revealed a pattern of unlawful conduct within the Louisiana State Police, including troopers’ use of excessive force, lack of accountability and other problems in “every corner of the state.” The U.S. Department of Justice review was prompted by the May 2019 killing of Ronald Greene, a 49-year-old Black man, in police custody. He was beaten while handcuffed and shackled face down on the side of a highway, pleading with the troopers and a local deputy following a vehicle pursuit near Monroe.
A Baton Rouge-area grand jury indicted a New York physician and a Louisiana mother on felony charges for allegedly providing an illegal abortion with drugs obtained through the mail. It’s the first criminal case of its kind in the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion  in 2022, which triggered Louisiana’s strict abortion ban. Attorney General Liz Murrill’s efforts to extradite Dr. Margaret Carpenter from New York to face criminal consequences in Louisiana have run into that state’s shield laws.
February   
State tax Judge Cade Cole automatically became the newest member of the Louisiana Supreme Court after being the only candidate to sign up for an election to fill the court’s open seat. He represents District 3, which stretches from Calcasieu Parish to Caddo Parish.
The Louisiana State Civil Service Commission denied a request from Gov. Jeff Landry to remove protected status from 900 positions in state government. Many of the jobs under the proposal were within the Department of Transportation and Development, though it would not have affected any current employees.With the Legislature’s backing, the governor would later take steps to reorganize the transportation department and create a new entity under his office with the goal of expediting prioritized infrastructure projects.
Louisiana utility regulators sanctioned one of their colleagues after he called the governor an “a–hole” on social media. In a 3-2 vote along party lines, the Louisiana Public Service Commission removed Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, as vice chair of the panel and installed Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, R-Metairie, in his place. 
LSU marked more than 1,300 of its webpages for review because they include the terms “diversity,” “equity,  “inclusion” and “DEI.” The scrutiny came in response to guidance from the Trump administration after his threats to revoke federal funding from campuses that use race-conscious practices in admissions, programming, training, hiring, scholarships and other aspects of student life.

March
Following the lead of the White House, the governor signed an executive order that directed state agencies to change all references to the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana laws and other documents to the “Gulf of America.”
Jessie Hoffman was put to death at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, becoming the first person in the state executed using nitrogen gas. It also marked the first time Louisiana carried out the death penalty in 15 years.A second condemned man who was scheduled for execution the next day, 81-year-old Christopher Sepulvado, died in February.
Landry declared a state of emergency to immediately address system outages at the state Office of Motor Vehicles that caused crippling delays in processing drivers’ licenses, vehicle titles and registration services. 
In a stunning rejection of the governor’s agenda, Louisiana voters turned down all four of his constitutional amendments, including his plan to overhaul the state’s tax and budget laws.  Nearly two-thirds of voters rejected all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s time as governor.
April
A Plaquemines Parish jury ruled Chevron must pay the local government more than $740 million, blaming the company for decades of damage to its wetlands. The ruling is the first among several lawsuits from coastal parishes in Louisiana that want the oil and gas industry to compensate them for carving up swamps and marshland with canals. Local officials contend the vast work related to energy exploration and pipelines has gradually exacerbated the natural depletion of coastal areas.The case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, where a precedent could be set for several other parishes pursuing similar damages from fossil fuel corporations.  
Gov. Landry hired Bruce Greenstein as Louisiana Department of Health secretary, returning him to the role he held under former Gov. Bobby Jindal from 2010-13. During that earlier stint, Greenstein was charged with lying to a state grand jury under oath to oversee billions of dollars of spending. He was forced out of the job after Jindal discovered the federal government was investigating Greenstein’s role in the award of a nearly $200 million state Medicaid contract to Greenstein’s previous employer. The federal government did not bring charges against Greenstein, and he was never convicted on state charges. 
The University of Louisiana Lafayette shut down its Office of Campus Inclusion. The closure was done “in compliance with a federal directive,” according to an email sent to university employees. 
A judge set aside the first-degree murder conviction and death sentence of Jimmie Duncan, whose 1998 conviction in Ouachita Parish for killing his girlfriend’s 23-month-old daughter was based in part on bite mark evidence that experts now say is junk science.

May
Aurelia Giacometto, the embattled secretary of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, made her exit from the agency. The governor appointed Courtney Burdette to fill the vacancy. Giacometto’s departure followed a year of tumult that began with high-ranking LDEQ executives resigning and publicly airing their complaints about her alleged harassment of subordinates. It was also brought to light that Giacometto used public money to travel to out-of-state political events with no obvious connection to her position in state government. 
LSU President William Tate was named the next leader of Rutgers University in New Jersey, becoming the most notable in a string of abrupt, high-profile departures from Louisiana’s flagship public university.  
After outcry from several corners of the legal community, Louisiana lawmakers scuttled a controversial proposal Attorney General Liz Murrill backed that could have moved thousands of criminal cases involving children and teenagers from juvenile to adult courts every year. The Louisiana Senate Finance Committee voted 6-5 to reject legislation that would have mostly affected Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes, where juvenile courts operate separately from district courts. The decision came a few weeks after state voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar constitutional amendment. 
Republicans in the Louisiana Senate overwhelmingly rejected a bill to allow people convicted by non-unanimous juries before 2018 to petition for their cases to be reviewed. The proposal failed on a 9-26 vote despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, who’s long campaigned on a tough-on-crime platform.
A proposal to end the addition of fluoride to public drinking water in Louisiana failed in the legislature following passionate testimony from health care and dental professionals.
June
Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a set of dramatic changes to state ethics laws that will make it much more difficult to charge elected officials and public employees with misconduct. One measure alters the process the state ethics board used to bring charges against Landry two years ago that are still pending and won’t be affected by the legislation. The governor’s personal attorney, Stephen Gelé, helped craft the language contained in it.
Beyond making it harder to bring ethics charges, the legislation also loosens limits on elected officials’ and state employees’ in-state travel, weakens restrictions on government contracts with public servants and their families, and reduces requirements for elected officials and political candidates’ disclosure of financial interests.
The legislature overwhelmingly approved a $53 billion budget without funding for Landry’s signature, private education voucher initiative, one that he initially celebrated with much fanfare. Legislative leaders, especially in the Senate, had said for the past year that they weren’t going to fund the LA GATOR program.
The eight-week legislative session ended with lawmakers backing the less stringent of two measures aimed at regulating pharmacy benefit managers, the “middlemen” operations that oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers.  Landry threatened to bring lawmakers back to Baton Rouge for a special session to lower prescription drug prices but opted not to follow through. 
A federal appeals court blocked a Louisiana law that requires public K-12 schools, colleges and universities to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom. A three-judge panel from the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional because it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another. The full 5th Circuit is scheduled to reconsider the panel ruling in January. Attorney General Liz Murrill has said she would take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed.
July
While standing on the deck of a friend’s yacht in Bermuda, Landry praised a new Louisiana tax break on boat purchases in a short video he shared to social media. What the governor didn’t mention is the tax break, which took effect July 1, only applies to boats worth $200,000 or more.
The governor renamed the state’s largest National Guard training site after a little-known early 19th century Louisiana militia member and slaveowner, the father of the Confederate general whose name the facility originally carried. Landry announced the renaming of Camp Beauregard in Pineville  with a social media post that included a seemingly AI-generated image of a headstone that reads “Wokeism.” 
Rebecca Harris, a veteran state employee, was tapped to lead Louisiana’s child welfare agency, replacing David Matlock, the former juvenile judge who held the role for the first 18 months of the Landry administration.
A proclamation from President Trump allowed 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 with sites in Louisiana, to ignore new federal rules meant to contain harmful emissions.

August
Landry declared a state emergency to address what he said was lack of capacity to house violent offenders at Louisiana State Penitentiary. The proclamation allowed state officials to expedite repairs at Camp J, a section of the Angola prison shut down eight years earlier for security reasons. It would be reopened in September to house detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
District maps for seats in the Louisiana Legislature violate the federal Voting Rights Act, a panel of judges on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. Their decision upholds a lower court ruling that found the boundaries discriminated against Black voters.The 5th Circuit has since put the case in a holding pattern while the U.S. Supreme Court considers Louisiana v. Callais, which challenges the state’s second Black-majority district in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Later in August, Attorney General Murrill filed a brief in the Callais case that argues a key provision of the Voting Rights Act violates the U.S. Constitution. If justices agree, it could limit the extent race can be considered in the redistricting process nationwide. 
State utility regulators approved a plan to install three natural-gas fueled power plants for the tech company Meta, which needs the electricity for a massive data center it’s building in Northeast Louisiana. Shaving two months off its usual approval process, the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted 4-1 to advance the unprecedented project from Entergy Louisiana to supply a massive amount of power for a single customer. 
New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell made history, becoming the city’s first mayor to be indicted while in office, after federal prosecutors charged her with multiple counts of wire fraud, obstruction of justice and lying to a grand jury. Cantrell, who leaves office in January, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
September
The Louisiana Board of Ethics dropped formal charges against Gov. Landry for failing to disclose flights he took on a political donor’s private plane when he was attorney general. In return, Landry agreed to admit publicly to other instances in which he failed to disclose free travel he accepted from business groups and political contributors.The board also fined the governor $900, though Landry could have faced tens of thousands of dollars of penalties for failing to disclose the gifts. 
Planned Parenthood clinics in Baton Rouge and New Orleans were among those that closed or had to scramble for funding to stay open at the end of September after the Trump administration blocked Medicaid funding for certain reproductive health organizations.
The Landry administration has failed to provide oversight of public money given to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers as required by state law, according to a report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office. 
Attorney General Murrill issued an arrest warrant for a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Louisiana woman  — the latest legal volley in an ongoing fight between states with abortion bans and those that have enacted protections for abortion providers who use telemedicine to send abortion medication over state lines.  
October
Attorney General Murrill filed a lawsuit that calls on the federal government to strike down rules that allow the distribution of abortion drugs without an in-person doctor’s visit. It’s her latest attempt to place restrictions on out-of-state shipments of mifepristone, a medication used to terminate pregnancies but that also has other life-saving and gynecological uses.
New Orleans Councilwoman at-large Helena Moreno scored a resounding win in the city’s mayoral primary election, securing 55% of the vote, above the simple majority she needed to clinch the job without a runoff election.
A Cameron Parish judge ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal. The decision found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility. In November, the state agency reissued its approval with a new set of reasons for its endorsement, leading to a lawsuit from environmentalists. 
Gov. Landry summoned the Louisiana Legislature for a three-week special session to address the 2026 election calendar with hopes of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the state’s challenge of its current U.S. House districts. While the qualifying schedule was pushed back one week for next year’s congressional midterms, justices have not issued a ruling on a timeline that would give state lawmakers enough time to redraw the districts.
November
The LSU Board of Supervisors named Wade Rousse its next system president and picked University of Alabama Provost Jim Dalton as chancellor of its Baton Rouge campus. The dual hires mark the first time the university will have separate system and main campus leaders since the roles were merged in 2012. 
Clay Schexnayder, former speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives, was charged with felony theft in connection with a missing piece of historic cypress that had been on display at the State Capitol and was last seen at his legislative office in Gonzales. Schexnayder denies knowing of the relic’s whereabouts.
Calvin Duncan, who was wrongfully convicted of murder 40 years ago and sentenced to life in prison, was elected clerk of Orleans Parish Criminal Court, handily defeating an established incumbent. The campaign saw Attorney General Murrill challenge Duncan’s claim that he had been exonerated. Court records confirm Duncan’s conviction was vacated in 2021.
Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, who rolled back government vaccine distribution as the state’s top public health official, was appointed by President Trump to the second highest position at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Southern University System took steps to move on from its current leader, Dennis Shields, who has been president and main campus chancellor since 2022.

December
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System Board of Supervisors voted to name state Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson as its next system leader. Nelson will replace current President Monty Sullivan, who is retiring after serving in the position since 2014. Nelson will officially take office Jan. 1. 
A federal immigration enforcement campaign began in earnest in Louisiana, the latest area of focus for the Trump administration’s sweeps, detentions and deportations.  Operation Catahoula Crunch began with agents fanning out from their New Orleans base into suburban areas to apprehend day laborers outside home improvement stores and workers at restaurants and construction sites.
The Landry administration abruptly ended contracts with two of the six companies that provide Medicaid insurance in Louisiana, only to reverse course on its deal with Aetna and offer a three-month extension to UnitedHealthcare. UnitedHealthcare has opted to pull its business from Louisiana once its extension lapses March 31, meaning some 330,000 people will need to move to new Medicaid plans.
The Louisiana Supreme Court refused the state attorney general’s request to return a convicted killer to death row, though it doesn’t necessarily derail Liz Murrill’s plans to challenge a U.S. Supreme Court precedent that declared executing minors was unconstitutional.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Lewis and Clark County District Court judge has suspended Hamilton Sen. Jason Ellsworth from public office as the court considers charges that he engaged in official misconduct by procuring a $170,000 contract for a friend and business associate in his final days as Senate president.
Judge Kathy Seeley issued the order earlier this month, writing “the Court finds probable cause to believe the Defendant has committed the alleged criminal offense.”
Ellsworth could not be reached for comment by phone or text this week, but a lawyer who has represented him in the past said Ellsworth will challenge the order.
Lawyer Joan Mell she found it “very surprising” Seeley would grant the order “without a hearing and any fact-finding.”
The Montana Attorney General’s Office submitted the request for suspension, along with its charging documents, after a months-long investigation.
Ellsworth’s actions late last year were first reported by the Montana State News Bureau in the early days of the 2025 legislative session and became a dominant narrative throughout lawmakers’ time in Helena.
Ellsworth was originally investigated by the Legislative Auditor in a waste, fraud and abuse hotline case that found Ellsworth abused his power and wasted state resources. The auditor referred the investigation to the DOJ in February.
A separate investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee led to a full-chamber vote stripping Ellsworth of nearly all his responsibilities and privileges of office, making the court-ordered suspension mostly a formality.
Mell, Ellsworth’s civil attorney who represented him throughout the Ethics Committee investigation but is not his criminal attorney in the current case, told the Daily Montanan in a phone call that the information in the charging documents “is just highly suspect and just wrong.”
“He is definitely going to challenge the order on a variety of grounds, not the least which is legislative immunity and separation of powers problems,” Mell said.
According to court documents, Ellsworth is scheduled for an initial appearance on Jan. 6.

A $1.8 billion winning Powerball ticket was sold at an Arkansas gas station, the second largest Powerball winning in the game's history. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)It’s the biggest mystery to hit the central Arkansas town of Cabot, not to mention the rest of the state: Who purchased the winning $1.8 billion Powerball ticket?
Locals speculate on who the big winner of last week’s jackpot is, and whether there’s a new billionaire in their midst. Area charities are hopeful it’s a donor who’s willing to share the wealth.
“If I go into a local grocery store, if I go into anywhere in town, someone asks me about it,” House Speaker Brian Evans of Cabot said “Typically, it’s, ‘hey Brian, hey were you the winner?’”
Evans is quick to point out that he wasn’t.
A spokesperson for the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery said as of Wednesday morning a winner of the Powerball jackpot hadn’t stepped forward, and thanks to a nearly five-year-old state law their identity may remain a secret for a while longer. 
Arkansas is one of several states that allow some form of anonymity for lottery winners, and supporters of such secrecy say the Powerball jackpot poses the type of security risks they were hoping to address.
The 2021 Arkansas law allows lottery winners of more than $500,000 to remain confidential for three years. For elected officials and their immediate family who win, that anonymity is limited to six months.
Former state Sen. Larry Teague said he didn’t imagine a jackpot of this magnitude when he sponsored the legislation. But Teague said he wanted to give larger lottery winners a chance to get their affairs in order before their names were publicized around the state or country.
“There are a lot of things you’d have to do to protect yourself,” Teague said. “I wanted to make it where they would have time to work through what they needed to.”
Whoever won last week will have a lot to work through. The $1.8 billion winning ticket was the largest in Arkansas’ history and the second largest in the history of the multistate Powerball game. The winner will have the choice between an annuitized prize of more than $1.8 billion or a lump sum payment of nearly $835 million. Both amounts are before taxes.
The secrecy measure had its critics. Press groups opposed it for expanding the government records that were exempt from being disclosed to the public. Opponents also said that keeping that information confidential could hamper efforts to market the state’s lottery.
“In order to sell tickets, you have to publicize the winners,” then-Sen. Keith Ingram said during floor debate on the measure.
Evans and Sen. Ricky Hill, whose district also includes Cabot, both voted for the anonymity measure in 2021.
“The biggest issue is privacy, with people coming out of the blue saying they’re your cousin,” Hill said.
Local residents are for now left to wonder who bought the winning ticket. The Murphy USA gas station where the ticket was purchased sits in front of a Walmart Supercenter, and it’s uncertain whether the winner is from Cabot, one of the surrounding communities or someone who was just passing through.

This would be Mississippi's fifth data center project.,"Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, has purchased a new building in Southaven to boost its computing power. 
This is the tech company’s latest expansion into Mississippi. The property at 2400 Stateline Road is a short drive from xAI’s natural gas power plant that the company bought in July 2025. The former Duke Power plant will power xAI’s two data centers across the state line in Memphis. 
According to property records, MZX Tech, an LLC associated with xAI, purchased the property on Dec. 23.
“xAI has bought a third building called MACROHADRR,” Elon Musk wrote on Tuesday in a tweet on X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk added that the building would expand the company’s computing power to almost 2 gigawatts. 
The company has not said what it plans for the warehouse. However, The Information, a tech publication, reported that the building will be used as a data center.
If true, this would bring the total number of data center projects in Mississippi to five. 
xAI’s power plant already faces community pushback. Residents of Southaven have raised concerns about noise levels and environmental concerns. A petition by a local group, Safe and Sound Coalition, calls for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the city to end all xAI operations. It has over 700 signatures.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — One thing is certain about 2026: Politicians will make a lot of promises about cutting South Carolina taxes.
How much will be cut? And which tax?
Don’t believe candidates for the Governor’s Mansion (in either party) who pledge that they will eliminate state income taxes — no matter how loudly or how often they say it. For starters, the South Carolina governor doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally change tax policy. Period. That is entirely up to the 170-member Legislature.
Sen. Sean Bennett, who a year ago was considering a bid for governor, calls those campaign promises “pie in the sky.”
“They sound good, particularly in election years on the stump: ‘Let’s just eliminate our income tax,'” said the Summerville Republican.
The financial planner calculates the move would require at least doubling the state’s 6% sales tax: “I wish we wouldn’t waste time chasing that shiny lure.”
He is hopeful, however, about traction on the type of sweeping changes to the state tax code he’s advocated for years.
Legislation that further cuts state income taxes is in the Senate’s court, after passing the House by a vote of 68-46 in May during the last week of the 2025 legislative session.
What Congress did two months later provided a boost to state House GOP leadership’s arguments, though probably not in the way you’d think.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which President Donald Trump signed July 4, is expected to reduce state income taxes by $515.4 million in the fiscal year starting July 1, according to a recent analysis by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. The state’s revenue forecasters expect the federal law to further reduce collections by $244 million in 2027-28 and $251 million in 2028-29, when some of its major provisions — such as no taxes on tips or overtime — will phase out, leaving tax impacts beyond that a mystery.
But there’s a giant “if” in those predictions. The reductions will occur if the Legislature adopts the federal tax code changes.
That’s what the General Assembly normally does: South Carolina is among just a handful of states to tax “federal taxable income.”
The argument for decoupling
But a major reason that House Republicans gave last session in pushing their tax restructuring plan was to decouple South Carolina’s income tax code from the federal system.
House GOP leaders recently told the SC Daily Gazette they believe the Trump-signed tax law — and state forecasters’ analysis of its impact to state tax collections — increase the need for South Carolina to untether and do its own thing.
“It shows what happens when we give away the tax-making authority of the General Assembly to Washington,” said Rep. Brandon Newton of Lancaster, chairman of House Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, which advanced the bill he co-sponsored.
“We can’t be at the mercy of whatever D.C. does, whether it’s President Trump or President AOC,” he continued, referring to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, while stressing, “even though I agree with the changes made by President Trump.”
More importantly for the bill’s chances, the Senate’s budget chief agrees.
“We want to decouple from the feds,” said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney. “South Carolina doesn’t need to depend on Congress.”
Bennett, who chairs two of Senate Finance’s regular subcommittees, believes the “Big Beautiful Bill” not only strengthens the case that state tax collections should not be “dependent on the whims of the federal government,” it highlights the need for a total overhaul.
“Let us decouple and put together a South Carolina-focused, South Carolina-centric tax policy that supports our budget,” he said.
For him, that means making changes to the entire tax structure, not just further chipping away at income taxes. And for the first time in his 13 years in the Senate, he said, he senses a real possibility of that happening.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said the debate should include finding a way to reduce property taxes. Those are the taxes he gets the most complaints about, he said, even though they’re collected by counties, not the state, to fund local government services and schools.
“I’m all for a further reduction in income taxes,” said the Edgefield Republican. However, “I don’t have any constituents telling me we should eliminate income taxes.”
Changing appearances
The bill passed by the House would reduce income tax collections overall by $400.3 million in year one.
House GOP advances new plan that initially cuts SC income taxes by $400M

That would not, however, benefit all taxpayers immediately. Whether you would pay less in the proposal’s first year depends on your income and how you file: 42% of filers would see a cut, 24% would owe more, while 33% would see no change whatsoever, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
That’s an improvement from the bill as originally filed, which Republicans announced with much fanfare in the Statehouse lobby before the state’s fiscal experts could dissect it — an odd, cart-before-the-horse move. After their analysis showed the bill would actually increase taxes for nearly 60% of filers, the public backlash prompted a rewrite.
The amended bill collapses the state’s three tax rates into two, instead of moving to a single flat tax rate immediately, while promising to get there through a multi-year phase-in.
House GOP leaders point to the 2022 law that cut income taxes by more than $1 billion as proof that will happen sooner than later. That phase-in was expected to take five years. Instead, it was completed by the budget that took effect July 1.
That law passed unanimously in both chambers. Opposition to the current House GOP plan comes from two directions: The hardline House Freedom Caucus insists on the immediate elimination of state income taxes — which, by the way, still make up more than 40% of the state’s general fund revenue. Democrats argue it’s unnecessary and potentially harmful to the state’s fiscal health.
As I wrote back in April about the original bill, the push wasn’t really about cutting taxes — at least, not in year one. It’s about removing what the House’s chief budget writer, Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, calls the state’s “glaring black eye”: a tax structure that seems to be the highest in the Southeast, even though it’s not.
Even with completion of the 2022 law, the state’s top marginal income tax rate is 6%. That appears uncompetitive to our neighbors and beyond. Politicians like to point to that 6% rate when they tell voters that South Carolinians pay the highest taxes in the region. That claim is malarkey.
Because South Carolina taxes “federal taxable income,” rather than adjusted gross income as most states do, South Carolinians start their state tax forms with less income to tax, compared to what they’d file if they lived across the state border.
Their effective tax rate — what people actually pay — is comparatively low. Roughly 45% of tax filers actually pay no state income taxes at all.
Republicans want a “fair and flat” tax code that makes South Carolina stand out as a low-tax state, rather than appear the opposite. But numbers can be deceiving. That’s why the original proposal that brought the tax rate to a flat 3.99% in one fell swoop actually increased most people’s taxes.
If the Legislature adopts the tax code changes in the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” the overall cut to state income taxes would be bigger in the coming fiscal year: $515 million compared to the House GOP plan’s $400 million.
But the state’s tax rate would still appear out of whack.
“We’d still have the sticker shock problem,” Bannister told the Gazette.
“We need to get the rate down,” he said. “If we cut $500 million, we ought to do it in a way that lets us celebrate a historic tax rate decrease, not just that we’re following the feds.”
The House GOP plan would further put in state law the goal of someday, eventually eliminating state income taxes.
Just conforming to the federal code would make it “almost impossible” to also pass a bill restructuring state taxes, Bannister said.
The next move will be decided in Peeler’s committee after the Legislature returns Jan. 13.
The House bill, said the Gaffney Republican, is “heading in the right direction.”
Peeler said he wants to make sure whatever the Senate passes is an actual tax cut — a not-so-veiled swipe at the original House plan.
And, further emphasizing that the Senate will pass something, he repeated a line he’s known to make: “You can’t out-cut Harvey Peeler.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/income-tax-newser-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 15:56:58.768344

The Administrative Procedures Act ensures government accountability by making agencies transparent, require public participation, setting fair rulemaking standards, and allowing courts to review actions for legality and rationality.”Thompson found that Noem did not sufficiently review country conditions or provide a minimum six-month winding-down period leading to the end of temporary legal status, a practice that the agency has followed for decades.“Taken together, the Court finds that the Secretary improperly narrowed the scope of her review of the conditions of the countries at issue in this litigation before making her termination decision,” Thompson said. “The Secretary’s narrowing was based on an erroneous reading of the TPS statute and history of DHS practice.” A country receives a TPS designation if it meets certain conditions, such as a major natural disaster, violence, or some other instability that makes a country too dangerous for its citizens’ return. About 52,000 TPS recipients hail from Honduras, more than 7,100 are nationals from Nepal and nearly 3,000 TPS holders are from Nicaragua. The judge also denied the Department of Justice’s motion to dismiss the case. “Our laws should not favor the loud and powerful simply because of their positions. Yet, for too long, our laws have overlooked the quiet truths—truths carried in the margins, truths lived but never spoken aloud,” Thompson said.“It is the duty of every public servant entrusted with shaping a more just society to bring those truths into the open, to translate lived experience into written protection. It means hearing the faintest whisper of injustice and refusing to let it fade. It means honoring the people who call this country home but have never been invited to speak in it. It means finally ensuring that the law speaks for them,” she continued.DHS did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.All three country designations were set to expire by September, but in July, Thompson halted the terminations. In late August, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the TPS terminations to continue, meaning that work authorizations for those recipients expired.  Separately, another judge in Boston, Massachusetts temporarily halted the TPS termination for more than 200 nationals from South Sudan on Tuesday, also finding a move by Noem is likely unlawful. TPS for South Sudan is set to expire Jan. 6. This year, the Trump administration has aggressively moved to revoke the legal status of TPS recipients, and those with some other form of humanitarian legal status. So far, about 1 million immigrants under TPS, along with another half a million, have lost their status.",,,,2025-12-31 14:58:15.602295

President Donald Trump on Tuesday vetoed HR 504, federal legislation intended to provide flood protection to Osceola Camp, a Miccosukee residential area in the Everglades. In his veto letter, the president blamed the tribe for having “actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”
‘Dragging its feet’: ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ appeal paused due to government shutdown

“My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country,” Trump wrote. 
The tribe is part of a lawsuit against the state, claiming planners behind the immigration detention facility, also dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility. 
Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Republican from Miami, sponsored the bill, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, passed by both chambers of Congress via voice votes. 
The bill called upon the Secretary of the Interior and the tribe “to take appropriate actions to safeguard structures within the Osceola Camp from flooding events.”
The Osceola Camp in the Everglades is a residential area for the Miccosukee tribe but not part of the federally reserved area for the tribe.
The bill, introduced nearly a year ago, four days before Trump’s second term began, also would’ve expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include the Osceola Camp.
Gimenez’s office said the bill would help with “strengthening the Tribe’s governance and enhancing infrastructure within the community.”
“This bipartisan legislation ensures that the Miccosukee tribe has the legal authority to manage, protect, and preserve their land, and continue their traditional way of life,” Gimenez said on the House floor in July, going on to say the bill “is about fairness and conservation.”

“Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts and restoring fiscal sanity is vital to economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation. This principle carries especially heavy weight here; it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy,” Trump wrote. 
The bill does not have a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate. 
At the same time, Trump announced he had vetoed HR 131, Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That measure, sponsored by Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, addressed federal support for a water pipeline in Colorado.
Colorado Newsline, a Phoenix affiliate, reported:
“Trump’s veto, the first of his second term, was roundly criticized by Colorado Democrats as another act of retaliation against the state for its ongoing incarceration of former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted on state charges related to breaking into the county’s voting machines to prove unfounded claims of widespread election fraud in 2020.

Sensory exercises like this are often used in special education classrooms. (Getty Images)From significant actions in the long-running Yazzie/Martinez educational equity lawsuit to upheavals in federal funding priorities, New Mexico public school staff, administrators and students faced a variety of challenges in 2025.
On the home front, New Mexico’s landmark educational equity lawsuit returned to court in the spring, when the court ordered the New Mexico Public Education Department to complete a remedial plan to address the needs and outcomes of at-risk students. In September, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the state would be the first in the country to offer universal free child care by Nov. 1.
At the national level, President Donald Trump’s efforts to reduce diversity, equity and inclusion programs resulted in federal funding delays and cancellations to states, including New Mexico, for various educational efforts and research at higher education institutions. The federal government’s Oct. 1 to Nov. 12 shutdown this year also threatened Head Start programs across the state with closing or losing their federal grant funding.

Parties returned to court in the spring after plaintiffs in the case claimed the state had not made enough progress toward improving opportunities and support for Native students, English language learners, students from low-income families and students with disabilities. The court agreed and ordered the PED to develop a remedial action plan.

The final draft of the plan was recently submitted to the court for review. However, plaintiffs, represented by New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, and educational advocates quickly criticized the plan through the development phase as being “too vague.” 
Parties in the case now have time to submit formal objections and responses to the plan before First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson makes a determination whether the PED’s remedial plan complies with his order. Wilson recently granted the plaintiff’s motion for more time to submit their response, pushing the deadline to February. 
A spokesperson for Transform Education New Mexico, a coalition of educational advocacy organizations, told Source New Mexico in a written statement that while the PED took “initial steps” this year toward including the voices of stakeholders, the department’s plan “still falls short of what students need and what the court requires.”
“It’s clear that the central challenge remains how to turn legal mandates into meaningful, lasting change for New Mexico students,” TENM Communications Director Meryl Chee said. “The opportunity now is to make partnership structural rather than symbolic—ensuring that students, families, educators, and communities closest to the classroom are shaping strategy, implementation, and accountability, not just offering feedback.”
Chee added that the coalition’s hope for 2026 is “deeper collaboration and concrete actions” that move the state toward fulfilling the court’s rulings in the lawsuit.
New Mexico announces universal child care

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, alongside Early Childhood Education and Care Department Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky, announced in September that the state would become the first in the U.S. to offer universal free child care before the end of the year, a gambit that quickly drew national attention
 ECECD was tasked with changing the rules to remove the income eligibility threshold for child care assistance, which previously waived copays for parents whose income was up to 400% of the federal poverty level.
New Mexico governor announces free universal child care

The rule change is intended to expand access to child care, allow parents to maintain their jobs, increase child care worker pay and strengthen the economy. However, capacity issues may hamper the progress toward achieving universal free child care. Experts pointed out in October that there may not be enough child care centers to care for the children the program intends to assist, and there are too few available spots. And such issues could be worse in more rural areas of the state.
Lori Martinez, executive director of the educational advocacy organization Ngage New Mexico, told Source in a written statement that she believes the state must prioritize child care assistance for families most in need and create a “solid” plan for recruitment and retention of quality workforce to make the universal program sustainable. 
“Starting with funding and implementation of the Wage and Career Ladder, which was a requirement in the legislation that created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019,” Martinez said. 
She added that early childhood educators should be recognized, and adequately compensated, for their role in supporting “the health and well-being” of New Mexico communities. “High quality child care is early childhood education, and contributes to school readiness as well as economic growth and quality of life in our communities,” Martinez said.

Changes in federal funding, federal government shut down impact programs

Federal upheaval touched most sectors of New Mexico, including education at all levels. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take steps to shut down the Department of Education. Not long after, the department ordered state education leaders to certify their compliance with a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion practices or risk lost funding. These announcements led to uncertainty among state education departments and school districts regarding what funding would be released, when it might be released and whether it would be released at all.
Research universities in New Mexico have also been hard hit by federal fund freezes and reductions. A report provided to state lawmakers in mid-November noted that the state’s research facilities face up to $95 million in lost federal funding.
While the Trump administration’s actions have been challenged and, often, refuted in the courts, efforts to dismantle the federal department remain ongoing. The Trump administration has also withheld funding throughout the year, including $6.8 billion last summer for K-12 programs (some of which was subsequently released). 
Changes to federal funding, social programs mean more uncertainty for NM public education

Uncertainty over federal funding came to a head in October when federal lawmakers failed to pass a budget, resulting in a month-and-a-half-long government shutdown. Head Start, a federally funded program that offers early childhood educational opportunities and support for low-income families, was one program the Trump Administration was already considering ending. 
As the government shutdown extended, concerns over operational funding and keeping Head Start programs running in New Mexico ramped up. And even after the shutdown ended, New Mexico’s congressional delegation demanded the U.S. Health and Human Services Department release grant reimbursements for New Mexico programs, including three tribal programs.
NM delegation calls for feds to release Head Start money

Nonetheless, state leaders remain resolute. ECECD Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky told Source in a written statement that her department is focusing on “strengthening and expanding” New Mexico’s early childhood system in 2026 as well as supporting career advancements and wage scales for people working in the field; and getting more families and community leaders involved in their efforts to support providers, families and children.
“Our state funding is strong, our partnerships are solid, and our commitment is unwavering,” Groginsky said. “ECECD will keep working to ensure every New Mexican family has access to the high-quality early care and education opportunities they want and deserve.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-31 14:11:43.084285

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) James Bruton grew up in rural Texas where the night skies were full of constellations. 
As he moved to larger cities, before ultimately settling in Des Moines, evening star gazing faded away for Bruton and could only be found with intentional trips away from the light-polluted metropolitans. 
Bruton hopes rural Iowa can keep that sense of wilderness, lower its electricity costs, help out local wildlife and even benefit from the growing astrotourism market, by enacting “dark sky” ordinances that limit light pollution. 
While the effort in Iowa is just getting off the ground, across the globe, nearly 200,000 square kilometers, or more than 77,000 square miles, are recognized as dark sky places by the international, volunteer organization, Dark Sky International. 
The open spaces of the west and national parks are the spots most people think of for prime stargazing, but Bruton said Iowa can develop its own dark sky areas and give people that same sense of wonder, but without a 10-hour drive. 
“Most of our days are spent looking at screens … being able to step away from that and truly just take in something as magnificent as a clear, dark night sky and everything that it beholds, it just creates (a) perspective that we don’t get when we live in so much light pollution,” Bruton said.

Dark sky doesn’t mean lack of visibility 
“It’s not about turning off the lights,” Bruton said. “It’s just about using light wisely so that communities can thrive.” 
A 2023 published study, analyzing citizen science observations, found that on average the night sky got brighter by 9.6% annually, from 2011 to 2022. 
According to the National Park Service the light pollution increase “exceed(s) the population growth rate” and has been caused by more light emitted per capita and more “uplight” or light that is directed or reflected upwards, emitted from fixtures. 
Dark Sky International recommends communities be more intentional with their outdoor lighting, in terms of brightness, direction, purpose and warmth. 
The organization has five principles for “responsible” lighting, which Bruton said would inform dark sky ordinances in a community. 
Dark Sky calls for lights that have a “clear purpose” and are only used when needed. 
It says light should also be “targeted” so that it doesn’t spill beyond where it is needed. Targeted lights could be something like street or parking lot lights that have a cover over the top to direct light down on the street and not up into the sky. 
The third principle is that lights should be “no brighter than necessary” with the idea that when something is excessively lit, it causes glare on surrounding surfaces and can be less effective than a dimmer light. 
An ordinance could specify, for example, that outdoor light fixtures not exceed 25% of guidelines set by the Illuminating Engineering Society, a technical and educational authority on lighting.
The fourth principle asks for controlled lights, those on a motion censor, timer or dimmer so that light is only used when it’s needed.  
These principles help to reduce energy costs by eliminating unnecessary lights.
The final principle calls for warm colored lights – below 3000 Kelvin –  because they are less disruptive to wildlife and don’t travel as far into the sky, according to Dark Sky International. 
A city could add an ordinance with guidelines on where cool colored lights are allowed, like in a public safety setting or a sports arena, to adhere to this principle. 
“An ordinance – it’s about protecting what we have,” Bruton said.
He said dark sky ordinances shouldn’t be prohibitive to new businesses or economic development and can actually make a community appear “more forward thinking.” 
Potential benefits of dark sky initiatives
Rural areas have fewer lights to manage, but they aren’t the only targets for dark sky initiatives. In fact, Flagstaff, Arizona, was the first city recognized as an “International Dark Sky Place” by the organization. In the past two decades, other urban areas like Breckenridge, Colorado, Moab, Utah and several suburbs of Chicago have earned dark sky designations of their own.
Recently, Thousand Hills State Park in Kirksville, Missouri, was named an Urban Night Sky Place, one of just 12 in the world. 
Listen for more about Thousand Hills’ journey to dark skies:
Bruton believes a dark sky designation could be a “boon” for rural Iowa towns. 
Modeling in a 2019 published study found that dark skies would generate additional $5.8 billion from non-local tourists that visited the Colorado plateau over a 10 year span. 
“We’re not Colorado, we don’t have the landscape, that they may have … but it’s still really beautiful here in Iowa,” Bruton said. “There aren’t (many) protected dark night skies in the Midwest, and I believe that we have the potential here in Iowa to help preserve our dark skies.” 
Astrotourism, or the cross of astronomy and tourism, relies on dark sky places. Bruton said this could make a small rural town a destination during an astrological event like an aurora borealis, meteor shower or eclipse. 
It is estimated that millions of people traveled to the path of totality in 2024 to view the total solar eclipse, AirBnb’s in the path were booked solid and an entire festivals cropped up for the astronomical event. While the eclipse was historic, Bruton said it seems like astrotourism is growing. 
Beyond a potential camera and telescope-wielding tourist market, Bruton said a dark sky can help to protect the “rural heritage” of a community and sense of community pride.
While some states and communities create their own Dark Sky nonprofits to advocate for reducing light pollution, Bruton said he hopes to partner with an existing wildlife or conservation nonprofit that is interested in the cause. 
“There’s no downside, there’s truly just a lack of awareness right now,” Bruton said. “I think that as people become more aware of this and recognize how easy it is and how simple it can be, that we can get people on board.”

(Andrew Fraieli for Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump vetoed a bill on Tuesday that would have given Colorado towns more time to pay back federal loans for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline project that will provide more clean water to southeastern Colorado.
The bill was sponsored by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd. Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper introduced a version in the Senate. It passed by a voice vote in the House of Representatives in July and passed unanimously in the Senate earlier this month.
“H.R. 131 would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it,” Trump wrote in his veto message.

Trump’s veto, the first of his second term, was roundly criticized by Colorado Democrats as another act of retaliation against the state for its ongoing incarceration of former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted on state charges related to breaking into the county’s voting machines to prove unfounded claims of widespread election fraud in 2020. The veto followed the administration’s announcement earlier this month that it would dismantle Boulder’s National Center for Atmospheric Research, and its denial of two disaster declaration requests that would have opened up federal funding to support wildfire and flood recovery in the state.
The 130-mile Arkansas Valley Conduit broke ground in 2023 and is set to eventually bring water from the Pueblo Reservoir to 50,000 Coloradans who live east of town. The bill would have extended the repayment period for local municipalities and removed interest payments.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it would have cost the federal government less than half a million dollars. In his veto message, Trump wrote that he was committed to ending the “massive cost of taxpayer handouts.”
In a social media post, Hurd said he was disappointed by the veto and argued that further delay of the project risks “stranding taxpayer dollars.”
“In southeastern Colorado, water infrastructure isn’t a luxury — it’s essential,” he wrote. “I will continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.”
Boebert also said she would continue advocating for the project in a statement to 9News, which first reported the veto.
“President Trump decided to veto a completely non-controversial, bipartisan bill that passed both the House and Senate unanimously,” Boebert said. “If this administration wants to make its legacy blocking projects that deliver water to rural Americans; that’s on them.”
In another statement on social media, Bennet categorized the veto as “payback because Colorado won’t bend to his corruption.” Trump earlier this year threatened “harsh measures” if the state didn’t move to release Peters, who is serving a nine-year prison sentence. Boebert also recently voted to release the Epstein files against Trump’s wishes.

Here are some unique ways people celebrate New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day in different countries around the world:
NYC Ball Drop (courtesy Balldrop.com)

United States (New York City & elsewhere): Millions gather in Times Square to watch the famous ball drop at midnight, followed by confetti, fireworks, and performances.  We count down from ten and celebrate with a kiss – a custom rooted in old English and German folklore.  Long ago, people believed the first person they encountered in the New Year would set the tone for the year ahead.  Over time, that evolved into choosing to share that moment with someone whose presence you want carried into the coming year.

Australia (Sydney): One of the first major cities to welcome the new year with a spectacular fireworks display over Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.
Italy: People wear red underwear for luck and love, eat lentils (symbolizing coins for prosperity), and sometimes throw furniture and old items out windows to let go of the past and make space for the new year.
Greece: On New Year’s morning, a pomegranate is smashed against the front door – the more seeds that scatter, the more abundance and good luck for the household in the coming year.

Spain’s 12 Grapes Tradition (courtesy indianexpress.com)

Spain: At midnight, people eat 12 grapes—one for each stroke of the clock—to bring good luck for each month of the coming year.
Scotland: Celebrations known as Hogmanay include street parties, bonfires, torchlight processions, and “first-footing”—being the first guest to enter a home after midnight, often bringing symbolic gifts like whiskey or shortbread for good luck.

Denmark: Revelers smash old plates against friends’ doors to ward off bad spirits and jump off chairs at midnight to “leap” into the new year.
Germany: Watching the classic British sketch “Dinner for One” on TV, eating pork for prosperity and enjoying fireworks.
Brazil: Many head to beaches (like Copacabana in Rio) dressed in white for peace, jump over seven waves while making wishes, and offer flowers to the sea goddess Yemanjá.

Ecuador: Effigies (año viejo) representing the old year are burned at midnight to symbolize letting go of the past and starting fresh.
Columbia: Many wear brand-new yellow underwear and run around the house with a suitcase to invite luck and travel.
Japan: Temples ring bells 108 times (Joya no Kane) to cleanse the sins of the past year; families eat long toshikoshi soba noodles for longevity and enjoy a quiet, reflective transition into the new year.
Philippines: Displaying and eating 12 round fruits for prosperity in each month, and people wear polka dots or make loud noises with fireworks to drive away evil spirits.
Russia: It’s customary to write a wish for the coming year, burn it, mix the ashes into champagne, and drink it before the clock strikes midnight. Families gather for a festive meal, watch the President’s speech and enjoy fireworks.  Ded Moroz (Grandfather Frost) delivers gifts, with major displays in places like Red Square in Moscow.
Puerto Rico: Before celebrations, they clean their homes and throw dirty water out of windows to rid themselves of negative energy.

These traditions blend fireworks, food symbolism, and rituals for luck, reflecting cultural hopes for prosperity, love, health, good fortune, and renewal.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NYC-Balldrop-Image.jpg,,,2025-12-31 12:57:45.498462

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed former University of Florida and Jacksonville Jaguars football coach Urban Meyer to the New College of Florida Board of Trustees.
The 61-year-old grew up in Ohio and made a name for himself in the Sunshine State, winning two national championships (2006 and 2008) with UF and more than 80% of the games he coached there, including 22 games in a row.
Lately, Meyer can be seen on TV as an analyst for FOX Sports.
He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame this year.
Meyer holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees and previously served as assistant athletic director at The Ohio State University, where he also won a national championship as a coach.
His less-than-a-year stint with the Jaguars was not as illustrious as his time in Gainesville. Meyer was fired before the end of the first season after winning two of the 13 games he coached for Jacksonville.
Meyer’s appointment was announced Tuesday, when DeSantis also reappointed Mark Bauerlein, editor of First Things Magazine, and Debra Jenks, an attorney, to the New College board. Jenks is a New College alum.
The appointments are subject to Florida Senate approval.
DeSantis is shaping New College into a more conservative institution, although the campus has also captured the eye of the Board of Governors for its spending habits. In 2023, DeSantis appointed six new members to the board. At the time, the United Faculty of Florida president called the new trustees “extremist ideologues.”
FAU
Also Tuesday, DeSantis reappointed chair Piero Bussani, an attorney, and Linda Stoch to the Florida Atlantic University Board of Trustees.
Thomas Mersch, an attorney, was newly appointed to the FAU board, too.

DeSantis appointed Chad Mizelle, former chief of staff to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and a University of Florida alum, to the University of South Florida Board of Trustees.
The governor reappointed Mike Carrere, a retired CEO of Lykes Brothers Inc; Rogan Donelly, CEO of Tervis Tumbler Co.; and Lauran Monbarren, a former administrator at Pasco-Hernando State College, daughter to Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, and CFO of his private agribusiness operation, to the board too.

Christie Bassett, an education consultant and 2015 Florida teacher of the year; Jeffrey Beelaert, an attorney from Boise, Idaho, and former U.S. associate attorney general; and Jack Harrell, CEO of Harrel’s LLC and chair of the Florida Poly Foundation, rounded out the governor’s pre-New Year’s Eve appointments.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-31 17:11:36+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Massachusetts pushes offshore wind contract negotiations into 2026,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/massachusetts-pushes-offshore-wind-contract-negotiations-into-2026/,The negotiations had been set to wrap up by the end of the year after a deal wasn’t clinched six months ago but are now extended through June 2026 and appear likely to be frozen for most of if not all of President Trump’s term.,"2025 IS ENDING much the way it started for offshore wind in Massachusetts: on delay. 
Gov. Maura Healey’s administration announced contract negotiations between the state’s electric utilities and two offshore wind developers have yet again been delayed due to upheaval in Washington. 
The negotiations had been set to wrap up by the end of the year after a deal wasn’t clinched six months ago but are now extended through June 2026 and appear likely to be frozen for most of if not all of President Trump’s term. 
The delay is just the latest to hit Massachusetts since the state selected three projects in September 2024. Vineyard Wind has started delivering power to the grid — the lone wind project in the state to do so — but other projects have not yet moved forward.  
That includes the two from this 2024 procurement — from developers Ocean Winds and Avangrid — after state regulators allowed offshore wind contracts to be terminated as hostile economic conditions roiled the industry. 
Avangrid and Ocean Winds didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
“Massachusetts remains committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, which includes offshore wind,” Lauren Diggin, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy Resources, said in a statement. “The uncertainty created by the changing federal landscape continues to be a challenge as the utilities and developers work to memorialize the bids in contracts.” 
The Republican trifecta in Washington has gutted federal support for offshore wind, halting already-approved projects and ending new federal leases. That has forced some Bay State officials to rethink Massachusetts’s ambitious clean energy goals and the timeline with which they can realistically be achieved. 
The Healey administration backed an effort to delay a statutory offshore wind procurement requirement of 5,600 megawatts from 2027 to 2029. And last month lawmakers considered weakening climate commitments to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels in response to cost concerns at home and disruption from Washington. 
Even before Trump retook office, though, offshore wind appeared on shaky footing despite a groundswell of support within the state. The developer for Vineyard Wind 2 withdrew the project, and tax incentives designed to spur an offshore wind manufacturing supply chain in Massachusetts have gone unclaimed for two straight years. 
How the state plans to increase energy supply to meet growing demand while meeting climate targets and addressing the affordability concerns sweeping the state is still an open question. Massachusetts will likely see an influx of hydropower starting early next year as the long-delayed New England Clean Energy Connect project bringing electricity from Quebec into the region is finalized. 
But with offshore wind stalled, Healey has turned to focus on expanding solar supply, thrown support behind nuclear and natural gas, and even explored importing wind from Canada — a complicated and likely expensive endeavor.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image0032-edited-3.webp?fit=642%2C482&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-31 12:13:20.221053

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in November a proposal to implement more exceptions for businesses to report the levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as forever chemicals.
“This data is necessary for EPA to evaluate and manage the risks associated with PFAS exposure and to prevent harm to human health and the environment,” the attorneys general representing 15 states wrote in a Dec. 22 comment letter. “EPA fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its sudden reversal and ignores the substantial body of reliable scientific research showing the importance of collecting this data.”
PFAS have been used in consumer products since the 1940s — including clothing, non-stick cookware, food packaging, car seats, and strollers.
The chemicals have been known to cause harms such as the increased risk of kidney, breast, pancreas, prostate, and testicular cancers as well as liver damage, high cholesterol and infertility.
“North Carolinians should be able to get straightforward information about how much and what kinds of PFAS are in the products we buy,” Jackson said in a Tuesday statement. “The EPA shouldn’t be helping companies hide what kinds of toxic chemicals they’re using. We know what PFAS damage looks like in North Carolina, and we need these companies to be more responsible.”
Jackson’s office has filed lawsuits against DuPont and Chemours, two chemical companies, for their role in PFAS contamination to natural resources and drinking water in the Cape Fear River Basin and its communities.
The EPA claims the proposed change would reduce duplicity and make reporting more straightforward for businesses.
“This Biden-era rule would have imposed crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1 billion in implementation costs on American businesses,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “Today’s proposal is grounded in commonsense and the law, allowing us to collect the information we need to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.

Homegrown comedy, The Conspiracists, blends satire, sibling drama, and First State talent in a rare Wilmington premiere
WILMINGTON — Delaware is not just the setting for the new independent comedy The Conspiracists — it is the backbone of the entire production.
Set to make its world premiere on January 8, 2026, at Wilmington’s historic Grand Opera House, The Conspiracists is one of the most Delaware-centric feature films released in years. The movie opens to U.S. audiences the following day, January 9.
Directed by Michael Perrie Jr., the 92-minute film blends sharp satire with character-driven comedy, using modern conspiracy culture as a jumping-off point for a story rooted in family, ambition, and unintended consequences.
The Plot: When Satire Gets Uncomfortably Real
At the center of The Conspiracists are two siblings determined to host an inclusive, welcoming conspiracy theory convention — a space meant to be humorous, open-minded, and community-focused.
Almost immediately, the plan begins to unravel.
As eccentric attendees arrive, egos clash, and logistics spiral out of control, one sibling becomes increasingly desperate to keep the convention alive. Meanwhile, the other stumbles upon something far more unsettling: a genuine conspiracy quietly unfolding behind the scenes of the very event meant to mock conspiracy culture.
The result is a fast-moving comedy that blurs the line between absurdity and reality, mixing sibling tension, cultural satire, and escalating chaos.
“It starts from a place that feels ridiculous,” said executive producer Christopher Bruce, “but then it asks the audience to look a little closer. The film isn’t about making fun of people — it’s about what happens when good intentions, fear, and ego collide.”
Bruce said the film’s emotional core was what drew him to the project.
“There’s a lot of comedy here, but there’s also something very human underneath it,” he said. “It’s about siblings trying to prove themselves, trying to be heard, and realizing they might be in over their heads.”
Delaware on Screen — As Itself
What truly sets The Conspiracists apart is how fully it embraces Delaware.
According to the production team, 12 of the film’s 13 shooting locations were in the First State. Rather than disguising Wilmington as another city, the film allows Delaware locations to play themselves on screen.  Featured locations include:


Hotel du Pont, which provides an elegant backdrop for key convention scenes


The Grand Opera House, which appears in the film and hosts the world premiere


Captain Blue Hen Comics


Siegel Jewish Community Center


Delaware Tire Center


Precious Paws


“We didn’t want Delaware to feel like a backdrop pretending to be somewhere else,” Bruce said. “Delaware is part of the story. You see it, you feel it, and if you know Wilmington, you’ll recognize it.”
Built by Delaware Talent
Behind the scenes, Delaware creatives were central to nearly every aspect of production.
The film was anchored at King Creative, the Wilmington-based studio that served as the operational hub for the project. Bruce, King Creative’s co-founder, served as executive producer and housed production operations at the studio’s Market Street location.
Working with an estimated $185,000 budget, the team relied heavily on local crews, Delaware film incentives, community partnerships, crowdfunding, and private investment.
“This movie was built here — by local talent, local crews, and local businesses,” Bruce said. “It proves that feature films don’t have to leave Delaware to get made.”
Delaware Faces on Screen
The ensemble cast includes Terrie Lynne, Christopher Murray, Carly Otte, Valarie Perez-Schere, Brian Ray, Noah Berry, Guy Wellman, and John Jezior — many of whom are familiar faces within Delaware’s independent film and theater communities.
Several cast members have appeared in previous Wilmington-shot projects and King Creative productions, reinforcing the film’s deep local roots.
A Rare Hometown Premiere
The red-carpet world premiere at the Grand Opera House marks a significant cultural moment for Wilmington. Feature films rarely debut in Delaware — and even fewer premiere in the same city where they were largely made.
For Bruce, the location was non-negotiable.
“Premiering this movie in Wilmington isn’t just symbolic,” he said. “It’s the right way to thank the community that made it possible.”
Why It Matters
The Conspiracists arrives as Delaware’s creative and film communities continue to gain momentum. The movie stands as a case study in what’s possible when local talent, infrastructure, and storytelling align.
For audiences, it’s a timely, funny, and character-driven comedy.For Delaware, it’s something more enduring: proof that the First State can tell its own stories — on its own terms — and put them on the big screen.

With the latest round of certifications, the secretary of state’s office has now cleared nine initiative petitions to advance toward the 2026 statewide ballot, encompassing proposals to expand public access to records held by the Legislature and governor, restructure legislative stipends, allow collective bargaining for employees of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, and impose a new cap on annual state revenue growth with excess funds returned to taxpayers. Petitions needed to file 74,574 certified signatures this fall to proceed in the process.
The office certified 89,013 signatures for an initiative petition backed by Auditor Diana DiZoglio that would subject most records held by the Legislature and the governor’s office to the Massachusetts public records law. 
The office certified 96,797 signatures for an initiative petition seeking to overhaul the Legislature’s stipend system. The group backing the petition, the Legislative Effectiveness and Accountability Partnership, says legislative leadership use stipends to deliver $5 million to favored legislators, and calls the money “loyalty pay” intended to bind lawmakers to the wishes of leadership. Meanwhile, top Beacon Hill leaders say stipends reflect leadership responsibilities and allow lawmakers to think “about this job as a potential career.”
The ballot measure that would permit employees of the Committee for Public Counsel Services to collectively bargain had 86,153 signatures certified. The campaign backing the proposal is a partnership between SEIU and the National Association of Government Employees.
The office also certified 85,588 signatures for a ballot initiative that would change the limit on how much revenue the state can collect in a given year. The proposal would limit state revenue each year to the net amount of state revenue from the year before, increased by a rate equal to the average growth of wages and salaries in Massachusetts over the most recent three years, according to a summary from the Attorney General’s Office. If revenue collected by the state in a given year exceeds that limit, the excess amount would be refunded to taxpayers the following year.
There are two proposed ballot measures remaining that have yet to be certified: one that would steer sales tax revenue from sporting goods like golf clubs, RVs and camping gear into a new “Nature for All Fund” that could generate $100 million annually for water and nature conservation and restoration efforts; and another measure aimed at making it easier for residents to purchase a home by updating zoning rules.
The office has a January 7, 2026 deadline to process the remaining two proposed ballot measures and transmit them to the Legislature. After that deadline, the Legislature will have until May 5 to consider the proposals and act on them.
If the Legislature does not pass the measure as filed by then, a petitioner must then collect 12,429 more signatures and file them with local election officials for certification by June 17. After enough signatures are filed, the measure is then placed on the ballot for the 2026 statewide general election.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-01_all_party_primary_rally_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-31 11:14:25.310131

Laura Kelly against Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach.,"A dispute about the state's role in federal court litigation pits Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly against Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach. (Photos by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly and Attorney General Kris Kobach filed scorched-earth briefs outlining their disagreement on who possessed authority to advance federal litigation on behalf of the state of Kansas.
The ruckus headed to the Kansas Supreme Court was framed by Kelly and Kobach as a question of law involving interpretation of constitutional mandate and statutory power. Kobach and Kelly inflamed their feud by filing lawsuits against each other.
The turf war prompted a brief from the Kansas Legislative Coordinating Council, which is a committee of the Legislature’s top Republican and Democratic leaders, as well as one on behalf of Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab, state Treasurer Steven Johnson and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt.
This political clash between the Democratic governor and Republican attorney general is scheduled for oral argument before the state Supreme Court on Jan. 16.
Justin Whitten, chief counsel to Kelly, and Stephen McAllister, an attorney for the governor, said in a brief filed two days before Christmas that Kelly didn’t seek to control the attorney general, who the governor recognized held substantial common law power in Kansas. However, Kelly’s attorneys maintained the governor had authority as the state’s “supreme executive” to have her voice heard in federal litigation deemed to be in the interest of Kansans.
Whitten said Kansas court precedent affirmed the governor and the Legislature could direct the attorney general to join litigation, and the attorney general could refuse only if the request was unethical.
“She is not seeking to be the sole voice or the gatekeeper. She wants her voice, the voice which the Kansas Constitution bestows on her for the benefit of Kansas,” Whitten said. “She is not claiming the attorney general must always do her bidding, nor any other statewide elected official. They remain free to perform their duties as they see fit. But they cannot interfere with or prevent the governor from doing the same. Just because the attorney general stands down does not mean the governor lacks the authority to stand up for Kansas.”
Whitten said neither Kansas law nor history supported “the attorney general’s kingly gatekeeper theory.” If the attorney general prevailed, he said, Kobach’s sole control of the state’s litigation interests would result in unchecked power.
“The Kansas Constitution creates neither queens nor kings,” he said. “Quite the contrary, it purposely distributes power among numerous entities and officials.”
In the past, Kelly requested Kobach join multistate lawsuits challenging federal government actions, but the attorney general refused. Kelly was in favor of lawsuits against the administration of President Donald Trump related to federal funding of education, public health and food security.
Kelly sought to block disclosure to federal officials the personal information on Kansans who received aid under SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Whitten expressed frustration with Kobach’s claim that he alone should harness power to decide what federal lawsuits were worthy of the state’s backing. He noted Kobach had in the past attached Kansas to more than a dozen controversial lawsuits challenging President Joe Biden.
“The attorney general seeks to have his cake and eat it,” Whitten said. “He has exploited and touted his ability to bring and join partisan-motivated lawsuits to challenge federal laws he does not like. But when the governor seeks to join a challenge to federal laws that will harm tens of thousands of Kansans, he balks because the lawsuits are ‘meritless.’ ”
He said the attorney general’s attempt to reserve to himself the power to divine the state’s interests was a “guise for the attorney general to pursue his own partisan and political interests.”
 
Breathtaking theory
Kobach and Anthony Powell, who serves as the state solicitor general under Kobach, shared authorship of a brief declaring Kansas law granted the attorney general control of decisions to sue on behalf of the state in federal court.
Powell said Kelly’s role as governor was limited to asking the attorney general to appear on behalf of the state. Kansas statute couldn’t deliver to Kelly the “litigation authority she desperately wants,” he said.
“Governor Kelly brazenly asks this (state Supreme) Court to ignore the structure of the Kansas Constitution, the common law, 16 decades of Kansas history and this court’s many precedents to argue that she can control or supplant the attorney general in his exclusive legal representation of the state,” Powell said.
Powell said Kelly’s “breathtaking theory — that the governor somehow has ultimate control over any executive branch officer and their duties — is precisely the model of a unitary executive. Her theory is radical and wrong, both historically and legally.”
Powell said Kelly’s claim that supreme executive power entitled her to direct the attorney general to bring federal lawsuits ignored plain language of the state Constitution. Framers chose not to make the Kansas attorney general an appointed official subject to a governor’s direct control, he said.
“Their deliberate choice created independence and checks-and-balances within the executive branch,” Powell said. “The attorney general’s independent role in representing the state in litigation is a purposeful diffusion of authority that helps ensure electoral accountability.”
Powell said Kelly was asking the state Supreme Court to “obliterate that equilibrium based on her assertion that her election was effectively a coronation, giving her supremacy over any other executive branch officer.”
The potential of the governor and attorney general standing on opposing sides of a federal court case would provoke confusion, Powell said.
“If the governor can sue on behalf of the state, can the attorney general then appear and dismiss the case, or vice versa?” he said.

In mid-December, attorneys Edward Greim and Matthew Mueller filed a legal brief with the state Supreme Court on behalf of the Legislative Coordinating Council.
“This case is no mere executive-branch turf war,” Greim said. “True, all that need be resolved is whether federal litigation on behalf of the state is ultimately controlled by the attorney general or governor — or by some awkward mix of both.”
He said state statute resolved the issue in favor of the Republican attorney general. Kelly’s argument was tied to her perspective of supreme executive power, he said, but acceptance of her theory would require reversal of decades of state court precedent.
For Kelly to prevail on the question of federal litigation, he said, the state Supreme Court would have to allow redistribution to the governor the Legislature’s power to engage in lawmaking.
“It would pull into the governor’s powerful embrace all law enforcement and litigation functions, necessarily including district attorneys and local prosecutions. It would apply, too, to the Legislature’s longstanding apportionment of executive powers among other constitutional officers. The governor would reign supreme,” Greim said.
Brant Laue, a Topeka attorney who prepared the brief submitted by the elected insurance commissioner, secretary of state and state treasurer, echoed arguments shared by the LCC and Kobach.
He said the state Constitution and Kansas law guaranteed an executive branch structure that was fractured among separately elected state officials.
“The governor of Kansas is not imbued with King-like executive powers over all matters they deem to be under their executive control,” he said. “The governor’s contrary arguments in this case must surely give pause to the state’s other executive officials: Will the governor’s next contention be that she can overrule the actions of the commissioner on matters of insurance or securities? Or perhaps she can supplant the role of the elected State Board of Education on matters of public education?”
“The answer to all of these alarming potential assertions of gubernatorial authority has to be a resounding “no,” but the governor’s positions in this case cast doubt on whether she would be so restrained in her assertion of power,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KellyKobach251230-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-31 11:14:25.310131

In November, the Iowa Dental Board charged Robert Bruce Cochrane of Fort Dodge with unlawfully possessing or attempting to obtain controlled substances.
According to the board, Cochrane had scheduled a procedure on a patient and asked her to bring to the appointment the medications he had prescribed for her. “It was alleged that certain pills were not returned to the patient at the end of the appointment,” the board claims. “Upon the patient indicating that she was missing pills from her prescription, they were located by (Cochrane) and ultimately returned to the patient.”
The board has not publicly disclosed when or where the alleged actions took place.
As part of a recent settlement agreement with the board, Cochrane has admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to surrender his license.
Cochrane has a lengthy disciplinary history with the board dating back 30 years.
Board records indicate that in 1995, Cochrane admitted diverting controlled substances from his dental practice for his own daily use, in part by over-prescribing drugs for patients and then keeping some of their drugs for himself. At the time, the board also cited what it later called “evidence of substance abuse, including physical symptoms and mistakes when treating patients.”
The board ordered Cochrane to undergo a substance abuse evaluation, suspended his prescribing authority for controlled substances and placed his license on probation. A year later, in 1996, Cochrane entered into a consent order with the board in which he agreed to abstain from the use of all nonprescribed controlled substances.
In 1997, Cochrane allegedly tested positive for nonprescribed hydrocodone, after which he was charged by the board with failing to comply with the 1996 consent order. The charge was later dismissed after the board concluded there was a “strong possibility” the test results stemmed from a metabolite of the codeine Cochrane had been legitimately prescribed.
A few months later, in November 1998, the board expressed several concerns with Cochrane’s “overall management” of his substance abuse recovery. The board noted Cochrane had been prescribed opiates just one year after being diagnosed with opioid dependence by the Mayo Clinic and had also obtained a prescription for hydrocodone less than one year after entering substance-abuse treatment for use of that drug. Cochrane was ordered to select a new physician counselor to assist in his substance-abuse recovery.
After Cochrane challenged that action in court, the board reversed its decision and agreed to dismiss the order. In 2001, the board agreed to terminate Cochrane’s probation.
In 2003, the board charged Cochrane with the inability to practice dentistry with reasonable skill and safety by reason of habitual or excessive use of drugs, and willfully or repeatedly violating a board rule by failing to maintain records of controlled-substance prescriptions.
The board claimed that on at least two occasions, Cochrane issued prescriptions to patients prior to a surgery, then instructed the patients to bring the drugs to his office on the day of the surgery, then returned only a portion of the patients’ medications.
The board also alleged that in 2002, Cochrane had refused a board investigator’s request that he submit to chemical testing for drug use, then admitted he had a “problem” and indicated he was using medications not legally prescribed to him and was again using hydrocodone.
The board again placed Cochrane’s license on probation and ordered him to undergo additional substance abuse treatment. Over the next few years, the board scaled back the terms of that probationary order, first agreeing to reduce the order’s requirements for therapy, then agreeing to reduce the requirements for attendance at meetings of a 12-step program, and then agreeing to eliminate all requirements for group therapy.
In 2008, the board agreed to terminate Cochrane’s probation entirely.
As part of its recent order affirming Cochrane’s agreement to surrender his Iowa dental license, the board stipulated Cochrane will be eligible to seek reinstatement of his license in one year.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DENTAL-.jpg,,,2025-12-31 11:14:25.310131
