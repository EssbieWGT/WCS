,DC,2026-01-15 21:55:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump rolls out framework on health care costs that’s silent on ACA tax credits,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-rolls-out-framework-health-care-costs-thats-silent-aca-tax-credits,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump outlined his health care proposals to Congress on Thursday, asking lawmakers to approve several broad policy changes “without delay” — but left out any mention of enhanced tax credits whose expiration has left some Americans with skyrocketing costs. Health care costs, especially the rising price of health insurance, have become a frequent talking point for politicians from both political parties following last year’s government shutdown, when Democrats repeatedly called on Republicans to extend the now-expired enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans. Trump reiterated in a five-minute video that he wants Congress to give Americans money directly so they can use it to offset the cost of health insurance or health care, a proposal that has so far been unable to get the traction needed to advance on Capitol Hill. Trump didn’t detail any income caps on the direct payments, which would likely be sent to Health Savings Accounts as opposed to a simple check. He also didn’t say how much per month or annually he wants lawmakers to provide Americans, leaving it for members of Congress to hash out. “The government is going to pay the money directly to you. It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own health care,” Trump said. “Nobody has ever heard of that before, and that's the way it is. The big insurance companies lose and the people of our country win.”The enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits, first implemented by Democrats during the coronavirus pandemic, expired at the end of 2025. The subsidies helped to keep premiums lower than they would have otherwise been for about 22 million Americans on those health insurance plans. The House voted earlier this month to keep the enhanced tax credits going for another three years, but the bill has stalled in the Senate as a bipartisan group of lawmakers tries to reach consensus on two more years of the subsidies with significant changes. Lower drug pricesTrump said in the video that Congress should approve legislation that requires prescription drug companies to ensure Americans pay the lowest price in the world for pharmaceuticals, a policy known as “most favored nation” that he has pursued during his second term. ""So instead of Americans paying the highest drug prices in the world, which we have for decades, we will now be paying the lowest cost paid by any other nation,” he said. “So any other nation that's paying the lowest cost, that's what we're going to pay. And the American people will get the savings.”Trump said the legislative request, which he dubbed “The Great Health Care Plan,” would require health insurance companies and health care providers to publicly share easy-to-understand information about what they charge and how much they make in profit.  “As the saying goes, sunlight is the best disinfectant. That is why my plan orders all insurance companies to publish rate and coverage comparisons in very plain English,” Trump said. “It requires insurers to publish detailed information about how much of your money they're going to be paying out in claims versus how much they're taking in in profits.” Health insurance companies, he said, would be required to detail how many claims they deny and whether those refusals to pay for health care were overturned on appeal. “And most importantly, it will require any hospital or insurer who accepts Medicare or Medicaid to prominently post all prices at their place of business so that you are never surprised and you can easily shop for a better deal or better care,” Trump said, though a 2019 rule created a similar requirement. “We will have maximum price transparency and costs will come down incredibly.”Path through CongressA one-page outline of the proposal posted to the White House website doesn’t detail whether Trump wants Congress to approve the policy requests through the complex budget reconciliation process that Republicans used to approve the “big, beautiful” law this summer or to negotiate a bipartisan bill with Democrats. A White House official, speaking on background on a call with reporters to detail the plan and the next steps, said the administration believes the “proposals all have broad support from the American people.”“We expect both Republicans and Democrats to be able to embrace them, so reconciliation would not be necessary,” the official said.The framework is intended to provide “broad direction” to lawmakers, leaving negotiators the ability to take any bill they may write in different directions, the official said, adding the administration is “open to working” with Congress on the details. “We want to make progress,” the official said. “We're not laying out a specific path.”The official said the president leaving out any mention of the expired enhanced tax credits for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace was not intended to cut off ongoing bipartisan talks in the Senate. “This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,” the official said. “It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.”Engaging drugmakersCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said on the same call with reporters that the framework focused on “four pillars” the administration believes must be codified into law — solidifying most favored nation drug pricing, lowering health insurance costs, transparency from health insurance companies and more pricing information from health care providers. “Although we're taking major action at CMS, including fines and the like, having Congress say, ‘This is how it's going to be, this is a law of the land’ is important,” Oz said, adding that he really does believe there can be bipartisan support for at least some of the proposals. Oz said the administration’s approach to bring down the cost of prescription drugs to the lowest level offered anywhere in the world is not intended to impede innovation and reiterated that lawmaking is crucial for longer-term stability. “We believe by codifying it, we’ll make sure that the drug companies stay engaged for future administrations,” Oz said. “We also believe that by doing it correctly, we’ll not overreach and create challenges to life-saving drugs being continually evolved and developed in the United States.”The Trump administration, he said, wants Congress to give the Food and Drug Administration more leeway to convert prescription medications to over-the-counter availability, possibly increasing competition and decreasing prices. Oz said the price transparency portion of the request would help Americans to have more information about how long it takes to get routine appointments and whether health insurance companies are able to keep their rates down by frequently denying claims.",,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The former deputy director of Oklahoma’s mental health department settled with the Ethics Commission Thursday and will pay the state $2,500 for violating lobbyist registration and reporting law. 
Heath Hayes, 41, communicated with state officials “for the purpose of influencing governmental action” without being registered as a lobbyist, according to a statement from Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission. 
Scott Adams, Hayes’ legal counsel, did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Bruce Boone would not disclose who Hayes was lobbying on behalf of. 
She signed the settlement Thursday following its approval by the Ethics Commission at its meeting. Hayes and Adams signed the settlement Tuesday. 
The Ethics Commission found Hayes had not violated Oklahoma conflict of interest rules, but had violated the lobbyist registration rules, according to the settlement. 
“Ethics Rule 5 exists to ensure transparency in the lobbying process and fairness for those who comply with the law,” Bruce Boone said in a statement. “When individuals engage in lobbying activity without registering, it places those who follow the rules at a disadvantage and undermines public confidence in government.”
Hayes must make his payment in the next 30 days and provide proof of payment to the Ethics Commission, according to the settlement. 
Hayes also faces ongoing criminal charges, separate from Thursday’s ethics settlement, after Oklahoma City police alleged he embezzled $17,500 from Healthy Minds Healthy Lives while serving as a board member of the nonprofit foundation, which was affiliated with the State Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. 
Hayes is charged in Oklahoma County with one felony count of embezzlement in excess of $1,000, according to court records. The offense is punishable by up to up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and restitution.

Brian Kemp gives two thumbs up at his final state of the state address in the Georgia Capitol Thursday. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp called for an expedited income tax rate cut and another tax rebate, new spending for law enforcement retirement savings and funding for a needs-based scholarship program in his annual state of the state address Thursday before the Georgia General Assembly. 
The speech — Kemp’s eighth and final address as governor — highlighted many of the policies that have shaped his legacy, including his efforts to raise wages for teachers and other state employees, issue tax rebates during years the state had a revenue surplus and shore up the state’s multibillion-dollar reserves. According to Kemp’s projections, Georgia’s state reserves and rainy day fund combined will have more than $10 billion by the time he leaves office. The state’s current reserves sit at $14.6 billion.
Traffic congestion, homelessness top Kemp’s agenda for his final year in office

“There’s no question the state of our state is stronger, more prosperous and safer today than it was in January of 2019,” he told lawmakers.
But Kemp’s speech also highlighted the rising costs of living across the state, and cautioned lawmakers against taking the state’s economic stability for granted.
“The reality is that too many of our citizens are still struggling to make ends meet and everyday costs are still too high,” he said. “Groceries, rent, insurance, clothes for the kids, it all adds up to more than it used to.”
In his speech, Kemp also previewed his priorities for his last legislative session as governor, which includes a proposal to accelerate a plan lowering the state income tax rate below 5%.
Kemp’s proposed tax cut would bring the state’s income tax rate to 4.99%, down from 5.19%. His proposal would take effect for this year’s tax year and cost the state about $750 million each year in future lost revenues. 
“This will fulfill a promise to the people of the state that I made during my re-election campaign to lower our state income tax rate to under 5% and with the General Assembly’s passage and my signature, it will come a full three years ahead of schedule,” he said.
But there is a push in the Senate to move aggressively toward eliminating Georgia’s income tax. A special Senate panel recently released a plan that would waive the tax on up to $50,000 a year for individuals and $100,000 for married couples starting in 2027 – and eliminate the income tax entirely by 2032. Republican House leaders say they are also readying a bill that would nix the property tax on primary residences. 
Victor Anderson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Rep. Victor Anderson, a Cornelia Republican and chair of the House Governmental Affairs Committee, said that with Kemp’s proposed accelerated income tax cut, lawmakers could consider some sort of property tax relief reduction without impacting local government services.
“I also think there’s plenty of room for us to work with our local government on property taxes and still allow them to provide the services the citizens need,” Anderson said.
Notably absent from Kemp’s speech were discussions of hot-button social issues like banning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts or restricting access to gender-affirming care.
Instead, Kemp centered his speech on cost-of-living issues, including a proposal to distribute a one-time $2,000 bonus to state employees, and fund a needs-based scholarship for Georgia students that had previously been funded through private donations. 
The University System of Georgia Foundation’s DREAMS Scholarship would complement the state’s existing HOPE Scholarship, which is awarded to students based on merit. Under Kemp’s proposed budget, the DREAMS Scholarship would receive a one-time contribution of $325 million from the state to create more opportunities for Georgia residents to graduate without student debt.
“I believe we owe it to every child to ensure they start out on a level playing field, no matter their zip code,” Kemp said. 
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley applauded Kemp’s push to fund the scholarship during his final year in office.
“We’ve been asking for a need-based scholarship for years,” she told reporters after the speech. “As you know, HOPE started out as a needs-based proposition, and they turned it into a merit-based scholarship. So I’m happy that on his way out the door, he’s giving a nod to something that we’ve been asking for for several years.”
But Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, also criticized Kemp’s proposal to send out one-time tax rebates to Georgia residents, saying it would not go far enough to address the state’s affordability issues.
This year’s rebates, which also require lawmakers’ approval, would be the fourth time Georgia taxpayers received an extra payment in recent years, and it would again show up as $250 for individuals, $375 for head of household and $500 for married couples filing jointly. All told, the rebates would cost the state’s rainy day funds about $1.2 billion.
The rebates “will not take care of the needs that most families are thinking about,” she said. “They’re thinking about child care. They’re thinking about paying rent. But a one-time $250, a one-time $500, what is that really going to do?”
Kemp also released his budget proposals Thursday. Here are some other notable details from his spending plans: 
Kemp’s budget would use $46.4 million to replace the recent reduction of federal funding for a key food aid program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The cuts were included in last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The governor’s plan would also add about $18 million to go toward reducing the state’s payment error rate to avoid future federal funding cuts to the program. 
Roughly $2 billion in Kemp’s proposed budget would go toward highway improvements around metro Atlanta, and another $250 million would be allocated to local road projects. Rural parts of the state would also receive $100 million to strengthen or replace failing bridges, and $35 million for natural gas infrastructure upgrades. He highlighted these infrastructure projects at Wednesday’s Eggs and Issues event. 
The proposal would also include $5 million to fund a full hand recount for this year’s election, and another $1.8 million to help scan and tabulate ballots based on the human-readable text.
The new spending will bring the size of this year’s budget up to $42.3 billion. Next year’s budget, which will take effect in July, is set at $38.5 billion. 
The governor sets the spending levels each year in his budget proposals, and while lawmakers can’t increase the money available, they can move money around in the budget to reflect their own priorities. Lawmakers are set to hold budget hearings next week.

(Photo courtesy of David Spang.)In South Carolina, the hemp industry is at a crossroads.
Without sensible regulation for the sale of hemp and hemp-derived products, we risk undercutting public safety, damaging industry credibility, and putting South Carolina small businesses in jeopardy.
Current South Carolina law does not regulate products containing hemp-derived cannabinoids, aside from limiting delta-9 THC to 0.3% on a dry weight basis under federal law.
This gap has allowed a rapid increase in products, from gummies to vapes, with little to no oversight or guidelines.
Fortunately, there is a solution.
For the last several years, the South Carolina Healthy Alternatives Association has worked to develop a reasonable and responsible regulatory framework for the state’s hemp industry. As the legislative session opens in Columbia, an amendment to House Bill 3924 provides an opportunity to implement that framework.
With the support of numerous legislators, we believe this amendment will make the proposal the only legislation that accomplishes the goals of our industry, law enforcement, and most importantly, protects the public.
States around the country, including Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Kentucky have passed bills to responsibly regulate hemp and hemp-derived products in their states.
Additionally, last month’s White House order on reclassifying marijuana also gave clear direction on full-spectrum hemp, signaling further support for consumable hemp products.
It’s time South Carolina joined its peers, ensuring access to these products for people who have come to rely on them, and protecting small business owners and the public from bad actors.
In December, local, state and federal law enforcement conducted “Operation Ganjaprenuer,” a series of coordinated operations against criminals trafficking illegal drugs across South Carolina.
Unfortunately, these actions also impacted legitimate businesses selling legal hemp products across the state.
For those businesses, Attorney General Alan Wilson called for exactly what is needed: a reasonably and responsibly regulated South Carolina hemp industry.
That means creating a framework for responsible regulations for hemp-derived consumable products to include the following:

Limiting sales to individuals 21 and over
Testing requirements to ensure safe and compliant products for consumers
Packaging and labeling requirements
Licenses for manufacturers, distributors/wholesalers, and retailers
Serving size restrictions

For responsible businesses trying to operate legitimately, the current patchwork of interpretations and inconsistent enforcement is unsustainable.
Business owners committed to doing things the right way are forced to compete with bad actors who cut corners, mislabel products, or target minors.
South Carolina can take an important step forward on regulating the hemp industry, protecting our families, and ensuring access to these products.
If we can amend H3294 with complete regulatory guidelines and send it to Gov. McMaster’s desk, we will ensure South Carolina catches up to the responsible regulations of our peer states.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CBD-hemp-business-commentary-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 21:45:22+00:00,CT Mirror,PURA ordered to reconsider sale of Aquarion Water Company,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/aquarion-water-appeal-pura-ordered-to-reconsider/,The decision is a lifeline for Eversource's bid to sell Aquarion to South Central CT Regional Water Authority in a deal worth over $2 billion,"A Connecticut judge on Thursday said that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority erred in its November decision to block the sale of the Aquarion Water Company and sent the deal back to regulators for further deliberations.
The decision, from New Britain Superior Court Judge Matthew Budzik, provided a lifeline for Eversource’s bid to sell Aquarion to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, also known as the RWA, in a deal worth roughly $2.4 billion.
That deal would turn Aquarion — the state’s largest water utility — into a quasi-public authority operated in a similar manner to the RWA, with both entities sharing a board of directors and top staffers. But despite the purported benefits of public ownership, the deal attracted broad criticism from state officials and local leaders who argued that it would result in lost tax revenue, oversight from regulators and ultimately higher costs for consumers.
Budzik’s ruling remanded the case back to PURA, leaving open the possibility that its commissioners could still reject the sale along narrower grounds.
“Today’s clear decision from the court provides a path forward which we believe should be focused on collaboration and reaching a practical resolution that supports long-term infrastructure investment, protects customers, and ensures safe, reliable water service across Connecticut,” the RWA and Aquarion said in a joint statement. “We appreciate the Court’s direction and will continue engaging with PURA and all stakeholders as this matter moves forward.”
PURA was represented in the case by state Attorney General William Tong’s office. Tong, a Democrat, has been a staunch opponent of the proposed sale.
“We are reviewing the decision and evaluating next steps,” Tong said in a statement Thursday. “But this remand does not change the fundamental truth of this transaction — it’s a costly loser for Connecticut families and it shouldn’t happen.” 
PURA’s decision to block the sale rested entirely on regulators’ objections to the structure of the newly-created Aquarion Water Authority, which was established to manage the water company’s assets. In particular, the authority’s commissioners found the 11-member board created to separately oversee each utility was “unworkable” due the conflicting interests it would create among board members. The decision also cited concerns that Aquarion’s customers would lack an independent voice to advocate on their behalf, similar to the state’s Office of Consumer Council.
While the commissioners specifically said in their written order that both the RWA and the new authority had the financial and technical capabilities to operate a water utility, they ultimately determined that those managerial problems were too big to overcome.
Both Aquarion and the RWA sued to overturn that decision, arguing that PURA went outside the scope of its authority to reject the sale. 
Specifically, their attorneys argued that the governing structure of new Aquarion Water Authority was dictated by a state law passed during a special session of the legislature in 2024 to facilitate the sale of the private utility.
Attorneys representing PURA, the consumer counsel and several municipalities opposed to the sale argued that regulators are empowered to second guess lawmakers who wrote the law establishing the new water authority — and to determine whether the structure they came up with serves the public’s interest.
During a hearing in the case on Wednesday, however, Budzik appeared skeptical of that argument. “PURA works for the legislature, not the other way around,” he said.
Ultimately, Budzik said in his written decision Thursday that while PURA does not have the authority to overrule acts of the legislature, at least one of the concerns cited in the authority’s decision to block the sale does fall within regulators’ purview.
That issue had to do with the RWA’s Office of Consumer Affairs, which lawmakers tapped as the entity to advocate on behalf of Aquarion’s customers following the sale. Budzik said that while PURA could not deny the sale based solely on objections to that decision, the commissioners could object to the amount of funding or staff allocated to that office. Currently, the office is staffed by one part-time attorney to advocate on behalf of RWA’s 121,000 customers.
“How these permissible regulatory concerns might ultimately affect the approval or disapproval of the application given that the court has overturned other aspects of the decision is a matter for PURA to decide in its regulatory discretion,” Budzik wrote. 
Opponents of the sale reacted with some relief Thursday that Budzik’s decision did not order regulators to approve the transaction, as attorneys for the utilities had requested. 
“We appreciate that the Court refused to order PURA to approve the application, and instead remanded the case to PURA for further proceedings,” read a statement from First Selectperson Christine Vitale of Fairfield, one of the towns that was involved in the appeal. “We will continue to fight against this unacceptable transaction — which will guarantee unregulated increases in water rates — and we look forward to continuing to advance our arguments to PURA that this transaction is unacceptable to the town and clearly not in the public interest.”
Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman said in a statement that Budzik’s ruling will allow PURA to continue considering the public’s interest in its review of the Aquarion deal and future utility acquisitions.
“On remand the OCC will continue the approach we took in the original proceeding to protect the wallets of Aquarion customers and ensure that if a transaction is to move forward, it is not just for the benefit Eversource’s bottom line, but it is a good deal for customers,” Coleman said. 
While both PURA’s decision and the subsequent appeal focused largely on the governing structure of the new authority, critics of the sale have focused their arguments on the potential cost and impact to Aquarion’s customers. (As part of the deal, Aquarion plans to sell off its assets in New Hampshire and Massachusetts to the utility company Unitil.)
As part of the application submitted to PURA, officials at both Aquarion and RWA had pledged not to seek a rate increase for at least six months following the sale. After that initial period, officials projected that Aquarion would require annual rate increases of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade in order to maintain its operations.
That would effectively double the cost of water for Aquarion’s customers, critics said.
But supporters of the deal, including Eversource, pointed out that utility’s last rate increase came in 2013, even as the costs for things such infrastructure maintenance and treatment of PFAS chemicals have risen substantially.
The last time Aquarion sought a rate increase, in 2023, PURA instead cut the company’s revenues by $2 million.
In December, Aquarion officials announced their intention to seek a 42% rate increase — worth roughly $88 million — if the sale of the company is not approved. That amount was higher that the $64 million estimate of needed revenues that company officials gave to PURA during its consideration of the proposed sale.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0306_SR_AquarionReservoir_047-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Currently, child welfare services are nested within the state Department of Health and Human Services. However, there have been multiple attempts to separate the entities. 
Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin), who has championed this idea for years as a way for the state to focus more specifically on the delivery of child welfare services, presented LD 555 in a public hearing last week. He introduced a similar bill two years ago that was passed by the Maine Senate, but ultimately died. 
On Thursday, Republicans and Democrats on the Health and Human Services Committee underscored their desire to keep Maine children safe, but they overwhelmingly rejected Timberlake’s proposal because they said it isn’t the best way to achieve that goal. 
“Simply creating another department doesn’t fix the problem nor does it save a child, unfortunately,” said Sen. Marianne Moore (R-Washington). 
Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-Chelsea) has historically rejected the idea of creating a unique child welfare agency, but voted in support of the proposal to give Timberlake a chance to make changes to the bill.

In theory, what counts as private or public dollars is uncontroversial. Dollars are public when government has a legal claim over them — otherwise, they are private.
The public versus private dollar distinction matters when accounting for who is contributing how much to a sports facility. When public dollars are allowed to count as private dollars, a project proposal looks more enticing than it is, in fact.
For instance, lawmakers regularly allow team owners to count public dollars as private dollars. The Sacramento City Council agreed to let the NBA’s Sacramento Kings count their property tax payments for the city-owned arena as private contributions to the overall cost of financing the arena. But property taxes are public dollars that in other instances go toward public services like schools and road repairs.
Team owners building private facilities also typically receive public dollars through tax breaks, which is government spending in disguise. Property tax exemptions, sales and use tax exemptions on materials and machinery, and income tax credits are common forms of government givebacks to sports team owners.
I’ve estimated that property tax exemptions alone, among facilities in the five major leagues, have cost state and local governments $20 billion cumulatively over the life of teams’ leases, 42% of which would have gone to K-12 education.
Rental payments spent on facilities are not private dollars
Many facilities and their infrastructure are funded through public debt secured in part by team rental payments. Lawmakers, media and consultants often view projects secured by rents as privately financed, in part or whole.
However, rental income in exchange for use or operation of public property should not be counted as private dollars.
Here’s a thought experiment. Suppose state lawmakers allocated the rent paid for use of campground sites in a state park to pay for new campground bathrooms. Are the bathrooms privately funded?
The flaw in concluding “yes” arises from a failure to appreciate that lawmakers, through policy, create legal claims over certain dollars. All dollars start as private dollars, but through the tax system, lawmakers transfer ownership of some dollars to the public.
It is the government landlord’s choice, a policy decision, to spend the rental income on the rented property, a choice available to them only if they own the rental income in the first place.
Yet lawmakers regularly allow teams, both professional and minor league, to count rental payments as private contributions. This accounting makes sports subsidies look less generous than they actually are.
Looking beyond construction
Facilities not only need to be constructed but also operated, maintained and eventually upgraded. Roads, sewer lines, overpasses, game-day security and emergency response and public policies to mitigate gentrification caused by a facility are all common taxpayer-funded touchpoints. In addition, facilities have preconstruction costs such as land acquisition, soil remediation and site preparation, as well as later costs such as demolition and remediation for the land’s next use.
Focusing on privately financed construction and ignoring all other aspects of a project’s development and operation is misleading, potentially contributing to lawmakers making inefficient and expensive policy decisions.
By way of example, the Council of the District of Columbia approved a subsidy agreement last year with the NFL’s Commanders. The stadium would be financed, constructed and operated by the team owner, who would pay $1 in rent per year and remit no property taxes. In exchange for financing the stadium privately, the owner receives exclusive development rights to 20 acres of land adjacent to the stadium for the next 90 years.
The stadium is expected to cost the owner $2.5 billion, with the city contributing $1.3 billion for infrastructure.
But the city also gives up market rental income between $6 billion and $25 billion, depending on future land appreciation rates, that it could make on the 20 acres.
In other words, the rent discount alone means the city gives up revenue equal to multiple stadiums in exchange for the Commanders providing one. It is as if the council has a Lamborghini, traded it straight up for a Honda Civic, and then praised themselves for their negotiation acumen that resulted in a “free” Civic.
The Broncos’ proposed stadium
As of January 2026, Denver taxpayers know only that the Broncos stadium construction will be privately financed and that public dollars will be spent on some infrastructure.
Being enamored with such a proposal is similar to being offered a $1 billion yacht at a 75% discount. In my experience, there are two types of public officials: one will want to spend $250 million to save $750 million, while the other will ask whether $250 million for a yacht is an appropriate use of taxpayer resources given existing needs elsewhere.
My hope is that lawmakers better appreciate the many ways government participation in sports facility development, including privately financed ones, imposes serious risks and costs for current and future taxpayers. What is the expected total cost of the stadium project over its life? How much of the life cost would public resources cover? Could public resources generate greater benefits in an alternative use? How much will it cost to mitigate or compensate those affected by a project’s expected negative side effects, such as gentrification, congestion, pollution and crime?

Buckson’s Term Limits proposal ensures lawmakers consider whether longevity in office strengthens governance or undermines it.
DOVER, Del. — A Republican state senator has introduced a proposed constitutional amendment that would impose term limits on Delaware lawmakers and several statewide elected officials, reopening a long-running debate over legislative longevity, accountability and voter choice.
Senate Bill 222, sponsored by Sen. Eric Buckson, R-Dover South, would cap the number of terms served by members of the General Assembly and limit tenure for key statewide offices, including attorney general and treasurer.
Under the proposal, state senators would be limited to five four-year terms, or 20 years, while state representatives would be limited to eight two-year terms, or 16 years. The bill would also impose a two-term limit on the attorney general, state treasurer, auditor of accounts and insurance commissioner.
Buckson said the amendment is intended to increase accountability, encourage leadership renewal and restore public trust in state government.
“Delaware voters deserve a system that allows leaders time to be effective, but not to become entrenched,” Buckson has said previously. “Term limits provide a clear end point and ensure regular opportunities for new ideas and perspectives.”
Because SB 222 would amend the Delaware Constitution, it faces a high procedural bar. The measure must pass both chambers of the General Assembly with a two-thirds majority in two consecutive legislative sessions before it could take effect. As a result, no current officeholders would be affected in the near term.
The bill has been assigned to the Senate Executive Committee.
Lawmakers Exceeding Proposed Limits
If the limits outlined in SB 222 were already in place, several current and former legislators would exceed the proposed thresholds based on their years of service.
State Senate (more than 20 years):


Sen. Dave Sokola, D-Newark, first elected in 1990, has served 36 years, making him the longest-serving legislator in Delaware history.


Sen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View, has served a combined 24 years between the House and Senate.


State House of Representatives (more than 16 years):


Rep. Daniel Short, R-Seaford, first elected in 2006, has served 20 years.


Rep. William Carson, D-Smyrna, first elected in 2007, has served 19 years.


Rep. Stephanie Bolden, D-Wilmington, and Rep. Debra Heffernan, D-Bellefonte, each first elected in 2010, are at the proposed 16-year limit.


Former Rep. Robert Gilligan, who served more than 40 years in the House before retiring, would have exceeded the proposed limit by more than two decades.
Why Term Limits Appeal to Voters
Supporters argue term limits resonate with voters because they prevent legislative seats from becoming de facto lifetime positions, reduce the power of entrenched interests and ensure regular turnover.
Advocates also say term limits create space for new candidates, younger leaders and individuals with current professional experience to enter public service. Many voters, they argue, already assume term limits exist and view them as a commonsense reform.
Why Some Lawmakers Object
Opponents of term limits counter that voters already have the power to remove lawmakers through elections and that experience matters in a part-time legislature dealing with complex budgets, regulations and legal frameworks.
Critics also argue term limits can weaken institutional knowledge, shift influence to unelected lobbyists and staff, and limit voter choice by barring popular or effective lawmakers from seeking reelection.
Delaware voters have rejected term-limit proposals in the past, most notably in a 1994 constitutional referendum.
Still, Buckson’s proposal ensures the issue will again be part of the conversation in Dover — and among voters — as lawmakers consider whether longevity in office strengthens governance or undermines it.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/istockphoto-168250183-612x612-1.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Helping Rhode Islanders afford health insurance, home energy bills and child care is an expensive proposition: nearly $15 billion in fiscal 2027 under Gov. Dan McKee’s budget proposal.
The $14.9 billion tax-and-spend plan unveiled by McKee’s office Thursday marks the largest spending plan in state history — $522.6 million more than the current year’s budget although the dollar figure on fiscal 2026 is poised to cross the $15 billion dollar-mark under proposed revisions by the executive branch.
Embattled McKee highlights affordability, takes on Trump in 2026 State of State

The eye-popping button line comes amid stark federal funding cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill) poised to decimate social safety net programs for vulnerable Rhode Islanders while increasing state costs. Indeed, the gap between state revenue and expenses is poised to swell to $537 million by fiscal 2031. Nearly one-third of the deficit stems directly from H.R. 1, according to analysis by the state Office of Management and Budget.
“It’s gotten worse, as you can tell,” Brian Daniels, budget office director, said in a press briefing with reporters Thursday. “That’s not particularly heartening.”
But the headline-grabbing bottom line belies what Joe Codega, state budget officer, insisted is a “disciplined process” with “modest” growth in state general revenue. Less than half — $6.0 billion — of the total fiscal 2027 spending would come from state coffers under McKee’s proposal. This represents an increase of 2.5% over the $5.8 billion included in the fiscal 2026 budget. Federal funding covers the bulk of the remaining spending plan, including $292 million in leftover pandemic aid that must be spent by the end of the calendar year. 
“The $15 billion headline, I realize, gets attention,” Codega said. “But it really is a broad universe of spending in that $15 billion total.”
Across the galaxy, here are 10 highlights to focus on:
1. Cleaning up the Big Beautiful Mess 
Many of the sweeping federal changes to eligibility and funding for social safety net programs don’t kick in for nearly a year, or more. 
But state administrators want to prepare. McKee’s proposal includes $19.3 million in state general revenues ($45 million across all funding sources) for information technology, full-time workers and contractors to implement the necessary changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This includes working to reduce the 12.3% error rate in distribution of SNAP benefits to avoid up to $50 million in federal penalties down the line, and updates to the RIBridges electronic benefits portal to ensure compliance with new Medicaid work requirements.
More than 33,500 Rhode Islanders are expected to be kicked off Medicaid by the end of the calendar year because of new federal work requirements, while a separate group of 13,000 who buy insurance through the state marketplace are likely to opt out of coverage this year because they can’t afford the higher premiums. 
 McKee’s budget proposes $10 million to offset hospitals’ uncompensated costs from treating uninsured patients, and another $9.5 million to help 6,500 of the lowest-income self-insured afford insurance through the state marketplace — though not until January 2027, one year after the federal discounts expired.
The Rhode Island Community Food Bank will also see its annual state grant double, from $1 million to $2 million — as McKee highlighted in his State of the State address Tuesday.

2. Tax the rich, save the seniors 
Bad news for millionaires, cigarette and cigar smokers: Your taxes will go up under McKee’s spending plan. Despite reticence at a tax on top earners in past years, the executive branch has finally acquiesced to the progressive call for an extra 3% tax on income over $1 million. 
“H.R. 1 really forced our hand on this,” Daniels said. The income tax is expected to bring in $67.1 million in fiscal 2027, rising to $135 million in fiscal 2028, affecting 7,800 people, 2,300 of whom are Rhode Island residents.
Also boosting state coffers: a 75-cent increase per pack of cigarettes to $5.25; raising the cap on cigar taxes from 50 cents to $2; and removing the 1.25% discount for cigarette distributors that stamp their own packages for a collective $8 million in additional revenue. This is the third year in a row that McKee has moved to raise the cigarette tax, though lawmakers nixed the move last year.
On the other side of the ledger, seniors collecting Social Security, families with minor children and motorists will see savings under a series of tax credits and cuts. A three-year phaseout of the state’s income tax on Social Security benefits— mirroring policies adopted by 42 other states — will ease costs on 32,000 seniors while meeting the AARP Rhode Island’s top legislative focus for the year. The move cuts $40 million from state coffers, however.
A new, permanent child tax credit, $325 per child, replaces the dependent exemption on state income tax filings to help level the benefit across income levels. The change will help 31,200 people — just over one-quarter of state tax filers. 
For motorists, McKee wants to roll back the 2-cent gas tax increase that took effect in July, reducing the gas tax from 40 to 38 cents per gallon, made possible after paying off motor fuel bonds. And for tax scofflaws, the administration is offering the first amnesty program since 2017, hoping easing up on delinquent taxes will generate some revenue, rather than none at all.
3. Electricity bills vs. environmental mandates 
McKee’s solution to soothe frustrations over rising home energy bills comes at the expense of state environmental mandates. His eight-pronged approach to save ratepayers $1 billion over the next five years — or $180 a year for the average customer using 585 kilowatt-hours of electricity — hinges on rollbacks to state mandates for renewable energy, energy efficiency and utility infrastructure upgrades.
Most significantly, the 2022 law requiring the state to generate 100% of its electricity needs from renewable sources, or purchase credits to offset the fossil fuel sources, has now been extended to 2050, matching the overall decarbonization deadline of the Act on Climate law. This will cut bill costs for ratepayers by nearly $64 million in fiscal 2027. 
Large community net metering projects will also be charged a new fee to offset local taxes, project construction costs and interconnection upgrades, saving ratepayers $20 million collectively. And customer charges that fund energy efficiency projects will be capped — saving ratepayers another $21 million — with the reduced bill charges partially offset by $10 million in new state borrowing as part of a “green economy” bond. 
Acting Energy Commissioner Chris Kearns framed the decarbonization rollbacks as an attempt to balance climate goals with affordability concerns while recognizing the 180-degree shift in federal incentives for clean energy since President Donald Trump took office.
“Rhode Island ratepayers should not pay the price for President Trump’s chaos in Washington,” Kearns said during the briefing.
Despite advocates’ outrage at the executive profits and shareholder returns for Rhode Island Energy, McKee’s suite of changes only includes one direct cut to the utility supplier: eliminating an energy efficiency performance incentive for shareholders, which saves ratepayers $2.5 million a year.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, did not specifically respond to questions regarding the proposed cuts to company shareholders.
“We appreciate the Governor’s focus on energy affordability and look forward to reviewing the full details of his proposals and working with stakeholders to advance affordability measures as the legislative process unfolds,” Dalo said in an email Thursday.

4. Bonds. $600 million worth of bonds
McKee is proposing six bond initiatives totaling $600 million, a package representing the priciest ballot request in state history, even accounting for inflation, budget officials said.
That is 50% more than the $400 million bond package in 2020, which would be the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $515 million in November 2026. This year’s suggested bond bundle includes:

$215 million for higher education, with $105 million for an “Integrated Health Building” to support nursing, pharmacy, medicine and other interdisciplinary sciences at the University of Rhode Island; $50 million to renovate and add a student success center to the Adams Library at Rhode Island College; and $60 million for the Community College of Rhode Island to add a career and technical education center to its Warwick campus.
$120 million for housing development, divided into $25 million for home production and $95 million to preserve the state’s stock of affordable housing via redevelopment, construction, property acquisition, and improved infrastructure. 
$115 million for economic development, with $70 million for site development at the Quonset Business Park in North Kingstown as well as the I-195 Redevelopment District in Providence. The other $45 million would flow toward “growth industry” infrastructure meant to fortify the state’s ocean, defense, life science and data analytics sectors. 
$50 million for the green economy, spread out across initiatives like energy efficiency programs, shoreline resilience efforts, land conservation, watershed restoration, brownfield remediation, and local recreation efforts — a bond very similar to the one voters approved in 2024.
$50 million for career and technical education — a workforce-centric centerpiece of educational policy both locally and nationally — for improving programs and facilities in public schools statewide via a grant pool administered by the state education department.  
$50 million for the cultural economy, including $45 million for Secretary of State Gregg Amore’s much-pined-for state history center. It’s less than the $60 million Amore asked for to house Rhode Island’s most cherished and delicate artifacts, but the governor hopes Amore could make up the $15 million difference with some alternate funding sources. The remaining $5 million in this bond would fund preservation grants for municipalities and nonprofits.

5. No fiscal cliff, no service returns either for RIPTA
After declining to fill a $32.6 million dollar deficit in his recommended fiscal year 2026 budget, McKee pledged in his State of the State speech to “fully close” the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) projected $13.8 million deficit for fiscal 2027.
McKee recommends a $9.3 million annual increase to RIPTA’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, funded primarily by vehicle registration fees, from $5 million to $14.3 million.
Also plugging RIPTA’s deficit would be $1 million generated from a proposed increase in fees assessed per passenger on cruise ships that visit Newport. Since 2024, cruise ships have been charged $10 per passenger embarking or boarding from the city by the sea — all of which has been collected by the municipality. McKee proposes increasing the fee by $5 to $15.
McKee also recommends a $3.5 million allocation of capital funds toward bus purchases — money the quasi-governmental agency had taken out of its operating budget.
RIPTA will continue to receive the 2-cent gas tax increase approved by lawmakers last year, even as Gov. Dan McKee has pledged to roll back the overall tax.
The governor’s commitment is still not enough to restore service to what it was before last fall, when RIPTA reduced service on 46 of its 67 bus lines — the most significant cuts in the agency’s 59-year history.
So why not add more revenue?
“This was their proposal and we filled that gap,” Andrea Palagi, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said Thursday.
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand thanked McKee for plugging the agency’s latest financial gap.
“This investment affirms the progress we have made over the past year to stabilize our finances, operate more efficiently, and better align service with the needs of riders and employers across the state,” he said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “Through more than $30 million in cost-savings measures, increased federal reimbursements, and new revenue sources, RIPTA has taken meaningful steps to strengthen its long-term sustainability while continuing to serve the people who rely on transit every day.”

6. Truck tolls still stalled, bridge oversight returning in-house at RIDOT
Keep waiting for the state to restart its truck tolling program. 
McKee’s administration had anticipated $10 million in revenue for fiscal 2026, but the gantries set up on state highways under the Gina Raimondo-era RhodeWorks program still remain offline. That’s because state transportation officials found much of the equipment needs to either be replaced or updated before tractor trailers get tolled again.
Officials declined to say when the gantries will reactivate, just that it won’t be before June 30. Whenever they do turn on in the upcoming fiscal year, McKee’s budget recommendation assumes the tolls will bring in $20 million into the state’s coffers, increasing to $40 million in annual revenue starting in fiscal 2028.
Come July 1, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) could hire two new civil engineers to provide “inspection oversight” over the state’s inventory of 1,206 bridges, costing $356,492 in state funding.
RIDOT Director Peter Alviti Jr. told lawmakers during a Nov. 13 oversight hearing on the Washington Bridge that the department had no in-house ability to check the adequacy of work of contractors who maintain and inspect Rhode Island’s bridges.
Helena Buonanno Foulkes, McKee’s 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, has called for the creation of an “Office of Accountability” within RIDOT responsible for oversight and making sure contracts are fair and the work is being done.
7. New education funding formula? What new education funding formula?
This year, like last, McKee wants to give an incremental boost to the numbers behind the formula to determine the state’s share of public education costs, hopefully redirecting more money to school districts with higher numbers of students living in poverty. 
Overall, the governor’s proposal represents a $17.5 million raise for per-pupil formula aid, or a 3.1% increase from last year. The so-called “student success factor” would rise from 40% to 43% in the funding formula and would account for $14.2 million additional K-12 aid. 
The state is using October enrollment data as the baseline for its formula calculations. That autumnal data led to some troubles last year when the state undercounted the amount of multilingual learners as well as the amount of children living in poverty, but Daniels said the state is “in better shape” this year because of improved data matching work across certain state agencies. “There was a big swing last year, so we really focused a lot on data accuracy,” he said. “I don’t know that we’re fully there yet.” 
Meanwhile, the recently publicized report of a Rhode Island Foundation commission shows how the state could forge a new calculation of what to give school districts. While consideration of this new algebra is underway at the General Assembly — the state Senate is set to receive a presentation on the retooled funding formula Thursday, for instance — McKee’s team is sticking to the method of bean counting the state has relied on for approximately 15 years. When a reporter asked why McKee hadn’t opted for the shiny new formula in this year’s budget, Daniels joked, “Well, it came out 10 days ago, and it cost $600 million.” 
Daniels then took a more serious tone and noted the commission’s report has “some very thoughtful ideas” but the fiscal forecast does make it look “difficult” for the state to absorb even more education costs than it already does. 
McKee is also proposing a $2.5 million increase for high-cost special education categorical funding for a total of $20 million. High cost special education is defined as students whose needs are more than quadruple the formula’s most core instructional amount. 
8. He wants the (veto) power 
After landing in legislative purgatory following the fiscal 2026 budget process — McKee declined to sign the final spending plan but refused to veto it either — he’s back with the perennial solution of executive branches past: a line-item veto.  
Rhode Island is an outlier — one of only six states that don’t let their executive branch reject individual items within their annual budget. But the path to changing the state’s constitution is long and onerous. Without a constitutional convention, McKee’s push for more power must first pass muster with the Rhode Island General Assembly and then with voters as a ballot question.
There is no direct cost for the policy change. So why was it included in McKee’s budget proposal — listed as an “affordability initiative” in a handout supplied to reporters?
“It relates to the administration of the budget,” Daniels said. “We view this as an area where we can have long-term cost containment.”
The Rhode Island General Assembly would still be able to override executive vetoes by a three-fifths majority vote in both chambers. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson did not address McKee’s veto plan in a joint statement Thursday.
“The submission of the Governor’s budget today signals the start of a very public budget process over the next several months,” they said. “The respective House and Senate Finance Committees will carefully review all of the proposals at televised hearings and we encourage all interested parties to provide in-person or written testimony.”

9. A Band-Aid for a bleeding health care system 
The governor proposed modest increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates and accompanying funding for cash-strapped hospitals, nursing homes and health centers, and the providers who work within them.
Rather than relying on the July 1 reimbursement rates recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, McKee’s administration proposes a slightly lower, 2.5% increase for hospitals, nursing homes and federally qualified health centers to match the state’s projected revenue growth.
Daniels acknowledged this would not be welcomed by health care providers and facilities. “Yes, you probably want more, but you are going to get what we’re getting,” he said. 
This, on top of regularly scheduled increases in hospital licensing fees based on updated patient revenue figures, would pad state coffers with another $232.5 million in fiscal 2027.
Nearly $120 million in inflation-adjusted reimbursement increases ($46 million from state coffers) for home health aides and providers who work with people with developmental disabilities and young children will be doled out over two years, rather than a single year as the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner recommended. 
But the health insurance commissioner would be able to wield more power over insurers that fail to meet state caps on annual premium increases, an answer to the double-digit insurance hikes that marked the 2024 and 2025 rate review processes. 
There’s no money for Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital as the drawn-out sale reaches decision day, but the executive branch is working closely with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General on contingency planning, Daniels said.
10. More beds for Veterans in Bristol 
McKee’s office pledged in October that he wouldn’t make any cuts to the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol. The governor not only stuck to that promise but wants to commit a potential $3 million in fiscal year 2027 as part of a two-year plan that would reopen 16 beds for veterans on the campus. 
The 16 beds represent half the full capacity of the Foxtrot neighborhood, which has been closed since the pandemic due to a lack of staff needed to tend to residents in the unit. McKee’s allotment provides for up to 22 full-time resident care roles, plus two more jobs for administrative tasks like training, recruitment and retention. The governor’s budget estimates the Veterans Home could reach its full occupancy of 208 beds in fiscal year 2028.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix) The Florida House has again passed legislation (HB 133) dropping the minimum age to purchase rifles and other long guns from 21 to 18. The vote was 74-37, with five Republicans joining the majority of Democrats in opposing it and one Democrat (Jose Alvarez from Osceola County) supporting the measure.
But for the fourth year in a row, the likelihood of the state repealing the law is doubtful, as a companion bill in the Senate has yet to be filed. A similar situation has played out during the past three legislative sessions, with the measure passing the House and dying in the Senate.
Florida lawmakers raised the age to purchase a long gun from 18 to 21 as part of the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, in the immediate aftermath of the mass shooting in Parkland that resulted in the deaths of 17 people.
The measure under debate also would allow a person 18 or older to purchase a handgun from a private seller, although a federal ban prohibits anyone under 21 from purchasing a handgun from a federal firearms licensee.
Rep. Robin Bartleman, D-Weston, said lowering the legal age would contribute further to what she said is an erosion of gun safety in Florida.
“We don’t require permits,” she said. “We don’t require training to own a gun. We don’t require safe gun storage, and now we allow everyone to open carry, so literally these 18 to 21 year olds who are not fully developed, who are not thinking rationally, who cannot think of consequences of the actions, actually can lawfully carry their AR-15 on their back and walk around. That’s a dangerous situation.”
Rep. Dean Black, R-Jacksonville, went on an extended discussion about how the debate about gun violence wasn’t about guns at all. The crisis is “with us,” he argued, adding that mass shootings became a phenomenon only over the past three decades. Instead, he said, the House could be talking about the breakdown of the two-parent family and the loss of faith.
“We could talk about things that really might get us somewhere, but we have this distraction, and history over centuries teaches us that that’s not the answer, because it didn’t happen back then, yet it happens today,” Black said. 
Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, D-Parkland, was mayor of that city when the shooting happened in 2018. She said the bipartisan vote in the Legislature to raise the age was “because people decided then that the cost of doing nothing was too high and was something that they wouldn’t be able to live with. 
“I feel that going back on what was done then, the political courage that was done then, would be devastating and heartbreaking, because it’s so hard to find that kind of bipartisan political courage these days,” she said.
The effort to raise the legal age has been supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis and gained momentum this spring when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced he would not defend the law after a federal appeals court again upheld its constitutionality after it was challenged in federal court by the NRA.
“If the NRA decides to seek further review at SCOTUS, I am directing my office not to defend this law,” Uthmeier said in March, not long after DeSantis appointed him to his office. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
Twenty-one states have raised the age to purchase a long gun to 21 in America, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.
The bill sponsor, Rep. Tyler Sirois, R-Merritt Island, said he was attempting to correct an inequity in Florida law. 
“This country has a problem with school shootings, but the answer to that is not to infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding people,” he said.
Among those watching the debate from the gallery was De’ja Charles, 20, a student at Florida A&M University and a member of Students Demand Action, a gun safety group. 
“We know that 18 to 20 year-olds are three times more likely to commit gun homicides, as opposed to those over 21,” she said, citing statistics compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety. 
“We should be trying to make it safer in Florida for us to live our lives. There should be Parkland victims here today and it’s difficult to have the courage to express your views when you have representatives that are blatantly just going against it.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Jeff Landry said he intends to change the role of the state Office of the Inspector General. (Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry said he intends to change the role of the state Office of the Inspector General, an agency that acts as a watchdog over public officials and is tasked with rooting out government corruption. 

The governor has replaced longtime Inspector General Stephen Street, who has held the job since 2008, with Angele Davis, who was commissioner of administration and budget czar for former Gov. Bobby Jindal. Street’s most recent term, which started in 2020, expired this week. 
But the governor’s vision for the reworked state inspector general office goes beyond just a personnel change. He said at a news conference Thursday that the inspector general duties overlapped too much with the functions of the legislative auditor, whose staff also conducts investigations into government fraud and waste.

Landry said some of the changes he wants to make require state law to be changed through the Louisiana Legislature. He plans to back bills to change the inspector general’s office in the upcoming lawmaking session that starts March 9. 
While not giving many details about his proposal, the governor said he didn’t think the inspector general’s office should be designated a law enforcement agency as it is now.  He also said the “new” inspector general’s office would be “connected to optimization and efficiency within state government.” 
The inspector general’s office was set up in state law as part of a wider ethics and anti-corruption legislative package Jindal pushed during his first few months as governor in 2008. Prior to that time, governors had employed inspector generals through executive order. 

An overhaul of the office could align with other dramatic changes Landry has made to state government entities that serve as a watchdog and check on state officials’ power. 
In 2024, Landry pushed through significant changes to the Louisiana Board of Ethics that weakened its independence and brought the agency further under the governor’s control.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
While the legislative auditor and inspector general share some overlapping functions, as the governor said, the two positions are structured differently. In general, legislators have more direct authority over the legislative auditor than the governor does over the inspector general. 
The inspector general is nominated by the governor and confirmed by the Louisiana Senate to serve a six-year term. The person’s time in office intentionally doesn’t line up with the governor’s or state lawmakers’ four-year terms in order to somewhat insulate the inspector general from political pressure. 
The legislative auditor, currently Mike Waguespack, is voted into office by state lawmakers and serves no specific term, though he or she must be a certified public accountant. Waguespack was a CPA before he was elected sheriff of Assumption Parish, a role held from 2000-16.  
Street, an attorney, was on the staff at the state’s Third Circuit Court of Appeal and the Louisiana attorney general’s office before becoming inspector general.
“Serving 18 years as Louisiana’s Inspector General has been one of the great honors of my life, both personally and professionally,” Street said in a written statement Thursday. 
Both the inspector general and legislative auditor have subpoena power, meaning they can compel a person to testify or hand over documents, but who approves their subpoenas differs. 

The legislative auditor can only subpoena people if the Legislative Audit Advisory Council, made up of the state lawmakers who help hire the auditor, agrees to do so. The inspector general gets approval for his subpoenas from a state judge with the 19th Judicial District in Baton Rouge.

Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford, said in a press release that he decided when he first ran in 2020 that he would serve only three terms, honoring the term limits law in effect at the time that restricted House members to six years.
“I plan to stick to that commitment,” Posthumus said.
The law changed in 2022 to an overall limit of 12 years to be served between either the state House or Senate.
Posthumus was elected in 2020 to represent the 73rd House District. Following redistricting, he was elected in 2022 and reelected in 2024 in the 90th District. Both districts are solidly Republican. 
He was subsequently chosen by his GOP colleagues to serve as majority floor leader, the second highest position next to the Speaker, in 2022 and again in 2024.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It has been the privilege of my life to serve Kent County and the people of Michigan,” Posthumus said, adding that announcing his decision now would give voters time to choose “the best possible candidate” to replace him.
He cited several accomplishments during his tenure, including what he described as cutting the state budget for the first time outside periods of war or recession and increasing budget transparency.
Posthumus also praised fellow lawmakers from both parties, acknowledging sharp partisan divisions while emphasizing a shared goal of improving the state.
“We live in an era of hyper partisanship, and the gap between Republicans and Democrats is enormous,” Posthumus stated. “The solutions we offer are often diametrically opposed to one another. However, the one thing that unites us is the desire to leave Michigan better than we found it.”
He said he will continue working through the end of the year and remain active in efforts to help Republicans retain control of the House. Posthumus also expressed support for House Speaker Matt Hall returning to the post in 2027 under a Republican governor.
Posthumus noted that serving in the Legislature held special meaning because his father and sister also previously served in the state Legislature.

Josh Stein speaks to reporters about western North Carolina recovery on Jan. 15, 2026. (Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein thanked federal officials Thursday for finally approving some Helene survivors’ applications for disaster relief.
It’s a good step, he said, but he’ll continue to ask Congress for an additional $13.5 billion to help western North Carolina recover from the devastating effects of the 2024 hurricane.
In the meantime, FEMA has taken more than a year to process some aid applications.
“The longer the delay in federal funding and getting programs up and running, the worse it is for western North Carolina recovery,” Stein said. 
U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-NC11) announced Wednesday that FEMA will release $116 million in Helene relief. $72 million is from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Public Assistance program, and the remaining $44.6 million comes through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
Under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, local governments use federal disaster money to buy land from homeowners whose property is in a flood zone. 
“The way it works is, they buy the property, and then it becomes green space forever, so that there won’t be anybody who experiences pain if there is future flooding,” Stein said. 
A Buncombe County woman was waiting for a buyout for her house in Swannanoa after it was destroyed in the storm, Stein said. She hasn’t been able to live there, sell it, or rebuild it, but she’s been stuck paying the mortgage on the property for more than a year while waiting for FEMA to release the money for the buyout, he explained.
“There were 560 applications of homeowners who similarly said, ‘Please, my house is in a flood zone. I am ready for you to acquire my property,’” Stein said.
The funding released Wednesday will allow some of those transactions to move forward, like elevating 14 homes in Beaufort County.
”Not all of it’s been solved yet,” Stein said. “I don’t want to overstate it, but what a constructive development yesterday was.”
In the 16 months since Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc on the western portion of the state, North Carolina has dedicated more than $3.1 billion towards recovery efforts, Stein wrote in his Wednesday letter to the congressional delegation. Previously, Congress had allocated $7 billion in federal funding towards recovery from the catastrophic storm.
But that’s still a small fraction of estimated $60 billion in damages Helene caused in North Carolina.
North Carolina first asked for the additional $13.5 billion in September 2025.
According to the governor’s office, the appropriation request includes: 

$1.77 billion to repair roads
$8.37 billion to support homeowners in rebuilding their homes
$1.99 billion to help local governments stay afloat
$540 million to restore water infrastructure systems

Stein, a Democrat, said the request has the bipartisan support of the state’s congressional delegation.
“There was just unanimity that Washington needs to do more,” he said.
Stein asks lawmakers for drone legislation
Following Helene, the state used drones to survey damage, search for survivors, and direct rescue teams. Now, there are new concerns over the technology. 
Stein serves as co-chair of the Council of Governments, a group that focuses on national security, cybersecurity, and natural disasters.
“It quickly became apparent to our group that the malicious use of drones can become a real problem around the country,” Stein said. “The potential that weaponized drones can be used by bad actors to attack large public gatherings for critical infrastructure — it isn’t fiction.”
In December, Congress passed the Safer Skies Act, allowing state law enforcement to address the threat of drones, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. Trump signed it into law. 
Previously, state and local officials could not shoot down suspicious drones unless they were suspected of delivering contraband to prisons. Otherwise, they could only go after the drone operator.
“Now, under the Safer Skies Act, if a state or local government goes through a federal training program, they can then have the authority to, when it’s appropriate, when there is a risk, to actually take action against a specific drone,” Stein said.
“The current law only holds accountable the person who is directing the drone, but that person may be miles away and you have no idea who they are,” Stein continued. “But the drone is right there and presents a real and clear present danger. And so that’s the change in federal law that we have been seeking.”
N.C. Public Safety Secretary Jeff Smythe said states will need to set their own rules for state and local officials. He said North Carolina’s approach will focus on protecting critical infrastructure, like power generation facilities, water systems, ports, transportation hubs and communication networks.  
Smythe also wants to ensure that law enforcement and correctional officers have clear rules of engagement, and follow federal law while respecting privacy. 
“This is not about expanding surveillance,” Smythe said. “It’s about preventing harm and keeping pace with modern risks.”
Stein said he’s working on a draft bill to set up a state framework, but did not share further details. 
“We need to strengthen our law to make sure that it takes care of all of the major risks,” Stein said.

Rucker sponsored the bill that would allow for over-the-counter sale of ivermectin, which passed in Senate Health on Thursday and now advances to Senate Judiciary. (Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)For a second year, members of the Senate Health Committee advanced a bill Thursday to allow pharmacists to sell ivermectin, a medication generally prescribed to treat people with topical conditions or infections that stem from parasitic worms, over-the-counter and without a prescription.
Senate Bill 42 would allow individuals to request ivermectin from pharmacists without having a doctor’s order for treatment of a specific condition or dosage. 
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, who said she believed risks associated with ivermectin use are minor. She compared it to Tylenol, which can be abused if used irresponsibly but is relatively safe in appropriate doses.
“There are people who have destroyed their stomachs by taking too many over-the-counter medications. It is absolutely a responsibility of the individuals and the pharmacists,” Rucker said. “I do believe that pharmacists have a very good knowledge of what it is that they are not only dispensing, they’re there to educate the consumer when the consumer requests any drugs, whether it is with a prescription or without a prescription.”
Per the proposed bill, no consultation with the pharmacist or a doctor would be required before purchasing the medication. Pharmacists would provide individuals who request the drug with an information sheet on uses approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. While pharmacists “may” sell the drug, there is no requirement for them to do so.
Pharmacists who sell the medication would be immune from any civil, criminal or professional actions that could arise from someone taking it.
Per the FDA, ivermectin is only authorized for use in humans at specific doses to treat some parasitic worms and, topically, for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea.
Sen. Tom Takubo, R-Kanawha, said he had concerns about over-the-counter access to ivermectin without limits on dosages, especially when it comes to off-label uses. If taken in high doses, he said, the medication can be dangerous.
“My biggest concern with this particular bill … is just the dose and quantity,” Takubo, a doctor by trade, said. “If someone doesn’t know what dose of ivermectin or how much to take then, yes, there are significant toxicities.”
He said pharmacists can only share the information they have. Since there is no scientific evidence or FDA authorization showing that the medication treats antiviral conditions or other illnesses, specifying an appropriate dosage in those uses would be difficult for the pharmacist.
Complications from over-usage, Takubo said, can include a drop in blood pressure, an increase in heart rate, seizures, blindness and the development of Steven Johnson Syndrome, a serious disorder in the skin and mucus membranes that causes skin to shed off.
“My only concern is there’s nothing that prohibits [someone receiving then taking too much of the drug],” Takubo said. “I think this is probably something that will never or rarely ever get used, so it’d be nice if there would be some safeguard or some limit.”
Last year, a similar bill passed out of Senate Health. That bill, however, hinged on over-the-counter access only being possible if the FDA approved the drug for human use in wider circumstances than currently allowed. The bill ultimately died in the Senate Judiciary, where it was not brought up for consideration.
Interest in and pushes for the wider use of ivermectin became common during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, when people alleged that the drug could help treat infections from the virus. To date, no clinical trials or peer-reviewed evidence have been accepted by the FDA to support such claims. 
The drug became a common talking point for COVID-19 conspiracists and, due to this misinformation, health leaders urged the public not to use the drug for off-label purposes, citing concerns over other medications that could be contraindicated and different formulations of it that could be safe for animal consumption but not for humans.
Takubo, a pulmonologist, said that he and other doctors attempted to use ivermectin in severely ill patients in the early days of COVID-19. Even at the highest doses, he said, it did not work. Months later, studies were released showing it as ineffective.
“I ran the dose to very toxic levels. We did everything we could to try to save people,” Takubo said. “It just didn’t work.”
Sen. Kevan Bartlett, R-Kanawha, said that while he was “uncomfortable” getting COVID-19 vaccination boosters after receiving an initial dose, he did take ivermectin when he caught the virus. While he acknowledged there was no scientific or medical evidence showing its efficacy, he said his symptoms “significantly diminished” within two days.
“More and more, we need to look for ways to let West Virginians make informed choices and less opportunity [for us] to just dictate choices from the dome here or the dome in Washington,” Bartlett said. “So I support the freedom that comes with this bill in this small particular area.”
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, called ivermectin a “political football.” Rucker said seeing similar bills implemented in other states inspired her to introduce it again here. But Garcia said that just because other places were doing it didn’t make it “the right thing to do.”
“I do think there are some risks to a bill like this,” Garcia said. “I think there are a lot more important things to do [in the Senate Health Committee], and this should not be a priority.”
The bill will now advance to the Senate Judiciary for lawmakers there to consider.

Jones’ platform for the role includes a more diversified agricultural landscape, more regulations on polluters and concentrated feeding operations and greater access to locally grown food. 
“We need a secretary of agriculture that is for the people … and not just for corporate agriculture,” Jones said. “And so that’s what I endeavor to do if I’m elected secretary of agriculture.”

Jones was formerly a research engineer studying Iowa water quality at the University of Iowa. He spoke Thursday in front of Des Moines Water Works to highlight the fact that the Raccoon River, one of the drinking water sources for central Iowa, had nitrate concentrations in excess of federal safe drinking water standards. 
“So clearly, here in Iowa, we are not getting the environmental outcomes that we want from this agricultural production system,” Jones said. 
Des Moines Water Works has been running its nitrate removal system since Jan. 6 in order to continue providing drinking water within safe drinking water limits. Over the summer, nitrate concentrations were so high in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers following a wet spring, that the utility issued a lawn watering ban to decrease demand on the system and remain within safe limits. 
Jones said the nitrate levels, which have remained high through the fall and winter, are due to row crop and animal agriculture systems upstream. Jones’ writings and his book, “The Swine Republic,” center largely on the same theme. 
This stance, and his calls for Iowa to transition away from corn and soybean farming, has led some, including incumbent Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, to say Jones is anti-farmer. 
Jones said he “wants what’s best for farmers” and that means deviating from current production models. Jones said the current agricultural model — of mostly large operation corn and soybean farms and concentrated livestock feeding operations — has not been prosperous and has led to a decline in rural populations and essential services. 
“I hope farmers see that I want what’s best for them – I want our farmers to be prosperous,” Jones said. “Iowa cannot be prosperous if farmers aren’t prosperous.” 
He also said the role of secretary of agriculture should not be a “farmer popularity contest” and he wants non-farming Iowans to vote for him as well because “agriculture policy is too important just to leave it to agriculture to make the decisions.” 
Jones is running for the Democratic nomination against farmer Wade Dooley who announced his campaign Monday. 
Jones said more diverse cropping and livestock systems would fix a lot of the current problems facing agriculture, including, water pollution, low prices for corn and the ongoing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza. 
That means different crops, like oats, for example, need to be subsidized and livestock production should transition to “more traditional” methods outside of animal confinement, Jones said. 
“Instead of continuously trying to find what we can do with more and more and more corn, maybe let’s think about growing something else,” Jones said. 
In his writing, Jones has criticized both the Republican and Democratic parties’ approaches to agriculture and water protections, but he said he is not worried his critiques will impact his campaign. 
“I have my own views on things, and they’re not molded by party politics,” Jones said. 
Jones will host a campaign kickoff Thursday at Confluence Brewing in Des Moines and a Clean Water Town Hall in Grinnell Jan. 24.

(Via Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)For the second year in a row, the Florida House has greenlit a measure requiring all businesses to use a federal verification tool to determine whether new hires can legally work in the country.
HB 197, sponsored by Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, would mandate that all employers use the online database called E-Verify. This expands a 2023 law championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, which demanded E-Verify for public businesses and private ones with more than 25 employees.
This is the second year the E-Verify bill has cleared the House. Last year, the measure never gained traction in the Senate. It remains to be seen whether its identical companion bill, filed by Sen. Jonathan Martin, will be scheduled for a committee hearing.

“If this bill passes, it would expose a lot of law breakers that are harming Floridians, that are harming law abiding people who want to get into the workforce, and harming law abiding businesses,” Jaques said Thursday from the House floor.
“It’s time for us to finally get this done.”
The bill passed in an 80 to 30 vote, with four Democrats voting with the Republican majority and two Republicans voting with the Democrats.
Of note, more than 475,000 small businesses in Florida have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2025 report by the Small Business Administration. Not counting businesses without employees — of which there are more than 2 million — there are fewer than 518,000 small businesses in Florida.
Jacques’ bill is emblematic of a nationwide push to tighten immigration laws, spearheaded by President Donald Trump and most clearly mirrored in Florida. Trump has mobilized Border Patrol within the country to supplant and aid ICE while the Sunshine State exists as the first (and only) in the nation to require all of its counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Under DeSantis, Florida also constructed the first state-run migrant detention center, nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz.” States including Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana quickly followed suit.
‘Fake fix’?
Not all were in support of Jacques’ bills. Democrats cited fears of undue costs on small business owners and past reports of unreliability within the E-Verify system.
“We don’t need this fake fix forcing private employers to use a broken and unreliable federal database in the form of a big government mandate,” said Rep. Dotie Joseph, a North Miami Democrat. “It’s bad for business and bad for Florida.”
Others pointed to alleged burdens on small businesses, with Rep. Yvette Hinson pointing to a 2010 Bloomberg study estimating that E-Verify implementation cost small businesses $81 million.
Although E-Verify requires documents like an I-9 to prove work authorization, cases of identity theft have permeated the platform. E-Verify can determine whether documents are valid, but it can’t always determine whether they are the valid documents of a person besides the potential new hire, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.
But Jacques pushed back. He argued that E-Verify has been in use since 1996, and that some small businesses contracting with public agencies are also required to use the database.
“This is nothing new,” he said.
In 2023, then-Sen. Blaise Ingoglia sponsored the law to require private businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify. It was part of a large immigration package that also required Medicaid-accepting hospitals to annually report how many undocumented immigrants they treat.
Despite this, Florida Republicans criticized the DeSantis administration for failing to penalize businesses that hadn’t been using E-Verify. The statute requires businesses that ignore E-Verify laws three times within two years to face a $1,000 fine per day.
DeSantis, in turn, sent out warning letters to 40 companies either ignoring or refusing to implement E-Verify.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3602-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

(Photo courtesy of USC)COLUMBIA — The University of South Carolina selected Prisma Health to run the school’s new $30 million brain health clinic in downtown Columbia.
Only Prisma entered a bid for the five-year operating contract for the center, scheduled to open in March. No other companies applied, according to documents from the state’s procurement agency.
The state’s largest hospital system will earn $825,000 annually to run the clinic, which will boast the most powerful MRI scanner in the state. Also at the center, those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s will have the option to undergo treatment with recently approved drugs meant to slow the disease’s progression.
Neurologists and radiologists with the necessary training to diagnose the most complicated cases of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia will work out of the clinic, Julius Fridriksson, USC’s vice president for research previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
USC seeks partner for new $30M brain health center

Prisma is already USC’s largest partner when it comes to brain health.
USC renovated a 75,000-square-foot building the school owns on the Prisma Health Richland Hospital campus to serve as the main hub in a network of seven clinics already set up across the state. While awaiting the new center’s completion, USC medical school doctors have been booking appointments four days a week in university-leased space within the neurology department of the hospital.
Prisma also was the partner in the first of those satellite clinics, founded in an effort to increase access to brain-related disease research and cutting-edge treatments in rural areas. The clinic, located in Winnsboro, opened two years ago.
Prisma-based locations in Sumter and Seneca followed the Winnsboro clinic.
Plus, Lexington Health is USC’s partner for a clinic in West Columbia. HopeHealth is the partner for clinics in Orangeburg and Darlington.
Since opening the clinic network has seen more than 1,000 patients, and the demand keeps increasing.
USC runs the network with $5 million in taxpayer dollars annually. The college is seeking an additional $1.5 annually in the upcoming budget packaged to cover the cost of the Prisma contract and add more rural clinics. The school has yet to determine the locations of those additional clinics, USC spokesman Jeff Stensland said.
The main brain health clinic is located a half mile from the site of USC’s new $300 million School of Medicine campus, set for completion in 2027, and a $350 million neurological hospital and rehabilitation center planned for downtown Columbia’s BullStreet District.
The Legislature provided $150 million this year toward the specialized hospital for neurological diseases. USC is seeking an additional $25.5 million annually to cover hospital operations.
Prior state budgets collectively provided about $200 million toward building the new medical school. Now, USC is asking legislators to set aside an additional $90 million so it can add a new pharmacy school to the medical campus as well.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/braincenter-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Democratic Governors Association, released a joint statement Thursday saying the Trump administration had “unleashed chaos and division in Minnesota.” They later urged Republican governors to also speak against Trump’s threat of military action. 
“Communities across the nation are on edge after a woman was killed and a man was shot. Threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act is reckless and dangerous,” the governors said. 
Protests in the state followed a fatal shooting by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross, who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in south Minneapolis last week. 
Another shooting of a man by an ICE agent Wednesday evening in Minneapolis increased tensions. 
Trump said on Truth Social Thursday that if Minnesota’s “corrupt politicians” did not “stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.,” he would invoke the Insurrection Act to send in the military to stop protests. The 19th century law grants an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from performing domestic law enforcement.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, is among officials in the state who have called for the federal government to withdraw ICE agents.

“Our country is too divided. In moments like these, real leaders do the right thing and bring people together. You can’t do that by attacking states,” Beshear and Whitmer said. 
“We stand with Governor Walz, who has made it clear that violence is not acceptable and is calling to lower the temperature,” they continued. “We also call on our country’s Republican governors to join us in defending states’ rights by speaking out against these threats for a chaotic and un-American federal takeover.”
Last week, Beshear was critical of the Trump administration’s initial response to the shooting of Good calling it “grossly irresponsible.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0465-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 16:57:22.688440

“Nobody’s looking at the bookkeepers,” Lock said.
That’s her job now.
Lock’s position was created after lawmakers passed Senate Bill 60 last year, which expanded the auditor’s access and investigative authority to monitor state spending.
The state Attorney General’s Office has prosecuted numerous cases of criminal activity by state employees over the past two years. One former Department of Social Services employee, Lonna Carroll, was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of $1.8 million from the state across multiple years. In response, lawmakers have called on state offices and departments to improve their internal controls and oversight.
State Auditor Rich Sattgast introduced Lock to the legislative budget committee on Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Lock reviews bookkeeping processes, checks that new hire background checks are performed, and analyzes day-to-day operations to ensure dual controls, separation of duties and other financial controls are in place. She also meets with the fiscal employees in person.
“We want to be sure that the people who actually have access to our state funds are continuously monitored,” Lock told lawmakers.
Sattgast added that Lock will be instrumental in analyzing data from agencies and identifying anomalies or changes to spending. Lock formerly served as the finance officer for the South Dakota Governor’s Office of Economic Development and as an investment accountant for the South Dakota Investment Council.
Information Lock needs in her role will be easier to access once the Bureau of Finance and Management’s Project Bison financial reporting software is online, Lock said. 
State officials outline new safeguards after string of employee criminal cases

Project Bison, which replaces South Dakota’s more than 35-year-old financial reporting system, is expected to come online in July, Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger said.
“We expect greater efficiencies. We expect having better controls in place from a technology perspective,” Terwilliger said. “That’s something that we work with the State Auditor’s Office on. When it comes to issuing payments, a lot of that will be streamlined electronically.”
In addition to the multimillion-dollar upgrade to the financial reporting system, the bureau leads the state’s Internal Control Board and initiative. Terwilliger told lawmakers that the board reviews procedures and processes to prevent future fraud.
“This has been a multi-year effort in terms of establishing a statewide, consistent framework that’s documented in a consistent manner,” Terwilliger said.

(Photo by Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered the Muscatine County Jail to release an ICE detainee who had been incarcerated for almost a year after a judge ruled in his favor on an asylum request.
Court records indicate Jose Yugar-Cruz, 36, entered the United States in July 2024 after fleeing his home country of Bolivia. In court filings, Yugar-Cruz alleged that while living in Bolivia, he operated a small business and had “refused to facilitate the drug trade by police officials” who then detained him and tortured him.
In the court filings, Yugar-Cruz said he fled to Mexico, entered the United States on foot at the Arizona border, and then “sought out and surrendered” himself to federal immigration officials. He was then taken into custody and jailed, after which he applied for asylum based on the threat of persecution in Bolivia.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In December 2024, a federal immigration judge held a hearing on Yugar-Cruz’s asylum request. According to a lawsuit Yugar-Cruz filed four weeks ago against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and various Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the judge ruled in January 2025 that the U.S. government could not send Yugar-Cruz back to Bolivia due to the ongoing threat of torture.
The judge granted Yugar-Cruz “withholding-of-removal relief” — a form of protection for individuals who face persecution if returned to their home country. It prevents the U.S. government from deporting an individual to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.
In his lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz asserted the government never appealed the immigration judge’s ruling and so he “expected that he would soon be released from detention and allowed to start his life in the United States.”
In February 2025, however, Yugar-Cruz was still being held in the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center in Albert Lea, Minn. While there, the lawsuit claimed, he spoke to ICE officials who first indicated he’d be released in “15 days or so,” but later informed him they would continue to hold him while looking for some third-party country to which he could be deported.
The lawsuit alleged ICE officials proposed that Yugar-Cruz be deported to Argentina, Chile or Paraguay, all of which border Bolivia, but Yugar-Cruz objected, noting that Bolivians, including the police, can easily travel to those countries without a passport. Mexico was proposed as an alternative, but Yugar-Cruz expressed concern officials there would simply deport him to Bolivia.
Lawsuit cites Trump policy on deportations 
On Dec. 3, 2025, Yugar-Cruz was transferred from the Albert Lea jail to the Muscatine County Jail in Iowa.
Nine days later, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney sued the Muscatine County jail administrator, as well as Noem and other Homeland Security officials, alleging they were violating federal law by continuing to detain Yugar-Cruz 11 months after the immigration judge had ruled in his favor.
As part of that lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney noted the Trump administration had adopted a practice of deporting people to third-party countries with no guarantee those individuals wouldn’t immediately be sent to their home country, where they faced persecution or torture.
A federal judge in the District of Columbia has ruled the practice amounts to a “widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.”
In recent months, the administration has deported at least 20 individuals to Eswatini and other African nations where they’ve reportedly been jailed indefinitely at maximum-security prisons without charges and without access to legal counsel.
None of the individuals originated from those African countries. They had been convicted of crimes in the United States, but had served their sentences and were released before being detained by ICE and then deported over the objections of human rights organizations.
Yugar-Cruz has no criminal record, according to his attorney’s court filings. His lawsuit alleged violations of his due process rights and the Immigration Nationality Act, and sought his immediate release from the Muscatine County Jail.
Recently, after the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged the federal government had been attempting, without success, to find a third-party country to accept Yugar-Cruz, District Court Judge Stephen H. Locher ruled in Yugar-Cruz’s favor.
Locher ordered the Muscatine County Jail to work with ICE officials in securing Yugar-Cruz’s immediate release and, on Jan. 7, 2026, ICE officials confirmed for the court that Yugar-Cruz had been discharged from the county jail.
His release remains subject to “reasonable conditions of supervision” by ICE, according to Locher’s order.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is auditing Hennepin Healthcare, which operates Minnesota’s largest safety net hospital, for compliance with immigrant employment eligibility laws.
A memo from hospital leaders to staff on Thursday obtained by the Reformer says DHS issued a subpoena on Jan. 8 for Hennepin Healthcare’s I-9 forms, which are required by federal law to verify workers’ identities and employment eligibility. The documents include workers’ full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers and employment eligibility documentation.
“We are complying with this legal requirement, as failure to do so could result in civil or criminal penalties,” the memo says, which is signed by co-interim administrators J. Kevin Croston and David Hough.
Homeland Security did not respond to a Reformer email seeking comment.
The subpoena was issued less than a week after a Hennepin County commissioner and state legislators showed up at HCMC to tell ICE agents to leave the bedside of a patient they had been guarding despite not having a judicial warrant, according to immigrant advocacy group Unidos MN.
Unidos MN held a news conference with HCMC staff and elected officials on Jan. 6, blasting the ICE agents’ behavior, saying the patient was denied family visits and shackled to the bed.
ICE agents have been guarding another patient around the clock for more than a week over the objections of medical staff, according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
Hennepin County Commissioner Angela Conley called the employment audit a “retaliatory move,” in a news conference on Wednesday with other local elected leaders.
“ICE agents have occupied our safety-net hospital for the last week,” Conley said. “They have been asked to leave multiple times given that there has been no judicially signed warrant presented to hospital leadership.”
Earlier this week, Hennepin County Board commissioners voted unanimously to condemn ICE and called for their removal from Minnesota.
Hennepin Healthcare is far from alone in facing government scrutiny, as the Trump administration carries out an unprecedented immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, with more than 2,000 federal agents on the ground in what DHS calls its largest operation ever.
Homeland Security Investigations is issuing a torrent of subpoenas to small and medium-sized businesses for employment records, according to immigration attorneys who spoke to the Star Tribune.
Michael Davis, an attorney specializing in immigration law, told the paper he’s handling several cases a week when he would usually only see a handful each year. He said businesses are being hit with heavy fines for simple paperwork errors.
“This is part of the administration’s overall effort not just to ensure compliance, but to make it more difficult for businesses to operate,” Davis said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_9579-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

This is the prepared text of Gov. Jared Polis’ 2026 State of the State address to the Colorado General Assembly, which he delivered at about 11 a.m., Jan. 15.
Your Excellencies Madam Speaker and President Coleman, and Minority Leaders Caldwell and Simpson, thank you, welcome to my final State of the State address. I am truly humbled to be here as your Honorable Governor. It has been such an honor to be your Governor.
To my family, who have been on this journey since day one. Thank you, Marlon, for your unwavering support and for your inspiring work as Colorado’s First Gentleman on animal protection, recycling and composting, voter participation, and LGBTQ rights, and for being an incredible father to our children. I know you’re relieved that we are nearing the end. To my mom and dad, who have been here every step of the way. My sister and brother, who are amazing. To my kids, you should be in school!
To my friend and partner on this long journey, my Lieutenant Governor, Dianne Primavera. Thank you for all you do every single day to serve our state. Your strong moral compass, passion and strength have been an inspiration to our administration and helped us to navigate so many hard issues. Our state is better because of your service.
To my chiefs of staff, Lisa, Rick, Alec, David, thank you for steering the ship with joy, fortitude, and steadfast dedication to our fellow Coloradans.
And to my senior staff, cabinet, and our incredible team across state government who have contributed to my administration, thank you. It is with your expertise and commitment to service that we’ve achieved even bigger and bolder than we could have imagined.
Seven years ago, I stepped up to the plate as your Governor: baseball aficionado, gamer, tech geek, a head mostly full of hair, ever-hopeful Rockies fan, well, hopeful back then.
At the time, I certainly couldn’t have predicted all that we would face as a state and a nation.
There’s all that we planned and worked for to put Colorado ahead of the curve. Shared achievements like:
Delivering on the promise of free kindergarten and preschool, saving families thousands and giving our youngest learners a strong start.
Building out low-cost clean energy for more Coloradans to save money on energy bills, protecting our air and water, and creating good-paying jobs.








Making it easier and more affordable – even free in many cases – to get the skills needed to get a good job.
Breaking down barriers to housing for Coloradans at every budget. Getting rid of the Budget Stabilization Factor and fully funding our schools.
Cutting income taxes three times and property taxes five times while supercharging the earned income and child tax credits. Establishing the Family Affordability Tax Credit, which helped cut child poverty rates by nearly 41%. Today, Colorado boasts the lowest childhood poverty rate in the nation.
Generating more than $470 million each year in new funding for our roads, bridges, and transit – with the vast majority of that funding going to roads and bridges.
There’s the “pinch me” moments, when we seized opportunity and we called our shot to deliver monumental achievements for Colorado.
Becoming the new home of the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival.
Keeping the Broncos in Denver with the revitalization of Burnham Yard.
Standing atop Fishers Peak, Colorado’s 42nd state park.
Bringing the M-L-B All-Star game to Colorado, boosting our economy as the world recovered from the pandemic.
Receiving Colorado’s first COVID vaccine shipment, marking a historic scientific achievement and the return to life lived together.
Celebrating President Biden’s designation of Camp Hale as a national monument, an effort I helped begin more than 15 years ago during my time in Congress. First Pup Gia, who is also here with us today, accompanied me to that signing. The Denver Post front page picture celebrating the new monument featured Gia front and center!
Earning national recognition as the epicenter of quantum computing technology.
And then, there’s the curveballs that come with the job. The unforeseen events that altered and shaped the trajectory of our state forever.
COVID was unlike anything we’d ever faced before. While the world plunged into uncertainty, we came together to support our brave and dedicated doctors, nurses, and frontline workers, and charted a path forward to chart hospital capacity.
At the height of the pandemic, we held three press conferences a week to help explain to Coloradans frankly what we knew – and what we didn’t know, too. Leading with data and science, we shared the most up-to-date information to empower Coloradans to make informed decisions, weigh their risks, and choose how to best protect themselves and their families.








And when Washington told states to figure it out for themselves, we all stepped up for Colorado. We quickly expanded life-saving tests, PPE, and when they were finally available, thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, vaccines too. and pushed hard to be one of the first states to safely get our schools and economy back up and running.
With the expertise of our Department of Public Health and Environment Director Dr. Jill Ryan and her team, and my then Chief of Staff Lisa Kaufmann, Colorado led the country in wastewater testing, and made it easier and quicker for Coloradans to get a COVID test. I am proud we had among the quickest vaccine uptakes of any state.
In the middle of it all, we came together to deliver on the promises we made long before the pandemic hit. Democrats, Republicans, and my Administration all worked together to keep Coloradans safe while at the same time, passing free preschool and historic transportation funding. When we work together, we do big things.
And because 2020 was the year that kept on giving, we also faced the three largest wildfires in the history of our state. The next year, we faced the Marshall Fire, the most destructive fire in Colorado history. I want to recognize and thank Department of Public Safety Director Stan Hilkey, Director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention & Control Mike Morgan, Director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Kevin Klein, Chief of the Colorado State Patrol Matt Packard, Colorado National Guard Adjunct General (and now-acting CPW director – thank you for coming out of retirement) Laura Clellan, and the many, many more Coloradans involved for their steady, skilled leadership through Colorado’s most trying times.
We witnessed horrific mass shootings at the STEM School in Highlands Ranch, Club Q in Colorado Springs, King Soopers in Boulder, and most recently at Evergreen High School. We endured a horrific antisemitic attack on Pearl Street Mall in Boulder.
And grief has also struck right here in our State Capitol, with the sudden and tragic passings of our colleagues Senator Faith Winter and Minority Leader Hugh McKean.
To honor their legacy and all we’ve lost, the work continues. As Faith would say, we will “lift as we rise.”
For all of us here, we’re going to bat for Colorado’s future, to leave our great state even better than we found it.
Seven years ago, some thought our bold goals were far-fetched. I’ve got the receipts, I mean headlines, doubting if I’d be able to get it all done.
From 2019: Will Polis Get Full-Day Kindergarten, Or Will Colorado Give Another Flaky Promise? One year later, headlines read: Colorado’s Free, Full-Day Kindergarten Boosted Enrollment By Nearly 25%.
In my first year, the intrepid reporters at the Colorado Sun published a tracker of my campaign promises. 9News even wrote a song about it!








Now, I appreciate their help holding us accountable for our bold goals. Although, I did notice they stopped keeping track because it’s not as exciting when we keep delivering on our promises.
But for me, it’s always been about delivering real results, not headlines. To me, politics is simple: you say what you’re going to do, and then you do it.
We posted a transparent dashboard to share month-by-month updates with Coloradans on our progress delivering wildly important goals – what we call WIGs – for each agency. We are bringing ease and convenience to government services with mobile DMV offerings and the myColorado app, used by nearly 2 million Coloradans.
And when it comes to turning my bold agenda into a better daily life for Coloradans, we haven’t always succeeded on our first try. But we’ve always stepped back up to the plate – because that’s what we do in Colorado.
We are in this work to make life better, more affordable, safer for all Coloradans.
Meanwhile, over the past 12 months, it seems Washington is in it to break it all down. To make life harder and less affordable. To make Americans feel more fearful, more belligerent, more vulnerable.
In the last month alone, the Trump administration has threatened over $1 billion in funding for Colorado, and is making life more expensive and more difficult across our state.
Mean cuts target short-term support for the most basic and essential needs for Colorado families and threaten child care support that Colorado families and child care centers rely on. The President denied two major disaster relief requests for the Lee and Elk fires and devastating flooding in Western Colorado, hurting Coloradans and our recovery efforts, and went on to veto Lauren Boebert, Michael Bennet, and John Hickenlooper’s unanimous, bipartisan bill to finally complete the pipeline providing clean water to rural Colorado, a project first promised under JFK. All while threatening to dismantle NCAR, a global leader in weather and global sciences, and a crown jewel of American scientific achievement.
That’s before you get to the devastating impacts HR 1 had on our state, gutting our state budget by $1 billion overnight, eliminating Coloradans’ TABOR refunds, and slashing Medicaid and SNAP.
All the while, tariff taxes on Coloradans are driving up costs on everything from groceries to medicine. Trump’s tariffs alone are expected to cost Coloradans on average $1,700 for a single year. Tariffs hurt all of us, and make it unaffordable to live.
Since day one, we’ve worked together to save Coloradans money. To strengthen international trade and make our state the best place to start and grow a business.
Four years ago, I stood here and sang about finding 50 ways to save Coloradans money, and we went on to deliver over 100. We’re saving the average Colorado family of four over $600 dollars a year on income and property taxes, and last year Colorado taxpayers saved nearly $2.5 billion.








Just as we came together during the special session to close corporate tax loopholes, I am hopeful that we can come together again to cut the income tax rate.
We are fighting – hard – to protect every federal dollar owed to Colorado. In partnership with Attorney General Weiser, the state has successfully defended nearly $900 million.
But there’s over $1 billion more lost or at risk from illegal Trump administration cuts.
Washington Republicans – once the self-proclaimed party of states’ rights and small government – today are too often the party of socialism, overreach, and intrusion into people’s daily lives in ways wholly out of the scope of government. Picking corporate winners and losers, co-opting capitalism with cronyism. It often feels like Big Government is in our wallets, our doctor’s offices, in our homes, bullying businesses of all sizes.
This is not the Colorado Way.
Driving up costs with tariff taxes is not the Colorado Way.
Ripping away critical food and health access is not the Colorado Way.
Tearing families apart with a costly and cruel immigration agenda is not the Colorado Way.
Today, nearly 75% of people held in immigration detention centers have no criminal history. In America in 2026, a culture of fear and chaos means families debate going to work or sending their kids to school out of fear they won’t come home. The words on the Statue of Liberty beckoning those who come to “breathe free” ring hollow against the cruel realities we are facing today.
This is not who we are. Since day one, I’ve worked to build a Colorado for All.
It’s a mission that reflects our shared commitment to a compassionate, kind Colorado for everyone, and one that I hope and trust will continue well beyond my administration.
In the words of Aurora Smoky Hill High School graduate Bowen Yang, “the only way forward is to be joyous and to celebrate each other.”
At a time when Washington is peddling the illusion that America somehow isn’t for everyone – that somehow there’s only room for some – some people, some beliefs, some love, some prayer – I want to make it clear:
In our Colorado for All, there is room – and opportunity – for all of us.
In our Colorado for All, we welcome immigrants and refugees who seek to build a better life here, who strengthen our economy and enrich our communities under the shelter of our democracy.
In our Colorado for All, an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.








In our Colorado for All, we safeguard our fundamental freedoms, protecting the right to be who you are, marry who you love, and choose when or if to start a family.
There is space in our great big hexahectaenneacontakaiheptagonal state for all of us. We are a state of adventure seekers chasing mountain peaks and fresh powder, of wide-eyed entrepreneurs, artists, devout Coloradans of faith, poets, vegans, soccer moms and ultimate frisbee dads, hunters and union workers, farmers and ranchers, and yes, immigrants and refugees.
We respect our differences, and we are stronger and better off because of our rich diversity. In our Colorado for All, hope and kindness are part of our DNA.
The legacy of Jane Goodall, who had a special place in her heart for Colorado, lives on, as we take inspiration from her words, “hope does not deny evil, but is a response to it.”
Hateful and divisive rhetoric rarely stops at just words. We are seeing online vitriol spill over into horrific violence, including right here on our doorstep.
Enough is enough.
We refuse to sit idly by as a culture of targeting our fellow human beings festers in this country that we love.
In words and actions, we must reject the politics of division and the poison of blind hatred by doubling down on respect, kindness, compassion, and truly learn to disagree better.
These are the values that also guide our solidarity with those around the world fighting for freedom as we speak, in Iran and Venezuela, and in solidarity with the brave Ukrainian people in their continued fight against Russian aggression.
In my first State of the State address, I shared a story of a conversation Marlon and I had with our kids. Our then-6 year-old wanted to know the difference between the various political parties. And at the end, he went over to his four year old sister and asked, “What political party are you in?” And without missing a beat, she answered, “the Happy Birthday Party.”
Colorado’s kids are wise in ways that we could all use a little more of.
This year, we will celebrate our state’s 150th birthday, and our country’s 250th. Let’s come together and honor these historic milestones, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as the Happy Birthday Party.
Housing
And we head into our special birthday tackling our shared challenges. Coloradans – of all political stripes, in every part of our state – tell us that the high cost of housing makes it harder to live in the Colorado we love.
In “Field of Dreams,” starring Colorado Rancher Kevin Costner, the wind whispers, “if you build it, he will come.” Or, as we say, if you build it, opportunity will come.








For too long, we’ve run up against roadblocks – from outdated laws to piles of paperwork – that slow or stop new housing, new transit, and new clean energy from even being built.
It reminds me of the words of Taylor Swift and, maybe Kevin Bommer too – “I’ll sue you if you step on my lawn.”
Not us – we say, let us build!
We’ve empowered Coloradans with the freedom to build an ADU on their property, and let homeowners – not the government – make decisions about how much parking is needed, thanks to the bipartisan work of Senators Amabile, Hinrichsen, Exum, Mullica, and Representative Weinberg.
The benefits are even greater than we could have imagined, just ask Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker whose mother-in-law now lives in an ADU in his own backyard!
We’ve unlocked more housing near transit, opened the door to single – or smart – stair homes, and broken down barriers to lower-cost modular housing, tackled by Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, and Woodrow, alongside Senators Ball and Bridges.
And at long last, we tackled construction defects liability to build more condos, unlocking the promise of homeownership for more Coloradans thanks to the work of President Coleman and Senator Roberts.
We put our skin in the game: speeding up contracting times through the Department of Local Affairs, with the department now turning around contracts for new housing in 33 days, down from 61 days a year before. Under Maria De Cambra’s leadership in partnership with the Housing Consortium, we launched the innovative housing hub to make it easier to apply for affordable rental housing tax credits.
We stood up the Educator First Housing initiative to help 3,000 teachers buy their first home thanks to the work of Senators Amabile and Frizell and Representative Lukens.
Through Proposition 123, we’ve built over 10,000 new homes across the state, including in rural communities who are building state-supported affordable housing for the first time.
And there’s more to be done.
As Colorado-born Ji-Young Yoo, the voice of the iconic Zoey in KPop Demon Hunters says, “I do have one idea… Actually, 57, but let’s start with my favorite.” I share Zoey’s enthusiasm when I think of the 57 – or maybe even more – ways we can unlock more housing at lower cost.
This year, we want to ensure local governments have the resources they need to build and improve bus and train stations, and to pair these investments with more housing near transit. I want to thank Speaker McCluskie, Representative Woodrow, and Senators Roberts and Exum for taking this on.
The Housing Opportunities Made Easier, or HOME Act, will open the door to more housing by partnering with higher education, nonprofits, transit agencies, school districts, and housing authorities to build on underutilized land. With Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, Representative Mabrey and Senators Exum and Gonzales leading the way, these steps are expected to significantly cut down on building times for new housing.








Coloradans are eager to be a part of the housing solution. For example, in Edwards, the Eagle County School District opened up Miller Flats Apartments with 37 homes for district employees conveniently located near schools, parks, and transit.
We’ve given homeowners the freedom to do more with their property. It’s only the start. By making it easier to subdivide and sell your property, we can boost the supply of affordable starter homes and help Coloradans to stay in their homes.
Together, we’ve worked hard to make the senior homestead exemption flexible and portable, help seniors downsize and free up homes for young families. We can and must make good on our promise to seniors by funding the senior homestead exemption this year.
Doing so will require finding $200 million dollars in one time funding this year. Converting Pinnacol is the way to shore up our workers compensation system to better protect workers, ensure Pinnacol can compete and thrive in today and tomorrow’s marketplace, provide some relief with the budget shortfall, and make good on our bipartisan promise to seniors.
Once you have a home you can afford, keeping up with the costs that come with it is the next challenge. That starts with homeowners insurance which costs too much.
This year we must bring homeowners insurance rates down. Costs continue to skyrocket, up 91% or an average of $2,000 since 2019, and Coloradans in wildfire prone areas are having a harder time even finding insurance.
There are tools at our fingertips that can help bring down homeowners insurance rates.
While we might not tackle the entire challenge overnight, it’s long past time we start, with steps like making hail resistant roofs more affordable, and reducing fire risks, we can drive down claims and lower premiums. Thank you Speaker McCluskie, Representative Brown, Senators Amabile and Snyder, for taking on this urgent issue.
The more we do here to bring down costs, the more opportunity opens up for Coloradans in the ways that matter most – where we live, and how we spend our time and money.
Transit
Five months into my time as Governor, an 8.5 million pound boulder fell smack dab in the middle of Highway 145 just outside of Dolores, Colorado, leaving an eight foot trench in the middle of the road.
When I learned that it would cost the state $200,000 more to get rid of the rock than to reroute the highway I found another way.
I’m a rock tumbling enthusiast, much to Marlon’s chagrin – for those who aren’t familiar, check it out! But there was no way to tumble this particular rock. And so, heeding the wise words of the Beatles, we “let it be.”
This is the same common-sense I’ve used to make it easier, safer, and more affordable to get around our state, whether you choose to do so by car, bike, foot, bus, or train.








Today, getting around takes up too much of Coloradans’ budgets and time, and puts out too much pollution. We’re showing that there’s a better way forward for Coloradans, one with more choices and greater convenience.
We’ve re-paved 2,500 miles of roads in the past five years alone. Under the leadership of CDOT director Shoshana Lew, we’ve tackled long-neglected projects including Floyd Hill, to finally get drivers over Floyd Hill safely and quickly, taking away the scary drive that too many of us can relate to going to or from our incredible Rocky Mountains.
When I took office in 2019, there were 18,000 electric vehicles driving around Colorado, our energy office director Will Toor was one of those early adopters! Today, Will no longer feels lonely, with more than 204,000 electric cars on Colorado’s roads. We’re #1 nationally for percentage of electric vehicle sales, and by embracing these clean, quiet, fun to drive cars, we’ve cut emissions by nearly 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
Folks: we got all of this done because of policy.
Working with Senator Weissman, we want to make it even more affordable to get an electric vehicle by directing savings to lower-cost electric vehicles.
The lion’s share of additional transportation funding we’ve secured has gone to roads and bridges. But we know we can’t just build our way out of the congestion that is robbing too many Coloradans of our free time and money.
That is why we’ve also supercharged state support for transit.
We are blazing a trail on cost-efficient passenger rail, and we’re doing it in record time. With a new lease and access agreement to begin Mountain Passenger Rail service through the Moffat Tunnel, we are turning the promise of daily, year-round service from Denver to Craig into a reality with the first routes from Denver to Granby kicking off about a year from now.
Looking to the Front Range, we are on the precipice of delivering a joint service partnership from Denver to Fort Collins, working closely with CDOT, RTD, and local governments to get Front Range Passenger Rail across the finish line.
I want to thank Lisa Kaufmann for her amazing work on passenger rail, and before that she thought being Chief of Staff was a hard job!
The success of Bustang, Snowstang, Pegasus, and Outrider show that Coloradans have a big appetite for reliable, affordable bus transit options. In the past five years alone, Bustang ridership has increased fivefold to reach nearly 2.3 million riders to date.
Bustang now runs 20 routes, with lower fares and exciting partnerships with iconic Colorado events, like the X Games. And we are pursuing long- term sustainable funding so Bustang can continue to grow, providing even better service to even more Coloradans now and in the future.
We’ve made major progress. But the reality is, until we have a world-class metro area transit agency with RTD, we simply cannot meet our climate or affordability goals. This begins with governance changes, increased accountability and transparency, and a stronger partnership between the cities it serves and the transit agency. I want to thank Senators Ball and Jodeh,








Representative Froelich, and the late Senator Winter along with Maria Garcia Berry and the accountability committee for putting together a thoughtful and effective approach for how we can realize a world-class transit agency.
Now, letting our Broncos leave Denver would have been like getting an invite to Taylor Swift’s ‘s wedding and saying no – Which is to say, not an option, And by the way, Taylor – I’m an excellent officiant, just ask Allie Kimmel.
In all seriousness, the revitalization of Burnham Yard, one of our state’s most historic properties, lays the groundwork for an amazing hub with multimodal transit, shops, restaurants, and entertainment, and of course, the A-F-C-West Champion Denver Broncos. We look forward to beating the Bills this Saturday, and – hopefully – hosting a Super Bowl parade in February.
We are looking at every piece of the puzzle to make it safer and more affordable to get where you need to go. Today, high auto insurance rates – the 5th highest nationally – lead to far too many uninsured drivers, making our roads less safe for all and further driving up rates.
That’s why I launched the Roadmap to Reduce Auto Insurance Premiums, an action plan to improve road safety and lower auto insurance costs.
And by more than doubling the number of wildlife crossings statewide to more than 70, including the world’s largest in Greenland – no, not that Greenland, Greenland, Colorado, leave the other Greenland alone! – we’re reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions by 90%.
We’re putting the days of too much time spent in traffic, too much money to get around, and too much pollution in the rearview mirror, pushing past the way it is to achieve the way it can be.
Education
Twenty-six years ago, I was driving around the state in an old school bus campaigning for the State Board of Education, demanding more investment in Colorado schools to ensure every student could get a high quality education and thrive.
My passion for education is what drew me into public service after starting my career as an entrepreneur, and is what continues to drive my work as Governor.
There are so many ways we can build a bright future for Colorado and almost all of them begin with education. Education is about opportunity and hope.
Colorado students today get a strong start with free preschool and free full day kindergarten, thanks to Representative Sirota and Senator Bridges.
Students head into fully funded schools thanks to our work with the JBC. Indicators of class size are down by one student today from when I first took office – and average teacher pay is up over $13,000 dollars per year.
If you visit a Colorado classroom today, as I did this week in Colorado Springs, you might notice something special about Colorado’s first and third graders. These classes include the first group of Colorado students to go to free preschool and free full day kindergarten.
I’ve met a lot of them in our schools and usually their first question is ‘who are YOU?!,’ sometimes followed by, “I want to be governor when I grow up!”








When I started out as Governor, going to kindergarten for a full day of school, and going to preschool at all was treated like a bonus, not a necessity.
But the data speaks so clearly otherwise.
High-quality early education prevents achievement gaps, and helps with reading, math, and long term success in school, all while saving families $6,300 a year on preschool and $500 a month on full day kindergarten.
Colorado families eagerly raised their hands to sign up for preschool and kindergarten, catapulting Colorado from 27th nationally for preschool enrollment to third under the leadership of Dr. Lisa Roy.
And today, 98% of kindergarteners take advantage of free-full day kindergarten.
We’ve dedicated historic funding to Colorado classrooms, increasing funding per student from just over $8,000 in 2019 to nearly $12,000 today, and finally with the leadership of Speaker McCluskie, Assistant Minority Leader Bacon, and the Joint Budget Committee, tackled the beast – the Budget Stabilization Factor that for more than a decade hamstrung our schools with too little funding.
At the same time, we’ve worked to protect school funding and the services Coloradans rely on from a rainy day or recession. When I took office, the state’s budget reserves were at 7.25% and today, we’re in the double digits with 13% in the bank.
While our reserves took a minor dip after President Trump and Congress torched our budget last year, we’re on track to get our reserves back up to 15% in the coming years.
In Colorado, we’re doing our part to help our talented, hardworking educators do what they do best: shaping the next generation of learners and leaders.
Each of us can remember a teacher, or likely several, who helped us become who we are today. I want to thank all of the teachers here today, and across Colorado, for your incredible contributions to our state now and into the future.
Workforce
A good education gives students a head start right out of the box, and high-quality skills and workforce development help Coloradans cross home plate to a good job.
Last year, Colorado high school students enrolled in a record 146,000 courses through our Community College System, earning college credit before graduating and saving over $71 million in tuition costs.
Today we are joined by Mariah, a Nursing student at CSU Pueblo. Thanks to concurrent enrollment opportunities, Mariah earned two credentials and completed the first three years of her Bachelor’s, while still in high school at Swallows Charter Academy in Pueblo. And today, Mariah is working in an ICU in Colorado Springs while completing her studies. Welcome, Mariah!








Through the bipartisan National Governors Association, my Chair Initiative: Let’s Get Ready: Educating All Americans for Success, kickstarted a long-overdue national conversation about how we better connect the skills students get in school with those that lead to a good job.
Now, we are putting the lessons learned from Let’s Get Ready into practice. Alongside six other states, led by both Democratic and Republican governors, we are tracking student readiness in real-time with a new dashboard to more accurately and quickly evaluate if students are ready for and successful at what comes next.
We’re saving Coloradans money with free and low-cost training opportunities, and making the first two years of college free for many Coloradans, thanks to the bipartisan work of Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Taggart, Senators Kirkmeyer and Mullica.
As one of the largest employers in the state, we’re leading by example by hiring for the right skills instead of the right degree, putting an end to the days where good candidates were turned away just because they don’t have a college degree.
Our workforce investments are bold, innovative, and nation leading. And while there’s a lot to be proud of, it’s not enough.
People change jobs more frequently nowadays.
And yet, our job training system is not working for every Coloradan. It’s a maze of more than 20 divisions, offices, and units across seven state departments. The 110 programs available have different eligibility requirements, applications, and outcome measures. I will now read the names of all 110 workforce programs. There will be a quiz at the end.
But seriously, if even I can’t name them all, how can we expect everyday Coloradans trying to get ahead to figure out how to navigate this maze?
Transformative results require bold action. That is why we are calling for a unified department to serve as a one-stop-shop for Coloradans to access high-quality skills, training, apprenticeships, and education. This bipartisan effort led by Speaker McCluskie, Representative Taggart, and Senators Bridges and Frizell is truly poised to unlock opportunity and prosperity for all Coloradans.
Helping Coloradans get job-ready is another way we are making Colorado the best place to work and do business. Today, we are proudly home to a robust business-friendly ecosystem, ranked the top state for female entrepreneurs three years in a row, and fourth best business environment overall by US News and World Report. With Eve Lieberman at the helm of our Office of Economic Development and International Trade, companies continue to thrive in Colorado. Businesses like Boom Supersonic, a $1.5 billion dollar company that started in a Denver basement and is now building a supersonic passenger jet that could get from Denver to London in just over five hours.
My own career is one that in its earliest days was shaped by the promise of emerging technology – at the time, internet 1.0 – when I launched an internet service provider from my college dorm room. This experience taught me a lot about how technology is a tool that can and must be used to maximize opportunity and innovation.








Along those same lines, AI has tremendous potential – but I assure you, did not write this speech! We must act thoughtfully to embrace innovation while empowering consumers.
Today, we are called upon to ensure Colorado remains a leading state for artificial intelligence for both businesses and consumers. Now is the time to get this done in a way that drives innovation and protects Coloradans.
In my time as Governor, one of the greatest honors has been serving alongside the talented men and women who work for state government. We are so fortunate to have such passionate, dedicated Coloradans working across the state, taking on the most difficult challenges we face, and bringing creativity and a commitment to service to their work every single day.
Today, I am honored to be joined by Fidela Jacquez, one of our longest serving state employees whose nearly 50 years in service to Coloradans across the Departments of Public Safety, Transportation, and Revenue, and mentorship of her fellow state employees, has and will continue to make a huge impact on our state now and into the future.
Our efforts to support Colorado’s hardworking and dedicated state employees is further strengthened by our work with Colorado WINS, led by Hilary Glasgow. Thank you Hilary and your team, including President Diane Byrne here with us today, for your passionate advocacy on behalf of our workforce, and for our partnership throughout my governorship.
Health care
Since day one, I’ve taken on special interests and tackled challenges that critics said could never be solved.
When it comes to health care, I would measure our accomplishments against any state in the nation.
Under the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera and our Office of Saving People Money on Health Care, we’ve tallied nearly three billion dollars in savings for Coloradans even as national costs went up tens of billions of dollars more.
We partnered with bipartisan legislators including Patrick Neville and Pueblo’s own Daneya Esgar on our nation-leading hospital price transparency law. We passed the landmark Colorado Option and bipartisan reinsurance alongside Speaker McCluskie, Senators Jodeh, Rich, and Roberts. We brought Republicans and Democrats together to put an end to surprise billing. We’ve made six behavioral health care sessions free for Coloradans under 18 with Senator Michaelson Jenet. Thanks to the efforts of Senators Gonzales and Weissman, Representatives Froelich and Zokaie, we built in needed protections to assure Coloradans that if they are in need of emergency care and their doctor recommends an abortion to save their life, they will not be turned away.
With the leadership of Division of Insurance Commissioner Mike Conway, we created a first-in-the-nation group that is finally capping the cost of the most expensive drugs and we know we’re on the right track, because we’ve already been sued twice by big pharma. Years before the federal government, alongside Senator Roberts we capped the price of insulin.
Despite all this – and more – we’re not where we need to be.








High-powered and well-funded corporate interests have proven to be deeply entrenched in our politics. It’s like the Avengers fighting Thanos. We are up against big hospitals, pharma, and insurance, alongside a federal government often eager to cozy up to these special interests.
Colorado’s application to import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada – thanks to the leadership of Kim Bimestefer and Senator Rodriguez – languishes in Washington, first under President Biden and now under President Trump and RFK Jr.
The reality is, the incentives are simply FUBAR. Americans are getting screwed on health care.
Today, hospitals rake in billions of dollars in profits, and actually get away with charging $5,000 for an ice pack, $600 for a bandaid, while insurance companies and pharma raise prices on consumers. I was perhaps a bit naive to think I’d be able to pull together a coalition to fight back against such absurd charges.
Too often, we fight over incremental progress, and when we stand up for systemic change, we are met with the might of the medical industrial complex and their highly effective scare tactics. I saw this firsthand when I was in Congress working to pass the Affordable Care Act, and I’ve seen it time and time again as Governor.
It’s truly mind-boggling that every other industrialized Western country in the world has figured out a way to provide universal health care at a baseline for everyone. Japan spends less than half of what America spends on health care, and their average lifespan is six years longer.
Let me be clear. Our dedicated doctors, nurses, and providers work around the clock to give Coloradans great care. Our essential safety-net hospitals – especially in rural communities – are filling the gap while fighting tooth and nail to keep their doors open, made all the more difficult with the federal government taking a sledgehammer to Medicaid.
Fixing the broken cycle is not about spending more. We’re already doing that and it ain’t working.
The federal government today makes up about half of health care payers through Medicare and Medicaid – it’s long past time the feds start negotiating with prescription drug companies and hospitals and actually drive down costs.
Instead, premiums are skyrocketing across the country after Congress failed to extend the tax credits that millions of Americans rely on to keep health care affordable. In some ways, it’s one of those $600 bandaids, but has at least prevented major increases in insurance premiums.
In Colorado, we’re doing the best with what we have by maximizing efficiency and refusing to let Medicaid, the payer we do have, fail.
The reality is that health care expenses are rising far faster than the rest of our budget. We must take action to bring Medicaid costs to a more sustainable level and protect access for the 1.2 million Coloradans who rely on Medicaid.
The numbers are stark – I almost brought my charts, but I’ll spare you. Ask a JBC member, we can’t afford to keep growing Medicaid at its current pace while still funding schools, roads, and public safety.








So let’s focus on spending less, covering more people, and getting better health outcomes.
As Babe Ruth famously said, “never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.” Let me be clear. We’ve been in the game and we’re giving it our all.
But when it comes to health care, special interests like big hospitals, big pharma, big insurance and Pharmacy Benefit Managers, are the umpires and have way too much influence to call the pitches the way they like.
We will continue fighting for Coloradans, but ultimately, we need Washington to step up and take real action on a real solution. Call it what you will – a social insurance model, multi-payer universal health care, Medicare for All, a single payer system with private insurance and care on top – no matter the jargon, the outcome is what matters: health care for everyone at lower costs.
It’s long past time Washington got on the side of hardworking Americans, and out of the pockets of special interests.
Public safety
Just like our health, our safety is also critical to being able to lead a good life.
When I set the bold goal to make Colorado one of the ten safest states in the nation, we got right to work taking data-driven, common-sense steps to prevent crime in the first place, better equip law enforcement, and crack down on crime.
We’re seeing real progress. A new report from our Division of Criminal Justice shows that In the past year, violent crime is down over 13%. Property crime is down nearly 18%, representing nearly 14,000 fewer crimes. Through targeted investments and increased penalties, we’ve achieved a 61% decrease in auto theft in four years, including a 34% drop in the last year alone. In a single year, we’ve seen a 95% decline in catalytic converter theft in Denver.
Thanks to the support of voters, we are boosting state support for local law enforcement through Proposition 130, which I proudly supported. This year, the first round of $15 million in funding will go to local law enforcement to boost recruitment, retention, and training.
We are endlessly grateful for the service, bravery, and dedication of Colorado’s law enforcement officers, veterans, and service members. I want to thank all those here with us today for serving our state and nation with pride, ensuring our safety and security.
Keeping Coloradans safe includes better preparing for, preventing, and responding to the year-round threat of wildfires. We’ve expanded Colorado’s arsenal of firefighting tools, including state-owned helicopters like the Firehawk and multi-mission aircraft, fire engines, crews, and contracted air tankers, to ensure we can act quickly and decisively whenever and wherever a fire breaks out.
Our National Guard servicemembers have been on the frontlines – on the ground and in the air – in the aftermath of Colorado’s devastating fires and floods. Always at the ready, they flew helicopters to drop water on the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires, provided real-time data on fire spread, and helped control traffic out of evacuation zones in the Marshall Fire. These are the missions that matter for our communities. I want to recognize the bravery and commitment to service that exemplify our Colorado National Guard, and show our respect for their commitment to helping Coloradans through our hardest moments.








Looking ahead, there is more work to be done to ensure all Coloradans can thrive in safe communities.
While the Trump administration leaves states in the lurch, cancelling $29 million and threatening $19 million more in safety grants owed to Colorado, we are stepping up to do what we can to fill the gap, refusing to leave our safety to chance.
My balanced budget proposal includes support to monitor and protect Coloradans against rising threats of political violence and extremism, along with support for emergency preparedness, response, and recovery to ensure we are prepared to act quickly if disaster strikes. Once again, this is work that we would normally have federal partnership on, but Washington is threatening exactly this funding.
Keeping Coloradans safe includes protecting the spaces we gather, learn, and pray. Today, over 73 non-profits including synagogues, mosques, and churches have made security upgrades with support from the Nonprofit Security grants. Our students deserve to learn free from fear. Our Office of School Safety has supported 239 projects to boost safety and emergency response at 190 schools and districts across Colorado.
Together, under the leadership of Senator Sullivan and so many others – too many to name here – we’ve taken common-sense steps to reduce gun violence while protecting our second amendment rights. The nation-leading red flag law has been enforced over 478 times to protect Coloradans and our communities. Waiting periods, safe and responsible gun storage requirements, and cracking down on ghost guns, help keep all Coloradans safe. Colorado is proud to support responsible gun ownership, including with expanded background checks and making the theft of any firearm a felony. We are protecting the rights of Coloradans to own the gun of their choice while implementing new training for rapid fire and assault-style weapons through Colorado Parks and Wildlife later this year. By cracking down on gun trafficking and illegal firearm activity, we’ve gotten 183 illegal guns off the streets.
To truly keep Colorado safe, we must urgently address gaps in our system related to those who cannot stand trial but are charged with a crime, and ensure that individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others are not just released onto the streets. My supplemental budget request includes funding for the state to work alongside local governments and the judicial branch to pursue appropriate, secure placements and services, and I am asking the legislature to move quickly to get bipartisan legislation to my desk. Thank you to Speaker McCluskie, Minority Leader Caldwell, Senator Amabile, and Minority Leader Simpson for leading bipartisan action.
Environment, clean air
Delivering real results for Coloradans is as much about our values as it is about making life easier and more affordable.
We are showing that it’s possible to cut pollution, lower costs, and spur innovation, following the demands of the market.
By cutting pollution, we are cleaning up our air in ways we can see and feel, helping to reduce bad air quality days, which are down from 65 days in 2021 to 30 days in 2025. My dad in particular appreciates that.
During my time as Governor, the share of energy Colorado gets from low-cost clean sources has grown by nearly 75%, enough power nearly 3 million homes for a year.








I am excited about bright spots like Holy Cross Energy serving Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Mesa, and Gunnison Counties. At its peak last spring, Holy Cross generated 96% of its energy from low-cost clean sources.
Meanwhile, Washington DC, is tipping the scales toward expensive, out-of-date coal production that drives up costs, pollutes our air, and subjects all of us to volatile price swings in natural gas. We saw this after the Texas winter storm which drove up energy bills for many Coloradans by nearly $20 a month for years.
In Colorado, we tackle climate challenges head on, instead of burying our heads in a pile of coal. I would say snow, but sadly snowpack this year is only 62% of average.
We’re charging forward on the plan to 100% clean energy to unlock the lowest cost clean energy for Coloradans. By 2030, more than 70% of Colorado’s electricity will come from wind and solar. But we need emerging technologies like geothermal or carbon capture to get us to 100%.
That is why we are taking action alongside Representatives Willford, Senators Weissman and Amabile to maintain the important goal of 100% clean energy while building in needed flexibility to adapt to the realities of federal headwinds.
Now is the time to double down on investment and innovation to build more of what’s needed to power our homes and businesses, including power lines and power plants.
Local governments play a key role in moving energy and transmission projects along, but there is room to grow to ensure permitting across the state is clear, fast, and consistent.
Long before my time as Governor, the oil and gas wars plagued our state. Colorado’s patchwork regulatory environment had few if any meaningful standards.
At best, Coloradans had to worry if oil and gas would be able to drill in their backyard and literally in their living rooms. For far too many Coloradans, this worry became a reality. Even today, the devastating Enterprise Pipeline gasoline spill still impacts Southern Ute Indian Tribe land, showing us the importance of safety.
In my first year as Governor, we passed the most robust regulatory framework for oil and gas in the country, moving drilling operations further from homes and schools. We drilled down to ensure that energy oversight is held to the highest standards, under the cutting-edge Energy and Carbon Management Commission, further supporting innovation in underground geothermal and carbon capture.
I want to thank ECMC Commissioner Jeff Robbins for being with us since day one, dedicating his passion, vision, and expertise to this incredible generationally-important work.
I also want to thank Erin Martinez who bravely shared her story after her home exploded from an undetected gas leak from drilling operations, tragically killing her husband and brother, and all those who paved the way to a safer future for Colorado.
The apocalyptic warnings that our gold-standard regulations would somehow shut down the oil and gas industry in Colorado have proven to be completely unfounded. Today, we have a thriving, robust industry that is electrifying and getting cleaner while adding more protections for health and safety, and is accountable to Coloradans.








We went on to bring responsible oil and gas companies and the environmental community together, preventing costly, divisive ballot measures and creating a new funding stream that moves our state from 42nd in transit funding to 23rd. This work was led by the late Senator Faith Winter, alongside Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Velasco, Willford, Froelich, Bacon and Senator Cutter.
Time and time again, we’ve worked together to tackle the complex challenges we face and chart a sustainable, affordable path forward for Colorado.
From securing our water future, to protecting our wildlife and conserving our public lands, we are taking these lessons with us to prepare for and build resilience to a hotter, drier climate.
Under the leadership of Dan Gibbs with the Department of Natural Resources, we are implementing the visionary Colorado Water Plan and directing over $127 million in new funding to support local water projects. We are seeing record interest in Water Plan Grants, which so far have supported 530 local projects.
Agriculture is on the front lines of drought, and we are helping the next generation of producers get the tools and training needed to adapt to a changing climate. From Water Plan Grants to the transformative work led by Ag Commissioner Kate Greenberg, who just gave birth to her first child earlier this week, we are helping farmers and ranchers to prepare for and build resilience in the face of a hotter, dryer climate.
Looking to the Colorado River, under the leadership of Commissioner Becky Mitchell, we are working to find consensus while protecting the water for Upper Basin states. There is no state better positioned to lead the way to a sustainable future for our namesake river.
In light of the pine beetle outbreak spreading in the Front Range and foothills, we are stepping up to mitigate the most harmful impacts and protect our communities, forests, and key water sources.
We are also stepping up to support our pollinators, the workhorses of our ecosystems who are responsible for one in three bites of food we eat. Together, we are building on our work to protect pollinators from threats faced from some pesticides, including with bills this year led by Senators Kipp and Wallace.
Our treasured public lands are part of the fabric of who we are in Colorado, full of fun and adventure, home to incredible wildlife, and key to our economy.
Elevating enjoyment and care of our great outdoors go hand in hand. We’ve expanded our state parks and wildlife areas by over 90,000 acres, advanced conservation for 270,000 federal acres like the Thompson Divide, and opened up access to over 1 million acres of state trust lands.
We’ve created more than $120 million in new annual funding for the care and conservation of our public lands, including with the Keep Colorado Wild pass that cut the price of a state parks pass by more than half to $29, and growing lottery funding for Colorado’s outdoors. The first-of-its-kind outdoors strategy sets the vision to best care for our great outdoors while putting every dollar to the best possible use.








The moving words of America the Beautiful have connected generations to Colorado’s “Purple Mountains Majesty,” inspired by the beauty of Pikes Peak, where I was earlier this week, we are ensuring that America’s Mountain remains as central to Colorado’s future as it has been to our nation’s past. Through Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s partnerships with Mayor Yemi, Colorado Springs Utilities, the US Forest Service, Great Outdoors Colorado, county and local leaders in the Outdoor Pikes Peak Initiative, and the Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance, we are expanding opportunities – including new campgrounds, new trails, even better facilities maintenance – for Coloradans to enjoy and protect this hallowed place for generations to come.
As we look ahead to our state’s 150th birthday, what better way to honor Colorado’s proud history and build toward a bright future than by elevating the care and conservation of our most iconic wild spaces.
Look ahead
Our state’s milestone year is also a milestone for many of us who are embarking on our last year in this building.
I’ve truly enjoyed working with everyone here in this chamber, and those who came before. I want to recognize all of the legislators whose terms have matched up with mine – the class of 2026.
And I encourage all of you to take this year to lead on issues you know I will agree with you on perhaps more than the next governor, whether it’s school choice, eliminating puppy mills, technology innovation, supporting blockchain and crypto, or reducing the income tax, now’s your chance.
And on issues you know I disagree with you on, let’s work together to find agreement. Much to my staff’s chagrin, this year I demanded a special veto pen, after poor Jeff Bridges couldn’t even get a regular one from David when I vetoed his bill.
Conclusion
In the Lord of the Rings, Sam speaks to Frodo, saying “there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it’s worth fighting for.”
Colorado, there’s so much good, and we keep fighting for more.
There’s good we’ve achieved – more homes for every budget, more ways to get around easier without sitting in traffic, and more opportunities for students at every stage – and the good that we know is still possible, what we continue to fight for.
When I ran to serve as your Governor I promised to be bold – heck, I made a lot of promises, that together, we’ve turned into a reality for Colorado.
Free preschool. Free full day kindergarten. More housing. Less pollution. We dream. We dare. We do.
I’ve been called many things – Colorado’s education governor, marijuana governor, tech bro governor, gay governor, socialist, fascist, communist, capitalist, libertarian. I’ll keep putting in the work and let others decide the labels, but at the end of the day, it’s always been about delivering real results that leave our state better than we found it. And it’s also about showing loving kindness for everyone and everything. I leave you with the advice to be kind and love your fellow human.








Through it all, what will always stick with me are the special moments during my time as Governor – visiting all 64 counties, picking and eating a fresh peach in Palisade, warm from the Colorado sun, the breathtaking view from atop the mesa at Fort Lewis College. Attending church on All Saints Day in Otero County trying with limited success to descend into the only active volcano in Colorado in Dotsero on a wire tied to a tree, taking our kids to see Tarantulas crawl near La Junta, picking Pueblo chiles, surprising seniors for lunch at the San Luis Senior Center. White knuckling it on the drive to the top of Pikes Peak.
Fulfilling a life goal by “playing” Red Rocks with Colorado South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. And, of course, getting married at the Mary Rippon Theater at the University of Colorado Boulder, Marlon’s alma mater.
Speaking at the preschool graduation ceremony for the first class of universal free preschool. Reading to the first class of full-day kindergarteners.
And of course the people. My cabinet, including those who have been here since the beginning, many of whom I’ve already mentioned, along with Joe Barela, Michelle Barnes, Patty Salazar, and Tony Gheradini. Our incredible executive team, Danielle, Kara, Allie, Mark, Conor, Jesse, our entire staff, and their families who have also dedicated so much.
Our spectacular Colorado is matched only by the heart and ingenuity of those who call our great state home.
Seven years ago, I joined you all in delivering my first State of the State address, and shared what an honor it is to be your Governor.
In the time since, forces beyond us have shaped our reality – a once in a century pandemic, widespread inflation, the biggest and most destructive fires in our state’s history, an unpredictable federal landscape, a massive wormhole connecting to the Abyss with an upside down version of Colorado and our only hope is a group of Dungeons & Dragons – playing teens…. Well, maybe not that.
But despite it all, we faced our challenges head on, never losing sight of our values and what makes us who we are. We stared down the abyss, destroyed our metaphorical Vecnas, and delivered big, bold progress for Colorado while rolling a natural 20 on landing Sundance, the All-Star Game, and the quantum accelerator.
In this time of great division, now more than ever we must come together as Coloradans, leading with kindness and respect to move our ONE team, our great state, forward.
The state of our state is strong. Resilient. Loving. Kind. Innovative. Free. And ever bright with the promise of a Colorado for All. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
G-d bless you all, G-d bless Colorado, and G-d bless the United States of America!

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan/New Jersey Monitor)A pro-Palestinian activist arrested by immigration officials after participating in anti-Israel protests at Columbia University and then freed by a federal judge in New Jersey may be rearrested after a federal appeals court ruled against him Thursday.
The 2-1 decision from the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals says Mahmoud Khalil must fight the Trump administration’s attempts to deport him in immigration court, not federal district court. The ruling boots Khalil’s case against the administration back to the district court with instructions for the judge to dismiss the case.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the ruling “a vindication of the rule of law” and threatened to deport Khalil if he does not voluntarily leave the United States.

“It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. The Trump Administration acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil, as it does with any alien who advocates for violence, glorifies and supports terrorists, harasses Jews, and damages property. We would encourage him to use the CBP Home app and self-deport now before he is arrested, deported, and never given a chance to return,” said spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin.
Khalil, in a statement from the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued in support of him in court, called the ruling “deeply disappointing.”
“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability. I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected,” he said.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who was born in Syria, was arrested March 8, 2025, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Khalil’s advocacy meant his continued presence in the United States “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” The Trump administration has also argued that he failed to disclose certain information on his green card application, amounting to fraud.
He was transferred from New York City to New Jersey before landing in a Louisiana detention center for months. Attorneys filed a writ of habeas corpus against the Trump administration — that’s a legal action taken to challenge incarceration — while Khalil was at the Elizabeth Detention Center, which is why parts of his case were fought in New Jersey. 
While fighting for his release in federal court in New Jersey, an immigration judge in Louisiana sided with the Trump administration and said Khalil could be deported. He appealed that ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and that case is still pending. In June, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz, overseeing Khalil’s petition for release in New Jersey, ordered him freed, ruling that his detention was likely unconstitutional. The federal government appealed to the 3rd Circuit, leading to Thursday’s ruling in the Trump administration’s favor.

Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, writing for the majority, said the federal Immigration and Nationality Act demands that, with some exceptions, people fighting deportation orders must do so in immigration court, not federal district court.
“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two. But it also means that some petitions, like Khalil’s, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct,” the judges wrote.
The judges added that because the Board of Immigration Appeals has set an expedited schedule for Khalil’s appeal of the immigration judge’s deportation order, he will be able to quickly challenge the decision.
It is rare for the Board of Immigration Appeals to side with non-citizens challenging deportation orders.
Judge Arianna Freeman, writing in a partial dissent, said she believes the district court was the correct place for Khalil to challenge his detention. Freeman warned that once his case is heard solely by an immigration court, the injuries he suffered during detention may get “no review, let alone meaningful review.”
Hardiman was appointed to the 3rd Circuit by the second Bush administration, Bibas by President Donald Trump, and Freeman by Joe Biden.

(Photo by Kevin Hutcheson)An environmental advocacy group that seeks to protect endangered species is suing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to force a decision from the agency on whether to protect an imperiled salamander found only in Appalachia. 
The Center for Biological Diversity in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday alleges the wildlife management agency failed to protect the yellow-spotted woodland salamander by missing a deadline to make a decision on whether the salamander should be protected under the Endangered Species Act.
The center stated in a press release there were only a few hundred of the salamanders remaining, endemic to Appalachian states including Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee and Virginia. The lawsuit asks for a judge to force the agency to make a decision on whether listing the salamander under the Endangered Species Act is warranted. 
“These are some of the most imperiled salamanders on the planet and they can’t wait any longer for protections,” said Will Harlan, a senior scientist for the center.  “Without federal action these salamanders will go extinct on our watch.”
The center along with other organizations including Kentucky Heartwood, Kentucky Waterways Alliance and Appalachian Voices petitioned the agency in 2022 to protect the salamanders.
Taylor Pool, a regional spokesperson for the agency, did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit Thursday afternoon. 
The lawsuit states yellow-spotted woodland salamanders are found in shale and sandstone “making it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation from mining because these areas are targeted by mountain top removal mining.” 
The lawsuit also states the salamander is found on 21 isolated rock outcrops in Appalachia and that new surface mining permits were issued near salamander populations in Eastern Kentucky in Harlan and Letcher counties. 
“The salamander has already lost significant portions of its range to mining, and it will continue to face destruction, modification, and curtailment of its range,” the lawsuit states. “Other threats include overutilization, disease, predation, invasive species, pollution, and impacts from climate change. Its vulnerability is compounded by its low dispersal.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RSyellow-spotted_woodland_salamander_2_Kevin_Hutcheson_FPWC-1024x617.png,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

State officials also have serious concerns about the district’s financial health. Wilkinson schools’ full financial picture isn’t clear, officials said, because district officials have not submitted a financial audit since the 2023 fiscal year. The district did indicate a $1.7 million deficit in its budget outlook for the 2025-26 school year.
“We don’t have a choice,” state Superintendent Lance Evans said at a state Board of Education meeting Thursday. When a district hits rock bottom, he said, the state has to act.

The school district has been rated F under the state’s accountability system for each of the past two years, state officials said. State accountability data shows that both Wilkinson County Elementary and William Winans Middle School are also failing. Wilkinson County High has a D grade.
Wilkinson County schools have the second-lowest graduation rate in the state. They also have the state’s lowest proficiency rate in math and science as well as the second lowest proficiency rates in English and history, state education officials said. 
The school district has lost about half of its enrollment since 2019, dropping to around 648 students — a number that prompted board Chairman Matt Miller to question whether Wilkinson County schools should be consolidated into another district.
Consolidation is not yet the top question for state officials. The immediate first step, Evans said, is for state officials to do a full audit of the district’s personnel and finances. The state will abolish Wilkinson County’s school board and remove the superintendent. 
The state Board of Education voted on Nov. 14 to take over Okolona schools for financial reasons, marking the district’s second time under state control in 15 years. District officials had notified the agency on Oct. 30 that it could not make its November payroll. 
At a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting on Wednesday, Evans said there is limited funding available to help provide technical assistance for additional school districts taken over by the state: $4.8 million. Since taking over Okolona schools, the agency has already spent $1.5 million. Evans asked lawmakers for additional funding for next fiscal year.
“It doesn’t take long to eat through that,” Evans said of the agency’s emergency fund. “One district that’s in serious trouble can completely wipe that out.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/17124510/3X0A8453.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

The film is the byproduct of a partnership between two nonprofits — Yellowstone Forever and the fStop Foundation. Yellowstone Forever is the park’s official nonprofit partner, while fStop is an organization dedicated to using photography to further conservation efforts.
The Yellowstone Cougar Project is a research effort over 35 years old and the film is about the mountain lions and the researchers who track and seek to understand them. Trail cameras and GPS collars have been used to track and document the interactions of the animals. Part of the film highlights the challenges cougars face being a predator in an ecosystem that also includes bears and wolves.
There are currently four screenings set for the film throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The first is this evening in Big Sky at the Waypoint.
Additional screenings are planned on:

Jan. 22 in Jackson, Wyoming, at the Center for the Arts.
April 9 at The Shane Center in Livingston
April 15 at The Ellen Theatre in Bozeman.

Those screenings are followed by a panel discussion featuring Dan Stahler, senior wildlife biologist at Yellowstone, along with filmmakers and the Yellowstone Cougar Project team. 
“These screenings create an opportunity for the public to connect more deeply with the science, the stories, and the people working to better understand and protect Yellowstone’s wildlife,” Lisa Diekmann, president & CEO of Yellowstone Forever, said in a press release. “We are proud to support Yellowstone’s Cougar Project through our comprehensive fundraising efforts.”

(iStock /Getty Images Plus)The Florida House once again this year is charging ahead with sweeping changes to laws governing lawsuits, notwithstanding in some cases pressure from business groups, and now will send the bills to the Senate to face uncertain futures.
The legislation covers a range of subjects, from limits on money recoveries from lawsuits against government, medical malpractice, and the death of fetuses.
“It seems like the House leadership is hellbent on bringing more lawsuits in Florida, which will only serve to drive up costs for ordinary Floridians,” Florida Justice Reform Institute President William Large told the Florida Phoenix Thursday. 
The institute focuses on lawsuit-related legislation. “Gov. DeSantis’s reforms from 2023 show tort reform is working. There is no reason to bring all this litigation-fueled legislation,” Large said.
Fetal personhood
Florida law allows would-be parents to recover for “negligent stillbirth” under common law. Those damages are limited to mental pain and anguish plus medical expenses incurred incidental to the pregnancy.
In a partisan vote Thursday, members of the House voted, 76-34, to pass CS/HB 289, a bill that would allow would-be parents to pursue wrongful death claims for the loss of developing fetuses. Wrongful death suits allow plaintiffs to seek damages for mental pain and loss of support, meaning jurors could calculate the salary the fetus might have earned over its life, as part of the monetary damages. Common law refers to a body of law developed through judicial decisions and precedents, not by statute.
Democrats offered nine amendments meant to blunt the reach of the measure, including one by Orlando Democrat Rep. Ana Eskamani that would have given a carve-out for abortion providers. (The Republican-dominated House voted down each attempt.)
“It’s really important to remember that this legislation is expanding Florida’s Wrongful Death Act to apply to fertilized eggs. There’s no way that does not impact abortion access,” Eskamani said. State law protects abortion access through six weeks’ gestation, although not after that.
Eskamani offered a second amendment that would have exempted mothers from wrongful death lawsuits involving the fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus; or against a health care provider who has not been  convicted of a crime in connection with the health care — including a provider of assisted reproductive  technologies — without the consent of the mother.
Jacksonville Democrat Rep. Angie Nixon offered an amendment that would have prevented lawsuits from being filed against gestational surrogates. Nixon said that, as written the bill would allow a surrogate to be sued by intended parents if she were to miscarry. 
“What type of message are we sending to people who are really looking out for other folks? That’s just wrong. Y’all for real? No family looks the same. And as legislators, we should not be getting in the way of people making physical and financial sacrifices in order to have children. If y’all really are pro life, you definitely vote up on this bill,” she said.
Another amendment, offered by Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston, would have barred wrongful death lawsuits by a person whose involvement with the pregnancy was by means of rape, incest, or human trafficking.
“Where would be the harm in putting this amendment in?” Bartleman asked, noting that every abortion-related bill the Legislature has passed recognizes pregnancies stemming from those crimes and treats those pregnancies differently.
Rep. Marie Paule Woodson, a Democrat from Hollywood, beseeched members to put their feelings about abortion access aside and to pass Bartleman’s amendment.
“Let’s do what’s right, because I don’t want to have to come back in this chamber and have to go back on this bill for us to realize the pain that we will be causing to those impacted,” Woodson said. “If we don’t pass this amendment, we are giving control to those abusers. That’s exactly what we will be doing. “

Former Democrat turned Republican Rep. Hillary Cassel blasted the notion that CS/HB 289 was abortion-related and instead said it was about justice for mothers.
“This is not about abortion. And too often, when we talk about a pregnant woman, it always goes to the side of the mother that didn’t want the child. But what about the mother who wants one? What about the mother and the family who wanted that baby? That’s what this bill does. Don’t make it anything more,”  said Cassel, of Hollywood.
Sen. Erin Grall, a Republican from Fort Pierce, has filed similar legislation (SB 164) in the Senate. That bill cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by a one-vote margin and has been referred to two other committees.
 “Free kill”

CS/HB 289 wasn’t the only bill related to wrongful death that the House passed Thursday, with the chamber voting, 88-17, to pass HB 6003
Although damantly opposed by organized medicine, insurance, and business lobbyists, the chamber passed the bill with little-to-no debate.
The bill revamps Florida’s wrongful death laws in two ways: Parents of single, childless, adult children 25 and older could file wrongful death lawsuits arising from alleged medical malpractice; and adult children could pursue claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice. Such cases are not allowed under existing law.
Proponents of HB 6003 say it fixes Florida’s “free kill” law, a name coined to describe the different legal protections in Florida statute based on someone’s age, family, and marital status.
Opponents argue the bill would increase the number of lawsuits and result in higher medical malpractice premiums. They have coined their own name for the proposal: “jackpot justice.” 
Those opponents, including Large, say they would support the measure if it were amended to limit damages that can be recovered for all medical malpractice cases, not just the newly expanded class of litigants in HB 6003.
During debate on a similar bill last year, an amendment to cap medical malpractice settlements failed in the Senate by a one-vote margin.
DeSantis ultimately vetoed the 2025 version of the bill because it didn’t contain the caps.
DeSantis delivers on promise and vetoes ‘free kill’ malpractice bill

During a press conference Thursday, DeSantis defended his veto.
“I  will say, you know, that particular legislation I vetoed, if you talk to people in healthcare, it would have caused us to lose doctors. Like, there’s no question, uh, to root, because basically, those were reforms that had been enacted in response to medical malpractice insurance crisis many years ago, well long before I was governor. And so, you would see an impact on that, no question,” DeSantis said.
Sen. Darryl Rouson, a Democrat from St. Petersburg, filed the Senate companion bill (SB 1700) last week
 Sovereign immunity

A bill that would increase the state’s sovereign immunity limits, taking them from $200,000 per person to $1 million and from $300,000 per occurrence to $3 million, passed the House by a 104-7 vote.
The bill would make clear that political subdivisions could settle cases beyond those limits without having to obtain advance approval in the form of a special legislative act. And it specifically would prohibit insurance policies from conditioning payment of settlements upon the enactment of a claims bill.
In legal terms, sovereign immunity refers to the state’s authority to exempt itself as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits, although the state does allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits. Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within the liability thresholds established by law but, if they win awards in excess of the limits, they must go to the Legislature in the form of what’s called a claims bill to collect the payment.
The claims bill process is lengthy and allows the defendant to challenge a jury verdict. Once a claims bill is filed, each chamber’s presiding officer refers it to a special master, who essentially reconsiders the jury’s recommendation. Claims bills also go before House and Senate committees that consider special masters’ recommendations. Ultimately, the bills must pass in both chambers.
It’s not unusual for claims bills to take years to pass, if ever.
Sen. Jason Brodeur, a Republican from Lake Mary, filed the Senate companion bill, SB 1366. That bill takes the existing sovereign immunity limita in law and increases them to $300,000 per person and $450,000 per incident. The bill directs the Department of Financial Services to adjust the caps five years from now and every five years thereafter, to reflect the Consumer Price Index. However, the bill limits those increases to no more than 3%.
In addition to the difference in the caps, the Senate bill lacks the language in the House bill that allows political subdivisions to settle cases beyond those limits without legislative intervention.
The Senate bill was filed last week and has not yet been referred to any committees.
 Phosphates

The House also passed HB 167, a priority bill for Senate President Ben Albritton and the one tort-related bill that offers increased protections to businesses that the House passed Thursday.
Offered by Rep. Lawrence McClure, R-Dover, and Rep. Richard Gentry, R-Astor, the bill would establish a defense from strict liability if the lawsuit is related to pollution caused by a former phosphate mine and certain requirements are met. 
Phosphate companies have faced lawsuits filed by people who bought homes built on radioactive spoils left by mining.
This strict liability defense applies to lawsuits brought by the Department of Environmental Protection as well as lawsuits brought by any other person.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Legal_Gavel_27571702173-1024x776.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

The child had a single blueberry in her stomach at the time of her death, according to the state’s autopsy. The report also stated that she weighed only 27 pounds, had “marked emaciation,” and a “near-absence” of fat on her body. She also had amphetamines, a stimulant that wasn’t prescribed to her, in her system.
Police found Torres-García’s body in a plastic container behind an abandoned house in October. Her mother, her mother’s boyfriend and her aunt have all been charged in relation to her death, which officials have said occurred in 2024.
Karla García, Torres-García mother, has been charged with seven felonies including a murder charge, child abuse, unlawfully restraining her daughter and illegally disposing of a body. García’s boyfriend, Jonatan Nanita, has been charged with the same felonies and larceny for allegedly defrauding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The child’s aunt, Jackelyn García, has been charged with three felonies related to child abuse and unlawful restraint. All three have hearings scheduled later this month.
The autopsy says witnesses confirmed that Torres-García was restrained with zip ties.
The case has also reinforced calls for more regulation of the state’s homeschooling system. In July 2024, the girl’s mother emailed school officials to alert them she planned to homeschool her daughter. Less than two months later, the child was dead, according to court records.
Documents from the two school districts García, the girl’s mother, emailed regarding her plans to educate her daughter show that the homeschooling plan likely hid abuse from people who would have been required to report it to the state. It’s the second high-profile case in recent months related to homeschooling in Connecticut.
In February, officials found that a Waterbury man had been allegedly locked away for decades after being pulled out of school in the fifth grade. Democrats convened a hearing to discuss the issue last session, which led to thousands of protesters gathering at the Capitol arguing against regulation of homeschooling.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Wednesday night that there will likely be legislation about Torres-García’s case, which may include homeschooling and the Department of Children and Families. DCF had a history with the family. He said there’s more need to look at situations in which a family has a DCF history and gets withdrawn from school.
“If you’ve had a lot of interaction with DCF and law enforcement and you just suddenly withdraw your kid, we might need to have better follow up on that,” Ritter said, noting the conversation is highly politicized. “That might get really ugly. Republican versus Democrat.”
House Minority Leader Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he would support more oversight of families who withdraw their children from school and have active cases with DCF, but doesn’t want to see the legislation stretch into broad homeschooling regulation.
“The broader conversation about homeschooling and to what degree they should be registered is a much more complicated conversation because it immediately moves into the realm of curriculum review, approval, testing,” Candelora said. “That defeats the whole point of homeschooling. To me, that’s a separate issue, and I don’t want to see us use a tragedy as an opportunity to regulate homeschooling.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

MONTPELIER — The two candidates vying to be the next leader of the Vermont National Guard both told lawmakers this week they would resign that post rather than carry out an unlawful order from their superiors in the state or federal government.
Vermont’s Legislature elects an adjutant general, which is the top military officer in the state, every two years. The current office-holder, Maj. Gen. Gregory Knight, is stepping down after seven years, creating an open race. The Vermont National Guard includes both the state’s Army National Guard and Air National Guard.
Two current guard members are vying to succeed Knight: Deputy Adjutant General Henry “Hank” Harder, who’s a retired Air National Guard general, as well as Army National Guard Col. Roger “Brent” Zeigler. Gov. Phil Scott is the commander-in-chief of the Guard, while the adjutant general is responsible for managing the force’s 2,700 members and keeping state military records.

This year’s adjutant general election is notable because it comes as members of the Vermont Air National Guard have been deployed under controversial federal orders. According to the office of U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., President Donald Trump’s administration has directed the Air Guard to take part in Operation Southern Spear, the U.S. military campaign that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. 
Democratic members of Congress, including those in Vermont’s delegation, have condemned the operation, which has more broadly targeted alleged drug smuggling boats and killed dozens of people. Some Democrats and experts in international law have said the U.S. may have committed war crimes by targeting survivors, while a few Republicans in Congress have pledged to investigate the drone strikes.
Harder and Zeigler faced questions from state legislators during a joint hearing of the Vermont House and Senate government operations committees on Tuesday. The full state House and Senate will elect one of the two candidates on Feb. 19. Vermont is the only state in the country where the head of its National Guard is elected, rather than appointed by the governor.
Harder was first to testify during the hearing. In response to a question from Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, he said he would do everything he could to gather information about whether an order from a superior was legal or not. However, after that fact-gathering, “if it was still clear to me that I had a question whether it was a lawful or legal order, I wouldn’t do it,” Harder said.
“(It’s) not what I would want to do. But, if I was forced into that, I would resign before I would ask my soldiers and airmen to do things like that, or go down that path,” he said.
During his turn testifying, Zeigler faced a similar question from Vyhovsky and said that provided he knew “all of the details to the situation” and had consulted legal counsel, he would also be willing to step down in the face of an illegal order.
“I would agree with Gen. Harder — I would resign,” Zeigler said. He added that he “would not want to be the person” to lead guard members in a state- or federally-ordered response to a city if that response “could violate certain laws, human rights.”No legislators asked specifically for the candidates’ opinions on the legality of the recent military actions in and around Venezuela.
While each state’s National Guard troops typically are commanded by their respective governors, the president has authority to mobilize the guard in specific circumstances. Trump has pushed that power to its judicial breaking point since beginning his second term, including deploying states’ National Guard troops to major U.S. cities.
Gov. Scott, a Republican, has at least twice over the past year chosen not to deputize the state’s National Guard for federal initiatives: first a request to help with clerical immigration enforcement work and later as part of Trump’s efforts to crack down on crime in Washington, D.C. 
Details about the guard’s role in Operation Southern Spear have been scant. In written testimony to legislators on Tuesday, Knight called the force’s recent deployment “an involuntary federal mobilization.” He wrote that he did not know at that point how long the Vermont guard would be deployed.
Harder, in pitching himself to legislators Tuesday, emphasized his role since January 2024 as Deputy Adjutant General, which is the guard’s No. 2 below Knight. He said his priorities would be improving care for veterans in the state and bolstering the guard’s recruitment. Both the army and air units have numerous vacancies, he said.
Zeigler told lawmakers he would focus on empowering guard members to speak about mental health and other issues they are struggling with. He also pointed to his role as president of the Vermont National Guard Charitable Foundation, which provides emergency financial aid to guard members and their families, among other roles.
Knight told lawmakers that he was not endorsing one candidate over the other at this point.

But he said his “mission remains the same” despite the change in title.","Ryan Ellison, who is now the First Assistant United States Attorney, speaks at a news conference in June 2025. A judge ruled Jan. 14. 2026 that his appointment as “acting” U.S. Attorney for New Mexico was invalid. (Courtesy U.S. Attorney’s Office)A judge ruled this week that Ryan Ellison, the federal prosecutor leading New Mexico’s United States Attorney’s Office, could no longer legally call himself the “acting” United States Attorney, saying Attorney General Pam Bondi acted outside the scope of the law when she designated him as such last August. 
But David Nuffer, a United State district judge in Utah, in a 53-page ruling Wednesday stopped short of declaring invalid all of the actions Ellison has taken since August. A group of defense attorneys argued in court that Ellison’s indictments against some clients had no force of law because the person who made them was acting illegally.
Defense attorneys, including from the Office of the Federal Public Defender, representing clients in 19 criminal cases all filed similar motions last year challenging Ellison’s authority. A spokesperson for the office did not immediately respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment. 
The lawsuit centers around a sequence of events in mid-August in which Ellison officially resigned as “interim” U.S. Attorney before Bondi named him “first assistant” and then immediately after “acting” U.S. Attorney. Defense attorneys said the maneuver undermined Congressional authority to confirm permanent appointees and laws governing who can and can’t fill vacant federal offices. 
Department of Justice extends New Mexico US attorney’s term amid judicial, Senate criticism

Because President Donald Trump has not officially submitted Ellison for Senate confirmation, Ellison’s official status and title as head of the office have remained precarious for more than a year. He is one of several unconfirmed United States attorneys who have faced legal challenges seeking to remove them from office. 
In Ellison’s case, he was initially appointed as “interim” chief federal prosecutor after Alex Uballez, a Biden-era appointee, stepped down. Bondi named Ellison “acting” U.S. attorney a day after a panel of federal judges declined to approve his “interim” designation. But the “acting” title came with an expiration date at the end of last year, which prompted the defense attorneys’ challenge.
Now, due to Nuffer’s ruling, Ellison’s title is “first assistant” United States Attorney, a title usually given to the prosecutor leading an office in the event of a sudden resignation or death of the confirmed chief prosecutor. 
Gang prosecutor appointed as new U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico

The authority and responsibilities are effectively the same, according to Nuffer’s ruling, including “the authority to supervise and conduct legal proceedings” and oversee assistant and special prosecutors who work on those proceedings. 
While Nuffer’s ruling doesn’t allow Ellison to continue as “acting” U.S. attorney, the judge  justified upholding Ellison’s previous actions by describing them as tasks that could have been delegated to others in the office and that were within the scope of the office’s duties. 
In an emailed statement Thursday, Ellison called himself “First Assistant U.S. Attorney” per the judge’s ruling. But he said his “mission remains the same” despite the change in title.
“Since I was appointed last April, I’ve repeatedly used the phrase ‘for however long I serve,’ because the duration of my time leading the United States Attorney’s Office has always been uncertain,” he said, before adding that he will “work tirelessly to enhance public safety for all New Mexicans.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image009-1024x827.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Outdoor learning for K-12 kids, expanding trade pathways in middle schools, universal pre-k and bilingual education were top of the education platform announced Thursday by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland.
Haaland, a former U.S. congresswoman and U.S. The Secretary of the Interior made the announcement of her platform from a classroom in Albuquerque’s Highlands Highschool, the last of the 13 public schools she attended in childhood, due to constant moves  by her military family.
“Every step in a child’s education should open doors for them, from pre-k to grade school to whatever they decide to do after. Our kids can’t do that alone though, they need stability at home and their educators should feel supported to do the jobs they need to do,” Haaland said.
When asked, Haaland said if elected, she would continue to support free universal child care, a policy announced by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is term-limited from seeking office again.
Haaland acknowledged that lawmakers and the executive disagree on how to pay for the program but said if she’s sworn in: “I’ll be happy to see where it is and I’ll take it from there.”
Supporters included the New Mexico American Federated Teachers Union leadership, teachers, and the Democratic chairs of both education committees in the Legislature.
Picaris Pueblo Gov. Craig Quanchello praised the plan for “investing in Native schools and children to meet their unique needs,” in a speech endorsing Haaland.
“I’m honored to stand before an amazing person and support her. Education is strongest when it reflects who our children are and the communities that raise them,” he said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Four Washington school districts are under federal investigation for reportedly allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, escalating long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and the state over the issue.
The U.S. Department of Education launched the probes Wednesday into the Tacoma, Vancouver, Cheney and Sultan school districts in response to complaints. Across the country, 14 other districts, colleges and state education departments face similar new investigations.
The Trump administration began at least two inquiries in Washington last year on related issues. One targeting the state’s Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction.
According to the Department of Education, Cheney allegedly allowed a trans girl to compete on the girls’ track team; Sultan let a trans girl on the volleyball team; Tacoma allowed a trans girl into “female intimate spaces” and onto sports teams; and Vancouver allowed a trans girl on the girls’ bowling team. 
The Vancouver district said it is reviewing the allegations, but otherwise declined to comment. A Cheney spokesperson also declined, but said the district plans to cooperate with the federal agency’s probe. Tacoma and Sultan didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Enacted in 1972, Title IX prohibited sex-based discrimination in schools receiving federal funding. The civil rights law increased the participation of female student athletes, and also provided an avenue for girls and women to bring complaints of sex discrimination. 
“Time and again, the Trump Administration has made its position clear: violations of women’s rights, dignity, and fairness are unacceptable,” said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Kimberly Richey in a statement. “We will leave no stone unturned in these investigations to uphold women’s right to equal access in education programs — a fight that started over half a century ago and is far from finished.”
WA Initiative, U.S. Supreme Court cases
Voters in Washington will likely get to weigh in on the issue this November. 
An initiative from the conservative Let’s Go Washington political committee looks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports. Democratic leaders in the state Legislature said last week they wouldn’t take up the measure, leaving it to voters if state officials confirm the initiative got the required signatures.
A conservative legal firm on Monday demanded the Legislature hold a hearing on the initiative, arguing that declining to do so is unconstitutional. Top Democrats in the Legislature, including House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, were not swayed.
This week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that ban transgender athletes from playing for women’s and girls’ sports teams. The conservative majority on the court appeared likely to uphold the bans. 
Simmering issue
As with many issues, Washington has been at odds with the Trump administration on the participation of transgender athletes. 
Some school districts have filed complaints with the Department of Education to intervene to force the state to comply with new federal policy on the matter. At the time, they said they were in a difficult position to either follow state law and jeopardize federal funding, or follow President Donald Trump and risk punishment from the state.
The administration has argued athletes assigned male at birth have physical advantages that disadvantage and pose safety risks for female athletes. Despite threats from Trump and an executive order, Washington has stuck with its policy allowing trans athletes to participate.
“Washington state law prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and school districts are acting in alignment with state law when they provide trans students with the opportunity to participate in athletics in alignment with their gender identity,” state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction spokesperson Katy Payne said in an email.
In March, the Department of Education announced it was investigating the Tumwater School District after a 15-year-old girls’ basketball player said she sat out a game “for fear of her safety” because a player from the opponent, Shelton High School, was trans, according to the department. A Tumwater spokesperson said Thursday the district hadn’t heard any updates on the case.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The agency also launched an investigation into the state superintendent’s office over gender inclusion policy. The federal government alleged the state policy conflicted with federal law.
In April, the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association voted down two proposals related to trans athletes. The association sets policy for school sports in the state.
One would have barred trans girls from participating in girls’ sports. Another would have created a separate division where trans athletes can compete.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/educationdepartment-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

Certain New Hampshire Medicaid recipients will begin having to pay premiums in order to receive coverage from the public health program this year as part of a Republican plan to shore up the state’s finances. State officials say those premiums could bring in tens of millions of dollars.
Lawmakers, when passing the budget in July 2025, instructed DHHS to implement that system by July 2026.
During a state Senate hearing on Tuesday, Medicaid officials reported the premiums could bring the state up to $23 million in the state’s fiscal year 2027 — which lasts from July 1, 2026, to June 31, 2027 — and another $23 million the following fiscal year.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to emailed follow-up questions asking whether this figure assumes all enrollees will pay the premium instead of dropping coverage.
The premiums will cost some Medicaid enrollees up to $270 a month. Enrollees who earn 100% of the poverty line or more will pay $60 to $100 per month, depending on the size of their families. Enrollees making at least 255% of the poverty line will be required to pay $190 to $270 monthly. Based on 2025’s federal poverty level standards, here’s what people are set to pay: 

A household of one person earning $15,650 a year — 100% of the poverty level, per 2025’s federal standards — is set to pay $60 a month to keep their coverage under the new system.
A household of two people earning $21,150 is set to pay $80 a month
A family of three earning $26,650 a year is set to pay $90 a month.
A family of four earning $32,150 a year is set to pay $100 a month.
A family of five earning $37,650 a year is set to pay $100 a month.
A household of two people earning $53,932.50 — 255% of the poverty level — a year is set to pay $190 a month.
A family of three earning $67,957.50 is set to pay $230 a month.
A family of four earning $81,982.5 is set to pay $270 a month.
A family of five earning $96,007.5 is set to pay $270 a month.

Olivia May, New Hampshire’s director of Medicaid enterprise management, told senators during the hearing that the state doesn’t yet know what costs it will incur to update its payment systems to be able to handle the new premiums. She said her team is exploring the best way to do that.
“We just don’t have an estimate at this time of system costs,” May said. “I know that wasn’t included in the fiscal note because we don’t have a final view of that yet. We’ve had many conversations with different system leads to try to determine the best path.”
Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature, passed the premium plan — as well as several other changes to Medicaid — as part of the state budget last year. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who included the premiums in her budget proposal, defended the system at the time by pointing out that many states — 22 according to KFF — don’t even offer Medicaid to children whose households earn more than 255% of the federal poverty line.
Democrats opposed the premiums and compared them to an “income tax on the poor.” A group of Democrats, led by Nashua state Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, have filed legislation attempting to repeal the premiums. The Senate Finance Committee is now considering that bill, Senate Bill 484.
On Tuesday, Rosenwald, after hearing the cost estimate from state officials, characterized the premium revenue as “a $23 million cost on low-income families.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/medpremiums-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 15:57:48.888157

The federal indictment returned Wednesday does not mean Stephen Spencer Pittman is facing a new charge, only that a grand jury has confirmed federal prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with prosecuting the 19-year-old for burning the Beth Israel Congregation temple. 
Federal and state prosecutors have not announced how they will collaborate on Pittman’s court cases. His attorney, federal public defender Mike Scott, could not immediately be reached Thursday.  
In state court, Pittman is facing a charge of first-degree arson. Earlier this week, a Hinds County Circuit Court grand jury indicted Pittman on that charge and recommended his sentence be enhanced under a Mississippi law punishing “offenses committed for discriminatory reasons.”
The federal government has not filed hate crime charges against Pittman and it was not immediately clear whether those are being considered. He also has not made an initial appearance in state circuit court, nor has one been scheduled, according to a court administrator.
Pittman is being held in federal custody, though it was not immediately known where. 
This photo provided to Mississippi Today, of a Snapchat account labeled “Spencer,” shows Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, who has been indicted  on state and federal arson charges in the Jan. 10, 2026, fire that heavily damaged Mississippi’s largest synagogue.
If convicted, Pittman’s federal charges carry a punishment of up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The federal charges against him were released earlier this week in an affidavit from an FBI agent that alleged Pittman broke into the northeast Jackson synagogue before dawn Saturday, doused a lobby in gasoline and set it on fire. Later that day, he allegedly confessed to law enforcement that he targeted the synagogue for its “Jewish ties.” 
The blaze charred parts of the synagogue, left smoke damage throughout and destroyed two Torahs. The fire was set in the same part of the one-story brick building that Ku Klux Klan members bombed in 1967 because the congregation’s rabbi supported civil rights. 
The Hinds County indictment did not include a photograph of Pittman. Federal authorities also have not released a photo of him.
Pittman is scheduled to return to federal court for a preliminary hearing Tuesday.
Federal investigators quickly identified Pittman – a former high school and community college baseball player –  as a person of interest, according to the affidavit filed earlier this week, which included text messages he allegedly sent to his father in the course of setting the fire Saturday. The father pleaded for his son to return home, the affidavit says, but Pittman “replied back by saying he was due for a homerun and ‘I did my research.’” 
Pittman is alleged to have confessed to his father, who later contacted the FBI and provided GPS data showing Pittman was at the synagogue early Saturday morning. 
The son “laughed as he told his father what he did and said he finally got them,” said the affidavit from Nicholas Amiano, an FBI agent in the Jackson division.

“I’ve already heard from many members that some of your children and grandchildren are already getting these books. And I love hearing that, because the whole goal of the bill is to help children learn to love reading,” Collins said on the House floor Thursday.
The bill would not change how the program operates but would codify an executive order signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in 2023. Ivey launched a statewide initiative to expand the Imagination Library program to all 67 counties the same year.
According to the bill, the Imagination Library Program would be managed by the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education. The department would also be responsible for collaborating with a nonprofit organization to operate the program and create rules as necessary.
State funds would make up half of the program’s funding and local partners would make up half. Private donations are also allowed to be contributed to the Imagination Library Program.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate Thursday voted to repeal a controversial law passed in 2025 that would have allowed the city of Cullman to annex part of Cullman County for a resort-style conference center on Smith Lake.
SB 12, sponsored by Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, passed on a 35-0 vote. It would remove the controversial law, which became an issue in a special House election in Cullman last year. 
Gudger said Thursday he thought the 2025 statute, which he co-sponsored, was good, but heard differently when he returned to his district.

“When I got home, I started listening to the people,” Gudger said. “A lot of people in my county did not want to change the way that the culture and living was there on the lake.”
SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, passed at a time when Cullman County did not have any representation in the Alabama House due to an early-session resignation and a late-session resignation. 
The law allowed a wet city to annex a “community development district” with a size of at least 250 acres from a dry country to build a development that sells alcohol. 
In 2024, Jeff Tolbert, a Cullman resident and owner of Trident Marina, announced plans to develop a $275 million resort along Smith Lake. According to the Cullman Tribune, Tolbert planned to have the development done by 2027 and employ over 300 people across what was expected to be a resort spanning 2,500 acres.
“Looking at that, it produced jobs, it produced capital investment,” Gudger said on the Senate floor. “I love economic development. I thought this was a good bill last year.”
Objections to the law were major points for then Republican and Democratic candidates, with critics saying a large development could change the character of the area. The law went into effect on Oct. 1, but the city of Cullman never moved to annex the land amid the controversy.

Members of the Michigan House Government Operations Committee on Thursday heard testimony from small farmers in support of a trio of bills put forth by state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), allowing farmers to sell raw milk directly to consumers, while setting product and labeling standards, alongside waiver requirements for individuals choosing to purchase the milk.
Under the current law, Michigan farmers are barred from selling unpasteurized milk. However, residents can acquire raw milk by participating in a herdshare program, where members can pay a farmer a fee for an animal’s board or for a share of the animal, which entitles them to a share of the animal’s whole, unprocessed milk.

While the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration and experts at institutions like the American Academy of Pediatricians and Harvard Medical School all advise against consuming raw milk, Ashley Armstrong, who started Armstrong Farms in southwest Michigan, argued that adults in the U.S. are already allowed to make informed decisions involving health risks every day. 
“Alcohol, vape pens, sushi with raw fish, raw oysters and even raw cookie dough,” Armstrong said. “In those cases, the government doesn’t ban access. Instead, it provides information and allows adults to decide for themselves. So why shouldn’t adults be allowed to purchase farm fresh foods they believe are healthier for them, while fully understanding and accepting the risks?”
While multiple studies have found no evidence that raw milk is more nutritious than pasteurized milk, bill supporters argued that raw milk contains beneficial compounds for supporting gut health. 
According to the FDA, there are no beneficial bacteria in raw milk to support gastrointestinal health, and that Bifidobacteria, which some raw milk advocates have referred to as “good bugs” in the milk, are a sign of fecal contamination, as these bacteria are commonly found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals.
The FDA also notes that raw milk does not cure lactose intolerance, despite arguments to the contrary. All milk, pasteurized or otherwise, contains lactose and proteins that can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, and raw milk does not contain any additional substances to aid in milk digestion.
Rick Hitchcock, who runs a family farm in Fowlerville, argued that proper animal hygiene and sanitation practices can ensure safety in raw milk. However, state Rep. John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming) remained skeptical, noting that even very clean animals can still introduce bacteria like E.coli and listeria into the product.
Later in the hearing, Fitzegerald pointed to a study shared by the CDC which found raw milk was linked to 202 outbreaks of foodborne illness and 2,645 illnesses between 1998 and 2018. This includes 228 instances of hospitalization and three deaths.

Armstrong countered, arguing that raw milk only accounted for a small number of the 21,919 foodborne outbreaks reported during this period. However, consumers of raw milk are also in the vast minority of Americans, with a 2022 study published in the Journal of Food Protection finding 4.4% of U.S. adults reported drinking raw milk at least once in a 12 month period.
Another study, published in 2017, found that unpasteurized milk and cheese accounted for 96% of illnesses caused by contaminated dairy products.
Maddock’s House Bills 5217, 5218 and 5219 received 133 cards in support, with Maddock telling committee Chair Brian BeGole (R-Perry) he had 231 individuals supporting the legislation. However, members of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dairy Farmers of America, Michigan Agri-Business Association, Michigan Dairy Foods Association, Michigan Milk Producers Association and Michigan Manufacturers Association submitted cards in opposition to the bills, but did not speak at Thursday’s hearing. 
In a letter to the committee, Rebecca Park, legislative counsel for the Michigan Farm Bureau, urged members to oppose the bill, emphasizing the critical role that pasteurization plays in preventing illness and warning that any raw milk related outbreaks would create concerns about Michigan’s broader dairy industry. 
“Maintaining the current statutory framework is essential to protecting public health, preserving consumer trust, and supporting the long-term stability of Michigan agriculture,” Park said.
Maddock, however, was unfazed by the broad opposition from business groups and state regulators.
“The corporations don’t want this, but all people do,” Maddock said as the committee concluded without voting on the bills.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1297005217-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 14:57:28.918251

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma Voice and its parent organization have sued the state Department of Transportation to obtain unredacted and complete copies of the agency’s flight logs.
The open records lawsuit, filed by States Newsroom doing business as Oklahoma Voice, alleges the agency unlawfully redacted the lists of passengers who flew on the state plane, which is maintained by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, and also failed on dozens of occasions to disclose the purpose of the flights as required by state law.
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Transportation declined to comment as the state agency had not yet been served the lawsuit. 
Oklahoma Voice in July requested that the agency provide a copy of travel logs for all individuals who used the Transportation Department’s plane, including the “date, time, passenger list, duration and purpose of the trip along with the total cost.” 
ODOT provided the records, but redacted some passenger names for flights involving the Governor’s Office. In addition, the purpose of over 50 flights was left blank or contained a statement that it was “not provided.”
Of the different agencies that used the plane, only the Governor’s Office and Department of Public Safety left the purpose blank, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the purpose for those flights was omitted because both agencies did not provide ODOT with the information.
The lawsuit also alleges some flight purpose information provided by other agencies was inadequate. Four trips identified the reason for the trip as “visits” or “airport visits” while 13 only listed “meeting” or “event,” according to the lawsuit.
Leslie Briggs, an attorney with Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, who is representing Oklahoma Voice, wrote in the lawsuit that ODOT’s attorney responded that while the agency maintained the records, “it can not provide information that has not been received. If the purpose is not included, ODOT does not fill in the blanks.” 
The agency’s attorney also cited a provision of the Oklahoma Open Records Act that allows the Department of Public Safety to keep confidential records related to personal information along with other information that could be considered of a tactical nature, according to the lawsuit.
ODOT said in November that it had unredacted copies of the records, but would not release them, according to the lawsuit. 
The Governor’s Office previously said passenger logs on prior flights were redacted if they contained Department of Public Safety employees or the names of Gov. Kevin Stitt’s children.
The lawsuit contends that state law requires the printed name of each person traveling on an aircraft and the purpose of each landing, “including whether the purpose of a landing is for a speech, meeting or performance of a service.” 
State law requires that those travel logs be maintained and made available to the public upon request under the Open Records Act.
Among other things, the lawsuit, which was filed in Oklahoma County District Court, requests that Oklahoma Voice be provided unredacted copies of the records, and that the Department of Transportation be required by the court to properly maintain complete records as required by law. It also seeks “reasonable” costs and attorneys fees.
Briggs said this lawsuit aims to ensure “maximum transparency allowed by law.”
“The goal of this lawsuit is to clarify what information may be redacted under the (Open Records Act) and what information must be gathered as required by statute in order to maintain complete records of expenditures of public funds relating to the use of the state plane,” she said in a statement. “Taxpayers deserve to know for what purpose their money is spent when public officials use the state plane.”

Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, asks a question during a Dec. 10, 2026, legislative committee meeting. (Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Two state lawmakers have raised concerns to the State Investment Board that the $1.3 million in bonuses slated to go to the Retirement and Investment Office employees may be a violation of state law.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, in a Tuesday letter to board members said that the bonuses are required by law to be based on the performance of investment money the state manages internally. Cleary said that instead, it appears that bonuses for 2025 were calculated based on the performance of funds mostly managed by outside firms.
The board will consider approving the bonuses to 12 Retirement and Investment Office employees on Friday.
The goal of the bonuses is to encourage the agency’s employees to bring in more money from state investment funds. According to State Investment Board policy, the incentive pay is awarded if the state’s top four funds outperform the market. Those four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
North Dakota investment board delays action on $1.3 million in employee bonuses

State data indicates only a fraction of the four funds was invested by in-house employees during the period of time the bonuses cover, Cleary wrote.
“This disconnect undermines both the intent of the law and the credibility of the incentive program,” he said in the letter.
In a memo to the State Investment Board, Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith noted that “internally managed” is not defined in state statute.
She said that under even the most strict interpretation of the phrase, the agency’s funds performed well enough in 2025 for staff to receive the bonuses. 
The agency’s staff was directly managing roughly $400 million in investments as of June 30, 2025, the memo says. Those investments made $7.9 million in returns in the preceding year.

Smith wrote that “internally managed” could also be interpreted as any money with the Retirement and Investment Office’s oversight, even funds that are invested by external managers.
State law doesn’t say the bonuses have to be proportional to the performance of internally managed investments, she added.
Based on the Retirement and Investment Office’s benchmarks, which were set by a third-party first, the agency’s largest four funds outperformed the market by $191 million in 2025.
The agency’s bonus policy was reviewed by a separate third-party firm and approved by the State Investment Board in May 2024.
Rep. Mitch Ostlie, R-Jamestown, in a Wednesday letter raised similar concerns as Cleary.
Ostlie also noted that he and Cleary submitted a request for an Attorney General’s opinion on whether the State Investment Board has continuing authority to pay out the bonuses.
“With so many questions still outstanding, it does not make sense for the State Investment Board to pay out any bonuses at this time,” Ostlie wrote.
Attorney general ‘prioritizing’ request for legal opinion on North Dakota investment staff bonuses

An assistant attorney general within the Attorney General’s Office previously advised that the agency could legally award the pay, Smith said at a December meeting.
Seven of the bonuses exceed $100,000, and the largest exceeds $293,000. If the State Investment Board approves the bonuses, it would be the first time the state awards them.
Smith has said bonus pay is common in state investment programs.
The Legislature gave the Retirement and Investment Office the authority to create the program in 2023, with the agency enacting it the following year.
Cleary said he’s considering asking for another Attorney General’s opinion to see if the bonus program is complying with the statute’s internal management requirement. He also said he may bring legislation to clarify state law in a future legislative session.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent activity in Kansas City and across the United States inspired a Democratic state legislator to attempt to hijack a Republican’s bill to read ICE “shall have no jurisdiction or power within the state of Kansas or its political subdivisions.”
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Democrat from Shawnee, proposed on the House floor Wednesday revising the text of Republican Rep. Rebecca Schmoe’s bill, which stated international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization have no power in Kansas.
In the place of international organizations, Ruiz inserted ICE.
“We need to stand up,” Ruiz said. “And we at least need to say — each community, each city council, each county’s commissioners need to make a statement to say that ICE is not welcome in their communities, and if they are there, they should be unmasked and well-identified, and they should carry body cameras.”
Ruiz rooted the explanation of her amendment in the recent death of former Kansas City resident Renee Good, who an ICE agent shot and killed at point blank range through Good’s windshield in Minneapolis.
“Tragedy always happens because people that get those kinds of jobs or go for those kinds of jobs don’t have a lot of training at all. And we saw,” Ruiz said. “We saw all the videos and you can see for yourself.”
Ruiz connected ICE activity across the country to Kansas City, describing the effects of an increased presence of immigration agents. Fewer people are going to work, the grocery store and schools, she said.
She mentioned news reports of a horde of ICE vehicles in Kansas City, Missouri, targeted ICE raids at gas stations and speculation of ICE using the Kansas City area as a staging ground, which has not been verified.
Schmoe, a Republican from Ottawa, proposed House Bill 2204 in 2025. It was the first piece of legislation debated on the House floor in the 2026 legislative session, which began Monday.
When Democrats pressed her to explain the motivation behind the bill, Schmoe said its purpose was to close “a loophole that can be exploited.”
“I had a group of my constituents come to me, and they were very concerned with global entities making decisions for Kansas, instead of Kansans,” she said.
During a March 2025 hearing for the bill, a senior legislative staff member called it “a statement bill as it is anything,” and called into question whether the international organizations targeted have any existing authority in the state.
Schmoe challenged Ruiz’s amendment, and a rules committee ruled it not germane, halting Ruiz’s effort.

Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, speaks in the Senate on Sept. 10, 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Senate Democrats blocked debate on more than a dozen gubernatorial appointments Thursday, bringing the chamber to a standstill and vowing to spend the year slowing down the legislative process. 
For two hours Thursday, a Democratic filibuster prevented the Senate from considering appointments by Gov. Mike Kehoe to various boards and commissions. With no end in sight, the Senate adjourned for the week without taking the appointments up for a vote. 
Democrats argued their stall tactics were an effort to restore the Senate’s role as the more deliberative legislative chamber that thoroughly vets bills before they go to governor. 
“It’s probably more important than ever that there is at least one entity in this government that serves as a speed check,” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, “that says ‘whoa, we’re gonna pump the brakes and do our jobs.’ If we do, we’ll get better public policy.”
The filibuster was the fulfillment of a threat Democrats made before the legislative session began earlier this month. 
The party, which holds only 10 of the Senate’s 34 seats, fumed as Republicans invoked a rarely-used rule to cut off debate four times last year to pass an abortion ban amendment, repeal expanded sick leave, put initiative petition changes on the ballot and approve a gerrymandered congressional map. 
Most expected Democrats to show up on the session’s first day ready to engage in procedural trench warfare, using the few tools available to them to slow the chamber to a crawl and exact some measure of payback.
But the Senate proceeded for the first two weeks with no drama though mostly ceremonial and procedural business. That changed Thursday, when it tried to conduct its first real business of the year by approving gubernatorial appointments.
Missouri lawmakers expect tension as they return for election-year legislative session 

Democrats didn’t focus on Republicans cutting off debate last year. Instead, they spent Thursday afternoon digging into legislation they argue the Senate rubber stamped that should have received more scrutiny.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, pointed to last year’s capital gains tax cut, which was approved by the Senate despite concerns that the estimated $111 million annual revenue reduction was inaccurate.
The state budget director now says the revenue loss could be as much as $500 million the first year and $360 million annual thereafter.
Webber said the same could be said of the gerrymandered congressional map. A lawsuit claims one Kansas City precinct was accidentally placed in two different districts, something Webber said would have been avoided if the Senate didn’t rush the map through the process. 
 “If we’d spent some time drawing it ourselves,” he said, “that wouldn’t have happened.”
Democrats also questioned whether the Senate is doing a good enough job vetting gubernatorial appointments. 
“Somewhere along the way,” McCreery said, “it feels like senators have slowly been removed from the process.”
State Sen. Steven Roberts, a St. Louis Democrat and member of the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee, asked President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican and the committee’s chair, about the process to approve reappointments.
“My understanding is, for reappointments, and these are folks who may be reappointed for six years later, we don’t really have any background information on them,” Roberts said.
“You would have to ask the Governor’s Office,” O’Laughlin said. 
Roberts said he was struck by the lack of public hearings of the state Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners. O’Laughlin is sponsoring two nominees for that board.
“It just caught me by surprise that by this one, it seems like all of their meetings are closed, and it gives me a little bit of concern,” Roberts said.
Roberts asked O’Laughlin whether the board sends newsletters about their decision-making process.
“No, I have never even thought about that,” O’Laughlin said. “I do think a lot of people feel that way about us.”
“But all of our meetings have to be public,” Roberts said.
“Well, supposedly,” O’Laughlin responded.
State Sen. Jason Bean, a Holcomb Republican, said Thursday’s Democratic filibuster didn’t come as a surprise. 
“We knew this was going to  occur, because of what happened last session,” he said, adding: “Up until now, we’ve run pretty smoothly. We’ve still got a long session ahead of us, and we’ll just see what that brings.”
Democrats have no intention of killing the appointments that were stalled Thursday. But Webber said the filibuster is a sign of things to come, with his party trying to force a much slower legislative pace and demanding more oversight.
“I’ve had Republicans come to me,” he said, “and say they want to get back to the way the Senate has been in the past.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_webber1-1024x667.jpg,,,2026-01-15 14:57:28.918251

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Less than 48 hours after terminating over $14 million of Mississippi mental health grants, the federal government informed organizations that their funding will be fully restored. 
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration cancelled nearly $2 billion of grants across the country Tuesday, according to NPR. In Mississippi, government health centers, private nonprofits and universities were told to stop all work funded by those grants — mainly related to addiction and children’s services. 
By Tuesday evening, Mississippi Today had learned about roughly $9.2 million of cancelled Mississippi grants. Later that night, the state Department of Mental Health accounted for an additional $4.9 million that had been terminated to Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Health Institute. 
Wendy Bailey, the mental health department’s executive director, said Tuesday night there could have been other terminated grants her agency hadn’t learned about yet. 
A Tuesday letter the federal mental health department sent to grantees said the cancellations were final because “no corrective action could align the award with current agency priorities.” But by Thursday morning, the agency sent the same organizations a short message to “disregard the prior termination notice and continue program activities as outlined in your award agreement.”

Nationwide, all $2 billion of the cuts from earlier this week were reversed, according to Roll Call. A spokesperson for the federal agency did not answer Mississippi Today’s call and email about the terminations and restorations.
Four of Mississippi’s 12 community mental health centers, local public organizations that serve people regardless of their ability to pay, were set to lose $8.7 million. Phaedre Cole, the Mississippi Association of Community Mental Health Centers president and the executive director of a center that serves the Delta, called the unexpected terminations and restorations “whiplash.” 
She said she was encouraged by the swift, bipartisan pushback to protect critical Mississippi mental health services that were already underfunded. But the previous 48 hours had left her and other executive directors frazzled. 
“It’s terrifying to us because we know we are the place of last resort for thousands of people across the state,” she said. “If we are to disappear, we will not disappear quietly.”
Shortly after receiving notice that the Department of Mental Health’s grant had been restored Thursday, Bailey said the last two days had been a whirlwind. But she’s grateful Mississippi mental health providers can continue providing important services. 
“We must remember that behind these dollars are services and supports that are being provided to our neighbors, friends, family members, and people throughout our communities,” she said.
Communicare, the community mental health center serving Oxford and the surrounding counties, was set to lose more than any other organization Bailey’s department heard from. Melody Madaris, Communicare’s executive director, said the losses would force her agency to cut back on preventing opioid overdoses, restructure services for school children and halt other planned programs. 
Thursday morning, before she had officially heard that the federal government would restore her grant, Madaris said services funded by federal grants are often the ones most people don’t notice unless they need them — transporting people from rural homes to receive antipsychotic medications, working with food banks to deliver meals to patients and other resource-intensive services. 
“Those are the things we do to keep our community healthy,” she said. “Without the federal funding, these are things that we won’t be able to do as much of.” 
Right after the federal government sent her an email restoring the funds, she texted Mississippi Today: “A sigh of relief and back to work as usual helping the citizens of Mississippi struggling with mental health and substance use issues.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/29162137/3X0A8546.jpg,,,2026-01-15 14:57:28.918251

The Iowa Board of Medicine has charged Dr. Kahlil Jihad Andrews of Coralville with practicing medicine in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, professional incompetence, and improper management of medical records.
The board has not publicly disclosed any information as to the conduct that gave rise to the charges other than to say it took place while Andrews worked as a surgeon in the Coralville area. State records indicate the charges stem from two separate investigations initiated in 2023 and 2024.

A hearing on the charges is scheduled for March 25 and 26, 2026.
“Dr. Andrews appreciates the board’s commitment to fulfilling its critical mission while he continues to honor his own commitment to the best possible outcomes for his patients within the standard of care,” Andrews said in a written statement to the Iowa Capital Dispatch. “He respectfully, but categorically, denies the allegations and charges asserted by the board and will proceed to defend his care while ensuring that he receives the due process to which he is entitled under Iowa law.”
Andrews has been an Iowa-licensed physician since October 2012.
Six Iowans have alleged negligence
In 2018, Andrews and Physicians Clinic of Iowa were sued for negligence by Marcia Bowman and LaDonna Fairbanks of Linn County, each of whom alleged they were left with deformities resulting from operations performed by Andrews. Andrews and the clinic denied any wrongdoing. Both women subsequently dropped their lawsuits. The available court records make no mention of any out-of-court settlements.
In 2022, Sandra Strunk-Sosalla of Linn County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery for negligence related to an alleged chin implant deformity. After corrective surgery was performed to install a second implant, Strunk-Sosalla allegedly lost movement in her lower lip, which led to problems with speaking and eating, as well as the removal of the second implant and a series of treatments at the Mayo Clinic. The case went to trial, where a jury found no fault with Andrews’ care.
In November 2023, Jocelyn Meade of Johnson County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery, alleging she sustained nerve damage and significant scarring resulting from liposuction and an abdominoplasty performed by Andrews. Andrews and the clinic denied any wrongdoing, and the lawsuit was dropped in April 2024 with no mention of an out-of-court settlement.
Also in November 2023, Kelsi Ziemann of Polk County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery for negligence related to liposuction and several other procedures that allegedly led to infections, swelling, scarring and disfigurement. Andrews and the clinic have denied any wrongdoing. Court records indicate the case remains open and active.
In December 2025, Taylor Worrall of Dubuque County sued Andrews and Dr. Andrews Plastic Surgery for negligence related to liposuction and other procedures that allegedly led to infections, blistering, abscesses and disfigurement. The case remains open and active, although court records show Andrews and the clinic have not filed responses to the allegations, and there has been no activity in the case for 13 months.

(Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Melissa Berg is a paid personal care assistant for her friend, a disabled person who needs 24/7 care. In December, Berg received a memo from AM Home Healthcare, the St. Paul-based agency she works under, saying that it won’t be able to cover payroll because the state’s late making payments.
Without the promise of pay, some PCAs in the agency haven’t been showing up for work, Berg said.
“It just enrages me because disabled people are so devalued and, again, you see the most vulnerable among us suffering first,” Berg said.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services delayed all payments to providers of 14 Medicaid services in the first weeks of a new system — called “prepayment review” — designed to prevent fraud. Providers of Medicaid services said the delay caught them by surprise and interrupted payrolls, leaving older and disabled Minnesotans without care.
The anti-fraud measure that seems to have ensnared legitimate providers and their vulnerable clients was introduced last year amid an ongoing scandal enveloping the administration of Gov. Tim Walz, who at the time was running for a third term before dropping out this month.
DHS suspended all payments for the 14 “high-risk” Medicaid programs on December 30, suddenly leaving many providers to operate without money they have come to expect to get every two weeks. Payments have started to be resumed this week, though many are still missing.
DHS put out a memo that payments would resume this week, but on Wednesday, the department told the Residential Providers Association of Minnesota that claims submitted on December 24 and 25 were not included in those payments due to an early deadline not communicated to providers, said Rebecca Johnston, the executive director of RPAMN.
DHS is now figuring out whether it can pay those remaining 40% or so claims from December sooner, Johnston said; if not, some providers will be left without payments for two more weeks, which could leave them at risk of closing their doors.
A spokesperson for DHS said the department does not yet have information on unpaid claims. At a Wednesday press conference, John Connolly, state Medicaid director, said the next payment for claims is in two weeks.
Zak Mohamed, who runs AM Home Health Care, said that he’s been trying to take care of clients in the place of employees who are — understandably, he said — not working because he can’t guarantee them payment. AM Home Health Care has yet to receive payments since December for services included in the new prepayment review process, which comprise more than half of what the agency gets from the state. Mohamed said the company paid one payroll from its reserves, but, without DHS payments, will be unable to pay its employees.
Many of AM Home Health Care’s 45 clients depend on their caregivers to survive, Mohamed said.
“If people don’t get their medications in time or if people can’t get out of their bed… You know, I do the best I can,” Mohamed said.
Hailey Grattan, the director of operations of Golden Heart Home Health Services, said the Brainerd agency also has yet to receive reimbursements for services included in the prepayment review process. The agency is still missing over $200,000 in state payments that it expected at the end of December — nearly its entire reimbursement amount.
Grattan said Golden Heart is currently continuing to meet payroll, though she worries that future disruption could leave staff without pay and individuals without care.
DHS is “not providing us with any help or any clear timelines,” Grattan said.
A fragile industry
Prepayment review has been touted by Walz and DHS officials as one of several administration’s efforts to stop fraud in Minnesota human service programs. The 14 high-risk services in the review process include Housing Stabilization Services, a program so riddled with fraud it was shut down.
Communication around the prepayment review system has disoriented providers ever since it was publicly unveiled by Walz’s office in October.
After an initial bout of confusion, providers were under the impression that only claims deemed suspicious would be delayed or held, though under state law, the state can take up to 30 days to pay “clean claims” without complications and 90 days to pay all other legitimate claims.
Then, at the end of December, a few days before they expected to be paid, providers found out that all payments in the 14 high-risk programs were suspended, not just payments for suspicious claims.
Connolly acknowledged that his department has gotten feedback from providers on the new review program.
We “want to make sure that we’re as clear as we can be in terms of setting expectations about what’s coming and hearing feedback about the hardships that providers are experiencing,” Connolly said.
Josh Berg, a service director at Accessible Space, an assisted independent living provider, said that he supports DHS reviewing claims before they’re paid, but is frustrated with DHS’ implementation and “not thinking through the consequences.”
Had they been warned that all payments would be suspended for two or more weeks, Berg said, providers would be more prepared. Berg said Medicaid waiver service providers often operate on thin margins. Accessible Space has other streams of revenue and received most of its delayed payments this week, allowing it to remain stable despite the delay. Other providers are less financially secure; Berg said he spoke to a provider who took out a second mortgage on their home to make payroll.
“We’re in a much more fragile position than I think anybody ever contemplated,” Berg said.
Political pressure to prevent fraud
Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has drawn significant attention from President Donald Trump, who has used the issue to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending thousands of immigration agents to the state. Announcements of federal actions that claim to address fraud in Minnesota, but threaten Minnesota’s social programs, ticked up following a viral video by influencer Nick Shirley claiming to uncover new fraud in Minnesota daycares.
The Trump administration has said it intends to withhold $2 billion of Medicaid funding from Minnesota, a decision which Minnesota officials said they are appealing. In response to a directive from the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the state announced last week that it will stop allowing new providers in the 14 high-risk Medicaid programs for six months at some point in the future.
Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who has prosecuted several social services fraud cases in Minnesota, said in December that he suspects at least $9 billion paid to the 14 high-risk Medicaid programs since 2018 have been fraudulent.
In a press conference Wednesday, however, Connolly said that very few claims — twenty or so — were rejected in the first round of prepayment review.
On Tuesday, Connolly said that the review process was implemented with a “compressed timeline” relative to similar past projects “because of the urgency of the situation.”
Sen. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, said the implementation was rushed, and that the department should have known that creating the system would take more time and consideration. He said he had advised DHS to put the review system on hold until it brought on legitimate providers to strategize.
“Maybe it’s a great idea to set up a really good algorithm with rubrics and pre-screen things that are way out of the norm,” Abeler said. “But you can’t start those up on a dime.”
Abeler, whose party has long criticized Walz for not being tough enough on fraud, said that prominent Republicans might be reticent to speak about prepayment review system problems because they would be seen as “pro-fraud if they criticized the governor’s program here.”
In an email to Connolly, Sen. John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, said that he plans to convene hearings about the design of the prepayment review system when he returns to work following his attempted assassination in June.
The prepayment review process’s “implementation raises serious and immediate concerns — not about the goal of program integrity, which I fully support — but about the lack of concrete assurances that Minnesotans who rely on these services will not be harmed in the process,” Hoffman wrote.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/D50F29A6-E905-4213-8769-F4A44F0BD615_1_201_a-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

The park’s “preferred alternative” would entail construction of a 5-mile stretch of highway that avoids much of the canyon where 2022 infrastructure damage was most severe. The NPS seeks comment through Feb. 4.
The post Yellowstone mulls new permanent routes to replace flood-damaged highways appeared first on WyoFile .","After a catastrophic 2022 flood destroyed highway sections in Yellowstone National Park, park authorities acted fast to make the repairs necessary to reopen. Because the former North Entrance Road between Gardiner, Montana, and Mammoth Hot Springs was eaten away by floodwaters and unpassable, the work included constructing a temporary highway to connect the towns. 
Though that temporary highway has provided year-round access since the disaster, the project was not engineered for longevity. 
“It’s done a fantastic job of keeping the park connected to the second-busiest entrance in the park,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said Wednesday during a meeting. “But it does not have the same type of engineering, it doesn’t have the same type of life cycle that you would see with a modern-day road.”
The National Park Service recently released an environmental assessment on plans to rebuild a new permanent North Entrance Road. It’s available for public review and comment through Feb. 4. 
The agency’s “preferred alternative” would entail creating a highway route that utilizes some segments of the pre-flood North Entrance Road but mainly stays out of Gardner Canyon, where major flooding damage occurred. It would construct roughly two and a half miles of new road, including several bridges. In addition, it would add 134 parking spaces and 19 turnouts over the 5-mile length of the road.

This map illustrates the three different route paths for Yellowstone National Park’s permanent highway. The park’s preferred alternative is in red, while the pre-flood route is shown in purple and the Old Gardiner Road is in blue. (National Park Service) 

“Overall, the [preferred alternative] will provide a better driving experience than the current route and provide greater resiliency compared to the pre-flood road alignment,” an informational park service video stated. 
The changes will impact major veins of traffic in a park that receives upwards of 4 million visits annually.
Long-term solution
The June 2022 floodwaters wiped out bridges, inundated campgrounds and pulled entire portions of highway into the river. The North Entrance Road, one of only two routes offering year-round vehicle access, was among of the hardest-hit areas. 
As a stop-gap solution, federal agencies improved the Old Gardiner Road, a historic, gravel road connecting Mammoth Hot Springs to the North Entrance. Constructed in 1879, the Old Gardiner Road was the original entrance road to Yellowstone until it was replaced in 1884. 
The improved Old Gardiner Road had an estimated design life of only five to 10 years, due in part because it’s located on slow-moving geologic slides and poor soils, according to the NPS. Additionally, due to an urgent need to complete construction before the winter of 2022, it was not built to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standards. 
In its efforts to find a more lasting North Entrance Road solution, the NPS has worked in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration to identify four alternative plans for the North Entrance route. They include: 

No action: Maintaining the Old Gardiner Road as is and conducting maintenance, repairs and potential re-engineering as needed. 
The Center Alignment: Creating a new route largely outside of the canyon but also using some reclaimed segments of the old North Entrance Road, and redesigning the Old Gardiner Road as a multi-use trail. This is the agency’s “preferred alternative.”
The OGR Alignment: Reengineering the Old Gardiner Road to current NPS Park road standards with wider lanes and shoulders, and reclaiming sections of the old North Entrance Road canyon alignment.
The Gardner Canyon Alignment: Rebuilding the flood-damaged old North Entrance Road in its previous canyon alignment and redesigning the Old Gardiner Road as a multi-use trail.

Risk, resiliency
“Lots of folks have said, ‘Hey, just keep the road that you built in 2022 the same,’” Sholly said. But because that road wasn’t built for longevity, “no action here is not going to be an option for the long term.”
The agency is leaning toward the preferred plan, he said, “primarily because building back in the canyon’s got a lot of risk.”
Even though Sholly is confident the agency could rebuild infrastructure designed to endure future floods in the canyon, he said, the significant rockfall potential in the corridor makes it an unappealing option.

Center Alignment, the NPS-preferred alternative, “represents the best balance between resiliency and project cost by avoiding the Gardner River Canyon as much as possible, thus staying out of the floodplain while maintaining the [Old Gardiner Road] alignment for recreational and emergency vehicle use,” the NPS project page reads.   
In the wake of the floods, there have been many discussions about how the park can prepare for the kind of large and unusual climate events that are becoming more common — like the June 2022 rain-on-snow event that precipitated such quickly rising waters. The road project assessment and planning process included evaluations of climate change and evolving hazards within the road corridor, according to the NPS, and climate models helped inform the development of the alternatives. 
The bottom line, Sholly said, is that there’s no perfect solution. “This is a very, very important project. We’ve taken time to really do our best to analyze every factor possible, because we want to get this right.”
The NPS will review all comments received during the 30-day public review period and make changes to the environmental assessment or the alternatives if warranted. A final decision will be issued in the spring or summer, according to the agency.

Land in this area of the Mississippi River Delta is sinking, both on its own and in tandem with rising sea levels. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)A new study says river deltas around the world aren’t just disappearing because of rising seas, but because the land itself is sinking down into the waters, either as fast or faster than the rising oceans.
Researchers found some of the most rapid sinking is happening along the Mississippi River Delta in Louisiana. The study aims to better guide coastal restoration in disappearing river deltas around the globe, helping leaders, scientists and people living in coastal communities with hard decisions on what can — and should — be saved.
“Coastal areas account for less than 1% of the entire land area we have,” said Leonard Ohenhen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine and the lead author of the study. “But a whole significant population, more than 600 million people, live in those areas.”
The study, published this week in the academic journal Nature, found that the contributions of  subsidence, or slowly submerging land, to disappearing coasts is often overlooked. 
The fight to preserve rapidly sinking land has been a decades-long battle in the Mississippi River Delta, as well as a source of contention between scientific and political figures in the state. But deltas across the world are sinking, too, and fast. 
“You have a sort of a hodgepodge of different reasons why deltas are sinking,” said Ohenhen.
He said river deltas naturally sink to some degree, with sediment carried downstream by rivers piling up and pushing down on the spongy, soft land already there. But humans can accelerate this natural process, by engineering rivers like the Mississippi and by extracting groundwater or oil. 
“Relative sea level rise in the area is also really important. That’s the sea level rise plus subsidence,” said Alisha Renfro, coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation. “It really helps us understand where we can make investments in restoration long-term that we might actually be able to hold on to.”
Lack of sediment is the main driver of subsidence in the Mississippi River Delta, said Ohenhen, creating hotspots of rapidly sinking pieces of land amid slightly more stable areas. Most of the deltas studied in the paper, around 70%, have subsidence problems primarily due to groundwater withdrawal, but some, like the Amazon and Mississippi River Deltas, had subsidence issues driven by the disappearance of river-carried sediment to replenish the delta’s land.
This map from the report shows which areas of the Mississippi River Delta are sinking. Areas in red and yellow are areas of land sinking more rapidly, while spots in blue and purple are building land upwards. (University of California, Irvine)
Putting hard numbers to and pinpointing causes of subsidence — like human activity — is invaluable to restoring coastal land. 
“I would say that really validates what, not just my organization, but what a lot of people have recognized for a long time — that this was a significant contributing factor in subsidence,” said  James Karst with nonprofit advocacy group Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, referring specifically to the lack of sediment sent to the Delta. 
Decisions about what pieces of the coast can be saved are even more urgent with the cancellation of two large-scale restoration projects in Louisiana. 
Known as sediment diversions, both the Mid-Barataria and Mid-Breton plans would have diverted freshwater from the Mississippi River into surrounding wetlands. They were scrapped by the state because of the prospective impact on fisheries like oysters, crabs and other marine species. Fishers and oyster harvesters celebrated the projects’ demise, while scientists and coastal restoration advocates warned that time is running out to save the coast. 
“In light of the cancellation of Mid-Barataria, I think what we, everybody, should be thinking of is, ‘What is the next best thing?’” said Karst. “Clearly it is not going to move forward, but we can’t do nothing.”
“People should be aware that we are in a part of the world that is changing, and that is changing rapidly,” said Karst. “If we want to position ourselves as individuals and as communities, we should be anticipating these changes and anticipating how they will affect us.”

While the average rate of subsidence for the Mississippi River Delta is around 3.3 millimeters per year, said Ohenhen, some areas of Louisiana are sinking at a rate of 3 centimeters per year, one of the fastest of all the deltas studied. That is paired with a sea level rising by at least 7 millimeters per year along the Gulf Coast, he said, also one of the highest rates in the world.  This puts some areas of Louisiana’s land at higher risk of loss than anywhere else. 
“In the Mississippi River Delta, for example, that is one of the only deltas in the world where you have active relocation of people from the delta due to land loss,” said Ohenhen. “The time that we need to respond to these changes is now before the situation gets significantly worse.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8951-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

The Trump administration slashed then restored roughly $2 billion in mental health and addiction services grants between Tuesday and Wednesday evening, leaving Connecticut officials and advocates concerned and scrambling, then relieved and exhausted.
The cuts would have affected some 2,000 programs across the country. On Wednesday advocates and agencies struggled to assess the impact, only to learn that the decision had been reversed that evening. 
The reversal comes after a day of extreme pressure from advocates and lawmakers on the state and national level, who called the decision to cut the grants “pointedly cruel,” “nonsensical,” “unconscionable and unjustifiable.”
A spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont said the quick reversal caused a sense of “whiplash.”
“As if the Trump administration’s arbitrary cuts to mental health and substance use funding weren’t cruel enough, the whiplash of cutting and then restoring those funds only deepens anxiety for the people who depend on these services,” said Rob Blanchard, a Lamont’s spokesman. “For those seeking help, these programs are a critical lifeline. While the restoration of funding is a relief, it should never have been halted in the first place. The public and nonprofits deserve the certainty of knowing they can count on the federal government.”
On Thursday, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, held Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responsible.
“After national outrage, Secretary Kennedy has bowed to public pressure and reinstated $2 billion in SAMHSA grants that save lives,” DeLauro said in a statement. “These are cuts he should not have issued in the first place. He must be cautious when making decisions that will impact Americans’ health. Our policy must be thoughtful — not haphazard and chaotic. This episode has only created uncertainty and confusion for families and health care providers. I hope this reversal serves as a lesson learned. Congress holds the power of the purse, and the Secretary must follow the law.”
“To say I’m relieved is an understatement,” said Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, on Thursday morning. “But I am still left wondering, why? The initial decision resulted in a day of uncertainty, with agencies scrambling and scared. The people supported by these SAMSHA (Substance and Mental Health Services Administration) funds need steadiness and certainty not chaos and fear.”
The Wheeler Clinic, which has several locations in the state, was among the providers that received letters late Tuesday that grants had been cancelled. President and CEO Sabrina Trocchi spent the day meeting with colleagues, calling congressional representatives to make the case for the cut programs, and trying to figure out how to retain employees who would otherwise have to be laid off. 
Three programs would have been cut — one that delivered medication assisted treatment in Waterbury, one working to help incarcerated people reenter their communities in Greater New Britain, and one that trains emergency responders to better assist people experiencing a mental health episode. On Thursday afternoon, Trocchi received notice that the funds had been restored. 
“Many staff yesterday across a number of these federally funded programs left their employer, not knowing if they had a job the next day,” Trocchi said. “It’s just absolutely devastating.” 
She said the reversal gave her hope, but the events of the past 24 hours have left her feeling uneasy.
“One of the takeaways for me is that this isn’t the end.

Free.,US Senate Dems launch midterm affordability push with focus on housing costs,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-launch-midterm-affordability-push-focus-housing-costs,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats began detailing their affordability agenda Thursday ahead of the November midterm elections, starting with a focus on housing. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during an event at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, that if Democrats regain control of the House and Senate they would pass legislation to expand rental assistance, reduce barriers to home ownership, build more housing and address predatory practices. Schumer listed several statistics he finds concerning, including that the median price of a home has gone up by 55% since the coronavirus pandemic, that rent has risen by one-third and that the average age for a first-time home buyer is 40. “That's a record high,” he said. “That's a devastating statistic that should shake up everyone in a position of power at the federal, state or local levels.”Schumer said the outline for housing is just the first of several cost-of-living policy proposals Democrats will detail this year as they seek to sway voters in key districts and states to vote for their candidates over Republicans.Democrats, he said, will also focus on how to curb the rising cost of groceries, electricity, child care and health care as part of the midterms messaging. On housing, Schumer said Democrats will focus on legislation that would incentivize construction companies to build more housing to address shortages throughout the country;expand rental assistance, including Section 8 vouchers for low-income families;reduce barriers to home ownership;expand the low-income housing tax credit;allow the Department of Housing and Urban Development to use the Defense Production Act to purchase “housing materials in short supply”;create an agency focused on advanced research into housing issues, similar to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; andblock “predatory companies” from being “allowed to gobble up entire neighborhoods so easily and turn them into profit machines.”Democratic bills would provide down payment assistance, lower the cost of mortgage insurance, expand access to portable mortgages and “reform homeowners insurance which is now at a crisis level and so important for people who can’t afford that down payment,” Schumer said.  Democrats have relatively good odds of winning back control of the House during the November midterm elections, especially since the president’s party tends to lose that chamber two years after taking power. Campaigns to regain control of the Senate will be much more difficult for Democrats, who face challenges keeping seats in Georgia and Michigan, while trying to flip Republican seats in Alaska, Maine, North Carolina and Ohio. Even if voters were to give Democrats control of Congress, leaders in the party would still need some Republican buy-in to move legislation past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster and need President Donald Trump to sign legislation into law, unless they had the two-thirds needed in each chamber to override a veto. A ‘family conversation’Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said during a panel discussion with Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth that was moderated by CAP President and CEO Neera Tanden that he’s been “radicalized on housing” and pressed for members of the party to talk realistically about issues with supply and affordability. “And the reason is that our shortage nationwide, but especially in Hawaii, is so acute that people can't make the math work anymore,” Schatz said. “In Hawaii, people are paying more than 50%, all-in, of their income for housing, either rental housing or paying a mortgage. And what I have come to realize is that we are the problem.""Schatz argued that the government “is the primary impediment to alleviating the shortage” and said that realization has led him to have some “very difficult conversations.” In Hawaii, he said, there are environmental and cultural protections intended to safeguard “special places” but that have ended up applied more broadly, impeding housing development. “They were not originally conceived to prevent a walk-up apartment building on the corner of Eisenberg and King to house Native Hawaiian families,” Schatz said. “And yet those same laws are being weaponized against people in Hawaii even being able to live in the state of Hawaii.”Schatz said Democrats must be honest with voters about what their housing policies would mean for communities throughout the country, contending the party needs to “solve the politics” around expanded housing before it can tackle the policy debate. “I actually think we have to have this family conversation around the politics of housing and realize that some of our base voters in the suburbs, who are otherwise good all the way down the line on all the progressive issues, also want to prevent a nurse or a firefighter or the disabled or the elderly or the student from living anywhere near them,” Schatz said. “And we have to have that conversation in the progressive coalition.”Rethinking inspections, other processesDuckworth said some solutions to housing could come through rethinking the processes in place now, similar to how the Department of Veterans Affairs changed its approach to homeless veterans. “VA used to say, 'You have to get clean and sober, and then we'll give you a voucher to get into an apartment.' And so it made no sense, right?” Duckworth said. “So we had to change the thinking to what the homelessness community had been working on, which is reduction of harm — get them into the housing and then work on getting them clean and sober,” she continued. “And by changing that thought, we were able to immediately start pulling veterans off the streets, put them into housing units where they immediately were also getting counseling, getting treatment.""Duckworth compared the sometimes slow process of housing inspections that can stop construction with the way the government approaches vehicle safety as one possible way to get things moving faster. “With automobiles, we say, ‘This car that you're manufacturing must be able to withstand a crash at 35 miles an hour into a brick wall.' And then when they meet and get that car approved, when we go buy that car, we don't have to take that car to get it inspected from top to bottom, like we do with homes,” Duckworth said. She added: “So why would we not say to homebuilders, especially (prefabricated) homes, if you come to VA and you are willing to get two models of your home, pre-inspected, pre-approved, then when a veteran builds a new home and they say, 'Hey, I'm going to choose one of these models that already has a VA good housekeeping seal of approval,’ they can shortcut that inspection process.""",,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

The census is completed in January.,"No.


Homelessness increased by 9.5% in 2025, according to the state’s annual census of the homeless population. This includes people living in shelters and the “unhoused,”  meaning those living outside or in a place not meant for human habitation, like a car.
The state provides an official point-in-time count of the sheltered and unsheltered people in the state. Last year’s count found a total of 3,735 people lived in shelters or outside in January 2025, compared to 3,410 in January 2024. 
The number of people who are unhoused, however, increased by 45%, rising to 833 from 574 in 2024.
Connecticut providers have argued they need more funding for years. Recently, however, the Trump administration cut federal funding for homelessness services.
Gov. Ned Lamont announced in December he planned to use funding from the recently created Emergency State Response Reserve to support homelessness prevention and response services throughout the state.

Nichols, an appointee of President Trump, ruled construction on Empire Wind could proceed as he considers the merits of the government’s order.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge Thursday cleared the way for a New York offshore wind project to resume construction, a victory for the developer who said a Trump administration order to pause it would likely kill the project in a matter of days.
District Judge Carl J. Nichols, an appointee of President Donald Trump, ruled construction on the Empire Wind project could go forward while he considers the merits of the government’s order to suspend the project. He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind’s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.
Norwegian company Equinor owns Empire Wind. Spokesperson David Schoetz said they welcome the court’s decision and will continue to work in collaboration with authorities. It’s the second developer to prevail in court against the administration this week.
The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects on the East Coast days before Christmas, citing national security concerns. Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House, most recently calling wind farms “losers” that lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.
Developers and states sued seeking to block the order. Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in East Coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays.
On Monday, a judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could resume its project to serve Rhode Island and Connecticut. Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not sufficiently explain the need for a complete stop to construction. That wind farm, called Revolution Wind, is nearly complete. It’s expected to meet roughly 20% of the electricity needs in Rhode Island, the smallest state, and about 5% of Connecticut’s electricity needs.
Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York, with a hearing still to be set. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, plans to ask a judge Friday to block the administration’s order so it can resume construction, too.
The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind LLC, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, joined the rest of the developers in challenging the administration on Thursday. They filed a complaint in District Court in Boston.
Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, said the administration was right to stop construction on national security grounds. He urged officials to immediately appeal the adverse rulings and seek to halt all work pending appellate review. Opponents of offshore wind projects are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey.
[RELATED: NY wind project may die if Trump pause lasts past Friday, developer says]
Empire Wind is 60% complete and designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Equinor said the project was in jeopardy due to the limited availability of specialized vessels, as well as heavy financial losses.
During a hearing Wednesday, Judge Nichols said the government’s main security concern seemed to be over operation of the wind turbines, not construction, although the government pushed back on that contention.
In presenting the government’s case, Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward, Jr. was skeptical of the perfect storm of horrible events that Empire Wind said would derail their entire project if construction didn’t resume. He disagreed with the contention that the government’s main concern was over operation.
“I don’t see how you can make this distinction,” Woodward said. He likened it to a nuclear project being built that presented a national security risk. The government would oppose it being built, and it turning on.
Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind, said in an interview that the company wants to build this project and deliver a major, essential new source of power for New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26014477594025-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 13:57:18.048783

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The University of Arkansas abruptly revoked its offer to the incoming dean of its law school after key Republicans complained about her background and legal position on protections for transgender athletes. 
The school cited “key external stakeholders” in its decision to withdraw its offer to Emily Suski less than a week after she had been announced as the law school’s new dean. 
A UA spokesperson did not return requests for comment Thursday morning, but the university said in a statement that it “decided to go a different direction in filling the vacancy” following feedback “about the fit” between Suski and the university’s vacancy.

Suski did not return requests for comment Thursday morning. 
“University officials are very grateful for Professor Suski’s interest in the position and continue to hold Professor Suski in high regard,” the statement reads. “We wish Professor Suski well as she moves forward with her career.”
The move comes as Republican lawmakers in Arkansas and elsewhere have taken steps to restrict what can be taught in the classroom. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who has advocated for prohibiting transgender athletes, has complained about schools indoctrinating students. 
One of the lawmakers who objected to Suski’s appointment was Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, a Cave Springs Republican.
“There’s no way the people of Arkansas want somebody running and educating our next generation of lawyers and judges [to be] someone that doesn’t understand the difference between a man and a woman,” said Hester, who also cited her position on transgender athletes as a concern.
Suski had been one of 17 law professors who had signed on to a brief defending transgender students’ right to play on the teams of their gender identity. The brief was filed before the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard a pair of cases about state laws banning transgender athletes.
Arkansas has a similar law in effect.
“Although Title IX does not guarantee a student a right to win or even make the team, supra, it does protect every student from being denied the benefits of school sports based on sex, including sex-based generalizations that do not apply to them,” the brief Suski joined said.
Hester said he was surprised that “this person who has these beliefs made it through the initial scanning processes.” He also said he heard from several concerned individuals as soon as Suski’s selection was made public.
Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin also had raised concerns about Suski, his office said. 
“The Attorney General simply expressed his dismay at the selection and his confidence that many more qualified candidates could have been identified,” spokesperson Jeff LeMaster said. “He never requested or even contemplated that the offer be rescinded, but he applauds the decision nonetheless.”
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Sanders, wouldn’t say whether the governor was involved in the university’s decision.
“Governor Sanders appreciates the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, for reaching the commonsense decision on this matter in the best interests of students,” Dubke said in a statement.
Rep. Nicole Clowney, a Fayetteville Democrat and adjunct lecturer at the law school, said in a social media post that she was concerned about the university’s aboutface. 
“I am still gathering information but based on what I’ve learned so far, it seems clear that what happened is a horrifying, unprecedented, and absolutely unconstitutional abuse of state power,” Clowney said. 
Suski is a professor and associate dean at University of South Carolina’s Joseph F. Rice School of Law. Suski’s areas of expertise include education law, particularly Title IX and civil rights in public schools; health and poverty law; and clinical legal education, according to her USC biography. She holds degrees from Georgetown University Law Center and the University of North Carolina.

Ron DeSantis, the Florida Supreme Court Thursday ended its reliance on the agency in charge of accrediting law schools.
This ends Florida’s more than three-decade dependence on the American Bar Association, the state’s sole accrediting body. Because the ABA does not serve Floridians’ “best interest,” five of six justice agreed, Florida will reach out to alternative accreditors, effective Oct. 1.
This comes just one day after DeSantis bashed the ABA as a left-wing organization undeserving of being the “arbiter of legal education,” and months after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier accused the organization of discriminating against Roman Catholics.
“The Court is persuaded that it is not in Floridians’ best interest for the ABA to be the sole gatekeeper deciding which law schools’ graduates are eligible to sit for the state’s General Bar Examination and become licensed attorneys in Florida,” the Court wrote in their nine-page opinion.
Although graduates of ABA-accredited law schools will continue to qualify to sit for the state’s General Bar Examination, so would graduates of law schools accredited by any “subsequently recognized programmatic accreditor,” the opinion continues.
‘Woke’ and ‘partisan’
Higher education in Florida has become a political battleground under DeSantis, who’s vowed to root out and abolish any and all “woke” policies within the state’s institutions. He’s led the nation in overhauling university structures, flipping the progressive New College into a “Hillsdale of the South” while installing GOP leaders as the head of multiple state colleges and universities.
DeSantis’ efforts inspired a nationwide conservative movement. Earlier this week, Texas became the first state in the nation to end its reliance on the ABA, the national agency that serves as the primary accreditor for multiple states.
In a press conference Wednesday, DeSantis slammed the ABA while his staff took to social media and hinted that reporters should “stay tuned” on potentially throwing out the accrediting organization, which has been Florida’s only accrediting body since 1992.
“The ABA is a very, very partisan activist organization, and you have a right to be that, but you should not then be the arbiter of legal education,” DeSantis said.
This echoed comments made by Uthmeier in November, demanding the ABA not “horsewhip” St. Thomas University College of Law, a Catholic institution in Miami that the ABA in August declared out-of-compliance with the association’s anti-discrimination and equal-opportunity standards.
In March, the Florida Supreme Court created a workgroup to propose alternatives to the ABA in the Bar admissions process, partially because “reasonable questions” had arisen about the ABA’s accreditation standards on “racial and ethnic diversity in law schools and about the ABA’s active political engagement.”
This came amid DeSantis’ moves to create a new accreditation system for state universities.
Not all justices agreed on tossing the ABA. Justice Jorge Labarga, the sole non-DeSantis appointee left on the court, dissented.
“I cannot agree with this action,” he wrote. “Regrettably, under the guise of expanding the accrediting agencies for law schools in Florida, the majority has taken the extraordinary step of divesting the ABA of its three decades long status as the sole accreditor of Florida law schools.”
Of note, DeSantis on Wednesday appointed Adam Tanenbaum to the Supreme Court to fill a vacancy left by Charles Canady. This means six out of the seven justices are now DeSantis appointees. Labarga, the lone standout, must retire in October 2027 when he reaches the age limit of 75.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fl_supreme_court-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 12:57:53.044099

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Maj. Gen. Stephen Osborn, the adjutant general of the Iowa National Guard, began his 2026 Condition of the Guard address Thursday by honoring the loss of two Iowa National Guard service members.
Osborn’s remarks come just over a month after Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard of Marshalltown and Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar of Des Moines, were killed in Palmyra, Syria, during an attack by a lone gunman associated with ISIS. Three other Iowa National Guard members were injured, and another U.S. civilian was killed in the Dec. 13, 2025 attack.
“We begin today with heavy hearts, reflecting on the profound loss of two of our finest soldiers,” Osborn said. “Yet even in this time of sorrow, we have witnessed something powerful — the strength, the unity and the compassion of the state of Iowa. On behalf of the entire Iowa National Guard, I want to express our deepest gratitude for the overwhelming outpouring of care and respect shown to our fallen heroes and their families.”
Osborn thanked Iowans for their support of the National Guard, the soldiers and their families following the attack, in addition for the continued support of the three Guard members who were injured. He also honored the more than 1,800 Iowa soldiers and airmen who are still deployed in the Middle East, where they “continue to carry out critical missions that are ongoing, demanding and vital to our national security.”
Lt. Col. Jeremy Taylor, deputy state chaplain in the Iowa National Guard, was brought to the podium to lead the chamber in prayer honoring Torres-Tovar and Howard, saying “these young men, Lord, were willing to walk through the shadow of the valley of death, doing what they loved and serving others.”
“They embodied what you taught us that there is no greater love than this, than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends,” Taylor said.
In her Condition of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Kim Reynolds also honored the Iowans who died in the attack. Howard’s wife, parents and brother attended the address while the Torres-Tovar family held a memorial service at their local church Tuesday night. Reynolds said “their service lives on — in the families they cherished, in the communities they strengthened and in the freedoms they helped preserve.”

Osborn said in light of the tragedy in Syria, he understands there are many Iowans wondering, “Why is the Guard in Syria?”
“That’s a fair question, and one that I want to clearly address today,” Osborn said. “The National Guard is a core component of our nation’s total force, providing 40% of the army and 30% of the Air Force operational force. … The National Guard is no longer a strategic reserve to be utilized in times of the most extreme national emergencies. We are and will continue to be, the primary combat reserve in the United States Army and the United States Air Force.”
The adjutant general said Iowa National Guard members are in Syria “and many other locations around the world” because the reserve forces serve as a critical fixture in Iowa’s national security efforts both domestically and abroad.
Osborn’s address did not touch on many specific requests for the Iowa Legislature in 2026, but he asked for support in the National Guard’s modernization efforts in coming years. Over the next decade, he said, the Guard and the whole U.S. military system will “undergo one of the most significant periods of transformation and modernization in our history” as it adapts and integrates new technologies like artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and space assets, as well as making organizational and personnel changes.
“In the Iowa National Guard, transformation is underway as we build a more advanced and capable force,” Osborn said. “We are launching new Air National Guard units designed with next generation technologies and creating new and challenging training opportunities for our airmen. We are also proactively shaping our future army force structure to be highly relevant in a changing world, while simultaneously delivering value here in Iowa.”
An important component of these efforts are infrastructure investments, Osborn said. He highlighted several federally funded efforts across the state, thanking the state’s congressional delegation for their support authorizing the $220 million investment to replace the runway and parking ramp at the 185th Air Refueling Wing in Sioux City, which was included in the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Funds for this effort still must be appropriated before the runway project can begin, he said.
He also pointed to new Readiness Center in West Des Moines that opened in 2025 as a vital facility for supporting the Army National Guard “well into the future,” as well as the Guard breaking ground on a $14 million federally funded Army National Guard equipment maintenance facility in Sioux City. In 2026, Osborn said, the National Guard will begin construction on another $14 million federally funded project in Waterloo, for an equipment maintenance facility.
As the year begins, Osborn said three priorities will guide the National Guard: a focus on service members through recruitment and support, conducting trainings that prepare the force for “increasingly complex missions at home and abroad,” and modernization of the Guard’s structure, infrastructure and equipment.
“This transformation strengthens the readiness of the Iowa National Guard, while creating opportunity for Iowa through economic growth, job creation and stronger communities, ensuring the Iowa National Guard remains ready for the future,” he said.

Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, speaks during a debate on the rules for the chamber as part of the organizational session on Dec. 4, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan announced Thursday she will not seek reelection this year.
Hogan, of Fargo, a longtime leader of the Democratic-NPL Party, said it was a difficult decision to step away, but family matters needed to come first.
“My husband is 90, so it was a family decision and it’s very bittersweet,” Hogan said in an interview with the North Dakota Monitor. “It has nothing to do with the Legislature. It just has to do with my family’s needs.”
She represented Fargo residents of District 21 in the North Dakota House of Representatives starting in 2009 and has served in the Senate since 2019, including the two previous legislative sessions as minority leader. Prior to her time as a lawmaker, she worked in human services for 40 years, which included 28 years as director of Cass County Social Services.
Hogan said she’s proud of the strides the state has made in improving behavioral health and the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy. One thing she hopes she’s remembered for is her ability to work with almost anyone.
“I think I bring a deeply respectful approach to all opinions,” she said. “The power of being nice, I think, sometimes we forget about it.”
She added she thinks state government is in a better position now than when she began serving in the Legislature 17 years ago.
“The thing that gives me hope is the new governor,” Hogan said of Republican Kelly Armstrong. “He’s very practical and he knows the legislative process and understands the difference between policy making and administration of the executive branch, and that gives me a lot of hope.”
Hogan said she plans to stay involved in issues that she is passionate about as an advocate.
Former North Dakota U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp was among Democrats who praised Hogan’s legislative service Thursday.
“She consistently delivered wins for the marginalized, and her advocacy for health care, Medicaid recipients, and our state’s children will be hallmarks of her service,” Heitkamp said in a statement.
Sen. Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, assistant Senate minority leader, said Hogan’s legacy extends beyond her time in state government.
North Dakota Democrats announce state convention in Bismarck

“Well before she was elected to the Legislature, she played an instrumental role in improving the quality of life for our citizens and working toward a healthier North Dakota,” Boschee said in a statement. 
The Cass County Democratic-NPL District will meet Feb. 7 to endorse candidates for the Legislature and delegates for the party’s convention in Bismarck on March 6-7.
Hogan also had advice for anyone considering running for elected office.
“If you are curious and want to learn about democracy, step into the arena,” Hogan said. “Whether it’s city, county, school boards, library boards, until we get people committed to making democracy work, our democracy won’t thrive, and everyone should be involved at some point.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Education committee leaders in the Oklahoma Legislature have put literacy laws at the forefront of their yearly policy goals, further entrenching childhood reading as a top focus for the 2026 legislative session.
Only 26% of Oklahoma public school students made a proficient score on statewide reading tests last year. Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, and Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, who lead Senate and House committees on K-12 schooling, both announced legislation this week aimed at improving those outcomes.
While groups like the Oklahoma State Chamber advocate for more students to repeat third grade if they’re too far behind in reading, Pugh and Lowe’s literacy plans would make student retention a possibility in first and second grade, as well. 
Third grade is too long to wait, Pugh said.
“My approach is we identify and intervene as early as possible so that we never have to get to that point,” he said in an interview with Oklahoma Voice. “For kids that do get to that point, then yes, there’s going to be a retention component, but as early as possible, you identify and you intervene.”
Lowe and Pugh both suggested schools give students summer tutoring and an end-of-summer reading test before finalizing retention decisions.
Pugh’s plan, outlined in Senate Bill 1778, also would require a transitional year before retention. Students in a transitional year would stay with their age-group cohort but spend the school year receiving extensive remediation in reading concepts they still need to master. If not caught up after a transitional year, a student could repeat a grade.
Oklahoma’s current reading instruction law, which Pugh co-wrote in 2024, removed a requirement that students repeat third grade if they score well below their grade level. 
Only 2% of third graders were retained even with the requirement still in place, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.That’s because the state allowed students multiple exemptions and other avenues to avoid it.
“To me, with all the exemptions on the books, it was almost like we needed to start over and reevaluate,” Pugh said. “And now we have.”
Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, proposed a bill to add reading interventions for struggling students. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
Lowe’s House Bill 3023 would prohibit schools from using only digital technology for reading intervention. Most instruction would have to come directly from a teacher, specialist or literacy coach trained in the science of reading.
Retired teachers would be allowed to contract with the Oklahoma State Department of Education to work as reading coaches, under the bill.
“Literacy remains a major concern for Oklahoma parents, educators and policymakers,” Lowe said in a statement. “House Bill 3023 might not be exactly the right solution, but now is the time to bring ideas to the table and have thoughtful discussions about how we can all help improve literacy for all students.”
The state should increase funding for districts to hire reading specialists to work with students, Pugh said, and to grow the Education Department’s literacy instructional team that provides professional development to schools. He said he also will push to increase public school funding overall with the goal of offsetting inflation and adding more school days.
He and the Senate Appropriations Committee will reveal the potential budget impact and a funding source for the investment in the coming weeks, Pugh said.
As the state continues to grapple with a shortage of qualified educators, Pugh also proposed several new incentives for teachers: a $2,500 base salary increase for all teachers, a $10,000 tax credit for teachers who work in the same district for at least seven years, six weeks of paternity leave for school employees and doubling the college scholarship funds available for aspiring educators.

Not all of the new incentives have a fiscal impact estimate yet, Pugh said, but he expects the $2,500 teacher pay raise to cost between $135 million and $140 million.
Lowe’s HB 3022 would prohibit schools from hiring uncertified adjunct instructors to teach core subject areas in pre-K through sixth grade. That would include math, science, English language arts and social sciences. Senate Education Committee Vice Chairperson Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, filed a similar bill.
Lowe’s legislation also would require adjunct teachers to have at least a high school diploma. State law currently doesn’t require a minimum education level for adjunct instructors, only that they have “distinguished qualifications in their field.”
“These bills reflect years’ worth of conversations with educators, parents and community leaders,” Lowe said of his policy agenda. “My goal is to build thoughtful, practical policy that strengthens Oklahoma’s education system and better prepare students for life after graduation while providing consistent, reliable support for our teachers.”

Janet Mills' Jan. 2025 State of the Budget address. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Republican legislators are blaming Gov. Janet Mills for the rumored increase in immigration operations in Maine because she allowed a new law to limit local cooperation with federal agents.  
“This is what happens when you have a Governor who puts political brinkmanship over the safety of Maine citizens,”  Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said in a statement Thursday. “Her actions place law enforcement and the general public at heightened risk.”
Stewart specifically mentioned a new state law that will bar local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement. Mills allowed it to become law without her signature, though it won’t take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns. 
State and local police already cannot enforce immigration laws, which are a federal matter, however local authorities have contributed to immigration arrests in Maine, including through traffic stops and 911 calls.
Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matthew Harrington (R-York) claimed that more resources need to be expended on immigration enforcement because of laws like the one that will take effect in Maine later this year.
Gov. Mills OKs restrictions on local involvement in immigration enforcement

The Trump administration vowed an immigration crackdown since he began his second term and his signature spending legislation passed in July increased immigration enforcement funding by tens of billions of dollars.  
“This entire situation is self-imposed and self-created by legislative Democrats and Governor Mills,” Harrington said. Mills did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This comes as tensions rise across the nation following the fatal shooting by a federal officer in Minnesota. 
Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline and Portland Mayor Mark Dion announced on Wednesday that they are expecting increased federal immigration presence in their communities soon, though neither responded to questions about how they were notified. 
Mills directed Maine State Police to work closely with local police as necessary “to provide whatever support is needed, in advance of and during any potential federal operations” in a video message late Wednesday, in which she also said the federal government “is not welcome” if it plans to be provocative or undermine residents’ civil rights. 
Sheline and Dion urged residents and businesses to know their rights and create a plan in case they are stopped by federal authorities. 
On Tuesday, Trump also threatened financial retribution against so-called sanctuary cities and states with policies against helping U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest people suspected of living illegally in the U.S.
Trump, speaking Tuesday to the Detroit Economic Club, said he would cut off “any payments” starting Feb. 1 “to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GOPbudget-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 12:57:53.044099

Monique Miller, sponsor of a proposal to eliminate property taxes on homesteaded properties within 10 years.A proposed constitutional amendment to go before the voters that would gradually increase the homestead exemption for non-school-related property taxes by $100,000 each year for 10 years advanced in a House committee Thursday.
The resolution (HJR 203), sponsored by Rep. Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, would, if approved first by the Legislature and then by the voters in November, take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.
“Given that the median home price is about $350,000, most Floridians will have zero non-school ad valorem property taxes by 2030,” Miller told the State House Affairs Committee.
Her proposal is one of a group of measures on property taxes making its way through the House, but whether the Legislature will approve it to go before the voters is in question. There is no Senate companion to Miller’s resolution, and Senate President Ben Albritton and Gov. Ron DeSantis have already said that they believe there should be only one constitutional amendment on the topic in November.
The concept of reducing or eliminating property taxes is controversial, with representatives from some local governments claiming it would devastate their budgets.
The state’s Revenue Estimating Conference has estimated that if the measure passes, it would have a negative cash impact of $4.4 billion and a negative recurring impact of $13.3 billion on local non-school property tax revenues in fiscal year 2027/2028, according to a bill analysis.
Rep. Lindsay Cross, D-St.Petersburg, said she had seen estimates that, under Miller’s proposal, 40 Florida counties would lose close to 40% of their taxing base in the first year.
Jeff Scala with the Florida Association of Counties repeated that statistic, forecasting a $2.9 billion hit to counties in the first year and that by the third or fourth year, “many of the counties are wiped off the rolls.”
“The math doesn’t work. This is fiscal crisis by design,” he said.
Carveouts for emergency services
Proponents of a major property tax reduction such as DeSantis and Florida CFO Blaise Ingoglia contend that local government spending increased disproportionately from 2019 to 2024, and that local governments could afford a reduction in property tax revenue.
Charles Chapman with the Florida League of Cities said that notion was misleading. He agreed property tax revenues have increased in recent years, but said so has the cost of providing local government services, “including facility and infrastructure construction, employee recruitment and retention, [and the] cost of capital equipment replacement.”
Among the members of the public who spoke against the resolution was Dave Shula, a commissioner with Juniper Inlet Colony, a small incorporated town in Palm Beach County. He said that 81% of his city’s revenue comes from property taxes, and the budget this year for police and firefighters is $2.1 million. But if property taxes were eliminated, he said, the city would have just $900,000 in revenue from other sources.
“That would significantly affect our ability to handle that,” said Shula, the son of the late Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula.
The resolution originally would have banned local governments from reducing total funding for law enforcement below levels budgeted in the 2025-2026 or 2026-2027 fiscal years. An amendment was approved in the committee to create a carveout for firefighters and other first respondents from having their budgets reduced.
The resolution has one more committee stop before reaching the House floor. A Senate companion has yet to be filed. Proposed constitutional amendments must be approved by three-fifths of both chambers to get on the ballot.
Meanwhile, a poll by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy on behalf of the nonpartisan Florida Policy Institute released Thursday found that 63% of Florida voters — including 73% of Democrats, 58% of Republicans, and 60% of independents — believe property insurance relief is a higher priority than property tax relief. Only 32% of voters said that property tax relief was the higher priority.
The poll also found that roughly half of Florida voters, 49%, opposed elimination of the non-school property tax on homesteads upon hearing that such a move could result in local governments cutting services or implementing new taxes to make up for the lost revenue. Only 39% of Florida voters supported the proposal while 12% were undecided.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-at-9.27.45 AM-e1768496395747-1024x833.png,,,2026-01-15 12:57:53.044099

Student and advocacy groups are pushing back on what they see as further federal attacks on trans youth.

Vermont’s largest school district is being investigated under federal allegations that it has violated laws surrounding transgender student athletes’ participation in sports.
The Champlain Valley School District is among 18 entities in 10 states being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights “based on complaints submitted to OCR alleging that they have violated Title IX,” according to a press release issued by the department Wednesday.
Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education. Champlain Valley is the only Vermont school district named in the release.
“In the same week that the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on the future of Title IX, OCR is aggressively pursuing allegations of discrimination against women and girls by entities which reportedly allow males to compete in women’s sports,” Kimberly Richey, assistant secretary for the Office of Civil Rights, said in the release.
CVSD was among the first in Vermont to craft a policy in 2023 affirming the rights of trans and gender nonconforming students. It allows transgender students to use their chosen names and pronouns in most cases, and to participate in activities that align with their gender identity, according to the district’s website.
The U.S. Department of Education considers such policies a threat to “the safety and the equal opportunities of women in educational programs and activities,” according to the press release.
District officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Student and advocacy groups are pushing back on what they see as further federal attacks on trans youth.
Aaliyah Washburn, coordinator of culture for the student-run statewide nonprofit group Vermont Student Anti-Racism Network, said she believes everyone has a right to play sports. 
“As a college athlete, when I’m on the field or court, I’m not thinking about another player’s sexual orientation or gender identity, I’m focused on how I can support my team, improve, and win. That should be the reality for most athletes. Sports are about teamwork, growth, and competition, not policing who someone is,” she said in an email.
The continuing debate over transgender athletes’ participation in sports is “a distraction” and “disconnected from reality,” according to a newsletter this week from the statewide LGBTQ+ youth nonprofit Outright Vermont.
“Transgender youth are not a talking point. They are real, brilliant, and amazing people” who deserve being supported and not attacked by adults politicizing the issue, Executive Director Dana Kaplan wrote.
There are very few transgender youth athletes nationwide and even fewer across individual states, he said, and they just want to “have a healthy outlet and participate in school sports alongside their peers.”
Meanwhile, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark this week joined 11 others to sue the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for “unlawfully conditioning” federal health, education and research funding based on states’ agreement to discriminate against transgender people.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, refers to the federal government forcing compliance with a presidential executive order that “seeks to deny the existence of transgender people and impose rigid, unscientific definitions of sex in violation of state laws that protect transgender people from discrimination.”
“This is yet another illegal attack by the President and his administration on transgender people,” Clark said in a press release. “I will continue to stand with transgender Vermonters and use every tool available to defend their rights in our state. I also will continue to fight back against this Administration’s efforts to coerce public institutions into ideological submission.”
This story will be updated.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)“How sad that indigenous people have to prove they are not illegal immigrants,” wrote Cindy Smith in response to a Facebook posting by the Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.
On Jan. 10, the LCO Tribal Governing Board issued an immediate release that it was “closely monitoring recent events that took place in Minneapolis, and around the country involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agents.”
Just a few days before, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, was shot and killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent in South Minneapolis.
Over 1,000 ICE agents were in the Twin Cities area as a major campaign that has received national attention to detain and arrest those who had reportedly violated federal immigration laws. The agents not only tracked down those without legal status to reside in the U.S., but also questioned and detained others because of their appearance, such as skin color and accent, whether or not they were legal residents or citizens. Caught up in the crackdown were at least five Native Americans who were detained, including four Oglala Sioux from South Dakota and one from the Red Lake reservation in Minnesota.
Jose Roberto “Beto” Ramirez, a Red Lake descendant, told a reporter for ICT that he was trailed by an SUV and  when he parked in a grocery store parking lot, he was dragged out of his vehicle without explanation and detained for several hours. Ramirez said he felt like he had been “kidnapped”. He  was subsequently released without any charges.
News reports from the Twin Cities have stated that Native Americans, who are fully U.S. citizens, had been approached by ICE agents regarding their immigration/citizenship status.
In response to Native Americans being stopped by ICE, several Wisconsin tribes issued statements voicing concern over the stops and also offering advice to their members.
“We humbly offer our sincere condolences to all those affected by these incidents,” reads the Lac Courte Oreilles release, which assured members that the Tribal Governing Board “is actively working to ensure our tribe and members are as safe as possible and is reviewing policies to implement access restrictions in areas that are non-public, employee-only, and restricted to ensure our facilities are entitled to every legal protection possible.
“In these unprecedented and uncertain times, it is essential that we remain vigilant and protect one another. We encourage everyone to stand together in solidarity to support each other spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically. The safety and well-being of all tribal members continues to be our highest priority. We will do everything in our power to protect our members, reservation, government buildings, and enterprises.”
Jon Greendeer, president of the Ho-Chunk Nation posted Wednesday, Jan. 14, “My office and social media feeds have been buzzing with concerned tribal members following the recent shooting of an American Citizen by an armed ICE official. Now with the news of alleged door-to-door campaigns, the threat literally hits home.”
Also on Jan. 14, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians posted the following: “The Tribe wants to be clear: we do not support or cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Our priority is the safety, dignity, and protection of our tribal members. We are deeply concerned by reports coming out of Minnesota involving the detention of tribal members, as well as ICE actively being reported in areas near our community. As indigenous people to this land, our identity should never be questioned, challenged, or used as a reason for detention.”
On Jan. 12, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians issued a statement on “opposing ICE and affirming tribal sovereignty,” which said, in part, that tribal leaders “strongly oppose the actions and presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) including the targeting of community members, the detention and separation of families, and the ongoing disregard of human rights.”
On Jan. 10, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community alerted members on Facebook that Native Americans “are being caught up in raids and detained.”
Like several of the tribal posts, the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe encourages its members to be prepared for being “stopped, detained and questioned regarding your citizenship.”
Even though tribal members are U.S. citizens, Wisconsin tribal members are being encouraged to carry their tribal, state and federal IDs and even birth certificates.
On Jan. 14, the LCO tribe said it would be issuing ID cards for enrolled members who live off the reservation in the Twin Cities at the Minneapolis American Indian Center Rotunda, and like other tribes, LCO noted that fees are being waived for the ID cards.
On Jan. 11, the Oneida Nation offered detailed guidance if members encountered ICE agents:

 “Stay calm and ask for identification.”
 “Always carry your Oneida ID.”
 “If detained, say ‘I want to speak with an attorney.’”
 “Report encounters to Oneida Police Department.”
 “At home, keep the door closed and request a judicial warrant.”

Several tribes are notifying members that if the ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, the agents do not have permission to enter their home without consent.
ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.
Some of the tribes are advising members if ICE comes to their doors without  a judicial warrant to not only not open their doors, but also report the presence of the ICE agents to tribal police.
The Ho-Chunk Nation said it will provide its members with door signs for law enforcement that “alert” officers of the “state, tribal and federal citizenship” status of the residents and communicate that “agents may not enter the property without a valid warrant.”

W. Bush in response to civil unrest that included the deaths of 63 people, following the acquittal of four white police officers charged with beating to death Black driver Rodney King. The statute has been used about 30 times since the country’s founding, according to records kept by the Brennan Center for Justice.Protests erupted across the Twin Cities after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in south Minneapolis on Jan. 7.The demonstrations escalated Wednesday night after a federal immigration agent shot and injured a man in north Minneapolis. According to a statement issued by the Department of Homeland Security, a man crashed his vehicle and ran away as agents were “conducting a targeted traffic stop” at 6:50 p.m. Central time. An agent fired “a defensive shot to defend his life” after the man and two bystanders “attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” according to the statement. The agent shot the man in the leg, according to the department. The statement described the man as “an illegal alien from Venezuela who was released into the country by Joe Biden in 2022.”States Newsroom’s Minnesota Reformer was unable to confirm the account. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said in a late-night press conference that the man was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.The Reformer reported that scores of demonstrators arrived at the scene, sparking a back-and-forth with agents, who deployed tear gas and flash bangs. Agents detained at least two people after someone threw fireworks at the agents. At least two vehicles believed to be used by federal officers were vandalized. The clashes largely stopped by 11:30 p.m., according to the Reformer.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey asked for calm and reiterated his call for the Trump administration to remove ICE from the city.Trump surged more ICE agents to Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of Good, bringing the total to roughly 3,000 — far outnumbering the city’s 600 local police officers.",,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

Jim Pillen delivers his State of the State address Jan. 25, 2023. (Courtesy of the Unicameral Information Office)LINCOLN — With a projected $471 million budget deficit on the horizon, Gov. Jim Pillen looked to the state Department of Health and Human Services for the largest chunk of his proposed budget cuts.
Pillen previewed his preferred mid-cycle adjustments to the state’s biennial budget Thursday during his annual State of the State Address. Overall, the governor’s changes would reduce state spending by 0.4% in the current fiscal year and by 1.8% in fiscal year 2027.
Across the whole of state government, Pillen proposes $495 million in spending cuts over both years, the current one and next. Calculations from his office indicate this would lead to Nebraska having a $125 million surplus by the end of FY 2027, a projection partially based on expected increases to state revenues.
While the last year has seen a mixed bag of monthly tax revenues, State Budget Administrator Neil Sullivan argued that state tax receipts have been gradually increasing over the last decade.
Roughly 30% of the cuts Pillen is proposing would come out of DHHS, the largest state agency. Pillen’s plan proposes a $22 million cut to the department this year and a $130.4 million cut next fiscal year.
Sullivan said the DHHS cuts would be covered by staffing adjustments, increasing federal funding and “replacing expensive contracts.” The governor’s plan proposes the agency use more than $25 million to convert roughly 360 outside contractors to in-house positions.
On staffing adjustments, Sullivan said there would be no need for new layoffs to meet the budgeted reductions.
“The changes are already done,” Sullivan said.
Of the proposed DHHS cuts, one of the largest would be to the state’s Aged and Disabled Waiver program, which would be reduced by more than $14.1 million. AD waivers allow aging Nebraskans and those with a disability to remain at home.
Sullivan said broad-based provider rate increases under the program led to increasing costs Nebraska shouldered that “got so far out of line.” He said the governor wants to take a more strategic approach.
“We can’t be paying four times the cost of nursing homes so one person can stay home,” Sullivan said. “We can’t be paying [for] 24 hours of services for someone that lives with their disabled family member.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some AD Waiver recipients and caregivers told the Examiner the program has been a “lifeline.” They say the reimbursements help stabilize incomes, as many caregivers and recipients might be unable to work outside the home due to the need to care for a loved one 24/7.
The Governor’s Office could not immediately confirm how much the proposal would cut from the program, if approved. DHHS officials previously said annual costs totaled $383.6 million in mid-2025, compared to $91 million in mid-2016.
Pillen’s proposal also boosts the budgets of some programs within DHHS, which brings the total reduction for the department to $152 million. Some notable increases include an additional $32.7 million to Children and Family Services, and an increase of $56.5 million to cover a higher-than-expected increase in Medicaid-eligible individuals.
In a somewhat surprising move, Pillen’s budget proposal would not make any changes to state appropriations for the University of Nebraska. Last year, Pillen proposed a 2% decrease in state funding for the university, but lawmakers landed on a modest increase of roughly $8.7 million per year.
On top of filling the projected budget hole, Pillen hopes to pass $170 million in new property tax relief, according to Sullivan. However, he noted that change is contingent on state revenues increasing enough to meet that amount.
Sullivan said much of Pillen’s budget plan relies on cash fund transfers, a staple of the governor’s budget strategy since he took office. The overall impact would cut more than $80 million over what Pillen’s team identified as “idle cash funds.”
Sullivan said some of the cash funds they considered have not been touched in over a decade. In previous years, state officials were looking for excess cash balances, Sullivan said. This time around, all cash funds were weighed.
“We looked at everything,” Sullivan said.
Other highlights of the governor’s budget proposal include:

$18.4 million reduction in special education reimbursements for FY 27
$19 million reduction to Tobacco Products Administration Cash Fund
$50.7 million increase to Water Recreation Enhancement Fund
$31.6 million reduction to Department of Revenue Operations in FY 27
$22 million reduction to Kinship Foster Care program
$15 million increase to Business Innovation Act
$11.9 million added to Nebraska’s school funding formula, the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act
$23.8 million increase to Nebraska Capital Construction Fund

(Getty Images)Nevada’s unemployment rate has typically ranked among the nation’s highest for years, going back to the Great Recession.
Paradoxically, the state also has a lot of job openings, Gov. Joe Lombardo noted on a local podcast in December.
So why is the unemployment rate high while a lot of job openings go unfilled?
“They’re not quality jobs,” Lombardo said. 
“Especially in the service industry, the dollar per hour is just not high enough for them,” and the job doesn’t pencil out if, for example, child care costs as much or more than the job pays, Lombardo explained.
Last summer when announcing his campaign to oust Lombardo, Attorney General Aaron Ford recounted how not long ago he had asked his son, who was graduating from college out of state, if he was going to come home.
“He said, ‘Dad, why would I come back to Nevada? You have no jobs.’” 
His son “said out loud what a lot of people in the state have been thinking,” Ford said.
Ford and Lombardo seem to agree on one thing: Nevada’s economy is a low-wage affair.
And that’s not all they agree on, unfortunately. 
Both also expound the long-standing and deeply ingrained Nevada conventional wisdom that the best and surest and only way to increase the quality of jobs in Nevada is to attract different types of jobs than the ones Nevada already has. 
As Lombardo put it on the podcast, Nevada needs to “change who we’re trying to attract.”
Similarly, at his campaign announcement, Ford touted his support while in the Legislature of policies “to bring in new sectors, like tech, like clean energy, and advanced manufacturing, to create more good-paying jobs.” 
That hard-wired faith in “economic development” based on “incentives,” shared by Lombardo, Ford, and most state elected officials of both parties, has resulted in public subsidies for a football stadium, a baseball stadium, a couple phases of Tesla’s factory complex, a film and video industry tax credit program (authored by Ford), and scores of other projects and ventures, most recently an infestation of water- and power-guzzling data centers. 
Alexis Hill, the Washoe County Commissioner who is running against Ford in the Democratic primary for governor, is among a minority of Nevada politicians who have openly blasted economic development as usual.
“This type of economic development has been the Republican and Democratic establishment’s go-to for a decade, and it hasn’t worked,” Hill declares.
Nevadans may never know if Tesla, the football field, etc. would have come to the state without the state providing tax breaks and other subsidies. 
But with Lombardo’s remarks on a podcast in December and Ford’s remarks while announcing his campaign to oust Lombardo in July, both men effectively conceded Hill is right: Economic development based on giveaways to business has failed to deliver as promised. Nevada job openings are still, as Lombardo put it, “not quality jobs.”
The real jobs of tomorrow
Just because jobs aren’t considered “quality” doesn’t mean they aren’t crucial to the economy and the people who live in it.
Over the next decade, the occupation with the highest projected numeric growth — by far — is home health and personal care aides, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In 2023, state legislators passed, and Lombardo signed, legislation raising the minimum wage for home care aides to $16 an hour. It was a victory for workers. It was also inadequate even before it took effect in 2024.
Those Nevada occupations that are, as Lombardo says, “not quality,” are also not going anywhere: The jobs with the third, fourth, and fifth highest projected numeric growth over the next decade are “stockers and order fillers,” “fast food counter workers,” and restaurant cooks. As with home health and personal care aides, the median annual pay for those occupations is less than $40,000. 
In other words, the jobs we’ve got are not only, well, the jobs we’ve got. They’re also going to be the occupations that will continue to have the most job openings for the foreseeable future, no matter how many stadiums or battery factories or data centers or YouTube shows the state subsidizes.
Lombardo’s underlying economic pitch is the traditional Republican one, wherein there are few if any things that can’t be fixed by cutting taxes and repealing regulations. Ford has pushed proposals to rein in price gouging and vowed to support public programs that Lombardo doesn’t (free school lunches). Ford was also scheduled to outline a housing proposal Thursday.
Along with opposition to corporate giveaways, Hill has outlined positions to reset property taxes when properties are sold, impose temporary caps on rent, and tax corporate investments as assets. Those alone would earn her the award for most candid candidate for Nevada governor of 2026.
She can also be the most refreshing.
“We tax poor people disproportionately more because of our very high sales tax. We need to bring all industries to this table,” Hill told the Current in response to questions about the state’s lowest-in-the-nation gaming tax.
While Hill derides corporate giveaways, she does call for investments “in our existing businesses,” and “in our workforce,” in at least an echo of the traditional (if downsized) economic and workforce development strategies Nevada has touted for years.
As Hill, Ford, Lombardo, and most Nevada elected officials know (to varying degrees), training for workers and support for businesses are not the only ways to increase job quality and household financial security.
But those are the ways that get the most attention.
And undeservedly so.
Nevada’s $12 minimum wage is an insult and needs to be raised. Thirteen states require employers to provide paid family and medical leave, and Nevada should join them. Erratic and irregular work schedules wreak havoc not only on household finances but family health and well-being. The state’s tax structure preys on the poor. Housing policy isn’t designed to serve people who pay the rent but the industry that collects it. Public transit is an afterthought. There are multiple policies the state can enact or reform (or empower local governments to do so) to directly and indirectly make the jobs Nevadans already have a lot better.
Truly consequential reforms would require political will.
And as prerequisite to political will, politicians and the voters who elect them need to stop disdaining the jobs Nevada already has, as if those jobs (and the people who hold them) are the problem. They’re not the problem. They’re the jobs we’ve got. (And Nevada isn’t special; they’re the jobs most states have got.) 
Politicians and the state’s rather sprawling “economic development” industry should shift their focus to improving the quality of those jobs, instead of disparaging them while fantasizing about replacing them.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1269178386-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

Ryan McLaren, a former aide to U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., announced a campaign to be the state’s next lieutenant governor on Thursday.
The Essex Junction resident’s bid was widely expected. He will face former Lt. Gov. Molly Gray, who announced her 2026 campaign for the state’s second highest office last week, in this year’s Democratic primary. On the Republican side, current Lt. Gov. John Rodgers has said he plans to run again.
“Right now, too many Vermonters feel knocked down or stuck. It’s too hard to find a home you can afford. It’s too hard to find childcare or a doctor. And it’s too hard for working people to make ends meet,” McLaren said in a campaign press release. “But I know what’s possible when we don’t quit, when our communities show up for one another and we all work together.”
McLaren has not previously run for statewide office. He worked in Welch’s office for about a decade, and before that, worked for the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles as well as the state chapter of the Democratic Party.
This story will be updated.

Seated with Foley is Valerie Moseley, deputy director of the department (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).Whether inmates die while in state custody is not used to measure the performance of Missouri’s private prison health care contractor,  the state’s top corrections official told lawmakers Wednesday. 
The 14 performance standards in Centurion Health’s contract track timelines for services, such as dental visits and physical exams, but do not include inmate mortality, said Travis Foley, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections.
During most of a two-hour hearing of the Missouri House Corrections Committee, Foley sought to tamp down reports that Centurion medical staff walked out of the Jefferson City Correctional Center in October. Under questioning from state Rep. Gregg Bush, a Democrat from Columbia, Foley listed several of the performance measures and said he would provide the full list.
“Is any of them mortality?” Bush asked.
“No,” Foley replied.
“Okay, so that’s not actually a measure that we’re measuring from our health care vendor,” Bush said.
“Not in terms of the outcome,” Foley said.
There was no way to know how many people died in Missouri prisons — until now

For several years, advocates for prisoner rights have been sounding alarms about the historically high number of deaths in Missouri’s 19 prisons occurring at the same time the prison population is well off its peak. 
There were 24,454 people in custody on June 30, down from about 33,000 in 10 years. In 2024, a record 139 people died, with 74 due to natural causes, 34 for unknown reasons and 23 due to accidents, a category that includes drug overdoses.
ML Smith, founder of the Missouri Justice Coalition, tracks deaths in custody and told the committee she has received reports for last year of 108 deaths through Nov. 30. Whether inmates are dying should be a major performance measure for Centurion, she said.
The fact that it’s not, Smith said, is “very disturbing for me, because a lot of people die within our prison system.” 
Too many of the deaths classified as natural are young, she said. Of the 74 who died of natural causes in 2024, 34 were in custody for 10 years or less.
When a coroner lists a death as resulting from natural causes, it doesn’t necessarily mean the person received adequate care for the condition that resulted in their death, former Texas County Coroner Marie Lasater told The Independent in early 2025. The term covers an unexpected death for any reason from a treatable medical condition.
Smith wants the state to fire Centurion and find a new provider. Centurion is not meeting staffing standards, she alleged, making people in custody wait for care or miss medications.” 
“Centurion is not adhering to its contractual obligations and metrics,” Smith said, “and (the department) is not holding Centurion to those obligations and the prescribed ultimate consequence, which is the termination of the contract.” 
ML Smith, right, speaks with state Rep. Don Mayhew, a Crocker Republican and chairman of the House Corrections Committee, following a hearing Wednesday on the state’s contract with a private company to provide health care in state prisons (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
No one from Centurion testified during Wednesday’s hearing.
Centurion, once a subsidiary of Centene Corp. but now privately owned, has been Missouri’s prison health contractor since 2021. The company renegotiated its deal in 2024, receiving a boost of about $20 million annually and agreeing to the 14 performance standards, up from five, Foley said.
The company has been fined for failing to meet standards in each of the quarters since the renewed contract was signed, Foley said, paying back a total of $3 million.
Centurion will be paid $212 million this year, Foley said.
Staffing has been an issue, Foley said, but there was no mass walkout of Centurion employees at Jefferson City Correctional Center.
Centurion contracts to provide the equivalent of 73 medically trained employees, mainly nurses, at the prison, Foley said. In the last six months of the year, there were 28 who changed jobs for promotions, resigned or were fired, he said.
In the same period, 19 new employees were hired. 
“There was no single month that had more than 10 departures, no single week had more than three, and no single day had more than two,” Foley said. “So I am not sure that there was anything that constituted an organized walkout.”
Centurion transferred staff into the prison, made sure a supervisory team was on site and hired contract nurses to cover shifts, Foley said. 
The performance standards that must be met include having 90% of a list of services completed in a specified period of time. There are also numerical standards for completing evaluations for substance abuse, tests for tuberculosis and referrals for mental health treatment.
The fines imposed on Centurion are for not meeting those standards, Foley said. While the contract has staffing requirements, the department wants the services provided and that is what the fines cover, he said.
That brought another question from Bush, who in addition to his legislative duties works as a registered nurse.
“Is it the same penalties that they’ve had or are they finding new ways to not live up to their contract?” he asked.
“I would say that it varies,” Foley replied.
Jerika White, criminal justice policy manager at Empower Missouri, a nonprofit that advocates for low-income residents, joined Smith for testimony to counter Foley’s assertions that meeting numerical goals for service are the right standards. She said conditions are getting worse inside prisons as medical staff are strained and overworked.
“I have spoken to more than 20 nurses and former staff members in the past few weeks and they have all shared major concerns with the quality and safety of medical care,” White said. “Eleven nurses stated that they were asked to cover unsafe caseloads, including one nurse who reported that they were assigned to cover an entire wing alone.”
Those conditions are also reflected in what current and former nurses at Jefferson City Correctional Center told the Marshall Project-St. Louis. Employees alleged that Centurion forced them to work long hours and extra shifts, creating a dangerous environment for them and their patients.
State Rep. Kimberly-Ann Collins of St. Louis, the ranking Democrat on the Corrections Committee, said she believes Centurion’s contract should be terminated.
Collins began raising public concerns about conditions in Missouri prisons — and an increasing number of deaths — since she was a freshman lawmaker in 2021. 
“I would like to see shorter wait lines for sick call,” Collins said to Foley. “I would like to see (calls for help) answered. I would like to not see the thousands of letters that I get that are about medical issues.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Foley-Mosley-01142026-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM) decried the wall in a remote area as a waste of money. (Courtesy U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez’s office)U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a Democrat representing the state’s 2nd Congressional District in the southern part of New Mexico, on Wednesday called upon the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to cancel border wall construction along a remote stretch of the state’s shared border with Mexico.
In a statement, Vasquez called the undertaking, which carries a $1.6 billion price tag, the “absolute definition of waste.”
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed last year contained $150 billion for DHS border and immigration enforcement efforts, which include constructing 49 miles of border wall along the far southwest corner of the state, along with 60 miles of a secondary barrier, according to a news release Wednesday from Vasquez’s office.
According to Vasquez’s office, a company called Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. received a $1.6 billion contract for the construction project along the area known as the state’s Bootheel. Federal contract records show an Arizona-based company by that name received a multi-year contract in late December for “vertical border and waterborne barrier construction” worth up to $1.8 billion. The initial contract period runs through 2028, according to the federal contract website. 
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

Vasquez called on DHS to cease construction and invest instead in border-monitoring technology like autonomous towers. 
“American taxpayers will get zero return on their investment if DHS pursues this plan to build a $1.6 billion dollar border wall in one of the most rugged, remote stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border,” he said.
Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
DHS in October announced its plans in the Federal Register to construct additional border wall sections in New Mexico, namely between landmarks known as “Border Monument 1” and “Border Monument 49.” 
According to data from the International Boundary and Water Commission, the area covers a stretch from approximately Santa Teresa in the state’s Southeast corner to the top edge of the Bootheel just east of the Big Hatchet Mountains.
Advocates: Mount Cristo Rey wall will worsen migrant deaths, erosion, habitat loss

Vasquez’s staff visited the area last week, according to the news release, and confirmed that “on-the-ground preparations” for the project were underway, including a new dirt road along the border. 
“It’s ironic that by building roads that lead right to the U.S. border in New Mexico’s Bootheel, the Administration is actually making it easier for folks to enter our country illegally,” Vasquez said.
A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in a statement included in the Federal Register notice, did not specify how many border crossers are suspected of entering through the Bootheel. 
But she said the El Paso Sector, which covers El Paso and New Mexico’s border with New Mexico, is “an area of high illegal entry where illegal aliens regularly attempt to enter the United States and smuggle illicit drugs.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img-f8a0df7a-d45d-4ca5-ad9f-fb44d3d2f14b-1-e1768438014298-1024x935.jpg,,,2026-01-15 11:57:22.309716

Billy Long speaks during a press conference on Feb. 22, 2022, in Jefferson City, Missouri (Madeline Carter/Missouri Independent).Billy Long’s prospects of becoming ambassador to Iceland hit a stumbling block this week, as the former Missouri congressman had to apologize Thursday after facing backlash for his comments suggesting the country should become a U.S. state, with him serving as governor.  
Long, in an interview with Arctic Today, a non-profit Alaska-based digital news publication that covers the Arctic region, apologized for joking with former colleagues in the U.S. House that Iceland will become the 52nd state, after America takes over Greenland. 
The comments set off a firestorm of criticism in the Arctic nation, where Long was nominated to serve as ambassador after stepping down from his leadership role at the Internal Revenue Service last year. 
The Icelandic Foreign Ministry confirmed to Politico that it contacted the U.S. embassy in Reykjavík seeking clarification about the comments. And a member of Iceland’s ruling party said Long’s statement must be taken seriously and represented a fundamental disrespect for the sovereignty of small nations.
“There is no doubt that this is very serious for a small country like Iceland. We need to understand that all the security arguments made by the U.S. regarding Greenland also apply to Iceland,” Viðreisn Sigmar Guðmundsson, a member of Iceland’s parliament, told a local newspaper. 
Icelanders launched a petition urging Foreign Minister Katrín Gunnarsdóttir to reject Long as ambassador. It currently has 2,000 signatures.
Long told the editor of Arctic Today that he was not serious when he made that statement. It was a joke, he said, about Jeff Landry, President Donald Trump’s U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland, becoming governor of Greenland.
“I was with some people, who I hadn’t met for three years, and they were kidding about Jeff Landry being governor of Greenland,” Long told Arctic Today, “and they started joking about me. And if anyone took offense to it, then I apologize.”
Long acknowledged that the reaction was justified, given the tensions internationally regarding Greenland. 
Long, a former auctioneer and talk radio host who represented Missouri in the U.S. House from 2011 to 2023, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to lead the IRS in June.  Two months later he was pushed out with little explanation and nominated instead to be ambassador for Iceland.

“When we fight our neighbors, China wins. We must not turn our backs on each other, not now, not ever,” she said, emphasizing the importance of renewing the USMCA, or United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade agreement first established in Trump’s first term.
“The American auto industry of 2025, let alone 2050, cannot exist on an island. To compete against our adversaries, we have to collaborate with our friends,” Whitmer said. “A fully assembled vehicle requires nearly thirty thousand parts. Producing all of them in the United States is impractical and, in many cases, impossible.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Whitmer said there are “zero vehicles” on the road made with 100% U.S. parts, stressing the priority of keeping assembly auto operations in Michigan “as much as possible to protect good-paying union jobs.”
Whitmer emphasized positive momentum in the automotive industry in Michigan — including increased production by General Motors at their Orion Assembly plant and the development of Ford’s BlueOval plant in Marshall. 
She also announced that earlier Thursday morning, she had signed an executive directive to develop geologic hydrogen as a new source of clean energy in Michigan. 
“We’re already seeing a lot of interest in Michigan because we have more potential reserves under our feet than every other state,” she said. “If our hydrogen reserves are proven, safe, and viable, they could lead to a massive economic boom, creating jobs, lowering costs, and reducing our reliance on foreign fuel.”

She also encouraged more investment in workforce development programs — including passage of two bills introduced by state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) to expand Michigan Reconnect. Currently, the program allows any Michigander over 25 years old to earn an associate’s degree or skills certificate, tuition-free. Anthony’s bills would lower the age threshold to 21. 
“All eyes are on Michigan’s economy today, and expanding the reach of the Reconnect program is a guaranteed way to keep our state competitive on the global stage,” Anthony said in a press release after Whitmer’s speech. “I’m proud to have a partner committed to building up and realigning our workforce because there’s nothing more impressive about our state than the people who call it home.”

Wilmington, Delaware
Died Jan. 6, 2026
Burlington, Vermont
Details of services
At Stephanie’s request there will be no formal services at this time, she asked for a springtime memorial service. 

With peace in her heart and her loved ones by her side, Stephanie Jill Mapes, age 65, peacefully put her angel wings on and sailed into her new life on Jan. 6, 2026. She leaves her husband Scott Michael Mapes, son Scott Lennon Mapes and his fiancé Cosette Giroux, soon-to-be in-laws Jason and Siersha Giroux, sister Diane Miller, her beloved guardian cat Skunk, Lennon’s godparents David and Diane Bahrenburg, many uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews, and a multitude of friends.
The daughter of Benjamin and Dolores Miller, she grew up in Wilmington, Delaware and learned to ski in middle school. Her ski club took trips to Stowe and that’s how she discovered that she belonged in Vermont.
While a student at University of Delaware, she was drawn to one class: “economics and the law.”  This led her to Vermont Law School where she met Scott.  Eventually, she became the first female president at Paul, Frank & Collins where she stayed for her entire 35-year career. 
She was very involved in her legal community, serving on the board of the Vermont Captive Insurance Association and the Champlain College Board of Trustees, as well as serving on the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce board and being involved with the Champlain College Cooperrider Center for Appreciative Inquiry. 
She introduced and educated her entire law firm on her appreciative inquiry approach — a positive, all-inclusive, non-hierarchical, collaborative style. At her retirement party, she declared she had entered “The Year of the Sloth,” which in her words was so wonderful — “Just hanging back in the trees. Out of the fray.  Still in tune but watching from a distance. Moving ever so slowly and deliberately. Hiking. Swimming. Yoga. Biking. Sitting on the beach. Sitting on the porch, or in the late afternoon breeze of nothing more than our own, beautiful backyard.”
On Oct. 1, 2024 Steph was diagnosed with HPV-inspired throat cancer. From that day forward, she said, “I am not going to let this illness define me. It is not going to become me, and I am not going to become it. It arrived as part of my path. To teach me and move me forward. But it needs to move on once it has served its purpose.” 
Stephanie led a rich life and she leaves a profound impact on the world, captured in her words, “So many of us are asking today, how can we be happy and what can we do when so much is wrong in the world. It is so overwhelming. Well, what you say to yourself; what you see and envision becomes reality. If you keep searching for wrong, you will find it. But remember, the opposite is also true. If you seek what is right, in your body, your organizations and the world, you will find that too. It’s out there. Don’t deny yourself from seeing or finding it out of anger, bitterness or cynicism.  Peace is every step. Each of us must become the flickering light that is needed to find our better future.”
There are many people to thank especially over the last few years and over all the years, but we give a special thank you to our amazing community of witches, wizards and goddesses:  Che’ Schreiner, Nicole Smith, Piper Abbott, Emily Davidson, Montana Burns, Michelle Sabourin, Rick Kolodinsky, Diane Bahrenburg, Jill Badolato, Michael Lemnah and the tremendous team at Vermont Wellness Medicine and Integrative Oncology (Dr. Fresh), and the wonderful care team at UVM Oncology (Dr. Kahn) and UVM Hospice and Dr. Haddad at Dana-Farber.
At Stephanie’s request there will be no formal services at this time, she asked for a springtime memorial service. In the meantime to honor Stephanie, please remember to laugh today, be kind, and be peace. If you wish to make a contribution in Stephanie’s honor, please consider donating to:  the International Campaign for Tibet, The Flynn Theater, the Green Mountain Club and Vermont Public. When doing so please note “Memorial donation for Stephanie J. Mapes.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-15 14:41:10+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Prospects shaky for real estate transfer fee,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/housing/prospects-shaky-for-real-estate-transfer-fee/,"Supporters of real estate transfer fees, a long-bubbling idea on Beacon Hill that would impose a surcharge on property sales to generate affordable housing funding, are vowing to make another push for transfer fees in the coming final year of the two-year legislative session.","AN ARRAY OF cities and towns are asking lawmakers, again, to let them impose a fee on expensive property transactions to fund affordable housing. But even as the state’s housing crisis grinds on, the polarizing pitch seems to be facing an increasingly uphill climb. 
Real estate transfer fees, a long-bubbling idea on Beacon Hill, would impose a surcharge on property sales to generate local revenue that can be directed toward building affordable housing. A proposal filed by Gov. Maura Healey during the last legislative cycle would have allowed cities and towns to impose a 0.5 to 2 percent fee on property sale proceeds over $1 million, or the county’s median home sales price, whichever is greater.  
Healey’s provision failed to advance in the final housing bond bill, and the governor has not signaled eagerness to revisit the policy this session. Supporters nonetheless are vowing to make another push for transfer fees in the coming final year of the two-year legislative session.  
Roughly a dozen different versions of transfer fee legislation have been filed. Sen. Julian Cyr, the Senate co-chair of the Legislature’s housing committee, supports the idea.  
Transfer fees are not “a silver bullet” solution to the housing crisis, he said, but could be a valuable part of the answer if coupled with zoning and permitting changes. Without new streams of revenue to support affordable housing, Cyr said, “there’s no way Massachusetts can subsidize its way out of this crisis.”  
Cyr, a Democrat who represents Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket, has been tasked by Senate President Karen Spilka with “going bold” on housing solutions that can make a dent in the 222,000 new housing units the state projects will be needed in the next decade. On transfer fees, he noted, “my feelings on this are no secret,” and placing him in the top housing spot signals Senate leadership may be warmer to the idea than it was last cycle. 
It seemed political momentum was building last session, but support from the governor, the mayor of the state’s largest city, and initial enthusiasm from the state Senate weren’t enough to get a transfer fee on the books. Facing antipathy from the House and pushback from business leaders, the Senate passed its version of a housing bond bill in 2023 without including a transfer fee provision.  
That decision meant a transfer fee couldn’t be used as a chit during negotiations between chambers, and it effectively killed any prospects for the proposal during the 2023-24 term.   
The transfer fee proposals take two forms: home rule petitions from individual communities seeking permission to impose a surcharge and local option bills providing a blanket authorization for cities and towns to approve transfer fees at the local level.  
Cyr said his district is facing “the worst housing crisis in the state,” and more than half of the 13 home rule petitions to impose a transfer fee have been sent to Beacon Hill by communities on Cape Cod and Nantucket.   
Lawmakers are considering home rule petitions for local real estate transfer fees from Arlington, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Concord, Chatham, Eastham, Falmouth, Nantucket, Provincetown, Somerville, Truro, and Wellfleet.   
One of the local option bills, filed by Cyr, takes special note of seasonal communities — where a large proportion of the housing is stock tied up in part-time use, like the Cape and Islands – and their affordability challenges.  The bill would allow seasonal communities in the state to assess a 1 to 2 percent fee on real estate transactions over $1 million, directing the money toward housing.  
Lawmakers representing seasonal communities have floated the idea of a targeted transfer fee policy for those areas, which Cyr says are “speaking with one voice” about their desire for more housing options including the transfer fee. Cape officials, Nantucket real estate agents, and Cape Cod business organizations alike are backing the fees, he said, while other areas of Massachusetts like Boston see the mayor and real estate groups at odds.  
A local option bill largely mirroring the governor’s prior pitch, filed in the Senate by Sen. Joanne Comerford of Northampton and in the House by Reps. Mike Connolly of Cambridge and Carmine Gentile of Sudbury, has support from statewide housing organizations like the Citizens’ Housing & Planning Association (CHAPA) and left-wing organizations like Progressive Mass. Over the past few sessions, a coalition of organizations from cities and towns across the state has also backed some version of a transfer fee.   
There is no sign, however, of a change of heart from House Speaker Ron Mariano, who was chilly toward the idea last term.   
One key Senate leader has also staked out opposition to transfer fees in the past. Sen. Will Brownsberger of Belmont, the third ranking member of the chamber, wrote after the Senate opted against including the fee in the 2023 bond bill that he’s concerned that a transfer fee could stifle efforts to have more housing built. 
“In the long run, the only positive solution to excessive housing costs is the production of more housing,” Brownsberger wrote. “I am uncomfortable with any measure that could tend to drag down housing production in our state. The option for municipalities to impose a transfer tax falls in that category.”  
Healey, who is heading into a reelection campaign where affordability is likely to be front and center, also has pulled back from her earlier enthusiastic push for a transfer fee.  
The fee was nowhere to be found in a sprawling 2025 report on “unlocking housing” in Massachusetts from a Healey task force that included housing policy experts, civic leaders, local officials, and labor representatives.  
The administration on Thursday referred to a brief comment in its statewide housing plan – A Home for Everyone – which notes Healey’s failed effort last session to have a transfer fee approved. “While this proposal was not adopted by the legislature,” the administration “intends to continue working with localities, housing trusts, and the real estate community to create new revenue options for municipalities and regions.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ptown.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, listened to the governor's proposed budget for fiscal year 2027 during a joint committee meeting of the House Appropriations and Senate Ways and Means committees. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Legislators got their first look at Gov. Laura Kelly’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2027 on Wednesday, finding a plan that prioritizes funding for schools and special education, expanded mental health services and creating a 10-year water plan.
Budget director and administration secretary Adam Proffitt presented the spending blueprint virtually at the joint meeting of the Senate and House budget committees.
The governor’s budget was set after Kelly completed a statewide tour to hear from Kansans, Proffitt said.
“Last fall, I spoke directly with Kansans, who were clear about the priorities they wanted reflected in my budget: fully funded public schools, investments in health care, and action to address our water challenges,” Kelly said in a news release. “My budget delivers on Kansans’ wishes while remaining balanced and ensuring that we protect Kansas’ fiscal foundation.”
The governor’s budget used a projected 1.7% revenue growth for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1, as a basis, Proffitt said. The recommended budget total of $10.8 billion comes in 1.6% higher than last fiscal year’s approved budget, he said.
Proffitt said $35 million of the increase comes from one-time expenditures, and if those expenditures are removed, the budget increase would be 1.3%, the amount total tax collections are expected to grow during the upcoming fiscal year. 
Diving into budget details, Proffitt said a few spending increases are tied to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which shifted some costs to the states. For instance, the state will pay a higher portion of administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which the governor accounted for by including $21 million in the budget, he said.
Legislators at the hearing questioned whether the budget included paying a penalty for the state’s high SNAP error rate, which could be between $20-40 million, depending on the rate, but Proffitt said the penalty won’t be assessed until fiscal year 2028. 
That gives the state time to get the error rate below 6%, which would carry no penalty, he said.
The error rate measures mistakes that have been made in allocating dollars for recipients, and can include data entry mistakes and incorrect calculations. The federal goal is a rate below 6%.  Kansas had a 9% rate for 2025.
The federal law also had more stringent work requirements for SNAP recipients, which increased administrative costs at the state level an estimated $4 million, Proffitt said.
 
 Education

Kelly recommended full funding for K-12 general education for two full years, Proffitt said, which provides predictability to school districts.
The school funding formula sunsets at the end of fiscal year 2027, and Proffitt said the governor’s budget extends the current school finance formula into 2028.
The governor recommended spending $2.5 million to eliminate the co-pay for 34,000 students who receive reduced lunches.
“The governor is recommending an incremental $50.6 million of (State General Fund) to fund special education for fiscal year 2027,” Proffitt said, adding that is 70% of excess costs, which is still well below the 92% required in statute.
The state has not funded special education to the 92% level in 15 years, he said.
“Funding for special education is really a shared responsibility between the federal government and the state government,” Proffitt said. “The governor is calling on the feds again to meet their obligation and increase their level of funding here in Kansas for special education. We simply cannot get to 92% without more federal support.”
 
Water funding
“Water remains among the top priorities in the state, not just for the administration but obviously for many in the Legislature,” Proffitt said. “It’s one of the most critical resources we have in the state, and we know we have a tall order ahead of us to make sure it’s available for the next several generations.”
The governor’s budget recommends full funding at $8 million for the state water plan fund, and Kelly wants to work with the Legislature to develop a long-term water roadmap, Proffitt said. 
 
Human services
Kelly asked for $12.6 million to fully fund a new Community Support waiver, which is expected to eliminate some of the stress from the current intellectual and developmental disability waiver, Proffitt said.
In addition, Kelly’s budget outlines an additional $10 million to address increased demand on the technology assistance waiver, which helps individuals younger than 21 who need life-sustaining medical equipment and technology.
Kelly’s budget includes $15 million to support increased Children’s Health Insurance Program caseloads. Her budget includes dollars for contract nursing at Larned State Hospital and Osawatomie State Hospital, about $37 million for both.
The state hospital system has been scrutinized closely over the past couple of years, Proffitt said, and the governor recommends a budget allocation of $38.9 million to strengthen the system.
“We recognize that there is both a capacity issue across the state hospital system but also staffing issues,” Proffitt said.
He said the budget includes: 

Nearly $31 million that would fund the new South Central Regional Mental Health Hospital, which would get the facility open in fiscal year 2027 and add 103 beds to the state’s capacity.
$3 million in capital improvements at the Kansas Neurological Institute in Topeka to create 15-30 behavioral health beds for children.
$5 million for one-time funding to support six local hospitals with behavioral health beds.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The developers of the proposed Donlin Gold mine in Southwest Alaska are planning to decide next year whether the project’s finances pencil out.
That timeline could depend in part on state utility regulators: At the moment, Alaska doesn’t have rules for the kind of gas pipeline needed to power the mine. 
Developers are proposing a contract-carrier gas line, a change from the usual practice in Alaska. Here, pipelines — including the trans-Alaska oil pipeline — have tended to be common carriers, with shippers able to buy capacity as needed.
A contract carrier sells long-term deals for reserved capacity in a pipeline, regardless of whether or not that space is used.
Though lawmakers have approved rules to govern contract carrier gas pipelines, which would reserve space for long-term use, the state’s regulators haven’t adopted those regulations yet.
“This is the ask,” said Donlin Gold permitting manager Enric Fernandez in a Tuesday meeting of the Regulatory Commission of Alaska. 
“We’re asking the RCA to please proceed with adopting these regulations,” he said.
Donlin’s plans include a natural gas pipeline stretching 316 miles from Anchorage’s Beluga power plant on Cook Inlet to the mine site near the Kuskokwim River. 
Based on a 2002 feasibility study that was updated in 2020, “we’re looking about $1.8 (billion) or $2 billion” for the cost of the pipeline, Fernandez said, but that figure is being updated as part of a “bankable feasibility study” that would compile financial information for potential investors.
That study is expected to be done in 2027.
If the study pans out, construction could begin later that year and finish by 2031.
But in order for that cost study to be complete, Donlin Gold first needs to know what the state’s rules are for contract-carrier gas pipelines.
In 2013, the Alaska Legislature and then-Gov. Sean Parnell approved a law allowing contract-carrier gas pipelines. 
That law was to be implemented by the RCA, but new regulations were never adopted. 
Fernandez said that, as currently planned, the pipeline will be larger than what’s needed for the mine alone, and that gas could be sold to local communities as well.
“It could transfer natural gas for others’ needs,” Fernandez said.
Donlin’s developers signed a letter of intent last week with Glenfarne, the lead developer of the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, but Fernandez said that Donlin is open to sourcing gas from other sources, including imports.
“There’s a number of options that are being proposed for Southcentral Alaska right now to bring natural gas … and we just see ourselves as part of the solution,” Fernandez said. “If there is a need to import natural gas, we can be part of that order, hopefully resulting in a larger order. That means maybe better economics there.”

David Gregory, R-Chesterfield, is introduced to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session  (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers debated two bills this week that would align the state with the federal limits on intoxicating hemp products set to go into effect in November.
Both Missouri bills would prohibit hemp products from containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container, which is among the limits included in a provision in the federal spending bill Congress approved last year.
They both would regulate intoxicating hemp the same as marijuana, which would essentially ban current hemp products because marijuana must be grown in Missouri and most hemp is grown outside of the state. They would also require hemp products to be sold in licensed cannabis dispensaries, where most are currently sold in gas stations, liquor stores, restaurants and smoke shops. 
State officials estimated in 2024 that 40,000 food establishments and smoke shops and 1,800 food manufacturers were selling products that would be banned under the proposed federal regulations. It includes low-dose THC seltzers, such as Mighty Kind and Triple, that have increased in popularity at liquor stores and bars. 
While business owners selling these products oppose the federal ban, some said they’re putting their support behind a proposal by Republican state Rep. Dave Hinman of O’Fallon because it would allow Missouri to sell the products if Congress changes its mind in the future. 
A House committee discussed Hinman’s legislation Tuesday, making it one of the first bills to get a public hearing during the new legislative session that began last week.
“The bottom line for us is, if it’s authorized and it’s lawful under federal law, we should be able to sell it here in Missouri, just like all the other 49 states will be able to sell it,” said Ron Leon, executive director of the Missouri Petroleum and Convenience Association, which represents gas stations and convenience stores, during the hearing Tuesday evening. 
The other bill, proposed by Republican state Sen. David Gregory of Chesterfield, does not include this provision. Another difference in Gregory’s bill is that it includes an emergency clause, meaning it would be enacted as soon as lawmakers approve it and the governor signs it.
New federal regulations complicate Missouri debate over intoxicating hemp

“Now it’s time for us to ensure the safety of our kids, regardless of what Congress did or will be doing in the future,” Gregory said during the Senate committee hearing Wednesday morning. “And we need to prohibit intoxicating cannabis from being sold anywhere except for the way our voters designed it and requested it be sold. And that’s exactly what this bill seeks to do.”
The Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, which represents marijuana businesses, has put its support behind both bills. The Missouri Hemp Trade Association, which represents a number of hemp businesses, spoke in opposition to Gregory’s bill but was neutral on Hinman’s bill. 
This will be the fourth year in a row that Missouri lawmakers have attempted to regulate intoxicating hemp products, with previous debates ending in stalemates. 
However, Hinman said this is a priority for the state’s leadership. 
“I met with [Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway] last week, and she thinks this needs to be a priority,” Hinman told The Independent. “I believe the governor is the same and the speaker (of the House) is the same, so I think it’s going to move pretty quick.”
The Law Enforcement Legislative Coalition, which represents police chiefs across Missouri, is supporting both bills. Lake Saint Louis Police Department Chief Chris DiGiuseppi emphasized at both the Senate and House committee hearings this week that the federal provision does not give local police authority to enforce the ban, which is why the state bills are necessary.
“In order to enforce federal law, we’d have to go to a federal law enforcement agency,” DiGiuseppi told the state Senate committee members Wednesday. “We would have to get others involved. We can only enforce state statute. That’s what we’re empowered to do.”
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, asked DiGiuseppi how difficult it would be to enforce the federal ban if Missouri lawmakers fail to pass regulations again this year.  
“It would be much more difficult,” DiGiuseppi said. “It’s always easier to try to take care of that in house…so we appreciate all the help we can get.”
Kathi Harness, a lobbyist for the Missouri Beer Wholesalers Association, opposed both bills during hearings this week. She argued that state lawmakers should consider conversations that are happening at the national level. 
Earlier this week, a U.S. House bill was filed to delay the implementation of the federal ban until 2028.
The association is supporting separate legislation to allow the sale of intoxicating hemp beverages to continue, contingent on what happens at the federal level.
“I believe, as do many people,… that what they will do is they will give it back to the states to regulate,” Harness said. “The federal government doesn’t regulate alcohol at the federal level. Alcohol is regulated at the state level, and I think there’s a very good chance that that’s how it will go if, in fact, the federal government decides to allow this product.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_davidgregory1-1024x723.jpg,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A survey of the 2026 campaign for Kansas governor shows a majority of Democratic voters unable to choose between frontrunners Sen. Cindy Holscher and Sen. Ethan Corson if the election was held in January rather than in August.
In the survey’s hypothetical head-to-head showdown measured by Public Policy Polling, 58% of 699 participants couldn’t decide who they would vote for at this point. More than seven months of statewide campaigning remain until the Aug. 4 primary to select a Democratic Party nominee to take on winner of the Republican Party primary race.
The poll, which was sponsored by the Holscher campaign, revealed that among individuals who felt they had sufficient information to declare a preference, 33% were comfortable with Holscher and 9% were drawn to Corson. Both Democratic candidates represent a Johnson County district in the state Senate.
Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, said it was telling that 68% were unable to form a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Holscher and 79% couldn’t decide the same questions for Corson. Neither candidate has spent significantly on campaign advertising.
“Obviously, this far out of this race with two candidates who are not known statewide the poll is showing ‘don’t know them’ as the leader,” Beatty said. “Holscher is slightly more well known — although still close to 70% don’t know her — and leading among that small group of Dems who know them.”
Beatty said the survey could reflect that Holscher participated in two more legislative election cycles than Corson. In addition, he said, Holscher had more time to raise general public awareness for her campaign for governor. She announced her candidacy in June, while Corson entered the contest nearly six weeks later in July.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who is completing the final year of her second term, endorsed Corson’s campaign in November.

Holscher campaign manager Madi Ashcraft said this snapshot was indicative of what backers believed about Holscher.
“Cindy has the support of grassroots Democrats and her message resonates with voters,” Ashcraft said. “While other candidates are catering to out-of-state donors and the establishment, Cindy has everyday Kansans on her side because they know what she stands for.”
In terms of campaign donations during 2025, Corson’s finance report said he generated $902,600 compared with Holscher’s $397,900. Corson spent $375,600 from the account during the year, which was significantly more than the $218,000 expended by Holscher. On Dec. 31, Corson reported nearly three times more cash on hand as Holscher.
“Ethan Corson is the only candidate in this race building a broad coalition of support to win both the primary and the general election,” said Kyla Sabado, Corson’s campaign manager. “In 2025, thousands of Kansans chipped in to help us build real statewide momentum. We are proud to be the only campaign in this race endorsed by labor, along with the enthusiastic support of Gov. Laura Kelly.”
For the survey conducted Jan. 8 and 9, the respondents were 62% women, 88% white, 72% were 46 years of age or older, and 48% completed at least a two-year community college degree. The text and landline survey concentrated on Johnson, Sedgwick and Shawnee county media markets.
Given the survey exclusively explored views of Democrats, it came as little surprise 96% of participants disapproved of GOP President Donald Trump.
Holscher received a favorable response from 28% of those surveyed, while 4% had an unfavorable view of her. Seventeen percent of participants had a favorable perception of Corson, but 5% said they had an unfavorable view of him.
Those taking part in the Kansas poll were presented background summaries of both Corson and Holscher. Forty-four percent said they found the description of Holscher “very convincing” in terms of drawing interest in her message. Twenty-nine percent of people said information offered to them about Corson provided  a “very convincing” argument for his candidacy.
For purposes of this poll, respondents were told Holscher was a member of the Senate who “fights for hard-working people and our public schools.” They were informed Holscher was raised on a farm and among the first people in her family to graduate from college.
She helped found the Bipartisan Women’s Caucus in the Legislature and “led the effort” to repeal Gov. Sam Brownback’s aggressive state income tax cuts. Participants in the poll were told Holscher took part in bringing Republicans and Democrats together to restore public school funding as well as grant tax reductions to “regular people instead of corporations and create more jobs in Kansas.”
For the survey, Corson was characterized as a senator and lifelong Kansan who attended Garden City Community College on a baseball scholarship, earned a law degree and worked at the U.S. Department of Commerce under President Barack Obama.
They were told Corson had “a common-sense approach, working with Republicans and Democrats to make our schools stronger, lowering taxes for the working- and middle-class, and recruiting new businesses to Kansas.” The summary  said Corson was endorsed by the governor because he was a “middle-of-the-road candidate who will be laser-focused on kitchen-table issues.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA130806-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

“@grok put her in a bikini”
Writing nothing but a short prompt, users on the social media platform X can quickly generate nonconsensual and sexually explicit images of women and children — a disturbing trend that has prompted California to launch a probe into X’s artificial intelligence tool.
As CalMatters’ Khari Johnson explains, California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Wednesday said the state plans to investigate the AI chatbot Grok after reports that a recent update enables users to create and spread sexualized photos of women and children. Tech billionaire Elon Musk’s company xAI developed Grok. 

Bonta, in a statement: “The avalanche of reports … in recent weeks is shocking. This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet.”

In a Jan. 3 post on X, Musk said that anyone using the AI tool to make illegal content “will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” Though, in an earlier response to Reuters addressing reports of sexualized images of kids spreading on X, he said that “Legacy Media Lies.”
Since 2019, California has passed about a half a dozen laws protecting people from deepfake pornography. Most recently, it enacted a law that punishes people providing “a service that enables the ongoing operation of deepfake pornography” with a fine of up to $250,000.

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a San Ramon Democrat and bill author, in a statement to CalMatters: “Real women are having their images manipulated without consent, and the psychological and reputational harm is devastating. Underage children are having their images used to create child sexual abuse material, and these websites are knowingly facilitating it.”

With the help of Grok — which will also be soon integrated in the Pentagon’s systems — X now produces more non-consensual naked or sexual imagery than any other website online, according to Bloomberg. And while the images may be fake, the damage they inflict is real: In 2024, the FBI warned that the use of deepfake tools to extort young people has led to self harm and suicide.

Judges reject GOP lawsuit with blistering critique

From CalMatters politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
A panel of three federal court judges shot down the latest “Hail Mary” attempt by California Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration to halt the use of the new congressional maps voters approved under Proposition 50, saying their “molehill of statements” claiming the maps were racially biased did not make that claim true.
The 2-1 ruling, with one Trump-appointed judge dissenting, comes after the judges heard three days of testimony and reviewed more than 500 exhibits totaling thousands of pages along with audio and video recordings.
“Our conclusion probably seems obvious to anyone who followed the news in the summer and fall of 2025,” wrote Judge Josephine Staton, an Obama appointee, in her scathing rebuke of the GOP’s challenge. 
She noted that opponents of Prop. 50 relied on a completely different argument against the measure in court than they used on the campaign trail.

Staton, in the ruling: “So, Challengers have abandoned the argument they made to the voters. Proposition 50, apparently, is no longer a partisan power grab. Now, it is a ‘racial gerrymander.’”

The GOP said they will seek an injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court. 



Parole rates for prisoners drop

Fewer California prisoners are being found suitable for parole, despite the state expanding opportunities and incentives for incarcerated people to seek parole over the last 10 years, reports CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.
Before plateauing in 2023, the annual number of parole hearings increased over the years, from 5,226 in 2018 to 9,017 in 2022. But the success rate for prisoners to be found suitable for parole has declined, from 39% in 2018 to below 25% in 2025.
Parole experts said various factors could be at play. As California’s prison population ages, the mental and physical limitations of these older incarcerated people could negatively impact their ability to present themselves before a parole board.
More than ever before, parole commissioners also have an abundant amount of personal information on individual prisoners: Visitor logs, personal expenses, medical records and monitored phone calls and text messages can all be deemed relevant when considering parole. The extra scrutiny could reveal potential misconduct, and result in commissioners granting fewer paroles.

But a cemetery preserves Mike's grave and the memories of their childhood together.,"Guest Commentary written by

Joshua Hernandez
Joshua Hernandez is an English teacher and academic decathlon coach at St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower.


On a recent trip to the Inglewood Park Cemetery to visit my best friend Mike, I noticed that his tombstone was dirty.I hadn’t come in a while, and apparently no one else had either. As I cleaned up, I surveyed the area around me. At 17, Mike was the youngest interred there by far. Most people buried nearby had at least reached their 40s by the time they died. Many, I realized as I looked at the dates, had been dead now longer than they were alive, their stories tracing back to different points in Inglewood’s past.
Beyond the cemetery, I was confronted by the rapidly gentrifying present of this place that raised Mike and me. Just across the street, where the old Daniel Freeman Hospital once stood, developers erected fancy condos way too expensive for the average Inglewood resident to afford. The skyline is now filled with new landmarks: SoFi Stadium, opened in 2020; the Forum, renamed in 2022, and now painted red, not the blue of my childhood; the Intuit Dome, the most recent addition, opened in 2024. 
The Inglewood that Mike and I knew has been constructed over. But the cemetery preserves the neighborhood’s complete narrative. I made sure to wipe the rest of the dirt off Mike’s tombstone before leaving because I wanted to be sure that his life is remembered in its telling.
From foe to friend
The way I met Mike sounds like a shitty Netflix comedy. We both attended Beulah Payne Elementary School at 215 W. 94th Street. I was in first grade and he was in second. I can’t remember the specifics of the encounter, but I know that it ended in one of those petty schoolyard scraps.
Flash forward three years to when my parents decided to send me to private school to keep me out of trouble. St. John Chrysostom was less than two miles from Beulah Payne but it felt like another universe, one where I was convinced I wouldn’t fit in. Except on my first day I recognized a familiar face. There was Mike, with his tan brown skin and small widow’s peak.

It turned out Mike had been sent to St. John in hopes it would keep him out of trouble too. This time around, instead of fighting, we bonded over being two Mexican kids from the inner city, different from our private school classmates, mostly Black and Filipino, who we didn’t think knew a day of “the struggle.”
If I was more reserved and prone to internalizing, Mike wore his heart on his sleeve and was always willing to go toe-to-toe with anyone on the schoolyard. Yin and yang, we balanced each other out. Mike quickly became more like a brother than a friend. It feels funny to say that our inner children came out when we saw each other, as we were both so young back then. But neither of us had enjoyed many opportunities to just be a kid. I always said my childhood ended at 9, when my brother was diagnosed with leukemia. Mike had to grow up even faster. His mother, who had health problems, died when he was around 7. As long as I knew him, his dad was away in prison. Since Mike’s parents were out of the picture, we used to hang out at my place, play video games, and just be.
On different paths
Looking back, it’s easy to see why our lives diverged. Because my dad got caught up in gang life when he was young, he and my mom, both born and raised in Inglewood, were careful to encourage me and my siblings to go another route. Mike didn’t have those kinds of role models in his life.
The summer of seventh grade, Mike left St. John and joined a gang—and I made the painful decision to distance myself from him. Since my brother had gotten sick, I had stopped causing trouble. I wanted to show up for my family. I also knew that if I wanted to make something of myself, I had to stay out of that life. Mike understood my reasons and took them in stride. One thing about Mike: He always protected me.
The last time I saw Mike was at the St. John fall carnival in 2019. We didn’t talk about the fact that we didn’t see each other as much anymore; we already knew why it had to be that way. Underneath everything, we knew there was always only love.
More than a statistic
Mike died that spring, after being shot near Century Boulevard and South Freeman Avenue.
I teach high school kids now, and I’m acutely aware that what happened to Mike is an unfortunate reality for many young men like him, who grew up in similar circumstances in Inglewood or elsewhere. These kids matter, but they rarely get the attention kids from more well-off backgrounds get. If you do a search online, the only coverage of Mike’s death is one sentence in the Los Angeles Times’ Homicide Report.
Mike was more than a statistic, more than a victim of homicide in an inner city. He was my friend and my brother. When I go to visit him at the Inglewood Park Cemetery, I am reminded of the good times we had together. And I find comfort knowing that in this place, inhabited by the dead but filled with memories, with pain, with the essence of life in this city, Mike remains a permanent part of Inglewood’s story.

A year after Eaton Fire, some business owners aim to return or go on while also dealing with rebuilding their homes.


A year after the Eaton Fire, some small business owners in Altadena are striving to rebuild, in some cases while also grappling with being displaced from homes that burned down or were severely damaged. 
For others, such as Steve’s Pets Store owner Carrie Meyers, it’s just too much.
“People want me back,” Meyers said. “But I don’t know if we can survive up there. No one lives there … mentally I’m not there.”
Meyers said she had just received a delivery before the fire last January, so about 65 animals perished, including cats, rats, birds and a 40-year-old parrot. The store is now permanently closed, and its website shows a message from former employee Michael Mersola, who said he would miss it because “people would just (hang out) here, I swear it was Starbucks for animal lovers lol.”
Meanwhile, Carrie’s husband Ed is dealing with trying to rebuild their home, which burned down. He has dealt with a long insurance process with State Farm that has, four claims adjusters later, finally improved.
One adjuster “was the king of no” and “existed like a great cloud in our lives for four to five months,” Ed Meyers said. “Then one day, like winning the lottery, we got a new adjuster.” 
Other survivors of the fire that killed 19 people have complained about insurance companies assigning them multiple adjusters, slowing things down. Now, Ed said things are looking better than they were six months ago and they are on their way to rebuilding, though they were underinsured, something many fire survivors have in common.
The small business owners and others CalMatters spoke with for this story stressed the importance of thoughtful and timely help from insurance companies, community organizations and all levels of government for businesses and residents as key to the recovery of the unincorporated town of about 43,000 residents — even for the businesses that survived the fire. 
“Our struggling businesses can’t afford patience,” said Nic Arnzen, chief of the Altadena Town Council, who called the community’s path to recovery a chicken-and-egg situation. “Without the population returning to Altadena, they’re in a tough corner.”
Los Angeles County has received about 2,700 applications for permits to rebuild in Altadena, according to the county’s dashboard. Of those, the county has issued about 1,200 permits and 560 homes are being rebuilt right now. 
‘The heart of Altadena’
Jimmy Orlandini, owner of Altadena Hardware, thinks it might take five years to reopen his business at its original location after almost the whole building burned down.
“Five years is an eternity to not have a business running,” he said. As others rebuild, they will need a hardware store, so he is looking for a temporary place to run his business as he waits for the property owner to rebuild. He had 21 employees at the time of the fire; he thinks most of them have found other jobs, while some are relying on unemployment benefits. 
His family has been in the hardware business for decades, and he has two other locations elsewhere. But he has deep ties to the community, having lived in Altadena for 40 years, since he was 2.

“It’s really difficult,” he said. “Altadena was our best store in terms of revenue, and our relationship with the customer base.” (Another business owner CalMatters spoke with, the owner of a pizza restaurant, called the hardware store “the heart of Altadena.”)
Orlandini and his family returned to their house in October. It did not burn down even as “everything around us burned,” he said. But Mercury Insurance eventually deemed it a total loss because of smoke damage and lead contamination of all its contents. 
“We have no couch,” he said. “We’re sitting on camping chairs in the living room. The kids still haven’t gotten their toys back.” But he said they finally received a big portion of the payout for the contents of their house a couple of weeks ago, so “now we can start buying stuff.”
Uneven help 
A common refrain among Altadena’s small business owners: Some of the help available to homeowners is not extended to them.
Matt Schodorf co-owns Café de Leche with his wife, Anya. Their home, about 15 to 20 minutes away in Highland Park in Los Angeles, is fine except for some ash in the attic. He understands that Altadena homeowners whose homes were destroyed and want to rebuild need assistance — those are his customers. 
But their Altadena coffee shop, the only one whose building they owned out of their four locations and which he said was their busiest store, burned down. Now they’re dealing with the rebuilding process and in some ways are feeling left out. 
“FEMA in particular excluded us from debris removal originally,” Schodorf said. So Schodorf and his wife complained and were featured “on all the media” including CNN. FEMA included Café de Leche in federally funded clearing of debris after the media appearances, Schodorf said. He also credited L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger’s office for advocating for them. 
Schodorf also said, as did others, that the Los Angeles Department of Economic Opportunity has been a huge help in providing information about grants and other support. 
Still, “it feels frustrating because it feels we are very small potatoes, especially from the perspective of the government,” he said. “It doesn’t seem like it would be too much to ask: waive permit fees, clean our lots out. Don’t make us go on national news pleading for help.”

Daniel Harlow, whose office was destroyed, agreed that businesses need more help. His custom computer programming and software development business is up and running again, but it was in a separate structure at his home and was a total loss. 
“A lot of rules for homeowners insurance don’t apply to businesses,” he said. “To not have more assistance for small and medium businesses is a problem.” 
For example, the state law that allows homeowners to get some upfront payouts without having to provide a full inventory of the contents of their home does not apply to businesses.
Harlow is now dealing with both rebuilding his office and repairing his house, which suffered some damage. He’s living in a rental home. 
“I’m trying to find architects and contractors while running my business,” he said. “It’s basically (another) full-time job.” 
A shift, and more changes ahead
Zak Fishman’s Prime Pizza in Altadena is the only pizza restaurant of the four in Altadena that survived the fire. It was a bit of good news for his family. Their house burned down, and they’re now rebuilding. 
Fishman, who owns several other locations in the Los Angeles area and elsewhere, said his Altadena location was closed for about a month but is now doing pretty well, considering the circumstances. 
“We do see a shift,” he said. “You see different types of people coming. A lot of workers in the area had nowhere else to eat (lunch).”
Fishman opened the Altadena location in September 2023 and was seeing a lot of growth, he said. He said sales at the location probably would have been up 20% over the prior year if the fire hadn’t happened. Now he says they’re up about 8% to 10%. 
“I’m certainly not complaining, it’s amazing,” he said.
With about half of Altadena’s businesses destroyed in the fire, it’s going to be a long way back. 
Judy Matthews, president of the Altadena Chamber of Commerce, said her group is working with other chambers and the county to help promote shopping local, and to identify more opportunities for grants and help for small and medium-size businesses.
“There’s increasing collaboration between local government and business,” she said. “That’s critical. No one man can stand alone and say I did it.”

When more of the community is able to rebuild, it could end up looking drastically different. Whether homeowners return could depend on their insurance provider and whether they can fill the gap from being underinsured, some said. Whether small businesses rebuild could depend on what type of service or goods they offer, and their location.
“Most worrisome are retail and specialty shops, and those that depend on a steady flow of  customers,” Matthews said, noting that Altadena’s limited foot traffic and visibility because of its location has been and will continue to be a factor.
Arnzen, the town council chair, said there is “a lot of competition for funds and assistance. There’s potential for people to feel left out. That is exacerbated by feelings of trauma and in some cases, historical neglect, especially from marginalized communities.”
Nearly half of Black households in Altadena, or 48%, were destroyed or had major damage, according to the NAACP. 
“We need to ensure a balanced recovery that supports diverse types of businesses,” Matthews said.
Orlandini, owner of the hardware store, said he expects his business and customers to change.
“It’s definitely going to be a different town,” he said. “My store was catered to older homes, and a lot of those are gone now.”
He added: “That’s the thing that bothers me most about the fire — how much of the history is gone and will never come back.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011226_Altadena-Business_JH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608

Gavin Newsom included no new funding for local journalism in his budget proposal last week, walking back an August 2024 deal with Google to commit $175 million over five years to help the diminishing industry.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom included no new funding for local journalism in his budget proposal last week, walking back an August 2024 deal with Google to commit $175 million over five years to help the diminishing industry. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget proposal includes no money for a fund formed last year to boost the state’s local newsrooms, casting doubt on whether a heralded effort to help California journalists will amount to anything and how serious Newsom is about supporting the struggling industry.
It’s a significant walkback from an August 2024 deal between state leaders and Google in which they agreed to jointly spend $175 million over five years to fund local journalism.
The deal, which Newsom hailed as a “major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms” at the time, was reached after Google spent a record sum — $11 million — lobbying state lawmakers successfully to drop two proposals that would have forced Google to pay newsrooms for using their content. Under the agreement, the state would pay $70 million and Google $55 million into the newly established California Civic Media Fund for local news outlets. Google would also continue issuing its annual $10 million newsroom grants. 
But in May 2025, citing budget restraints, Newsom slashed the state’s first-year commitment to just $10 million for fiscal year 2025-26, with no future state funding guaranteed. Google subsequently said it would match the state’s $10 million investment but no more.
Google was clear in the deal that “its contributions were contingent” on state funding, similar to its journalism funding deal in Canada, said Erin Ivie, spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who brokered the deal in 2024.
A 2019 study by the trade group News Media Alliance estimated that Google made $4.7 billion from news sites in 2018. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, made over $100 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone — its “first ever $100 billion quarter,” said Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. By Wednesday, Alphabet’s market cap was over $4 trillion.
None of the $20 million pledged has reached local news outlets, drawing disappointment from journalism advocates. 

Newsom is ‘more interested in the billionaires and his friends than he’s interested in journalists who are out on the street.’California News Publishers Association President Chuck Champion

“At this point right now, nobody should be jumping up and down and getting excited,” California News Publishers Association President Chuck Champion said.
Newsom’s lack of proposed funding for future years angered Champion, who said the governor failed to keep his promise.
“He’s more interested in the billionaires and his friends than he’s interested in journalists who are out on the street,” Champion said. “He talks about democracy, he talks about how critically important it is, and then he allows our journalists to starve on the vine.”
The lack of future commitment from the state also raises the question whether Google will deposit anything into the fund next year. Google News Initiative did not immediately respond to a CalMatters inquiry for comment.
Newsom’s office did not respond to questions about his decision to skip the funding this year, directing CalMatters to the state Department of Finance and the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, which administers the funds. 
Lawmaker promises to fight for more funding
“There’s no going back on the deal,” Department of Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw stressed to reporters during a budget briefing last week, saying that the state has already contributed the $10 million promised last year. 
Wicks said budget restraints forced Newsom’s hand last year. 
“What you saw last year was the budget being what it was,” she said. “Programs across the board got cut and sliced, either got completely zeroed out or significantly reduced, and this is no different.”
But she said she will fight for more funding. 
“I’ve been operating on the assumption that (the state) will honor the multiyear commitment,” Wicks said.
But even the full amount of the Google deal may not be enough to “arrest the collapse of independent community news in California,” said former state Sen. Steve Glazer, an Orinda Democrat who authored a bill that would have offered tax credits to employers of journalists by charging a fee to platforms like Google.
“Leaders can’t just talk about protecting our democracy,” he said. “They need to act to direct the resources to support independent news reporting that provides the oversight and accountability of our democratic institutions.”
The journalism industry nationwide has been diminishing. Between 2005 and 2024, more than 3,200 newspapers shut their doors, according to a 2024 report by the Local News Initiative at Northwestern University. 
As of that year, California had 1.5 news outlets for every 100,000 residents, ranking 45th among all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Between 2013 and 2024, the number of newspaper journalists in California dropped by more than half. 
To make matters worse, Congress last year voted to strip public broadcast stations nationwide of federal funding, putting dozens of stations across California in peril. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a national nonprofit that has funded public media since 1967, announced its dissolution due to the funding cuts last week.
California’s public broadcasters stand to lose as much as $30 million a year due to the federal cuts, said Assemblymember Chris Ward, a San Diego Democrat, in a letter last month to legislative budget leaders requesting state funding for public media.
Ward, along with 11 other Democratic assemblymembers, is asking for $70 million next year for public broadcast stations. 
“California is one of only 16 states that do not provide funding for public media,” he said in the letter. “California’s 33 non-profit public media organizations provide coverage to over 90% of the state, and serve diverse communities in both (the) largest metropolitan areas and rural communities — services that not only include arts, culture, and community engagement, but emergency alerts and education.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 13:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Major NY wind project may die if Trump pause lasts past Friday, developer says",Samantha Maldonado | THE CITY,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/major-ny-wind-project-may-die-if-trump-pause-lasts-past-friday-developer-says/,Work on Empire Wind has been on hold since the Trump administration “paused” the leases on it and four other projects just days before Christmas.,"An offshore wind project that would bring renewable power to over half a million New York City homes could be dead in the water.
Work on Empire Wind, an in-progress project developed by the company Equinor, has been on hold since the Trump administration “paused” the leases for it — and four other projects, including Sunrise Wind in New York — just days before Christmas.
Because of that pause, no work in federal waters can happen right now. And Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables America, said the project would likely face cancellation if construction could not resume by Friday.
That’s because a special vessel used for lifting very heavy equipment can only be at the project site, about 15 miles off the coast of Long Island, until February. Then it won’t be available for another year. If that timeline is thrown off, “cascading delays” would jeopardize the project.
“It’s critical that those activities are able to continue for vessel availability that we have and specifically being able to install the offshore substation, which is a very critical piece of equipment,” Morris said. “Our time of being able to do that is very limited.”
Equinor took to court to request a preliminary injunction, but the federal judge who heard the case Wednesday did not make a ruling. The judge will issue an order on Thursday. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers remain in limbo, waiting to start jobs at sea.
One of those workers is electrician Sally McKleinfeld, who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. A member of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3, McKleinfeld underwent special training to be able to work on Empire Wind, but can’t get a deployment date because of the work stoppage.
“It’s extremely frustrating,” she said. “Our job is risky on a good day. There’s environmental risk and our particular trade is very dangerous. When you couple that with the danger of being at sea, it’s an exceptional little pool of people who are excited — not just excited but thrilled — to do this … I’m willing to walk away from my kids, go on a boat and make the future happen.”
Union electrician Sally McKleinfeld, who has a keychain of a wind turbine, was slated to work on the project off the shore of Long Island.
The job would require McKleinfeld, 48, to live on a ship for three weeks, away from her husband and two children. But without a date, the family can’t prepare for her absence.
John Blanchfield, a rigger and member of the Dock Builders Union Local 1565, was scheduled to go back out to sea on Monday to continue working on Empire Wind. He’d lived on a ship for several weeks at a time between last summer and the end of the year to assist with lifting the equipment and he loved the work, enough to center the rest of his career around offshore wind.
“The uncertainty for the future is there now. Am I gonna continue in the offshore program?” he said. “When you have this opportunity in front of you and it’s taken away for no reason, it’s quite disturbing.”
At home in New Jersey without pay, the 47-year-old has turned down other job offers, anticipating he’d go back to sea. 
“Now I’m sitting here like, should I have said yes?” Blanchfield said.
He was supposed to be mobilized to the heavy-lifting vessel that’s only available to Equinor until February — and he still hopes it happens. He enjoyed being out on the water, witnessing scenes that he said inspired “awe.”
Dock Builders union member John Blanchfield was slated to work on a wind energy project off the shore of Long Island.
“It’s hard to describe: the 300-foot monopiles get lifted into the air like it’s nothing,” Blanchfield said, referring to the massive tubes that serve as the turbine’s foundation. “The sheer scope of it becomes incredibly breathtaking.”
Flat Air
Empire Wind is not the only New York offshore wind project affected by the Trump administration’s stop-work order: Sunrise Wind, developed by Orsted, was also caught in the crosshairs. Three additional projects serving other East Coast states were paused, too. 
The Department of the Interior had cited unspecified national security risks in its order.
Both Orsted and Equinor — as well as New York Attorney General Letitia James — took to court earlier this month to challenge the lease suspensions. On Monday, Danish developer Orsted won a preliminary injunction for a project it’s working on to serve Connecticut and Rhode Island, allowing construction to continue — though the time frame for the Sunrise Wind court case remains unclear.
“New Yorkers deserve clean, reliable energy, good-paying jobs, and a government that follows the law,” James said in a statement. “These projects were carefully reviewed and already under construction when the federal government pulled the plug without explanation. This reckless decision puts workers, families, and our climate goals at risk.”
Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind are projected to generate enough power for about a million homes when they are in operation, targeted for 2027. The power from the wind projects is especially important for New York City, as the electricity grid could face reliability challenges in the coming years.
Sunrise Wind is almost halfway to completion. Each day the project is delayed costs $1 million, and the full cancellation of the project could result in losses of over $8 billion, according to a court filing.
Empire Wind is 60% complete, and Equinor has spent more than $4 billion on the project, the company disclosed in a court filing. 
Equinor is also developing the city-owned South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, a port in Sunset Park that would support Empire Wind’s operations and maintenance. The terminal, at 90% completion, is also where the power from the wind project out in the ocean connects to the New York City grid.
Equinor said that if the Empire Wind does not move forward, the terminal’s future is in the air — though the company has been looking for other users to lease the space for activities not related to wind.
McKleinfeld, the electrician, has been working on site at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. But as the project wraps up, she’s looking forward to working on the wind farm itself. 
She has a silver keychain etched with a wind turbine that she holds on to as a sign of hope that she can live out the adventure she’s trained for.
“Once the turbines are erected, I would love to be the one up in the nacelle, the head of the wind turbine behind the propellers,” McKleinfeld said. “To me, that is so cool. You’re on top of the world and you’re doing what you’re trained to do.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013809809106-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 10:57:59.434321

Miller and Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/billionaires-tax-health-funding/,Newsom has already vowed to tank a proposed ballot initiative that would impose a 5% wealth tax on the state’s billionaires to bolster Medi-Cal.

Newsom has already vowed to tank a proposed ballot initiative that would impose a 5% wealth tax on the state’s billionaires to bolster Medi-Cal. Progressive lawmakers and their allies in labor and health seem hopeful that Newsom could support a different long-shot funding idea.


California health care advocates, labor unions and progressive lawmakers are urging the governor and the Legislature to find new money to fund medical care and other social services for millions of low-income and disabled Californians. 
Their coalition, known as “Fight for Our Health,” demanded Wednesday on the Capitol steps that the Legislature and soon-to-be lame duck Gov. Gavin Newsom take action to backfill funding cuts that President Donald Trump and Republicans approved last year.
The dilemma over how to respond to billions of dollars in cuts to social services — particularly to the budget for Medi-Cal, the state’s nearly $200 billion Medicaid program — foreshadows a showdown that will dominate both the 2026 legislative session and the midterm elections. 
As one union pursues a controversial wealth tax ballot measure to offset the cuts, progressive Democrats in the Legislature are floating a separate corporate tax, though details remain scant. If that materializes into a bill, it’s also likely to divide the party, which is sensitive to accusations that Californians are over-taxed and has recently declared its leaders will focus on lowering costs for state residents. 
In his final year as governor, Newsom faces a tug-of-war between two politically radioactive options: increasing taxes, or letting benefits lapse for millions of low-income and disabled Californians. Though his administration has sought only to blame Trump for the federal cuts, health care advocates made it clear they will push Newsom to help prevent steep coverage losses.
“I want to take a moment to address the governor and the state Legislature,” said Judy Mark, president of Disability Voices United, from the Capitol steps. “We know that you are not responsible for these awful cuts, but now the responsibility does lie in your hands. You have the power to protect us.”
The governor angered health advocates when he didn’t include money to backfill coverage when he released his state budget proposal, which acknowledges that tens of thousands will lose coverage and counts fewer services among projected revenue savings. This year, the state began freezing new Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented immigrant adults over rising costs in the program, over the objections of progressives and health advocates. 
Newsom’s analysts expect about 522,000 Californians to lose Medi-Cal coverage in the 2026-2027 fiscal year, rising in the future to 1.8 million. His administration has said the state simply doesn’t have the money to pay for coverage for people who are booted off the program due to new federal laws. 
One union, the Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West, has proposed a ballot initiative that would impose a wealth tax on California billionaires to help cover the roughly $30 billion the state would lose annually from Trump’s tax-and-spending law. Proponents say the one-time 5% levy would generate about $100 billion for the state’s health care system. About 10% of the money raised would be reserved for public schools.
But Newsom is fighting the measure, which has yet to qualify for the ballot but has still sent Sacramento and Silicon Valley into a tizzy.

Billionaires critical to state budget
The proposal has set off a flurry of opposition. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have reportedly moved to shift some business entities out of California while others are threatening to leave. Democratic strategists close to Newsom are running a campaign committee to defeat the measure as the union collects the nearly 900,000 signatures needed to qualify it for the November ballot. 
Newsom, who has repeatedly opposed state wealth tax proposals, this week told Politico he’s been personally pushing the measure’s proponents to drop it over concerns it could drive the targeted demographic — and their incomes — out of California. He also has longstanding personal ties to many of the tech titans who would likely be subject to a proposed wealth tax, and has reason to keep them close: they are potential donors should he make an expected presidential run after finishing up his term as governor this year. 
Even as progressives push Newsom to raise revenue to bolster Medi-Cal, few of them have actually embraced the wealth tax proposal, with most of them taking a wait-and-see stance. They also won’t criticize Newsom’s opposition, a potential sign that liberal lawmakers are hoping he’ll be willing to pursue other funding for health care.
Newsom’s office did not respond to inquiries Wednesday about whether he would consider alternative tax proposals.
The health advocates said they would make replacing federal funding a key priority this legislative session. Progressive lawmakers, who led the charge against Newsom’s proposal to cut costs by freezing Medi-Cal for undocumented immigrants, have signaled they’ll take up the fight as well. 
Assembly Health Chair Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat, suggested the state look at imposing new taxes on corporations that employ workers who are paid so little they qualify for public health care assistance. 
“We cannot let these corporations keep getting a free ride,” she said. “California has a responsibility to act decisively, and we will.”
But she has not introduced a bill, and health care advocates said they’re still just hoping to have more options on the table.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01142026_-FightForOurHealthCoalition_RA_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608
,California,2026-01-15 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Homelessness crisis remains one of Newsom’s biggest political liabilities,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/homelessness-crisis-newsom-political-liabilities/,"Newsom recently boasted about a 9% drop in homelessness, yet there are still plenty of encampments critics could feature in attack ads should he run for president in two years.","While delivering his final State of the State address and proposing his final state budget last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom clearly sought to neutralize an issue that has haunted his political career for more than two decades and could torpedo his hopes of becoming president: homelessness.
First, a bit of history.
Just months after being elected mayor of San Francisco in 2004, Newsom unveiled a plan he said would clear city streets of homeless people in 10 years. Fourteen years later, while running for governor, Newsom declared that homelessness in San Francisco had “never been worse.” 
He said eradicating homelessness would be a high priority and promised to appoint a homeless “czar” who could cut through red tape and intergovernmental friction to get the job done. Later, when pressed by reporters over the czar pledge, he snapped, “You want to know who’s the homeless czar? I’m the homeless czar in the state of California.”
Despite that self-appointment and devoting almost all of his 2020 State of the State address to homelessness, the number of unhoused Californians continued to rise to record levels. As it did, Newsom began blaming local governments for not spending state homelessness grants effectively and threatened to withhold annual funding.
However, in 2024 State Auditor Grant Parks excoriated Newsom’s own California Interagency Council on Homelessness for failing to effectively monitor and coordinate homelessness programs — even though the state had spent more than $20 billion during Newsom’s governorship.
He later reorganized the council and last year it issued a glossy “Action Plan for Preventing and Ending Homelessness.” Newsom hailed it as “not just a report of our investments, but a directive for continued accountability and action towards specific quantifiable goals.”
It listed multiple things that should be done to alleviate the homelessness crisis, but never mentioned how its lofty goals should be achieved nor said anything about how the state’s deficit-ridden budget would pay for them.
In last week’s State of the State address, Newsom sang the political version of the World War II tune, “Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,” cataloguing his accomplishments during the last seven years, including progress toward eliminating homelessness.
“When I began as governor, there was no homeless plan, no mental health plan and certainly no housing plan,” Newsom told legislators. “There was no accountability and little investment. The responsibility fell to cities and counties, with little interest from Sacramento.”
Newsom ticked off the efforts he had made and bragged that, “Early data, just compiled, shows that the number of unsheltered homeless people in California dropped 9% in 2025,” while “the nation saw an 18.1% overall increase in homelessness. Our investments are paying off.”
He could not, however, resist another jab at local officials, saying he is “providing counties what they’ve been asking for: the predictable funding for housing and substance abuse treatment. No more excuses — it’s time to bring people off the streets, out of encampments, into housing, into treatment. Counties need to do their job.”
County officials took umbrage. The California State Association of Counties, in a statement, complained that Newsom’s budget shifts the financial burden for several health and welfare programs to county governments and fails to protect them from federal reductions.
The organization also cited the new budget’s omission of an annual bloc grant for homeless programs, and the administration’s stalling the delivery of cash from a past allocation, “which was approved by the Legislature 18 months ago.”
While Newsom cites a 9% drop in homelessness, if true it would be from a base of nearly 200,000 Californians without homes. There are still plenty of squalid encampments to be videotaped and featured on ads attacking a potential presidential candidate named Newsom two years hence.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102524_Unhoused-Voting_FG_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608

One recent victory ended a National Guard deployment in Los Angeles.,"In summary
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has sued the Trump administration more than 50 times. One recent victory ended a National Guard deployment in Los Angeles.



At the end of December, the tide turned decisively against the Trump administration’s deployment of the National Guard in three states over the objections of their governors, including California. 
First, the U.S, Supreme Court on Dec. 23 sided with Illinois in its effort to block Trump from sending the National Guard to Chicago as part of its immigration crackdown. The court rejected the same legal reasoning that Trump used to federalize and deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles last summer when protests erupted there. 
“The government has not carried its burden to show that (the law) permits the President to federalize the Guard in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois,” the unsigned order from the Supreme Court read. 
Then the administration quietly withdrew its appeal of a federal court decision that the president could not keep California National Guard troops under federal control in perpetuity. That withdrawal marked a victory for California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who had filed an amicus brief in the Illinois case. 
“The law got developed in a way that will prevent what happened over the last six months from ever happening again,” Bonta said. “I think this door is closed to Trump.”
CalMatters spoke with Bonta this week about those cases and how he views the Trump administration’s current focus on Minneapolis. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.
CalMatters: In terms of what California does next on this issue, is there anything that you all are doing in preparation for maybe (large-scale immigration raids) coming back, or perhaps an escalation in tactics like we’re seeing in Minnesota? 
Bonta: We’re ready for anything. I think when you see incidents like we’re seeing in Minnesota, you have to assume that it could happen here in California. 
You know, the Trump administration has made no bones about it. They are going after blue states and only blue states. And it’s political, it’s weaponization, it is partisan. They’re trying to own the libs and get the Dems. That’s their whole reason for being. And chief among them, the biggest state in the nation that has rejected Trump three times when he’s running, that sticks in his craw, he doesn’t like it.
CalMatters: In Los Angeles, I don’t recall them going door-to-door to, you know, to try and grab people like we’re seeing in Minnesota. Is this an escalation?
Bonta: I think they’re escalating. Minnesota shows it seems to be an escalation. I mean, there were some pieces that are the same, that are horrific and terrorizing and traumatizing and inappropriate, like removing license plates and being in a moving truck, pulling up to a Home Depot and having people run out of the back and all the profiling that was being done.
I think it’s an escalation, and they’re doing more. They’re really trying to hammer Minneapolis and Minnesota. It’s the home of the vice presidential candidate that ran against Trump, right? It’s the place where their racism is on full display with their attacks on Somalis. It’s where the YouTuber was trying to suggest that there were child care centers that didn’t have any children and there was something inappropriate with what he was showing. 
So, Minnesota is a big target right now. California has always been, and I think they will put us back in the crosshairs at some point, and we’ll be ready.

CalMatters: What happened at the Supreme Court?
Bonta: The Supreme Court weighed in and basically said that the theory that the president had been operating on all along was completely unlawful and without foundation, truly a slap in the face and an embarrassing and devastating loss for Trump, who thinks he can always run to the Supreme Court and get what he wants. 
And they followed the law, the law that we had argued always applied, and that there was no authority … to deploy the military, that the “regular forces” included the military forces. There was no analysis that they were unable to execute the law, and there was no authority for the military to be even executing any laws, given the Posse Comitatus Act (which prevents the president from using the military as a domestic police force). So it was really a devastating and shocking loss for Trump.
CalMatters: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard in L.A. in June, but ruled differently six months later. The district judge’s rationale was that Trump couldn’t re-federalize troops indefinitely. 
But does that indicate to you that if the material conditions on the ground in L.A. were to change, similar to what the Trump administration cited in June when they claimed protesters were committing violent acts against federal personnel and property, the Trump administration could authorize a new deployment? Is that your understanding, or am I wrong on that? 
Bonta: I think you’re wrong, but I don’t think it’s an unreasonable thing to say, but let me just explain my thinking. 
That case in L.A. in June was the very first one in the whole nation, and built into the exercise of authority of the federal administration here when it’s deploying the military is a great deal of deference. I think that deference was provided. It was the first case. There were mostly peaceful protests, but some violence, as you just mentioned. 
It was the first time they were seeing what the Trump administration was doing here. 
And then they saw it again in D.C. Then they saw it again in Portland, and they saw it again in Illinois. The judges saw what was happening, and they saw what’s being said, and saw the rationale, they saw how Trump said that Portland was a war zone when it was a peaceful city, they see how Trump says, ‘I’m going to bring the military in to do the very thing the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits, to enforce criminal law, because these blue cities are not cracking down on crime.’ Exactly what the military cannot do! 
And so they saw what he was doing with the military and I think they got a sense of where this was really headed and what was happening here. … So now that the U.S. Supreme Court has said you make sure “regular forces” is military forces, you need to make a showing that all the military forces cannot stop the concrete block from being thrown, or stop the Molotov cocktail from being thrown – he’ll never be able to show that – then you can bring in the National Guard. 
CalMatters: Just one point on that. Circumstances being what they are today, again, if they were to mimic whatever happened in June, would that be a different conversation if the material conditions on the ground change in Los Angeles? 
Bonta: Yeah, totally different. We’d go into court right away, we would win, we’d get an order, and the 9th Circuit would uphold it. Because there would be no showing that the military, all the military — I mean, thousands of military, there’s multiple military bases in California – that they couldn’t stop one person throwing concrete. I think our military is fully capable of that.
So, same exact circumstances from June happening today, 9th Circuit affirms it and does not stay it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625-Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem-MG-CM-18.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608

Trevor Lee, R-Layton, speaks on the House floor at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Feb. 6, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)During a time when anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies have ramped up nationally under President Donald Trump’s administration, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature is expected to debate a handful of bills aimed at restricting people without legal status from accessing public assistance programs and other resources — like their ability to legally drive or seek shelter. 
The question remains, however, whether the bills will survive both the House and the Senate — and the governor’s pen — in a state that historically has been welcoming to refugees and immigrants. The Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session, set to convene Tuesday, also comes during an election year, with 15 seats in the Senate and 75 in the House up for grabs.
One of Utah’s most hard-right Republicans, Rep. Trevor Lee is sponsoring those bills. The first to be filed — HB88 — would stop unauthorized immigrants in Utah from being able to access a wide range of publicly funded assistance programs. 
“That could be housing, that could be any type of health care, it could be homeless assistance, food stamps, I mean, you name it,” Lee, R-Layton, told Utah News Dispatch in an interview this week. 
Idaho Legislature passes bill blocking unauthorized immigrants from public services

If Lee’s bill is approved, it would likely restrict undocumented people from accessing the state’s Women, Infants and Children Program (known as WIC), which provides nutrition services and healthy food for pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, and to infants and children up to 5 years old. It could also restrict free vaccines, communicable disease treatments and a variety of other assistance programs that don’t currently require proof of U.S. citizenship for people seeking help. 
Lee’s bill is modeled after one passed by the Idaho Legislature last year. The American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho sued, alleging it unlawfully disqualifies otherwise eligible low-income immigrants from life-saving HIV treatment based solely on their immigration status. In July, a federal judge blocked the state of Idaho from requiring immigration status verification for federally-funded health services. 
Lee also said he plans to run a bill to “get rid of” the state’s driving privilege cards, which are state-issued licenses allowing people living in Utah who are undocumented or awaiting legal status to be able to legally drive. 
Additionally, Lee said he’s “copying” another law from Tennessee that broadly bans anyone from providing housing to undocumented people, whether through shelter or rent. A coalition of faith groups have sued, alleging the law is unconstitutional for criminalizing providing shelter to anyone who is undocumented, even when there is no intent to conceal them. 
As of Wednesday, HB88 was the only one of those bills to be publicly filed and published. Lee said he’s still working on the others. 
Answering a call from the Trump administration
Though immigration is a national issue, Lee said he wants Utah to answer a call from the Trump administration to “follow what other red states have been doing” and help “crack down” on undocumented people.
“The federal side has their things that they’re dealing with, and this has been a call from the Trump administration to crack down on it,” he said. “If we do our job and we get rid of these incentives, then many will self-deport without us having to forcibly do it.” 
Advocates and Democrats including House Minority Leader Angela Romero and Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla have criticized Lee’s proposals as “heartless” and “mean spirited” for targeting vulnerable populations.

Lee’s bills are “hurtful” and “tell people they don’t belong,” Romero said. 
She added that “everyone’s family, at some point, except our indigenous communities, immigrated here.” 
“I encourage my colleagues to have a little bit of compassion,” Romero said.
She also noted that many of the people impacted by Lee’s bill are part of “mixed-status families,” with kids who may be citizens but parents who are undocumented.
“It’s not like these individuals are not contributing to our economy,” she said. “They have to buy food. They also pay taxes. … So I get frustrated when there’s a stereotype (that) people who are aspiring to be citizens or aspiring for a better future for their family, that they are taking away from the system when, in actuality, a majority of them are putting more into our economy than they’re getting back.” 
It’s particularly “infuriating,” Romero said, that many people who would be impacted by Lee’s HB88 are children. 
Lee, who is up for reelection this year, said his aim is “putting Utahns first” while discouraging undocumented immigrants from staying in the state. 
“Why on earth, when there are struggling Utahns, would we ever allocate and put those resources to someone who is not even a citizen of this country?” Lee said.

Providing public assistance to undocumented immigrants, Lee said, is “incentivizing lawbreakers.” 
“We’re allowing people to break the law and then we give them free stuff,” he said. “And they’re going to go somewhere else if they don’t get it. They will self-deport.” 
To those who criticize his bill, Lee said, “They love putting other people over Utahns.” 
“I believe compassion stops where responsibility begins,” he said. “That’s what we’ve done in this country. We are $37 trillion in debt. And it’s because we have a third world that’s been imported here, and so many of them have broken the law, entered our country illegally, and instead of telling them to go back home, we give them free benefits. That is absolutely insane.” 
While Utah’s budget is balanced every year — with Republican leaders often lauding the state as being fiscally responsible — Lee said the state still has unfunded needs that it should be prioritizing over providing assistance to undocumented people. 
“We are continually criticized for not giving enough money to education. We’re continually criticized for not doing enough for air quality. There’s always something more that we could be funding,” he said. “And why are we putting someone who is not even a citizen over the needs of Utahns? What are we elected for, then? What are we doing?”
‘Diabolical’: Advocates widely oppose Lee’s approach
Gina Cornia, executive director of Utahns Against Hunger, expects the bill would have an impact not just on WIC, but also on a program that funds meal boxes for seniors in Utah and another that contributes stock to food pantries. 
“I think it’s diabolical, you know, that he’s really willing to literally deny people food in an effort to force them to go back, as if people can just pack up their satchel,” Cornia said. “I mean, it’s way more complicated than that, and in the meantime, what do people do?”

Cornia said the WIC program seeks to foster healthy communities and called Lee’s proposal “a violation of our morality as a state.” 
“If the very least we can do for people is make sure they have food, we should be doing that,” Cornia said. 
She said the change would create a bigger administrative burden for the state government. And she said it’s not feasible to expect small food pantries with thin staffing and budgets to spend time checking into a visitor’s immigration status. 
“I mean, are we going to be asking a small church pantry to verify people’s immigration status? It just doesn’t make sense to us,” Cornia said. 
She noted immigrants living in the U.S. without documents are already ineligible for benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Under federal changes that took effect in November, refugees who aren’t lawful permanent residents no longer qualify for SNAP benefits either. 
Nationwide immigration raids bring fear to Latinos in Utah, but a glimmer of hope prevails

Moe Hickey, executive director of the advocacy group Voices for Utah Children, said Lee’s HB88 “is not even good policy,” noting, for example, that limiting vaccination efforts for undocumented people puts the whole community at higher risk. 
“So we’re going to say children who are going to come to school unvaccinated because they’re undocumented? That’s putting other children at risk,” Hickey said. “It’s very poorly thought out legislation, and it’s clearly a message. But it’s just not good policy.” 
To that argument, Lee said, “If we’re so worried about these people needing our vaccines, they shouldn’t be here.” 
Hickey said the bill would also add to a “chilling effect” that’s already impacting immigrant communities under the Trump administration.
“When you start running bills that are targeting a community, then the community starts living in more fear,” he said. “And then they’re not taking advantage of benefits that they potentially are eligible for. But they’re going further into the shadows. Which, you know, good immigration policy should be the opposite. We should be providing people with safety and a path forward. Not pushing them into the corner.” 
Hickey argued that HB88 wouldn’t result in savings — but rather push higher costs on emergency rooms and hospital systems. 
To Lee’s arguments that resources should go to “Utahns first,” Hickey argued, “they are.” He said undocumented people don’t impact the ability of Utahns to access the benefits
“Not at all,” he said. “What impacts Utahns, for some of these services, are bad policies coming from the federal government.” Work requirements on SNAP, for example, have a much bigger impact on eligible people accessing food nutrition benefits, he said. 
Aden Batar, director of migration and refugee services for Catholic Community Services, said also “we are deeply concerned” about Lee’s HB88. 
“From our direct service experience, we know that policies limiting access to these essential supports do not reduce need — they simply push families into crisis and place greater strain on emergency systems, hospitals, shelters, schools, and local nonprofits,” Batar said. 
More uncertainty surrounds SNAP program as new changes take effect

Additionally, Batar said Catholic Community Services serves “many mixed status households with children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present, but depend on shared family stability to remain healthy and housed.” 
“When parents are afraid to seek food, medical care, or shelter, children suffer first,” Batar said. “Public health is also put at risk when families avoid vaccination and preventive care out of fear or confusion.”
Batar also expressed particular concern about added administrative burdens the bill would put on local providers. 
“Requiring service organizations to verify immigration status diverts limited resources away from care, undermines trust between providers and families, and conflicts with the humanitarian and faith-based missions of many Utah nonprofits,” Batar said. 
Batar urged lawmakers to consider the “real-world impacts of this legislation” and people and service providers across the state, and to “pursue solutions that uphold human dignity, public health and the common good.” 
Will Lee’s bills find traction? 
In a wide-ranging interview this week with one of Utah’s most powerful lawmakers, Senate President Stuart Adams, Utah News Dispatch asked about Lee’s HB88 and whether he supports it.
Adams, R-Layton, did not take a position on Lee’s HB88, saying he needed to look at the bill. He said the Senate will evaluate what survives the House. 
Generally, though, Adams said undocumented immigrants who are “productive” should be allowed to stay, while those who are “doing things illegally, they need to go home.”
“I just want to make sure we keep America strong and keep us secure,” he said. “It seems to me that the better solution is to find a way to bring people through with less restrictions legally.” 
The Senate president acknowledged immigration is a federal issue that Congress needs to tackle — and it’s a “problem” and a “disappointment” that it has failed to fix the system.

Adams said as Utah lawmakers debate immigration issues, including Lee’s bills, he’s not sure where the House and Senate will land. 
“I don’t know what we’ll do,” he said. “My hope is we’ll find common sense. And we need people to work. And we need people to stay here that are productive. The people that aren’t … that are doing things illegally, ought to go home.” 
Romero, the House’s top Democrat, said she hopes Lee’s bills won’t find any traction “because I think they’re cruel, they’re message bills, and I hope that the majority of the body doesn’t share that ideology.”
It’s possible Lee’s proposals will find more support in the House but hit roadblocks in the Senate. But that’s hard to predict — especially during an election year, Hickey said. 
“I do think the general public is less inclined to support these,” Hickey said, though he added there may also be “a pocket of the public that would be on board.” 
In the past, the Senate “has been sort of the safeguard of things like this not going forward,” Hickey said, “but that being said, it’s hard to read the tea leaves right now.” 
Asked if he’s worried if HB88 could run into trouble in the Senate, Lee said: “If my colleagues want to tell their constituents they’re putting a noncitizen over Utahns, like, be my guest. But no, for the most part, the vast majority of my colleagues I’ve talked to said they will vote for this legislation.”

(Will Ruzanski/Utah News Dispatch)After three years of construction on Capitol Hill, the new North Capitol Building is complete just in time for the 2026 Legislative Session. Designed to complement the Capitol’s neoclassical architecture and house Utah’s first state history museum, the building serves as an expansion of the Capitol campus and a symbolic gateway through Utah’s history. 
The project marks the completion of the master plan for Capitol Hill, written more than a century ago. The northern entrance flows through the building and out onto the lawn, creating a direct pathway that guides visitors beneath a one-of-a-kind stained glass skylight leading to the Capitol building.

“It was imperative in the master plan that the new North Capitol Building fit within the neoclassical design of the campus,” said Nathan Levitt, the project’s principal architect with VCBO Architecture. 
Preservation extended beyond architectural style. During construction, crews altered the building’s underground footprint to protect historic sequoia trees on the north law. According to the Capitol Preservation Board’s Executive Director Dana Jones, a wall in the parking garage was shifted 18 inches during construction to avoid damaging the trees’ root systems. 
“I think that that’s a really special fact, because to me, it speaks to the level of care that our team has as a whole,” Jones said. “This is us paying forward to many generations.”
At the center of the building is a $1.6 million stained glass laylight showcasing Utah’s natural wonders and cultural symbols. Made up of more than 14,700 individual pieces of glass with sand from all 29 Utah counties, the piece incorporates iconic Utah scenes like the Great Salt Lake and southern Utah’s red rock formations. 
Inflation drove up project budget
The project cost $320 million, exceeding initial estimates of $165 million, according to Andy Marr, the director of Utah’s Division of Facilities Construction and Management. 
“Over a number of years (the budget) grew through different amounts of appropriations that the legislature approved as the project scope started to evolve,” Marr said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We were talking about this building as just a replacement for parking,” he said. “That conversation quickly evolved into, ‘this is the opportunity to finish the master plan of Capitol Hill.’”
Marr also mentioned inflation as contributing to the rising budget.
“We went through a pretty rough period of construction escalation, peaking at 14% (inflation),” he said. “That was a part of the cost factoring here that’s pretty standard industry wide.”
Construction
The building was constructed by Oakland Construction, along with collaboration from various other groups. Michael Despain, the project director for Oakland, said the building is “intentionally a step down” in comparison to the Capitol. 
“We wanted this building to not be as formal as the Capitol,” he said. “The Capitol is the highlight of the campus, and everything here is intentionally just a little bit more subdued.”

Despain also described the scale of the project. More than 450,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured during construction, enough to fill 4,500 trucks or lay a 4-foot-wide sidewalk stretching nearly 200 miles long. 
Employing an average of 266 workers per day and 350 workers per day during peak construction, Despain said the project took 581,000 hours of labor to finish. 
“For one person, that’s roughly 283 years for one guy to build this,” he said. 
“Lots of collaboration between VCBO, the Capital Preservation Board, DFCM, Oakland, and all of our trade partners,” Despain said. “It’s been an amazing, historical, iconic project.”
Museum of Utah History
The North Capitol Building includes Utah’s first dedicated state history museum, set to open in June 2026. 
“This is the space where, really, Utah’s fine art collection and history’s preservation will happen for the next 100 years,” said Tim Glenn, the museum director. 
Glenn explained the museum will display 950 artifacts when it opens, with a regular rotation moving through the exhibition space. The North Capitol Building also includes a specialized storage area suited to house all of the state’s historical pieces.

“This is purpose-built and state of the art. It provides (an) opportunity for us to grow. All of the state’s treasures will be here, and future state treasures will be here,” he said. “Our collection currently has around 30,000 artifacts, 28,000 books, 8,500 manuscripts, 23,000 pamphlets, and many, many other materials,” he said. “All of that will be stored in this space.”
Showcasing the state’s historical collection in the museum also opens up the public’s access to them, Glenn noted.
“We also have our engagement room in this building,” he said. “If (visitors are) doing research or have an interest in a particular artifact or manuscript collection, they can make an appointment in our engagement room and pull artifacts from this space right up into that research area.”
A ribbon cutting ceremony will commence Friday at 12:30 p.m. The North Capitol Building opens to the public on Tuesday, on the first day of the legislative session.

Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, stands on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 8, 2024 in Montgomery, Alabama. The House Judiciary Committee passed two bills sponsored by Simpson to expand the circumstances that prosecutors may seek the death penalty. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday approved two bills that would expand the list of criminal offenses eligible for the death penalty.
The House Judiciary Committee approved HB 41 and HB 20, both sponsored by Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne. HB 41 would make it it a capital offense to rape, sodomize or sexually torture a child younger than 12 years old. HB 20 would make it a capital offense to murder someone while also creating “a great risk of death to multiple persons.”
“Some people need to die,” Simpson, a former child victims prosecutor in Baldwin County, told the committee on Wednesday. “That is exactly the point. This is the worst of the worst offenses. These people are taking advantage of children who cannot defend themselves. These are the absolute victims of society.”
The legislation, if passed, would join laws passed by other conservative states seeking to challenge a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared the death penalty unconstitutional for all offenses except murder.
The bill retains much of the language that is already in statute but adds the three different offenses to what is essentially a growing list of aggravating circumstances that make someone eligible to be put to death.
Alabama law currently identifies 21 aggravating factors that allow prosecutors to charge a person with capital punishment and, by extension, allow a defendant to be put to death. Among them is murdering a first responder while the person is on duty, murdering someone with a deadly weapon while in a vehicle, or murdering someone in the presence of a child who is younger than 14 years old “if the victim was the parent or legal guardian of the child.” But murder is the only offense subject to the death penalty.
Simpson filed a nearly identical bill that was approved by the House Judiciary Committee early in the 2025 session but did not pass the Legislature.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 struck down a Louisiana law allowing the death penalty for child rape in a case known as Kennedy v. Louisiana. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy cited concerns that imposing the death penalty would discourage child abuse reporting and put victims’ lives in danger. He also noted a victim in the capital child abuse case had to repeatedly describe her trauma to investigators and prosecutors.
“During formative years of her adolescence, made all the more daunting for having to come to terms with the brutality of her experience, (the victim) was required to discuss the case at length with law enforcement personnel,” Kennedy wrote.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, cited those concerns in committee on Wednesday.
“In pursuit of the death penalty in that particular situation, you would not only require the person to be courageous enough, and the family to be courageous enough, to come forward, and say, ‘We want this person prosecuted,’ but the victim and the victim’s family would also have to participate in the decision to ultimately kill that person too,” England said. “The victim, in that situation, would be less likely to come forward knowing that prosecuting that person means that coach, pastor, aunt, uncle, mom, dad, whoever, would not only be prosecuted, but they would also be put to death.”
He was also concerned that the law could provide leverage to perpetrators when dealing with the victim.
“Imagine you being an abuser, and the law hands you the ultimate tool to abuse a victim by not only saying, ‘You will destroy our family if you turn me in, but you will also kill me too,’” England said.
Other people that advocate on behalf of children have concerns with the bill.
“In general, we want to ensure that the population that the bill is intended to protect and to bring justice for really are the children,” said Apreill Hartsfield, director of policy, advocacy and research for VOICES for Alabama’s Children.
Florida in 2023 and Tennessee in 2024 enacted similar laws in the hopes of challenging the previous precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court.
“What they are doing is showing that it is not unusual, and this is a nationwide push to show that this is not an unusual punishment, and therefore the rationale in Kennedy is no longer valid,” Simpson said.
HB 20 adds murdering someone while risking the lives of others as another aggravating circumstance to the list of offenses that make someone eligible for capital punishment.
Simpson is introducing his bills to expand capital punishment as public support for the death patently continues to wane. About 52% currently support the death penalty, lower than the 80% who said they approve of it in 1994. The number of people who oppose the death penalty has increased, from 16% in the 1990s to about 40% in recent years.

Youchah said during a hearing Wednesday, in a reversal of her previous denial.
“We are here today because, candidly, sometimes I think too much,” Youchah told attorneys for MGM Grand and Dwight Manley, a California businessman who is suing the casino giant in federal court. Manley claims he was drugged with ketamine while playing blackjack in the MGM Grand Mansion, an enclave for high rollers. 
He alleges MGM executives took advantage of his drugged condition by increasing his longstanding $1 million credit limit to $3.5 million in the course of an afternoon, despite erratic behavior witnessed by his friends and acknowledged by his longtime casino host, according to court documents. In his suit, Manley contends that credit extensions exceeding a gambler’s previous limit are granted in small increments, not millions of dollars at a time. 
The gambler has purchased billboards seeking information from witnesses and offering a reward. 
Attorney Lawrence Semenza III, who represents MGM in the suit, called the litigation “a fishing expedition.”
MGM, according to legal filings, suggests Manley was trying to get out of paying his gambling debts. Manley counters in pleadings that he paid his host $560,000 on the plane ride back to California. He also made no effort to stop payment when MGM deposited his markers, according to the lawsuit. 
Manley’s attorney, Paul Hejmanowski, has 60 days to complete the depositions, the judge ordered. 
Responsible gambling?
After a few hours gambling on Dec. 10, 2021, Manley felt “disoriented and ‘out of it,’” according to the lawsuit filed against MGM. At about 4 p.m., according to a video log composed by MGM, a cocktail server brought Manley his fifth drink. Within minutes he shattered an ashtray, cut his hand, and was bleeding on the blackjack table.
Manley – described by his then-girlfriend (now wife) in her voluntary statement to police as “a heavyweight, i.e., not a lightweight” when it comes to drinking – “does not recall cutting his hand, did not feel any pain, and was unaware that he was bleeding,” the lawsuit says. 
According to the video log from MGM, within minutes Manley began playing again at a different blackjack table.
Manley, in his police report, says he was told that “my casino host informed my three friends in the bar area that surveillance advised her that I was acting erratic. At no point, other than temporarily when my hand was bleeding, did MGM do anything to stop my play. To the contrary, MGM increased my credit limit by $2,500,000.”
“I may want to fly home tonight,” Manley, who flew to Las Vegas on an MGM plane, texted his casino host the morning after he was allegedly drugged. “I think someone must have spiked a drink.” 
Manley’s casino host, Vanessa Reboton, in a text message, suggests Manley get intravenous hydration. 
“At no time did anyone from the MGM suggest that Dwight should see a doctor or have a blood draw done to test for drugs,” according to Hejmanowski.
Later that day, Reboton told Manley she had requested tapes of his play from casino surveillance.
“It is my belief that the video evidence will demonstrate that Mr. Manley was visibly impaired, could not balance himself, and fell multiple times,” Manley’s initial attorney David Chesnoff wrote to MGM legal counsel Ashley Eddy three days after the incident. “During the above stated time frame of Mr. Manley’s visible impairment he executed several casino markers in amounts that exceed his traditional gambling history with MGM Resorts International.” 
In a voluntary statement to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Manley said his credit limit “has been $1,000,000 for approximately ten years.”
Under Nevada Gaming Regulation 5.011, permitting a person who is visibly impaired by alcohol or any other drug to gamble or be served complimentary drinks “is inimical to the public health, safety, morals, good order, or general welfare of the people of the State of Nevada, or that would reflect or tend to reflect discredit upon the State of Nevada or the gaming industry,” and is grounds for disciplinary action.
In Oct. 2022, gaming agent Terry Ochal notified Manley his case “has been approved by supervisors” for review by legal counsel. 
“I can’t imagine a victim has to be further harmed by having to be in the dark like this,” a frustrated Manley responded. 
“…as I explained in our first conversation, in an NGCB Regulation case you are considered a witness, not a victim,” Ochal told Manley. “The case itself is between the Board and the licensee.” 
Gaming regulators have taken no disciplinary action against MGM.
Company town?
Manley, in his pleadings, implies that Las Vegas is run by casino companies, and that Metro does their bidding. Both Metro and MGM, he suggests, skrimped on their investigations of the alleged drugging. 
The gambler submitted a police report to Metro in March 2022, along with a drug test that revealed the presence of ketamine in his hair. Ketamine is a powerful drug used to sedate animals. The test detected no other narcotics. 
Two lie detector tests arranged by Chesnoff, and turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, determined Manley was not deceptive when he asserted he did not use drugs while gambling and has not in the past. 
Metro, according to a deposition in the case, closed its investigation without interviewing the bartender who mixed the drink the gambler suspects left him incapacitated.
The bartender, Jerilyn Koch, testified in a March deposition that she was interviewed once by the Nevada Gaming Control Board about the allegations, but never by police, or by MGM.
MGM did not respond to requests for comment on their internal investigation protocol. Metro declined to discuss its probe. 
Manley’s casino host, Reboton, testified in deposition that she also was never questioned by Metro or her employer. 
Reboton, Hejmanowski said, acknowledged to others shortly after Manley left the casino that he was “wasted or drunk,” raising questions about why he was granted more credit. 
Metro has also withheld casino video which purportedly shows no wrongdoing, claiming it is evidence in the case, which is closed. 
“I have received and reviewed video footage that was provided by MGM,” Det. Justin Adkins told Manley via email in August 2022. “In the footage there wasn’t any evidence that proved an employee did any illegal acts.” Adkins added he was closing the case.  
“I am really shocked that only watching the tape is the depth of this investigation,” Manley responded in the email, adding “Ketamine mixed with alcohol is a deadly combination, which could have easily killed me.”
Metro declined to provide the Current with the video, reiterating its claim that it is evidence. A video that lacks images of a criminal act is generally not considered evidence, according to legal experts. Evidence, they say, must be impounded.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/leothelion-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 08:56:36.231608
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,US will suspend immigrant visa processing from 75 countries,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/us-will-suspend-immigrant-visa-processing-from-75-countries/,The State Dept said it will suspend processing visas for citizens of countries whose nationals the Trump admin. has deemed likely to need public assistance.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Wednesday it will suspend the processing of immigrant visas for citizens of 75 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and Somalia, whose nationals the Trump administration has deemed likely to require public assistance while living in the United States.
The State Department, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, said it had instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the countries affected in accordance with a broader order issued in November that tightened rules around potential immigrants who might become “public charges” in the U.S.
The step builds on earlier immigration and travel bans by the administration on nearly 40 countries and is part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to tighten U.S. entry standards for foreigners.
“The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” the department said in a statement. “Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.”
The suspension, which will begin Jan. 21, will not apply to applicants seeking non-immigrant visas, or temporary tourist or business visas, who make up the vast majority of visa seekers. Demand for non-immigrant visas is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months and years due to the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both of which the U.S. will host or co-host.
Cable calls for screening of non-immigrant visa applicants
A separate notice sent to all U.S. embassies and consulates said that non-immigrant visa applicants should be screened for the possibility that they might seek public benefits in the United States.
“With the uncovering of massive public benefits fraud across the United States, the Trump administration is laser-focused on eliminating and preventing fraud in public benefits programs,” said the cable that referred specifically to most non-immigrant visa applications and was sent on Monday.
The cable, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, urged consular officers to ensure that foreigners wanting to travel to the U.S. “have been fully vetted and screened” for whether they may rely on public services before they are issued a visa.
The cable noted several times that it is up to the applicant to prove that they would not apply for public benefits while in the U.S. and said consular officers who suspect the applicant might apply should require them to fill out a form proving their financial bona fides.
President Donald Trump’s administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Consular officials must consider a range of personal details
The November guidance on which Wednesday’s decision is based directed U.S. Embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S.
While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn’t be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.
Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who’s been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They’re also required to have a number of vaccinations.
The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants’ English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.
Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already tightening those rules.
The countries affected by the suspension announced on Wednesday are:
Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013628117938-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-15 10:57:59.434321

In 2024, eight families sued the Alabama Department of Corrections, alleging that the department harvested the organs of their loved ones, who died while in prison, and sent them to the University of Alabama Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine.
According to the lawsuit, a group of medical students from the school noticed that many of the specimens they worked with in the curriculum were taken from people who died while in Alabama’s prisons.
The university and the Alabama Department of Corrections sought to have the case dismissed in February claiming that the university is immune from civil litigation filed by the plaintiffs. The Montgomery Circuit court ruled against the motion to dismiss and allowed the case to move forward.
The House Judiciary Committee approved similar legislation that England sponsored in 2024.

The Mason-Dixon poll shows Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, leading Demings, mayor of Orange County, 23%-19%. But 58% are undecided in the August primary.
It’s a little clearer in the GOP primary in the Mason-Dixon survey, with Naples U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds with a huge lead over three other Republicans.
Donalds gets 37% of the vote, with Lt. Gov. Jay Collins (now officially in the race), a distant second with 7%. Former House Speaker Paul Renner is at 4% and investment firm CEO James Fishback is at 3%.
However, nearly half (49%) say they are undecided in the Republican race.
Other polls taken in recent months show Donalds leading in the GOP race, with his numbers rising exponentially when pollsters inform Republican voters that Donalds has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
“It should be noted that Donalds is the only candidate in either race whose name is recognized by more than half of his party’s voters,” said Mason-Dixon pollster Brad Coker. ” That name recognition advantage is an important factor behind his frontrunner status.”
The poll was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy from Jan. 8 through Jan. 13, 2026. It was made up of two separate statewide samples – one of 400 registered Democratic voters and one of 400 registered Republican voters. It has a margin of error of +/- 5%.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/0-1-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 07:58:25.704415

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen want to redirect a portion of funding allocated for immigration enforcement as part of the GOP-backed multitrillion-dollar domestic spending and tax cut package passed last year toward local law enforcement. 
Their proposal comes a day after Congressional Progressive Democrats vowed to oppose any funding for ICE after a Minnesota woman was killed by an immigration officer. The push comes amid recent polling that indicates growing support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Nevada Democrats’ proposal also came on the same day as the centrist Searchlight Institute, founded by a staffer for the late Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, pleaded with congressional Democrats not to fall into a “trap” by allowing themselves to be accused of wanting to “defund” ICE, the Bulwark reported.
The massive spending bill signed by President Donald Trump last summer allocated $175 billion to immigration enforcement over several years. Cortez Masto and Rosen said on Wednesday they were sponsoring legislation that would reallocate $75 billion to law enforcement.  
“The Trump Administration’s actions are not making our communities any safer, in fact they’re doing just the opposite,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “Instead of giving ICE $75 billion extra dollars to hire untrained ICE agents to patrol American communities, let’s invest that money where it will actually help – in hiring local police officers who are trained to fight crime in a way that earns community trust.”
Many local police agencies work with ICE to conduct enforcement. The ACLU found in the first eight months of Trump’s second term “the number of local agencies opting to act as deportation force multipliers has grown by 600 percent.”
Funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, is expected to be debated as the U.S. Senate takes up appropriations bills ahead of a Jan. 30 deadline. 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that ICE funding is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.” 
The Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which Rep. Steven Horsford is the only Nevada member, said this week it would oppose any federal funding going toward immigration enforcement. 
Their announcement follows the death of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed last week by an immigration officer. Her death has sparked nationwide protests, including some in Nevada. 
The Trump administration has spent the first year back in office carrying out a campaign promise for more aggressive immigration enforcement and a pledge for mass deportation. 
Both Cortez Masto and Rosen noted in their announcement Wednesday that 73% of individuals held in ICE detention didn’t have a criminal conviction while less than 5% had a violent criminal conviction. They also pointed to a ProPublica analysis that found more than 170 U.S. citizens had been detained by ICE.
“The Trump Administration’s mass immigration enforcement is causing chaos and instilling fear in our communities because they are going after law-abiding immigrants and even U.S. citizens,” Rosen said in a statement.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260112_1039-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 07:58:25.704415

(Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette) COLUMBIA — Republican legislators’ latest attempt to further limit abortions in South Carolina would put drugs used for medication abortions in the same category as Valium and Xanax.
A 3-2 vote Wednesday along party lines advanced the bill to the full House Judiciary Committee, where it’s certain to win approval: Its chairman, Rep. Weston Newton, is the main sponsor.
The proposal would classify mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV drugs, making possession legal only by prescription.
Violators could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to prison for up to five years. Anyone who gives the drugs to a pregnant woman without her knowledge intending to cause an abortion could be sent to prison for 10 years. However, the bill specifies that a pregnant woman could not be prosecuted for having the drugs for her own use.
A second bill taken up by the panel would do the opposite. It would intentionally punish women for having an abortion by extending all legal protections to the womb from fertilization. Abortion would be legally on par with murder.
Its sponsor, Rep. Rob Harris of Spartanburg County, said he wants to end abortions by erasing women’s “complete immunity” from prosecution.
Rep. Rob Harris, R-Wellford, explains his bill during a news conference at the Statehouse in Columbia on Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)
“Murdering anyone should be illegal for everyone,” said the father of 10 and member of the hardline Freedom Caucus.
Harris’ bill, titled “Prenatal Equal Protection,” is not expected to get any traction. Other than Harris, the subcommittee heard from two speakers on his bill, one for and one against, before adjourning without a vote.
“The reality is, you’re going after women making the most traumatic decision of their life. … You’re going after women trying to become mothers. You’re going after me,” said Tori Nardone, who shared needing to go out of state for an abortion after her doctor diagnosed a fatal fetal anomaly. Under the state’s abortion ban, her situation should’ve been an allowed exception, but her doctor feared making that call. “I couldn’t get care” in South Carolina, she said.
“Bills like these do nothing but terrify women out of wanting to get pregnant,” she told the panel. “Please don’t make it worse than it already is.”
Harris’ bill is unlikely to get a second hearing. Even some of the state’s most strident abortion foes say it goes too far.
It’s largely the same proposal he introduced in 2023. That bill never got a hearing, but the House rejected it when he offered it as an amendment during a floor debate. National headlines followed about South Carolina potentially allowing the death sentence for women, prompting 12 GOP co-sponsors to remove their names. The bill died with the end of the 2024 session. But Harris, an emergency room nurse, was undeterred and reintroduced the proposal ahead of the 2025 session’s start. House rules guaranteed him one hearing, which occurred Wednesday.
A companion bill was introduced Tuesday by Sen. Lee Bright, the former senator who won a special election in December to retake the seat he lost in 2016.
At a news conference with Harris ahead of session’s opening, the Spartanburg Republican recognized the bill’s slim chances.
“I know we’ve got hearts and minds to change,” he said. “God’s in the hearts-and-minds-changing business.”
Two months ago, a Senate panel rejected legislation that banned abortion from the onset of pregnancy and criminalized women for getting an abortion. In a panel chaired by the bill’s author, even one of its co-sponsors ultimately couldn’t support it.
Asked about the chances of an abortion debate again this year, Senate GOP leaders indicated they want to move on.
“We don’t need to do it,” said Senate Education Chairman Greg Hembree of Horry County. Referring to the six-week ban that took effect in 2023, he said, “We passed a bill. We need to let the bill work. We need to see how it goes. We need to let it play out a bit, and if we need to — two, three, five years from now — evaluate, OK, let’s do that. In the meantime, the Senate’s spoken. Let’s move on for a while.”
Sen. Tom Davis went further, emphatically promising to block any bill that bans abortion from conception, saying that’s “so far out of touch” with most South Carolinians’ opinions. If the proposal is revived in committee, he will work to stop it from advancing. And if it manages to get to the floor anyway, he will use Senate rules to ensure it gets no further.
“I’m committed to making sure that doesn’t happen,” the Beaufort Republican told the SC Daily Gazette last week. In fall 2022, it was Davis’ promised filibuster that ended debate on a proposed ban from conception.
But a bill that targets mailed abortion medication drugs is different, said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey.
“If we can focus on that, we can probably get strong support,” said the Edgefield Republican, who called the drugs mailed from another state an “end run” to state law.
The bulk of Wednesday’s two-hour House hearing was spent on Newton’s bill.
It’s already illegal for providers in South Carolina to mail the two pills that end a pregnancy. The two-step regimen is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation. In South Carolina, that option remains legal through six weeks. But the drugs must be handed over at the clinic.
Other states, however, allow providers to mail drugs for a medication abortion following a telehealth visit — including to patients in states with abortion bans — and shield them from prosecution. That’s led to lawsuits filed in Texas and Louisiana against doctors in New York and California.
Data from one of the nation’s largest online providers shows that 84% of their prescriptions over 15 months went to patients in abortion-ban states, according to a report last August by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin.
Advocates of Newton’s bill said it would help South Carolina in court.
“What this bill does is gives another arrow in your quiver when you go to the courts to enforce the state of South Carolina’s law,” former GOP Rep. Garry Smith, who represented a Greenville County seat for 19 years, told his colleagues. ‘This is another mechanism to support your case.”
But opponents of the measure said changing the drugs’ classification will further endanger women in a state that already has one of the nation’s highest death rates for women dying during pregnancy, childbirth or soon after.
Newton stressed that the drugs would remain available by prescription. Nothing in the bill bans the drug, he said.
But opponents countered it will still be harder for women to access the drugs for non-abortion health care.
Dr. Tricia Seal, an OB-GYN in Columbia, said the drugs’ safe and effective gynecological uses include miscarriages and other emergencies. She keeps them available in her office, but she couldn’t do that if the drugs were reclassified as Schedule IV. Requiring her to write a prescription to get filled elsewhere would delay care, she said.
“The impact on miscarriage and stillborn care is so profound, harm is guaranteed,” she said.
Dr. Rebecca Haskell, an OB-GYN resident in Columbia, said the bill will cause more doctors-in-training to avoid South Carolina. This spring, she and her classmates will travel to New York for a two-week crash course on maternal care that can’t be part of their training in South Carolina, she said.
The bill “will continue to drive away the next generation of eager, capable, confident physicians,” she said. “I urge you to put ideology aside. Women in South Carolina already can’t find an OB-GYN.”
Former Sen. Penry Gustafson called the bill unwise, unkind, and cruel. She accused the sponsors of being “pro-forced birth and pro-forced surgery.”
“I’m not talking about family values; I’m talking about miscarriage,” said the Camden Republican, one of the “sister senators” who lost her re-election bid in 2024 after uniting against the six-week ban.
“Your continued push to ban all abortions and anything related will cause real women standing beside us to die,” she said. “You have the opportunity to take a real concerted long pause on this one. This bill has not been thought through.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/penry-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 10:00:05.179225

(Stock photo by Darrin Klimek/Getty Images)New Jersey officials have released recommendations for how the state should repurpose two jails for law-breaking youth, even though the jails remain open nearly a decade after the state first vowed to close them.
Former Gov. Chris Christie in 2017 ordered the closure of the New Jersey Training School in Monroe, a 200-bed facility for boys in Monroe, and the Female Secure Care and Intake Facility, a 48-bed facility known as Hayes in Bordentown. The jails are to be replaced by three smaller lockups that look and function more like schools, to be located in north, central, and southern parts of the state.
In a new report released Tuesday, a youth justice working group convened in July 2024 by Attorney General Matt Platkin urged policymakers to convert the sites into places of restorative or therapeutic programming that serve low-income communities and people impacted by the criminal justice system.
NJ lawmakers pass bill to expand protections for women in prison

Their suggestions include a school, vocational and career training, reentry programming, affordable housing, recreational uses, a heritage center that tells the story of the sites, or a New Jersey Center for Peace and Restorative Justice modeled after the Equal Justice Initiative’s Legacy Sites in Montgomery, Alabama, which are part museum and part memorial.
Neither site should be used for correctional purposes, and their reuse should honor their history, the working group said.
Hayes is located on the site of a historic boarding school for Black youth called the New Jersey Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth. That school was founded in 1886 by the Rev. Walter A.S. Rice, a formerly enslaved Civil War veteran, and was once known as the “Tuskegee of the North,” attracting visitors including Nat King Cole, W.E.B. DuBois, and Booker T. Washington, and lecturers including Albert Einstein and Paul Robeson. The state closed it in 1955 after integration attempts failed.
The New Jersey Training School, which is known as Jamesburg, opened in 1867 as the New Jersey State Reform School to remove troubled youth from adult prisons.
Platkin acknowledged he won’t be around to supervise the sites’ reuse, with Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill naming Jen Davenport to Platkin’s post. Sherrill will be sworn in Tuesday. But he applauded the recommendations as “staying true to my mandate of providing innovative opportunities for populations historically and disproportionately, disadvantaged by the youth criminal justice system.”
“The Working Group’s proposals are significant, thoughtful, and a critical contribution to the discussions that this State is having around the future of these sites set for closure,” Platkin wrote in the report. “While my Office will not be the ultimate decision-maker as to the disposition of these facilities, I know that this Report will provide essential guidance as these projects proceed.”
Just over 400 juveniles and young adults, from age 14 into their 20s, are in custody or under the supervision of juvenile justice authorities in New Jersey, according to state data. Most — 244 boys and four girls — are in youth prisons, while another 32 are in residential community homes and 118 are under parole supervision in the community.
Construction on the smaller replacement jails has begun in Ewing and Winslow, though they’re not expected to open until at least 2027. The state is still finalizing a location for the northern site, the report says.
Members of the working group include advocates from the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, Salvation and Social Justice, and the Bordentown Historical Society, as well as youth justice officials and experts.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Former Vice President Kamala Harris spoke in Jackson at the newly reopened Thalia Mara Hall on Wednesday, stopping in Mississippi’s capital city for the second part of her book tour as she mulls another presidential campaign. 
Harris was greeted with a warm reception from a packed audience at Thalia Mara, which had been closed since August of 2024 for renovations. Jackson Mayor John Horhn kicked off the event by awarding Harris a key to the city and announcing that he had signed a proclamation making Jan. 14 “Kamala Harris Day” in Jackson.   
“Kamala, you don’t know what you mean to Jackson, Mississippi,” Horhn said. “You don’t know what you mean to America.”
Harris spoke for roughly an hour with Rita Brent, a comedian and writer from Jackson. Harris was in town to promote her book “107 Days,” which details what Harris called “the shortest presidential election in history.” Had she had more time to build her campaign — an opportunity denied by former President Joe Biden’s decision to keep running for re-election for a month after a disastrous debate performance — the election might have turned out differently, Harris said on Wednesday.
The then-vice president lost to Donald Trump in the popular vote and the electoral college. Her defeat ushered in an administration that is “corrupt, callous and incompetent,” Harris said.
Harris said she predicted what the administration would do, including efforts to eradicate the U.S. Department of Education and a widespread immigration crackdown. But she said she was caught off guard by the support President Trump has garnered from corporate leaders.

“I have predicted almost everything that’s happened,” Harris said. “But what I did not predict was the capitulation, the titans of industry, the powerful people who just bent the knee to the foot of a tyrant.”
Harris called the Trump administration’s agenda a “swift implementation of a plan that has been decades in the making.” She criticized what she said are economically damaging tariffs, the spread of disinformation and attacks on consumer protections.
At one point, when lamenting President Trump’s conduct and likening him to other demagogues, she appeared to confuse the home state of the white-supremacist politician Bull Connor, who is from Alabama.
“Mississippi knows it well, Bull Connor, I mean, we know, we have had figures throughout history that have been about destruction and have not elevated our best angels or our better angels,” Harris said.

The local crowd enjoyed a riff from Harris on the importance of participating in local government to help fix issues such as potholes, of which there are many in Jackson.
“Insurance doesn’t cover a flat tire,” Harris quipped. 
Harris’s late-December decision to launch the second part of her book tour in the Deep South, where Black voters typically play a key role in the Democratic presidential primaries, sparked speculation about her future. She spoke in New Orleans on Tuesday and will also make stops in the critical primary state of South Carolina, along with appearances in Tennessee and Alabama.
Harris did not discuss her future plans on Wednesday. But she has said she has not ruled out another run for the White House and did not say anything that would dissuade attendees from assuming that.
She recounted writing her 2024 concession speech on the way to Howard University, adding one line: “Sometimes the fight takes a while.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14212923/kamala-harris-feat-image.jpg,,,2026-01-15 07:58:25.704415

Gov. Kay Ivey launched a statewide effort to expand the program to all 67 counties in 2023. The bill does not change the way the program operates but codifies an executive order signed by Ivey in 2023 to establish the statewide expansion of the Imagination Library.
Last year, Ivey released a statement saying over two million books had been distributed to children in all counties across the state. The statement also said over 106,000 students are enrolled in the Imagination Library program.
Under the bill, state funds will make up half of the program’s funding and local partners will make up half. Private donations can also be contributed to help fund the Imagination Library.
According to the bill, the Alabama Department of Early Childhood Education will manage the Imagination Library program and is also responsible for working with a nonprofit to operate the program and create rules as needed.

(Photo by Buena Vista Images/Getty Images)Octopus is back on the policy menu for Washington state lawmakers.
A bill to outlaw the sale, possession, transport, and distribution of farmed octopus advanced out of the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday.
“Octopus are intelligent creatures. They’ve shown aptitude for problem-solving,” said Rep. Adam Bernbaum, D-Port Angeles. 
He said the bill is not intended to limit the consumption of octopus or to prevent its use “in any number of culinary applications. But if we can make sure that its harvest is done in a more compassionate, less painful way with fewer ecological impacts, we should do so.”
The legislation, which stalled in the same committee last session, passed Wednesday on a party-line vote, with the panel’s six Democrats in favor and its five Republicans opposed. 
House Bill 1608 seeks to build on a 2024 law banning octopus farming in Washington. 
Rep. Tom Dent, R- Moses Lake, the committee’s lead Republican, agreed that octopuses are intelligent. But his colleagues had “some serious concerns” with the legislation and he had not “got into the weeds” to find ways to make it amenable.
When Washington enacted its prohibition on octopus farms, it was a preemptive move as there were none operating or proposed in the state at the time. Most octopus consumed in restaurants in Washington is wild because there are no large-scale octopus farms anywhere.
A 2021 study by researchers in England found “very strong evidence” that octopi are sentient beings capable of experiencing distress and happiness. An octopus farm would be tough on them, researchers concluded.
Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, authored the 2024 law and sponsored this year’s bill.
It bars knowingly selling, possessing, transporting, or distributing “any species of octopus that is the result or product of aquaculture.” Violations carry a fine of up to $1,000.
“We’re following other states and other countries in trying to protect a pretty unique creature,” he said.
The legislation will be sent to the House Rules Committee, where lawmakers will decide whether to allow a House floor vote on the bill.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/octopus-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 07:58:25.704415

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An Indiana House committee unanimously advanced a bill Wednesday tightening protections for defendants with intellectual disabilities in capital cases, while a Senate proposal allowing firing squad executions remains on hold as lawmakers approach key legislative deadlines.
Other death penalty-related bills filed this session have yet to receive hearings. 
Legislators have just two weeks to move legislation to the House and Senate floors. Bills must advance from committees by Jan. 26 and to opposing chambers by Jan. 29.
The House Courts and Criminal Code Committee on Wednesday unanimously advanced to the full chamber House Bill 1432, authored by Rep. Garrett Bascom, R-Lawrenceburg, which would prohibit the state from seeking the death penalty against a defendant if a court determines at any time before trial that the defendant has an intellectual disability.

Under current law, the court must make that determination within a more narrow, early pretrial window.
Bascom told committee members the bill is intended to address a procedural gap — not alter Indiana’s long-standing policy barring execution of people with intellectual disabilities.
“It doesn’t change anything substantive,” Bascom said. “What we’re attempting to do here is make sure that anybody with an intellectual disability does not fall through the cracks in the process.”
Bascom noted that defendants currently must raise intellectual disability as a defense no more than 20 days before the omnibus date, which can arrive quickly after charges are filed.
“When I was a public defender,” he said, “sometimes it can be difficult to really get your feet underneath you” within that short window.
Before voting, the committee approved additional language in the bill that creates an automatic process to evaluate defendants for intellectual disability once prosecutors seek the death penalty.
Bascom explained that after the state files notice of intent to seek a death sentence, the court would appoint at least two independent evaluators to assess the defendant. Their reports would initially be shared only with defense counsel.
“After the review of the second report, then they will have 30 days to raise the defense and then the judge has to decide this before trial,” Bascom said. “I’ve attempted to bring all the stakeholders together to come into the sweet spot so that we don’t have anybody fall through the cracks as it relates to the death penalty, and as it relates to somebody that specifically has this intellectual disability.”
Examples of intellectual disabilities include, but are not limited to, persons with Down Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.
‘Straightforward and important’
Tom Crishon, with The Arc of Indiana, testified in support of the bill as amended, calling its purpose “straightforward and important.”
“The purpose of the bill … is to ensure that individuals with an intellectual disability are not subjected to the death penalty in Indiana,” he said. “This has long and properly been the policy of the state and reflects federal constitutional law.”
Crishon said Indiana’s current statute prioritizes procedural deadlines over accuracy.
‘A fail-safe option’: Lawmakers debate firing squad executions in Indiana

“Intellectual disability can manifest in different and often subtle ways,” he added. “It is not always obvious at the onset of a case.”
Crishon additionally said the bill does not presume a finding of intellectual disability, but instead ensures the issue is affirmatively considered by qualified professionals.
“Ensuring accuracy at the onset is not only constitutionally sound, but is fiscally responsible,” Christian said.
If defendants in active capital cases are determined to have an intellectual disability early in proceedings, the state could save an estimated $260,000 per case in public defense costs alone, largely because death penalty cases require two attorneys and higher reimbursement rates, according to a legislative fiscal analysis.
Counties could also avoid hundreds of thousands of dollars in jury trial and indigent defense expenses.
The Indiana Catholic Conference also voiced support. Roarke LaCoursiere, speaking on behalf of Indiana’s Catholic bishops, said the bill adds “an additional measure of scrutiny” in capital cases.
“Although the Catholic Church teaches that the use of the death penalty is inadmissible in all cases,” Lacoursiere said, “we are here to offer support for House Bill 1432.”
Public defenders urge caution
The Indiana Public Defender Council testified in neutrality but cited concerns from capital defenders about the bill’s automatic evaluation process.
Zach Stock, appearing on behalf of the council, said efforts to reduce error in death penalty cases are critical, including errors related to intellectual disability, mental health and sanity determinations.
“The error rate is unacceptably high,” Stock said. “Anything that could attempt to reduce that error rate is something that we should appreciate and champion.”










If an evaluation gets away from a defender, and it’s not done right — not done well — they’re tainted for years.


– Zach Stock with the Indiana Public Defender Council


However, he said capital defenders worry the process could “make it worse by complicating their control and potentially tainting” evaluations through what he described as the “anchoring effect,” where early assessments influence later conclusions.
“If an evaluation gets away from a defender, and it’s not done right — not done well — they’re tainted for years,” Stock said.
Bascom acknowledged those concerns and said he would continue working with public defenders as the bill moves forward.
Firing squad bill remains on hold
A separate death penalty proposal in the Senate stalled this week, however.
Senate Bill 11, authored by Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, would add execution by firing squad as an option under Indiana law. The bill was heard in committee last week and placed on the Senate Corrections and Criminal Law Committee agenda for Tuesday, but committee chair Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, declined to amend or vote on it.
In brief comments during Tuesday’s meeting, Freeman made clear that “Indiana is a death penalty state … and as long as I have a say, Indiana is going to continue to be a death penalty state.”
He warned, though, that efforts to eliminate capital punishment through litigation or other avenues could backfire.
“For those of you that disagree, fine, good. People can disagree, and we can do so respectfully,” Freeman said. “I would just say this — be careful what you wish for, because it just might come true the more you want to try to eliminate something.”

In comments to the Indiana Capital Chronicle after the hearing, Freeman said he would “prefer for executions to continue to happen by lethal injection,” which he called “the most humane,” but said he has not decided whether the bill will be called for a vote next week.
Freeman said he recently met with the Indiana Department of Correction, which he said raised “some concerns,” though he did not provide details.
Noelle Russell, a spokesperson for the Department of Correction, told the Capital Chronicle the agency has no position on the bill, currently. The department has not testified publicly on the proposal.
Several amendments to Senate Bill 11 have been filed but have not been taken up by the corrections committee.
One amendment would authorize DOC to carry out executions by firing squad only if the commissioner determines it is “advisable in light of availability considerations and the resources of the department.” The proposed changes would also require the agency to establish a dedicated room and execution protocol before any firing squad execution occurs.
A new state prison is under construction in Westville, but it’s unclear if such a room is included — or possible — in current building plans.
Other death penalty bills without action
Several additional death-penalty-related bills filed this session have not yet been scheduled for hearings.
House Bill 1119, authored by Reps. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, and Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, would allow executions by firing squad or nitrogen hypoxia while keeping lethal injection as the default method unless an inmate requests otherwise.
Another Ireland proposal, House Bill 1314, would seek to speed up post-conviction relief proceedings, potentially shortening the time inmates spend on death row.
Separately, House Bill 1287, filed by Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, would require members of the General Assembly to volunteer to serve on execution teams and make their names public records.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls New Jersey House candidate Analilia Mejia “a fighter for working people.” (Ocasio-Cortez photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch/Mejia photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed Democratic activist Analilia Mejia in the 12-person race to replace Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in the House of Representatives.
The endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, comes just days before Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is scheduled to appear at a Jan. 19 rally with Mejia in Wayne as part of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.
Mejia is vying with 10 other Democrats in a Feb. 5 special primary for their party’s nomination to succeed Sherrill, who stepped down from representing the 11th Congressional District after she won last year’s gubernatorial election.
Gov. Murphy touts accomplishments in final legislative address

“Analilia Mejia is a fighter for working people who has been on the frontlines of some of our most critical battles — from immigrant rights and universal healthcare to higher wages and real accountability for the powerful. I know she will bring that fight to Congress on day one and I am proud to support her run to represent NJ-11 in Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.
The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway on April 16. The winner of that election will finish out Sherrill’s term, which ends Jan. 3, 2027.
Ocasio-Cortez’s support will help Mejia cast herself as the progressive leader in the race to succeed Sherrill, which includes former Rep. Tom Malinowski, Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, and Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett, among others.
Mejia, who lives in Glen Ridge, was national political director for Sanders’ 2020 presidential bid, and is also the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance. She called herself “humbled” by Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement.
“It’s time to take power back from the political establishment and put it in the hands of the people and I’m ready to do that alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to deliver real results,” she said.
Major names are weighing in on the special election. Sen. Andy Kim (D) has endorsed Malinowski, who represented the 7th Congressional District for two terms before being ousted in 2022. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) supports Gil, who managed Murphy’s 2017 campaign for governor. Way has secured the endorsement of another New York Democrat, Rep. Gregory Meeks. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) backs Mejia.
The other Democrats in the race to succeed Sherrill are Army veteran and businessman Zachary Beecher, attorney and comedian J-L Cauvin, former Obama staffer Cammie Croft, Morris Township Committeeman Jeff Grayzel, Chatham Councilman Justin Strickland, and community activist Anna Lee Williams.
The 11th District includes towns in Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties.

Meeting that challenge will require discipline, market-driven solutions and a firm commitment to policies that strengthen, not restrict, the state’s energy supply.
Missouri consumes far more electricity than it produces. As demand increases from advanced manufacturing, agricultural processing and new technologies, and as older power plants retire, expanding in-state generation is no longer optional. It is essential to maintaining economic competitiveness and grid reliability.
That is why proposals to impose moratoriums on utility-scale solar are deeply misguided. A moratorium does not stop demand, it limits supply. When government restricts supply, prices rise. Blocking the lowest-cost and fastest-to-build source of new generation forces Missouri to rely more heavily on expensive, out-of-state power and volatile wholesale markets, directly increasing electricity costs for ratepayers.
The consequences extend well beyond utility bills.
Companies considering investments in Missouri look closely at energy availability and price stability. Advanced manufacturers and agricultural processors cannot expand, or even operate, without dependable, affordable electricity. Artificially constraining generation through a solar moratorium creates an energy shortage by government decree, putting Missouri at a competitive disadvantage to neighboring states that are expanding supply and welcoming investment.
Solar development has already proven its value in Missouri. More than $1.1 billion has been invested, generating $3.7 million in state and local tax revenue that supports schools, public safety and infrastructure, without raising taxes. In rural communities, these projects provide stable, long-term revenue at a time when family farms face increasing economic pressure.
Equally important, solar respects private property rights. Farmers and landowners who voluntarily choose to host projects are exercising their right to use their land productively, strengthen their operations, and diversify income. A blanket moratorium replaces individual choice with government control, undermining the principles of property rights and free enterprise that Missouri conservatives have long defended.
Solar energy is not a government mandate or a political statement; it is a practical tool. It is affordable, reliable, and can be brought online quickly to meet rising demand. Expanding solar strengthens grid resilience, keeps energy dollars in Missouri and reduces dependence on outside suppliers.
Missouri’s success has always been driven by innovation, private investment and respect for property rights, not by government-imposed scarcity. As lawmakers consider the state’s energy future, they should reject moratoriums and embrace market-based solutions that lower costs, protect landowner rights, and ensure Missouri has the power it needs to grow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Panels2-scaled-e1768426687144-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

Would any of the doctors be willing to help provide abortion services?
The responses were similar, said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates the Columbia location. 
“Could this affect my practice?” the physicians asked. “Could this put me at risk?” 
No providers agreed to come on board, Wales outlined in testimony this week as part of a trial focused on the constitutionality of Missouri’s dozens of regulations on abortion clinics and providers.
Three days into the trial, witnesses have illustrated how layers of regulations enacted in recent decades by a legislature intent on pushing abortion from the state ultimately succeeded in “making compliance confusing or impossible, and abortion gradually unavailable,” said Eleanor Spottswood, an attorney with Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
The dearth of physicians willing to provide abortion services — and who could meet the state’s rules — played a significant role.
“There are very few abortion providers in the state of Missouri and this community in general,” Dr. Selina Sandoval, associate medical director at Planned Parenthood Great Plains, testified Wednesday. “We know that a lot of this is related to the criminal penalties and the constant harassment and threat that abortion providers are under. I experience this regularly, almost daily, when I’m working.”
Testimony has painted a timeline of providers often sent scrambling for support as they tried to gain or maintain licensure required through the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. By 2022, when a near-total abortion ban went into effect in Missouri, there was no longer any point.
In late 2024, Missourians enshrined abortion protections in the state constitution. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state a day later with the goal of striking down a few dozen abortion regulations they say are now unconstitutional under the new amendment. 
Last year, Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang, who is presiding over the bench trial, agreed to temporarily block some of the regulations until a final conclusion could be reached at trial. This allowed Planned Parenthood to again begin providing procedural abortions at three locations: Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis. Medication abortions remain unavailable due to regulations that remained in place ahead of trial.
Missouri abortion regulations go on trial Monday. Widespread access is at stake

Among the myriad abortion regulations passed by the state legislature over the years is a requirement that only physicians perform abortions. 
Lifting this requirement and allowing advanced practice clinicians, including nurse practitioners, would double the number of abortion providers in the state, and could pave the way for offering abortion at additional Planned Parenthood clinics, Wales said in her testimony. 
Another law requiring physicians to have admitting privileges and a transfer agreement at a local hospital has also greatly inhibited Planned Parenthood providers over recent years, providers testified.
In 2012, the Columbia clinic employed two doctors with admitting privileges at two local hospitals. But both ultimately left the clinic, Wales said, because of harassment. Protestors showed up at one doctor’s home, she testified. They also showed up at the other doctor’s private practice.
Similarly, Wales testified, Planned Parenthood tried and failed to recruit a specialized sonographer to either its Kansas City or Columbia clinics after a new state statute requiring these more skilled and more expensive professionals be used.
Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood’s relationship with the state health department became increasingly “combative,” Wales testified, saying that both planned and surprise on-site health inspections intensified over the years. Some staff resigned as a result, Wales said.
Sandoval’s testimony detailed how hospitals are wary of giving abortion providers admitting privileges because of politics and OBGYNs fear potential criminal penalties if they provide abortions. 
Until the passage of the reproductive rights amendment, health care providers who performed abortions not deemed necessary under Missouri’s emergency exception could be charged with a class B felony, which means up to 15 years in prison. Their medical licenses could also be suspended or revoked.
By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in June 2022, there was only one clinic in Missouri still providing abortions.
Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, based in eastern Missouri, Springfield and Illinois, was among the last doctors providing abortions there when Roe v. Wade was overturned.
Baum knows the risks. When she walks into work, she said protestors have called her name, as well as her husband’s, who is also an abortion provider. They have plans in place for their children in the event they are ever both prosecuted. 
“When these laws came into place, we had a very serious discussion about whether or not we could continue to provide abortion in Missouri,” she testified.  
The trial, which is expected to span 10 days, returns for the fourth day of testimony on Thursday. Attorneys for Planned Parenthood are expected to call more clinic employees to the stand.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_8060-e1768445179450-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

(24th Judicial District photo)A Jefferson Parish judge who has been chosen king of a Carnival krewe can spend his campaign money on events surrounding his role, according to the Louisiana Board of Ethics.    
The board issued its decision Friday for 24th Judicial District Judge Adrian Adams, who reigns over the Mystic Krewe of Music this year. Adams, who is up for reelection this year, had sought an advisory opinion from the board confirming that his Mardi Gras expenses could be covered with campaign money. 

Specifically, Adams asked if he could use political contributions to purchase cups, beads and other carnival favors bearing his name and image to be given out at parades and other Mardi Gras festivities. 

“If I am able to use the funds, it will allow me to meet the constituents of Jefferson Parish,” Adams wrote in his request for an advisory opinion. 
The board agreed Mardi Gras paraphernalia could be a legitimate campaign expense. 
“[The law] does not prohibit you, as a candidate, from using contributions for expenditures related to Mardi Gras items, including cups, beads or carnival favors, provided that the items contain your name and image,” ethics administrator David Bordelon wrote in the approved opinion. 
A handful of older board opinions issued in the late 1990s already indicated Mardi Gras parade throws with the names and images of politicians on them were a legitimate campaign expense. 
The ethics board might be getting more requests for clarification because the Louisiana Legislature recently loosened restrictions on campaign spending for Mardi Gras. 
In previous years, the board prohibited using campaign funds for Carnival krewe membership dues and participation in parades if the elected official or candidate’s face was covered. But a broad rewrite of the campaign finance laws last year means those spending limitations likely don’t exist anymore. 
Politicians may now use their campaign and political action committee money for krewe dues as long as being a member of the krewe helps them interact with constituents, other elected officials or former elected officials. 
There’s also a specific provision to allow campaign money to be spent more freely on Washington Mardi Gras, which takes place in the nation’s capital every year. 
In November, the ethics board issued an advisory opinion to Mandeville Mayor Clay Madden, stating he can legally use campaign funds to cover his Washington Mardi Gras expenses. Madden intends to go to the event, which will take place the last week of January, in his official capacity as a city representative, he said in his request to the board.

Private equity firms have in recent years bought out some of the few school transportation companies available to school districts, sparking worries among advocates.

Years ago, when the Mountain Views Supervisory Union would bid for student busing services, officials would get several competing offers to pick from, the district’s superintendent recently pointed out.
Now, the district is lucky if they get a single bid, Superintendent Sherry Sousa said. And they’re not alone.
Over the past decade, Vermont has seen fewer and fewer companies available for student transportation services, according to interviews with school superintendents and administrators, and a report by the Vermont Agency of Education.
This has limited school districts’ ability to negotiate contracts at competitive prices. The Agency of Education’s report, released in December, highlighted the “rapidly rising and unpredictable cost of transportation services, driven in part by limited vendor competition.”
In a survey of supervisory unions and supervisory districts last year, officials described year-over-year cost increases ranging from 20 to 35 percent, “with some projecting even steeper future growth,” according to the agency’s report.
Without competition in the market, Sousa said it “makes it really hard to negotiate a contract that meets the needs of our communities and is fiscally responsible.”
Now, with the Legislature’s focus on education reform, transportation will almost certainly be on lawmakers’ minds. Act 73, Vermont’s generational effort to reform the state’s public education system, calls for consolidating the state’s 119 school districts and the 52 governing units that oversee them.
But it’s anyone’s guess what that consolidation could look like, or if lawmakers will even agree on a proposal. Issues with transportation will only make that endeavor more difficult.
Meanwhile, the few school transportation companies operating in the state have been bought up or are controlled by private equity companies.
At least four companies that are contracted with school districts in Vermont — including First Student, Butler’s Bus Service, Bet-Cha Transit and Mountain Transit — are owned by private equity companies, sparking worries about service quality among advocates.
Compounded by a general shortage of drivers, the state of the industry has made busing students all the more difficult, particularly for school districts in more rural areas.
“I think this is one of those sleeper issues,” said John Castle, the executive director of the Vermont Rural Education Collaborative and a former superintendent of the North Country Supervisory Union. “You contract out with a mega company that can do this. But how responsive are they to your needs? And at some point, when they control the market, they’re gonna jack up the price, and you’ve got very little say in what you can do.”

‘Not a whole lot of providers’ 
Vermont’s school districts are required by state law to adopt a school transportation policy but are not required to provide student transportation. 
The school districts that do provide transportation can get funding from the state’s transportation reimbursement grant program. Districts may apply to get 50% of their transportation costs covered but are limited by a statewide cap of about $25 million.
With a lack of competition, districts are left negotiating with companies from a position of limited leverage, contributing to disproportionately high per-student costs, according to the Agency of Education’s report.
It’s not clear how many school bus companies operate in the state, or how many districts offer transportation services. The Agency of Education does not track which school bus companies contract with school districts, nor does the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which manages the inspection of school buses and issues licenses to drivers.
One prominent company operating in Vermont is First Student, the largest student transportation service provider in the country, which was purchased by the private equity firm EQT Infrastructure in 2021 in a $4.6 billion sale.
First Student is contracted with the Washington Central Unified Union School District, which serves students in Berlin, Calais, East Montpelier, Middlesex and Worcester.
Steven Dellinger-Pate, the district’s superintendent, said First Student’s service has been satisfactory, but he is concerned with the lack of competition in school bus vendors.
“There’s just not a whole lot of providers in Central Vermont,” Dellinger-Pate said. “We have not always had other vendors bid for transportation contracts in the past, so, you know, we certainly appreciate competition where it exists, but we don’t always have that in our transportation bids.”
First Student spokesperson Brenna Rudisill wrote in a statement that the company is operating all planned routes and actively recruiting to offer competitive wages and benefits to increase staffing levels to continue to meet daily service needs. First Student and EQT Infrastructure did not immediately respond to subsequent inquiries on scant vendor competition and the impact of private equity on the student transportation landscape.  
Brooke Olsen-Farrell, superintendent of the Slate Valley Unified Union School District, said only one company, Bet-Cha, responded to the district’s last two bids for service. This is despite the supervisory union hiring a transportation consultant to drum up more bids across the Northeast, she said.
Olsen-Farrell said her district faces similar school bus workforce challenges and concerns with lack of vendor competition identified by the Agency of Education’s report.
“This year seems to be a little better than previous years, but there’s many years where we have had to combine runs (or) cancel runs due to lack of drivers,” Olsen-Farrell said.
Bet-Cha is owned by Student Transportation of America, which is owned by pension fund managers La Caisse and Ullico, according to Student Transportation of America spokesperson Mitun Seguin. 
Student Transportation of Vermont — the company’s arm here — works with 30 districts and communities, either through direct contracts or through the local divisions Student Transportation of America owns and operates: Bet-Cha Transit and Mountain Transit. 
La Caisse and Ullico both invest in private equity globally. But “unlike traditional private equity investors,” Seguin wrote, the pension funds have long-term interest in investments made — like Student Transportation of America’s operations in Vermont. 
There are “pocket areas of shortages” for bus workers, but Student Transportation of Vermont has invested in recruiting and retention efforts and has maintained adequate levels of staff, and Seguin rebuffed claims of a shrinking school transportation vendor pool. 
“It is important to note that there is, and always has been, competition among privately owned student transportation companies in Vermont,” Seguin wrote. 
Orleans Central Supervisory Union contracts with Butler’s Bus Service, which in January 2025 was purchased by Beacon Mobility, a national company operating in 25 states that is backed by private equity firm Audax Private Equity.
Jacquelyn Ramsay-Tolman, the Orleans Central superintendent, said staffing and scheduling problems caused routes to be canceled around four times in the first weeks of the school year.
Butler’s Bus Service representatives were communicative through the challenges, and route cancellations issues have since been resolved, although bus staffing for afterschool activities remain a concern, Ramsay-Tolman said.
Sousa, the Mountain Views Supervisory Union superintendent, which is also contracted with Butler’s Bus Service, said her district, too, has had trouble staffing routes due to a shortage of drivers.
Sousa said Butler’s is the only game in town. While she said the company is reliable, difficulties often arise due to driver shortages. The district was unable to support a school bus route for two months due to labor shortages that “put a huge pressure on families and on the school.”
“There are times, at least once a week, where a driver calls out sick, and within hours we have to inform families that there will not be a bus route,” she said. “It really makes it hard for our families when we don’t have the resources to meet the commitment we’ve made to those families.”

Private equity’s impact
Private equity’s presence in the market has generated concern among advocates and school officials around the quality of service available to school districts. Some fear it could magnify workforce shortages and the small vendor pool. 
Azani Creeks, a labor issues researcher and campaigner for the nonprofit Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said the trend is part of an emerging pattern at public schools of outsourcing and privatizing systems like health care, data management and food services to private-equity-affiliated companies.
Private equity companies have been investing in the student transportation sector for at least 15 years, Creeks said, according to tracking by the Chicago-based watchdog organization.
She pointed to a National Education Association article that argued that private outsourcing of student transportation negatively affects student safety and community accountability.
Employees often experience a shift in working conditions when private equity takes over, and private-equity-backed companies employ union busting tactics at higher rates, Creeks added.
Bus workers for the transportation company Travel Kuz experienced this firsthand. The company, which has a contract with the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, locked out its Vermont workers right before this school year started at the end of August.
Travel Kuz — which was formerly called F.M. Kuzmeskus — was acquired by private-equity-backed firm Beacon Mobility, in 2022. Beacon Mobility did not respond to an email request for comment.
The union bus workers and the company eventually came to an agreement but only after nearly two weeks of an escalating labor dispute.
Since the purchase, the Vermont bus workers who the Teamsters Local 597 union represents saw worsening conditions and operations before the contentious contract negotiations, according to the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 President Curtis Clough.
“The way they operate came with the private equity fund, because F.M. Kuzmeskus was a very, you know, tightly run, very organized company a few years ago,” Clough said. “They were starting to pay late. They started to pay the wrong rates. They started to not give people raises on time. They started to charge the wrong amount for health care.”

‘Dependability of our transportation system’
While many districts contract out transportation services, some Vermont school districts, like South Burlington and Champlain Valley, operate their own systems — albeit not without their own workforce challenges.
Jean-Marie Clark, the South Burlington School District’s director of finance and operations, said having an in-house fleet with drivers on staff allows the district a certain level of flexibility and control that they may not get with a third-party company.
“It feels like we are in control of what’s happening and what routes are running and what routes aren’t running, as opposed to that being told to us,” she said.
Staffing shortages remain a persistent issue, officials said, although some districts have found more stability after they increased wages.
Gary Marckres, the chief operating officer with the Champlain Valley School District, pointed to the “stability and quality” provided by having drivers on staff. His district pays first-year drivers a starting wage of $37 an hour, while drivers with the South Burlington school district who have been employed for more than a year make $39.46 an hour, Clark said.
“I’m not saying that the contracted bus drivers are bad, but these are our drivers and mechanics — they’re our employees,” Marckres said. “They’re part of that team that helps us engage with students. They have consistent routes. They know the kids by name. It’s really about engagement and quality and dependability of our transportation system, which I think is the largest advantage.”
But for many districts in the state, operating a fleet or keeping drivers on staff is not a financial reality.
For years, the Colchester School District owned its own fleet of school buses, according to Amy Minor, the district’s superintendent. But she said they eventually moved away from owning their fleet to save money. They now contract with Mountain Transit, one of the local divisions operated by Student Transportation of America.
In the Mountain Views Supervisory Union, Sousa said operating its own school busing system would require a full-time employee. The district would also have to weigh the cost of depreciation and maintenance on a fleet of vehicles — something the district wouldn’t be able to afford.
In labor leader Clough’s mind, the lack of school bus vendors has an upstream cause: school districts’ practice of choosing the lowest bidder.
By solely looking at price, Clough said the districts make it more difficult for smaller transportation businesses to compete and makes it more likely the smaller company will be bought out by larger firms that may have private equity ties — shrinking the pool of vendors further. 
The cost of owning and maintaining buses and establishing depots is a “hurdle” for smaller companies starting up in the state and submitting a bid for a student transportation contract, Olsen-Farrell, the Slate Valley superintendent, said.
While the contracts may cost more, Clough said local, smaller bus companies’ bids may be better in other ways, like providing better services and wages for workers. This, in turn, may help in recruiting bus workers during an ongoing labor shortage.
“You can get yourself in a situation where you’re creating an uncompetitive environment, because the only thing that the bus companies have to concentrate on is cost,” Clough said. “We need to be willing to invest in local companies to do this.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)At the Wisconsin Farmers Union annual farm and rural lobby day on Wednesday morning, the organization’s members heard about how antitrust policy, environmental regulation enforcement and immigration law are affecting the state’s farmers. 
About 90 farmers union members sat around tables in a conference room at the Madison Public Library before heading to the Capitol to push their legislators on the group’s 2026 priorities. 
Gov. Tony Evers addressed the group in a kick-off address, discussing  what his administration has accomplished and what it plans to do moving forward as the “chaos and confusion” of the federal government under the Trump administration “continues to make an already strenuous job harder.” 
“Regardless of what happens in Washington, here in America’s Dairyland, we’re going to keep fighting for Wisconsin farmers and producers and their families because Wisconsin’s agricultural industry isn’t just core to our economy, it’s core to our culture, core to our heritage and who we are as a state,” Evers said. 
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul addressed the group next to discuss how the Department of Justice is working to help the state’s farmers, noting the DOJ was involved in the lawsuit to keep federal food benefits available during the government shutdown last year.
He also discussed the DOJ’s work to protect fair markets and evenly enforce the state’s environmental rules to make sure that the state’s largest corporate farms are playing by the same rules as its smallest family operations. 
“One area that we are engaged in is ensuring that the market is fair, that there’s competition, and ensuring that there’s a level playing field for everybody to compete on. To me, that is fundamental to a lot of what we do,” he said. “So one way is regarding consumer protection. Another area where we take that very seriously is protecting our environmental laws and ensuring that the environmental laws in the state are evenhandedly enforced, because, as you all know firsthand, if massive corporate farms are able to cut corners, that puts them at a major competitive advantage, and all the farms that are out there doing the right thing, very carefully complying with rules and regulations that are in place. If the rules aren’t evenly enforced, that puts the small farmers, often small businesses, at a major competitive disadvantage.” 
Immigration crackdown
Among the farmers union’s top legislative priorities this year is protecting immigrant farm workers. 
On immigration, the organization said it is lobbying legislators to oppose a bill that would require all Wisconsin sheriffs to join the federal government’s 287(g) program, which grants sheriff’s deputies some authority to enforce federal immigration law. Under the bill, if counties refused to participate, the state would reduce the amount of shared revenue provided to the county by the state by 15%. 
Across the state, 18 sheriff’s offices have entered 287(g) agreements, including Kenosha County, which signed its contract to hold immigrants in its jail on behalf of ICE last week. 
The organization also wants to support a bill that would allow DACA recipients — people whose parents brought them to the country without documentation when they were children — to obtain occupational credentials such as licenses to practice medicine. 
In a panel on immigration policy, Amanda Martinez, a policy analyst at Kids Forward, said 287(g) can cause fear to spread throughout rural immigrant communities. 
“This could really deeply impact rural communities who already have those smaller budgets, and also impact the immigrant workers within local communities, because they are a big part of the workforce, whether it’s at farms [or] food productions,” Martinez said. “Bills like 287(g) and Assembly Bill 24 really creates that fear in communities, because immigrants don’t want to go to work, take their kids to schools, and can’t really participate in everyday life, and essentially will impact the workforce as a whole.”
Kaul was asked to respond to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and criticized the ICE activity that led to the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, and the exclusion of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation of that incident.
Attorney General Kaul says Minnesota ICE action harms public safety

Cottage-industry food makers
The Farmers Union is also opposing a bill that would regulate cottage foods makers in a way that advocates said would effectively kill the industry — which was only launched after a lawsuit in 2017 changed existing state law. The bill under consideration this year would require the business owner to use a commercial kitchen if their annual revenue exceeds $40,000. 
Advocates said this limit makes it impossible for these businesses to survive because $40,000 per year isn’t enough to support a family and the cost of renting commercial kitchen space, in communities where that’s even available, would make it harder to turn a profit. 
“If you do revenue of $40,000 your take home or profit is not going to be that, and it is not a living wage, and there is no amount of business you can do and put in an energy that is going to make this a sustainable business, even as a value-add product for farmers,” Jobea Murray, a Milwaukee home baker and president of the Wisconsin Cottage Food Association, said. “The amount of effort and time you put into this. There is no ROI on this. So you can can all day, you can bake all night. You are going to hit that revenue cap and you’re going to make not a lot of money.”

Members of the Joint Appropriations Committee split Wednesday over whether to put the quarter of a billion dollars into temporary or permanent savings accounts. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers clash over where to stash $250M in surplus revenue appeared first on WyoFile .","Amid ongoing budget fights over spending, Wyoming lawmakers clashed Wednesday on the proper way to stash a quarter of a billion dollars in savings.  
While Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers called for placing $250 million of excess revenue into temporary savings to retain the ability to spend it at a later date, others supported Gov. Mark Gordon’s recommendation to put that amount into permanent savings, where it would remain inaccessible but would generate spendable investment income in perpetuity. 
Tensions have run high this week in Cheyenne as the primary budgeting arm of the Wyoming Legislature has been meeting at the Capitol to write a draft budget bill ahead of next month’s legislative session. Debate has largely centered on cuts, including unprecedented measures to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council and halt state dollars from funding Wyoming Public Media. Lawmakers also voted to axe $40 million from the University of Wyoming’s block grant and to strip tens of millions from the state’s health department. 
The driver of such cuts? Not a financial deficit, but a desire by a newly empowered group of Republicans, known as the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, to reshape state government. 
“We’re going to do everything we can to limit the growth of government, so it does not outpace your paychecks,” Joint Appropriations Committee Co-Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said at a Freedom Caucus press conference in November.  
The caucus has criticized previous legislatures for stowing revenue in permanent savings. Those past decisions recently led to a record $1.86 billion in investment earnings, surpassing state revenues from the mineral industry. 
Even so, Gordon urged lawmakers to “significantly increase our savings, which are invested so as to bring additional revenue to the state,” he wrote in a Jan. 7 letter to the Joint Appropriations Committee. 
“As you know, these earnings from our savings continue to help defray the costs taxpayers would otherwise have to pay to receive the services the legislature has required under the law,” Gordon wrote. “Consequently, setting aside savings from current surpluses facilitated during President Trump’s administration better sets the state up to mitigate against harder times.”
Gordon proposed lawmakers evenly split $250,000,000 into two permanent savings accounts — the Wyoming Permanent Mineral Trust Fund and the Common School Permanent Land Fund. Both savings accounts earn investment income, the former of which provides “significant stability for the operations of our state government and statutorily mandated services to our citizens,” Gordon wrote. 
“This income is now one of the top three sources of revenue for the state and, at times, has been the number one revenue generator. This keeps taxes low and provides a quality of life for residents,” Gordon wrote. “Thanks to the wisdom of these former legislators and governors, Wyoming has not been faced with the prospect of being broke in 25 years. That specter was not unfamiliar before that.”

Bear sought an alternative. He brought a motion Wednesday to place those dollars in the state’s “rainy day” fund, officially titled the Legislative Stabilization Reserve Account, or LSRA. 
The fund is consistently ranked as the nation’s largest state reserve as a share of its operating cost. And while it also earns investment income, unlike permanent savings, lawmakers can dip into the account principal — not just the investment income it generates — to cover expenses. 
“There are many arguments to be made that the Legislature is far too liberal about spending this money down the road, and it should be protected by putting it in a constitutionally protected account, which is what the governor has recommended,” Bear said. “But as I look at the long-term forecast with the potential of being in deficit spending on education, I think it’s important that the Legislature have funds available in the next two years, especially in the next four years, to be able to meet those needs in education funding, where this money being tied up in permanent savings would not be available to this body.”
Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, spoke against Bear’s motion and pointed back to 2020 when the state was facing a $400 million budget shortfall. 
“We’re sitting on one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the nation, and our budget’s balanced with yet another year of excess money,” Driskill said. “We’re not arguing like I did back when we cut $400 million [that] we didn’t have.”
In response, Bear pointed to the committee’s attempt to spend less money and a forthcoming ballot initiative to cut residential property taxes — which fund local governments and education — by 50%. The reduction would be in addition to the 25% exemption lawmakers already put on the books. 
“What I’m proposing would help to keep local governments, which I’ve heard my colleagues across the aisle say is just draconian, what we’re doing to local governments, that they can’t afford these 2% to 5% cuts,” Bear said. “Well, there’s gonna be bigger cuts if people vote to relieve themselves from some tax burden.” 
Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, sits at his desk during the Wyoming Legislature’s 2025 general session. (Mike Vanata/WyoFile)
Bear’s comments piqued the interest of Jackson Democratic Sen. Mike Gierau. 
“We just got the tell right there. If you ever play cards, you always look for the tell. And there it was,” Gierau said. “Because we’re going to cut taxes and we’re going to need that money for spending.” 
The income that Wyoming’s investments generate “staves off the pain of the bust that we had time and time again,” Gierau said, speaking against Bear’s motion. 
“This is one of the most consequential decisions that we’ll make in this budget. Say you want to save, but you don’t want to save for the future. You want to hold this money out because you may want to spend it on something else,” Gierau said. “Well, I tell you what, when people in my party say that, they get called all kinds of names.” 
Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, asked the committee to understand that both options are savings and to find a compromise. 
“Ultimately, I think maybe we need to wake up to the fact that we can maybe achieve both ways and not just draw lines in the sand on this one,” Haroldson said. “Frankly, I’m frustrated.”
Before Bear’s motion passed, he told the committee that approximately $500 million is already statutorily earmarked for permanent savings. 
The committee will meet again Thursday to complete crafting the draft budget ahead of the session that begins Feb. 9. Once the budget bill reaches the House and Senate floors during the session, it’s subject to debate and amendments from the full Legislature.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation beefing up Indiana’s employment eligibility verification law no longer threatens violators with a yearlong ban from public works contracts following major edits Wednesday.
Instead, the reworked Senate Bill 87 offers employers — that, acting in “good faith,” misidentify a worker as eligible to work or vice versa — immunity from civil liability.
“This is a strong … statement proclaiming that Hoosier tax dollars invested in public works project will only be spent on legal workers,” said Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger.
Indiana employers face yearlong public works contract ban under immigrant work eligibility bill

Rogers brought a significant amendment before the Senate’s Pensions and Labor Committee, which she chairs. It was taken by consent.
The legislation explicitly extends the state’s existing E-Verify requirement to all public works projects, regardless of the construction delivery method. Witnesses previously complained of “loopholes” allowing certain construction managers to “self-perform” checks.
Rogers called the provision an “important” expansion of the state’s “commitment to being accountable to taxpayers.”
Before their employees begin work, contractors would have to provide the entity that hired the company with a notarized affidavit affirming they don’t knowingly employ unauthorized workers, and run employees working on the project through E-Verify.
The internet-based federal program cross-checks a new hire’s eligibility to work in the U.S. The system compares information from the employment eligibility Form I-9 to records maintained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.
Contractors would have three business days to provide an E-Verify number for specific employees upon the hiring entity’s request.

In response to concerns prime contractors would be responsible for their sub-contractors’ mistakes, Rogers’ amendment specifies the requirements apply to a firm’s direct employees.
Contractors would be prohibited from employing people that don’t pass E-Verify muster, although workers would be able to join the project later if they get a valid number.
A yearlong public works contracting ban for firms that “knowingly or intentionally” violate the bill was nixed in favor of a safe harbor provision for those “acting in good faith” — another response to critical testimony last week.
Current law offers 30 days to remedy violations but otherwise directs state agencies or local units to cancel the contracts. It also includes a rebuttable presumption that employers didn’t knowingly hire an unauthorized worker if the person came up clear in E-Verify.
Senate Bill 87, Rogers said, “dramatically expands the utilization of E-Verify in public works while maintaining an environment in which … contractors have the ability to do great work without undue administrative burdens.”
It was approved unanimously and now heads to the Senate floor.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s cities and towns would have the option of moving their elections to even-numbered years under a bill advancing in the Legislature.
A House committee’s endorsement Wednesday of the optional proposal comes after a failed attempt last year to shift the next round of municipal elections — now set for 2027— to presidential election years starting in 2028.
The House elections committee delayed taking action on another bill that would require most counties to draw county commissioner districts so that they have roughly equal populations.
Moving municipal elections
Supporters of last year’s effort to change the city and town election years argued the shift could increase voter turnout and decrease costs by pairing municipal races with federal and state contests.
Rep. Jennifer Meltzer, R-Shelbyville, raised those considerations in presenting House Bill 1055 to the committee but emphasized moving municipal elections would be a local decision.

“Only having an election once every other year instead of three out of every four, might be the right thing for your community,” Meltzer said. “So leaving all of that up to the local elected officials to make their own decisions and determine what is best for them, not forcing them to move their elections.”
Committee member Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, cited concerns about local issues “getting lost in the noise” of federal and state campaigns if city elections are moved. 
A study led by the Indiana secretary of state’s office last year concluded that moving the municipal elections would lead to a boost in voter turnout that would “more than mak(e) up for” votes lost through “ballot fatigue.” That’s when voters lose interest in lengthy lists of choices.
Indiana’s cities and towns organization expressed opposition to the bill, although the group’s lobbyist said some municipal leaders support the move.
Amy Krieg, the government affairs director for Accelerate Indiana Municipalities, said the group worried about a diminished focus on local issues if the elections for mayors and other city offices were shifted.
“When those elections are moved to even numbered years, the conversation always, or typically, turns into the national hot topics,” Krieg said.
Committee members voted 9-3 to advance the bill to the full House for consideration.
County commissioner districts
The committee put off any action on House Bill 1342 that would require most counties to draw residency districts for their three county commissioners so that they “contain, as nearly as is possible, equal population.”
Bill author Rep. Tim Yocum, R-Clinton and a former Vermillion County commissioner, said that in some counties “the balance is totally out of whack and it needs to be in some way justified.”
Supporters of the bill testified about situations in Clay and Knox counties where one commissioner district has more than 17,000 residents and the other two have fewer than 5,000 residents.
Bill opponents argued that such variations don’t violate “one man, one vote” standards because while commissioner candidates must live in their districts, those positions are elected on a countywide ballot.
The bill would apply to all counties with a board of commissioners, except Lake and St. Joseph counties that currently elect commissioners by district rather than countywide.
Tyler Warman, executive director of the Indiana County Commissioners organization, argued that rural residents “would lose their voice in county government” if commissioner districts were based on population alone.
“For example, Johnson County has a northern urban district, a suburban central district and a rural southern district. Many counties have a similar map,” Warman said. “… It allows for representation from each part of the county. If population alone dictates these districts, one city could hold all seats on the board of commissioners.”

(Getty Images)The Wisconsin Department of Children and Families Sec.-designee Jeff Pertl told reporters that he is confident in the state’s child care accountability measures and isn’t concerned about the state potentially losing federal funding. 
Last week, the Trump administration froze over $10 billion in federal child care funds designated for Minnesota and four other states amid fraud allegations. The funds cover child care subsidies, social services and cash support for low-income families. 
Pertl told reporters that “nothing can stop the president from politicizing an issue.” 
“I think we all see that playing out in a variety of ways all across the country right now, and I think that concerns everyone frankly,” Pertl said. 
Even with the politicization of the issue, Pertl expressed confidence in Wisconsin’s system. 
The Wisconsin Shares program is a subsidy program for low-income families where funds are paid to parents on an EBT card that is then used to pay a child care provider. According to the agency, this program is the main way that federal child care funding is utilized in Wisconsin. There is also some funding that goes towards quality improvement for programs, training and technical assistance.
Pertl said January payments have already gone out to families and he said he doesn’t expect any issues with February payments or other future payments. 
“People are using them. Folks should have confidence in the system,” Pertl said. “We’re likely to see an increase, maybe, in reporting requirements, but our system is well positioned to be able to meet those and continue to move forward. It may be administratively burdensome, and maybe more paperwork and things we’ve got to collect, but we’re confident that our system, particularly because of its unique history, is probably one of the best systems in the country for being able to navigate some of the questions that are coming in.” 
Wisconsin dealt with significant fraud involving improper payments a decade ago, which led to the state beefing up its accountability measures. 
A 2009 Pulitzer prize-winning investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel uncovered fraud within the WisconsinShares program that led to criminal indictments and prompted the state to implement protections. 
An audit that year by the Legislative Audit Bureau found there was an estimated $16.7 to $18.5 million in improper subsidy payments made and child care providers were estimated to have received an additional $4 million in improper subsidy payments as a result of errors or fraudulent reporting.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), who was in the Legislature at the time, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in December that he remembers the work that was undertaken to address the issue in 2009. 
“I want to definitely make sure it’s not happening again,” Vos said. He noted that he hasn’t heard of specific examples of fraud happening, but he doesn’t “want to assume that it’s not.”
Gov. Tony Evers also told reporters this week that Wisconsin is “in a good place.” 
“There’s lots of auditing going on… so I think we’re in a great place,” he said. 
Some of the reforms that the state has adopted relating to ensuring proper payments include expanding program integrity staff, improving attendance tracking and reporting, implementing fingerprint background checks, expanding the list of crimes that prohibit someone from running  a child care center, adopting YoungStar, which is the quality rating system in the state, and moving to using EBT cards. 
The state has also passed laws to allow DCF to collect money from providers if they go out of business and to suspend or revoke licenses and subsidy payments to people previously convicted of crimes relating to the operation of a business. 
Those measures can help ensure accountability.
“How do you know when it’s fraud? How do you know when a kid just stopped showing up?” Pertl asked. “When we do the licensing visit or get a tip or we’re checking the enrollment and attendance records, if there’s discrepancies… that’s going to trigger a review. It might trigger a claw-back and recovery of money.”
Wisconsin DCF also maintains a list on its website of child care centers that have been suspended or terminated from the WisconsinShares program. 
The federal government conducts monitoring checks every three years. In recent years, Wisconsin has had a low payment error rate. In 2023, the last time the check happened, Wisconsin’s error rate was 2.9%. In 2020, it was 1.81% and in 2017, it was 4.35%. In 2013, the error rate was 18.84%. 
Pertl noted that the changes made by the state were a bipartisan effort under the administrations of former Govs. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, and Scott Walker, a Republican. 
“There are certainly some very significant issues going on in Minnesota and there is no question that the president politicizes this for an agenda and targets folks for it,” Pertl said. “I think what you’ve seen [Gov. Evers] say and what you see Wisconsin leaders doing is showing that we have a strong system that has navigated these issues, that has high integrity, that addresses these things when they come, and so we’re confident about our ability to continue to run a robust and great child care system.”

Jim Pillen. Dec. 27, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations. 
State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.
In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.
Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”
Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815. 
That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty. 
According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”
“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”
Contracting with GSD
Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.
Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed. 
It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.
The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.
DED leaders did not know firm
State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Ak-sar-ben ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.
To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites. 
Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell. 
The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.
Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”
Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.
Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office. 
“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said. 
Contract facts
Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts. 
Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself. 
From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.
Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate. 
Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.
Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration. 
Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.” 
Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.” 
“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.
The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.
Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds
Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans. 
The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area. 
Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital. 
Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.
Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.
Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show. 
Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.
The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive. 
“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”
Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Questions about DG Fuels
Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.
The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.
Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email. 
Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.
Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities. 
Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.
DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”
“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.
Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.
“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”
Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.
But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024. 
The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.
The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.
But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.
Contract obligations questioned
Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.
Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.
The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.
In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.

Though dissatisfaction with the agency has been brewing for years, Gov. Gordon says he'll fight to preserve the state's primary economic development shop.
The post Stakeholders contemplate demise of Wyoming Business Council appeared first on WyoFile .","The fate of the Wyoming Business Council remains unclear following the Joint Appropriations Committee’s vote this week to defund the state’s primary economic development shop.
The committee informally agreed to consider sponsoring a bill that would presumably dismantle the Business Council statutorily. But the bill draft, as of Wednesday, had not been made public, and it’s unclear how far such an effort might go to reconfigure or reassign state economic development programs.
The legislative budget session begins Feb. 9.
If the Business Council is dismantled without a replacement, Wyoming might be the only state in the nation without a state-level economic development agency, proponents of the organization warned.
Though Gov. Mark Gordon said the committee’s defunding action “can be reversed during the full legislative session,” some economic development professionals say they’re prepared to work with the Legislature to reimagine how the state moves forward without the Business Council.

“It is clear that parts of the current economic development framework are not working as intended,” Wyoming Association of Municipalities Executive Director Ashley Harpstreith said in a statement to WyoFile. “Local economic development is ultimately about building and sustaining communities where businesses can locate, grow and remain competitive. That work starts with infrastructure and community readiness, not solely with programs or initiatives.”
Top of mind, according to Harpstreith and others who spoke with WyoFile, is maintaining vital programs like the Small Business Development Center, jointly administered by the Business Council and University of Wyoming.
“The most effective statewide economic development is going to have to prioritize empowering communities with the tools and resources they need to be ready for opportunity,” Harpstreith said.
The Business Council directly employs 38 full-time workers and two part-time workers, with an annual benefit and payroll of $5,894,845, according to the agency.
Council criticism
Dissatisfaction with the Business Council has been stewing for years, another economic development professional told WyoFile. The organization’s particular shortcomings, they said, depend on who you ask.
“We’re not finished yet. The full Legislature is going to come in, and they’ll have a conversation.”Amy Edmonds, Gov. Gordon’s office
The agency does not help everyone who comes knocking at its door, Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell has testified to Wyoming lawmakers. Through an application process, the agency chooses from a pool of applicants with legitimate needs for state help. The appearance of picking winners and losers has made Dorrell “unpopular” in some Wyoming communities, he’s said.
In August, for example, Dorrell pitched a proposal to a legislative committee to increase the mandatory dollar match for the Business Ready Community grant and loan program from a varied scale to a flat 25%. The “controversial” move, he said, was intended to concentrate state dollars in communities that demonstrated the most bang for the state’s buck. It also aligned with what Dorrell perceived lawmakers were asking of the Business Council, he said. Intrinsically, the move would exclude communities that couldn’t afford the higher match. It was a tradeoff that, “from an economic standpoint,” Dorrell said, made sense.
The Legislature’s Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee declined to take up the measure.

But frustration with the council extends beyond any one particular program, Harpstreith said. Essentially, the organization has become too bureaucratic to effectively connect with businesses and communities.
“Over time, emphasis has leaned toward programming and administrative approaches, while flexible, direct investment in infrastructure and community development has not kept pace,” Harpstreith said. “What is missing is consistent, meaningful partnership around infrastructure and community-level capital. Without that foundation, even well-designed programs struggle to produce real, lasting economic outcomes.”
If not the Business Council, what?
If the Business Council is eliminated without a replacement, Wyoming — technically — might be the only state in the nation without a state-level economic development agency, according to several sources.
But that distinction comes with a lot of nuance.
“[Economic development] work starts with infrastructure and community readiness, not solely with programs or initiatives.”Ashley Harpstreith, Wyoming Association of Municipalities
Wyoming, like every state, would still rely on various federal agencies such as the U.S. Economic Development Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which help meet myriad needs, including rural development, housing and food security. Other federal agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency, offer funding for water systems.
In terms of other “homegrown” economic development agencies in the Cowboy State, there is the Wyoming Energy Authority, which administers things like the Energy Matching Funds program.
The Office of State Lands and Investments is also integral to many aspects of economic development. Somewhat unique to Wyoming, the office’s Mineral Royalty Grants program — funded via a stream of revenue from coal, oil and natural gas royalty payments — used to be a powerhouse source to help communities meet infrastructure needs. But the program has shrunk in pace with decreasing mineral revenue payments.
For now, Gordon is not entertaining the potential demise of the Business Council or concepts of how Wyoming might forge ahead without the organization.
“The governor wouldn’t have made the recommendations he did if he didn’t support economic development and the Wyoming Business Council,” his Communications Director Amy Edmonds told reporters during a Wednesday briefing.
“We’re not finished yet. The full Legislature is going to come in, and they’ll have a conversation,” Edmonds said.

Renee Nicole Good's killing in Minneapolis compelled columnist David Romtvedt to ask, what is the place of poetry in a troubled society?
The post Poetry and the news appeared first on WyoFile .","I was working as a planning and budget analyst for the State of Illinois when I received notification that I’d been accepted into the Washington State Artist in Residence program. This was the beginning of my work in K-12 schools helping young people write poetry. I also worked in a Senior Center where we started a poetry workshop with 10 senior citizens and 10 high school sophomores. I don’t know which group felt more nervous about the other. I watched them come to understand one another better, write more insightfully, and gain in both critical capacity and compassion.

Opinion

It was very moving and yet something nagged at me: I worried that poetry was trivial. No one much reads it. And what good does it do? William Carlos Williams said, “It is difficult to get the news from poems, yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.” 
OK, but poetry feeds no hungry families. Poetry cures no disease. It ends no war. Williams was a doctor as well as a poet. Perhaps I should have been a lawyer. That’s what I thought. I was young. But I stuck with poetry and have written and published it now for 50 years. It’s too late for the law.
In the past few days, following the shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman, I’ve thought again about the place of poetry in a troubled society. Ms. Good, poet, mother, citizen is now dead. As a student at Old Dominion University, Ms. Good received the Associated Writing Program poetry prize. Her award was for “On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs,” a poem about the struggle to understand the place where science and faith meet. The narrator has donated Bibles to thrift stores, both the Bibles “plucked from street corners from the meaty hands of zealots” and those that don’t go by the name Bible, those with “the slick rubber smell of high gloss biology textbook pictures; they burned the hairs inside my nostrils.” 
In high school biology class, I too was asked to dissect fetal animals and I too struggled to find where the soul resides. In Ms. Good’s poem, it’s “maybe there in between my pancreas and large intestine.” She called it the “piddly brook of my soul.” As the poet does, I too asked if faith and science could exist together: “this fickle faith and this college science that heckles from the back of the classroom.”
When I was a student at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I submitted a poem for the Associated Writing Program competition. This was at the end of the Vietnam War. We were scarred by President Nixon’s lies and torn apart by both violent and nonviolent protests. National Guard troops had shot and killed students at Kent State University, while the police had shot and killed students at Jackson State University. My poem tried to stay away from politics. I didn’t win the prize, but did receive an honorable mention. I was just happy to be done with the war. 
Now here’s Renee Nicole Good, shot dead in her car by ICE agents going door to door trying to round up people who may or may not be undocumented residents of the U.S., who may or may not have committed a crime. 
I’ve watched several videos taken by both ICE agents and bystanders. It’s clear Ms. Good was neither threatening nor attacking anyone. As she backs up, an ICE agent grabs the driver’s side door of the car, saying, “Get out of the fucking car.” Another agent steps around in front of the car from the passenger’s to the driver’s side. Moving forward, Ms. Good turns to the right, away from this second agent, who pulls his gun and fires one shot through the windshield. As the car continues to turn away from him, he fires two more shots through the driver’s side window. Ms. Good’s car then crashes into the back of a nearby parked car. A bystander runs toward the scene; ICE agents look around, offering no aid. Then the agent who shot Ms. Good walks to the crashed car and, after a few seconds, turns back, telling his colleagues to call 911. Another bystander, his hands raised above his head, speaks:
“Can I go check a pulse?”
“No. Back up. Now.”
“I’m a physician.”
“I don’t care.”
That’s the poem of the day. In poetry, irony is a widely used writer’s device. Only it’s usually not so brutal.

The post Keeping the Republic: Franklin’s test for modern Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","As a small-town newspaper publisher, I’ve always considered it my mission to shine light on local government because I firmly believe citizens have a fundamental right to know what their government is doing for them — or to them. That principle is non-negotiable for those who understand the value of an informed citizenry and the importance of accountability for elected officials.

Opinion

Over the past year, the Wyoming Press Association proposed a draft bill to close loopholes in the Wyoming Public Records Act and make it more likely that officials who abuse the law will face consequences. We lobbied aggressively for this measure, and in November, the Legislature’s Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee voted 13–0 to sponsor the bill for the session that begins next month. That rare unanimous endorsement sends a clear message that lawmakers recognize something needs to change.
As we pushed for reforms to deter secrecy, we readily acknowledged that many local governments already go above and beyond to keep citizens informed. These leaders don’t just follow the law — they embrace it. They welcome scrutiny, communicate openly and treat transparency as a public service, but they were not being recognized for it.
That’s why the Wyoming Press Association created the Benjamin Franklin Award for Open Government. This monthly recognition honors Wyoming’s most transparent local governments. Awards will be given through 2026 in conjunction with the state’s observance of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This honor highlights agencies that partner with their local press and make good faith efforts to share information, conduct public business in the open and empower citizens.
The award is named for the pioneering printer and publisher who famously declared to citizens that he and the other Founding Fathers had created “a republic, if you can keep it.” Franklin’s warning indicated that citizens would have to be informed and engaged if the new republic was to survive, and that admonition is as true for Wyoming today as it was for the United States nearly 250 years ago.
The first recipient of the Ben Franklin Award is Converse County, whose officials were nominated by Matt Adelman, publisher of the Douglas Budget and Glenrock Independent. He cited their consistent and proactive approach to informing the public — from publishing more public notices than legally required to using multiple forms of media to update residents regularly on projects like major roadwork.
Converse County provides a model for how government can work with the media to keep citizens in the loop, and our intent is that their recognition will inspire others. We hope that transparency will prove to be contagious, but we remain certain that recognition alone will not change Wyoming’s culture when it comes to open government. That’s why we will continue to push for legislation that promises to close existing loopholes and introduce real consequences for bad actors.
This two-pronged effort will allow us to both celebrate the good and deter the bad, and we encourage statewide associations that serve local governments — like the Wyoming Association of Municipalities, Wyoming County Commissioners Association, and Wyoming School Boards Association — to partner with us in motivating their members to commit to greater transparency. We encourage them to nominate officials or boards who are “doing it right” for this recognition, and the Wyoming Press Association welcomes the chance to hold open conversations with their boards, share best practices or make presentations about transparency to their members.
We believe the most meaningful way for Wyoming to celebrate 250 years of “keeping the republic” is by renewing and reinforcing our shared commitment to informing and empowering the state’s residents to be more engaged citizens and more knowledgeable voters. This award is obviously a “carrot” meant to move local governments in that direction, but it will ultimately be meaningless and ineffective if the corresponding “stick” isn’t created to encourage compliance with the state’s open government laws. That will be up to the Legislature, and we encourage citizens to let their representatives know that transparency and accountability are important to them.

(Photo by PeopleImages/Getty Images)Indiana’s Senate Education Committee on Wednesday advanced two bills aimed at reshaping how young Hoosiers interact with technology — one that would restrict minors’ access to social media platforms and another that would require schools to strengthen technology plans and give parents greater control over at-home device use.
Senate Bill 199, authored by committee chair Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, passed the panel 11-2 and was recommitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it must be approved before moving to the full chamber.
Democrats Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, and Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, were the only “no” votes against the social media.
The measure contains multiple provisions, but a highly-discussed section would substantially restrict minors’ access to social media. Under the proposal, social media companies like Meta would be required to obtain written parental permission before a minor under age 18 could create an account.
A bill with similar social media restriction language passed the Senate in the 2025 session but ultimately stalled in the House.

Supporters argued in committee that the bill is a response to growing concerns over social media’s impact on children’s mental health and school environments. 
Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner emphasized the toll she said social media is taking on students across Hoosier schools.
“For most of us in the room, social media arrived when we were already well into adulthood,” Jenner said, adding that “our children growing up today do not have that same luxury” of a childhood free from constant comparison, cyberbullying, algorithm-driven content and addictive features.
But critics raised concerns about enforcement, privacy and rights of students. 
Samantha Bresnahan with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, for example, argued that such restrictions could infringe on minors’ constitutional rights and require intrusive data collection to verify age and consent.
Parents get more say
Senate Bill 159, authored by Sen. Spencer Deery, R-West Lafayette, takes a different tack on technology.
The measure, which passed the education committee 12-1, would require Indiana’s traditional public and charter schools to include in their technology plans a description of how they will enable parents to exercise control over school-provided devices when they are not in school and strengthen internet use and wireless communication policies.
If approved, schools must adopt policies by Jan. 1, 2027, that would let parents increase the strength of content filters on school-issued devices and limit the time students can use those devices outside school hours. The bill also directs schools to prohibit use of school equipment “for noneducational purposes during instructional time.”

Hunley was the lone vote against the proposal.
“I think that our school boards can already do this if they would like to,” she said. “I’m a big fan of home rule and local control, and I think that the level of government that’s closest to the school building should be the one to make this decision and enact this policy, not the state.”
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, voted in favor but urged additional consideration of how parental controls might apply during e-learning days. 
“We talked about the parental controls on an e-learning day, that (parents) may not want a YouTube video or a TikTok or pick-your-poison that may be used in structure for the educational experience,” she told Deery. “I just encourage you to look into that.”
Democrats also pressed for clarity on potential costs to schools. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, asked whether districts might need to spend money to implement stronger parental controls. 
Deery said his office could not identify any examples where Hoosier schools would take on additional costs because most already contract with vendors that offer such functionality. “
We’ve yet to find any institution that does not have a contract with a vendor that does not offer this,” he said. “I’ve confirmed with virtually all of the major vendors. So, I’m not aware of (any costs schools would incur).”

After five decades of protecting North Idaho’s forests and water, the Kootenai Environmental Alliance has a new focus: making climate change feel local.
Over the past year, KEA has ramped up efforts to translate abstract climate data into terms North Idaho residents can see and act on. The strategy includes publishing local climate impact reports, partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe on environmental education and launching creative community events — including a film series.
“After explaining carbon fee and dividend a dozen times only to see people’s eyes roll, I realized, it’s got to be local. People have to see the impacts for it to resonate,” said Dave Muise, KEA board president.

Founded in 1972 and incorporated as a nonprofit in 1974, KEA is Idaho’s oldest nonprofit conservation group. For more than 50 years it has worked to protect the region’s land and water as development pressures increased, challenging illegal timber sales and influencing land-use planning.
Now the organization is focusing on climate conservancy, advocacy and education — and finding new ways to make the case for action.
 Local data, local impact

The centerpiece of KEA’s climate education effort is the Coeur d’Alene Climate Adaptation Project, published in May 2024 by KEA’s Climate Action Team. The report documents rising temperatures in Coeur d’Alene at a rate that cannot be explained by natural cycles.
“It can be explained by including human impact on our environment, specifically the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting increase in greenhouse gas concentrations (GHG) in our atmosphere,” Muise said.
Coeur d’Alene is not an anomaly; globally, the three hottest years on record since temperature tracking began in 1850 are 2024, 2023 and 2025. Kicking 2016 out of the top three.
Climate data can often feel abstract — until its impact is made clear on a local level.
While living in northern California, Muise was introduced to the Citizens’ Climate Lobby, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy climate change organization focused on national policies to address the national and global climate crisis. He liked the idea of taking action as a country by putting a tax on carbon emissions. Muise, a former nuclear engineer who spent 30 years in telecom equipment, resonates with climate policy on a national level, and the numbers behind it.
Muise said the Coeur d’Alene Climate Adaptation Project was inspired in part by the idea that people are more likely to change their behavior when they can see the impacts of climate change in their own communities.
The CCAP report specifically looked at the impacts of climate change already occurring in their hometown. The report includes historical data and future projections.
“There are two things that probably resonate the most with people. One is the chart. There’s a temperature chart that has kind of a worst case scenario in red, and then a best case scenario in blue, and then we’re going to end up somewhere in there. Do we know where? No, it just ain’t good no matter what,” Muise said.
The second are the trickle down impacts. Muise said when people hear that the temperature in Coeur d’Alene has risen a couple degrees, most think, “big frickin deal,” but in the CCAP they are faced with the direct impact.
For example, more of the region’s precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow. As snowpack shrinks, runoff comes earlier and rivers and lakes warm, increasing the risk of drought and wildfires and placing added pressure on agriculture. Warmer waters also fuel toxic algae blooms, an issue Coeur d’Alene Lake knows well, while exposing a more unique threat.
“As oxygen levels drop, heavy metals from legacy mining in lake sediments can go back into solution in the water. Put it all together … hotter summer days; warmer streams, rivers, and lakes; a greater risk of harmful algae blooms; heavy metals in the water; threats to fisheries; and more wildfire smoke — and it all threatens our tourism economy, which drives the local economy,” Muise said.

Muise presented the findings of the CCAP report during the first North Idaho Green Summit in 2024.
“After that, I was invited to join the KEA board,” Muise said.
In their current work they continue to focus on protecting natural resources, climate conservancy, advocacy and education. They’ve put this into practice while collaborating and learning from other local groups.
 Kootenai Environmental Alliance and the Coeur d’Alene Tribe work together through advocacy

Work between KEA and the Coeur d’Alene Tribe has taken place through education, policy and public outreach events surrounding the environment and more specifically Coeur d’Alene Lake. Caj Matheson is the natural resources director for the Coeur d’Alene Tribe. He said KEA has been able to help bring in singers and speakers for these joint events.

“That’s been really helpful on our side because that is a goal for us, to get our message out there. We want to make sure that our lake and our environment as a whole is protected and taken care of,” Matheson said.
Muise also notes how the collaboration has been helpful to KEA’s Climate Action Team. Muise and the Climate Action Team drove down to Plummer, Idaho, to learn more about sustainable energy utilized by the Tribe for its senior housing.
“We actually went down to Plummer, Idaho, and visited with Laura Laumatia — she’s involved in climate resiliency — and it was super nice to see right where she works there are solar panels on the roof. What really intrigued me was each apartment had its own heat pump, which is considerably more efficient, providing both heat and air conditioning,” Muise said.
One of KEA’s focuses includes narrowing in on smaller lakes around the region.
“What really is being impacted is the smaller lakes, and KEA is in the process of trying to work with some of the watershed commissions. An issue that we have is watershed commissions are primarily made up of people who own property around a lake. What we don’t have is these associations talking to each other, working together,” Muise said.
Muise said that this work can often be a double-edged sword: bringing awareness to declining lake health.
“Yes, the current homeowners are very aware of it, but do they want to sing it from the rafters? No, because it might affect their property values. So they don’t want to talk about it, or they don’t want to talk about it as much as I would think they would want to,” Muise said.
Despite some resistance, KEA will be kicking off the Small Lakes Commission in the spring.
 Kootenai Environmental Alliance engages community with creative events 

KEA has come up with creative ways to connect with the community. One such event is its annual Junk2Funk fundraising event. It’s a fashion show event where all of the outfits must be at least 80% garbage.
Janet Torline, KEA board vice president, came up with the idea years ago. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was slow to come back, and took a few cancellations before restarting in 2024.
Junk2Funk 2025 was held on Oct. 18, 2025. “Artists were asked to focus their works on Air, Fire, Water and Earth,” Cynthia Rozyla, board director and treasurer said. (Photo by Gen Heywood/FāVS News)
The event is organized by a dedicated committee, which has grown in membership as the event regained momentum post-pandemic. Each year the group selects a distinct event theme. Board Director and Treasurer Cynthia Rozyla is the event’s committee chair and main organizer.
Rozyla said the first year after the pandemic the event resumed, they had to focus on just jumping back in. Then on Oct. 18, 2025, KEA had their second Junk2Funk event post-pandemic. The event’s theme was “The Elements” where artists were asked to focus their works on Air, Fire, Water and Earth.
KEA uses the funding from these events toward the organization’s expenses. This includes conservation initiatives for lakes and forests, educational programs for students and the broader community, organizing events and building partnerships with other regional environmental organizations.
Another event offered for the first time in early November was the Green Screen Series & Eco Film Forum. Three panelists spoke after the film’s completion, one of which was Aiyanna James, climate resilience coordinator for the Coeur d’Alene Tribe.
Muise said he chose a relatively positive film in part because he fears like-minded people who support climate action are discouraged.
“That’s what I want to fight. If I can stop three people from being demoralized, I will feel that it’s been a success.”
The film series event featured “Trashed,” a documentary about wasteful human consumerism, its negative impact, and how around the world waste reduction is, and can be, successfully achieved. The event took place on Jan. 10 at 2 p.m. in the Community Room at Coeur d’Alene Public Library.

(Photo: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)Seven years ago, the revelation that Tennessee had stockpiled $732 million earmarked for low-income Tennessee families drew a near-universal outcry that united fiscal conservatives and progressive advocates in questioning the state’s spending decisions.
On Wednesday, leaders of the Tennessee Department of Human Services told lawmakers that the state’s reserve for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, now stands at $305 million with a plan in place to expend the excess funds. 
TANF is a federal block grant program that delivers dollars to each state to provide temporary financial assistance and programs such as job training and child care to families that have fallen on hard times. Tennessee receives $191 million annually. 
Years after public outcry over unspent funds for needy families, Tennessee has $717M stockpile

After years of underspending the funding, Tennessee had accrued the $732 million balance, dwarfing nearly every other state in the nation and prompting lawmakers to enact legislation requiring expenditures of the funding by the end of 2026. The legislature also enacted a law setting a ceiling of $191 million for TANF reserves.
Clarence Carter, who leads the Tennessee Department of Human Services, told lawmakers the state had successfully implemented a plan to spend down the funds after distributing millions to seven community based organizations that implemented pilot projects intended to break generational cycles of poverty. 
The agency now spends all of its annual federal allotment each year, Carter said. Funds not spent directly to aid needy families are now offered as grants to nonprofits. Last year, the agency directed $27 million of its $191 million TANF grant to nonprofits.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/grocery-cart.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Helena Moreno enters the New Orleans mayor’s office with a mandate by winning 55% of the vote in the primary and defeating a large slate of candidates without a runoff. Due to her electoral success, there is a great deal of hope that her administration will improve the delivery of city services, fix the streets and other infrastructure, attract new jobs and investment to the city and stop the outmigration of residents. However, the new administration will need to overcome several challenges to achieve these objectives.
The first challenge will be the budget. The original budget submitted to the council at the end of 2025 had an estimated $222 million deficit. Mayor LaToya Cantrell proposed to balance the budget with 30 percent across the board cuts. Moreno and her colleagues on the council instead chose to balance the budget with a series of department mergers, layoffs, furloughs, and strategic service reductions.
The council passed the current $1.6 billion operating budget by overriding a Cantrell veto. While the budget is balanced, the process of surgical cutting necessary to balance it means that the new mayor will have fewer employees and less money to spend. To keep her plan of hiring 100 additional street workers to fill potholes, she will need to shift money from other programs.
In addition to road repairs, the Moreno 100-day plan calls for improving basic city services and infrastructure such as garbage pick-up, streetlights and storm drains. Funding those priorities will require reductions in funding for lower priorities, which will cause some pain for the residents who depend on those lower priority programs. Residents should prepare for some austerity measures for the first year of the administration until the budget stabilizes.

The second challenge will be continuing the public safety improvements the city has achieved during the last three years. The city has seen a reduction in homicides for the last three years and ended 2025 with its lowest number of homicides in 50 years. The NOPD also has recently been released from its nearly 13-year federal consent decree. While the NOPD experienced these successes, it continues to struggle with retaining police officers and currently around 900 officers, far below the department’s official goal of 1,200. As the city moves into Carnival season, followed by festival season, it will need money to make sure residents and tourists are protected.
The third challenge is the upcoming session of the Louisiana State Legislature in March. In addition to regular funding requests the city makes to the state for capital outlay money for infrastructure, and resources for port operations, Moreno will ask for structural changes to the Sewerage & Water Board. She wants to change its technical status from a state-regulated agency to a city agency and remove state authority. Previous bills reforming the structure of the Sewerage & Water Board have not fared well, but this is a new session, and the devil is in the details of the bill.
The fourth challenge will be an attractive economic development plan. The city cannot cut its way out of the budget crisis. It must grow its way out of the budget crisis by increasing revenue. Since the voters are opposed to new sales or property taxes, the only feasible way to increase revenue is to attract new jobs and new residents to the city. Low-hanging fruit in this process would be streamlining the safety and permits office to make it easier for new business to get licensed.
Attracting new business to the city is a multi-year effort and will not happen in the first 100 days. However, the beginning of a new mayor’s term is the period when potential investors will have their eyes on the city. Moreno will need to roll out an attractive comprehensive economic development plan during the first 100 days to immediately catch the attention of anyone thinking about investing in the city. She needs to communicate that the business climate in the city has fundamentally changed for the better.
Moreno has said that she will know she is achieving success when current residents stop leaving the city, and the population grows as new residents move in. Growing the population will take more than the efficient delivery of services. The biggest challenge will be creating a diverse economy with high-paying jobs that make the city a more attractive place to work and live.

Jan. 13, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAt his speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced that he would cut federal funding to any state or city with sanctuary policies.
“Starting February 1, we’re not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens and it breeds fraud, crime and all of the other problems that come, so we’re not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities,” Trump said.  
According to the Department of Justice, only one Michigan jurisdiction — the city of East Lansing — is designated as a sanctuary city. However, the Center for Immigration Studies, an anti-immigration think tank lists six Michigan counties — Kalamazoo, Leelanau, Muskegon, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties —as having some level of sanctuary policies as well.

Trump did not further explain the funding cuts — exactly what money would be cut and how the decision on which jurisdictions would lose funding were not clear in the speech.  
Someone who is familiar with funding threats from Trump is Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who has filed, or joined in, more than 40 lawsuits suing the federal government in some capacity.
“We’ve filed lawsuits where we can, and predominantly we’ve been successful on that front,” Nessel said following a roundtable in East Lansing on Wednesday. “It’s these broad strokes executive orders that really don’t carry the weight of the law.”
This is not the first attempt by the Trump administration to limit or place stipulations on federal funding — at the end of 2025, his administration announced that states would be required to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers in order to get those dollars, as well as limiting access to SNAP funding based on error rates. And Attorney General Dana Nessel has sued the administration over two separate grant stipulations — for Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Transportation funding — that would have imposed immigration enforcement requirements on states.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)An East Baton Rouge Parish judge is expected to rule as soon as this week on whether to dismiss a two-year-old lawsuit against the state of Louisiana over a 2023 law that bans medical professionals from providing transgender health care for minors, following a U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a similar law in Tennessee.
In January 2024, five Louisiana teenagers and their families sued the state to block Act 466, which had gone into effect after the state legislature voted to override then-Gov. John Bel Edwards’ veto of the legislation. In their initial complaint, they argued that the ban interferes with parents’ ability to make health decisions for their children and unlawfully denies trans kids access to necessary medical care on the basis of their sex, violating the rights of privacy and equal protection under the law that are guaranteed in the Louisiana Constitution.
But that was before the June 2025 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in U.S. v. Skrmetti, which upheld a Tennessee law banning the use of puberty blockers and hormone replacement in treating youth who have gender dysphoria. Transgender youth and adults, their friends and families and a variety of LGBTQIA+ and civil rights groups decried the ruling and many warned that it would result in a worsening in the mental health of trans youths and that it could lead to a nationwide ban on providing treatment to both minors and adults.
“Our plaintiffs, like a lot of people, were profoundly disappointed in the Supreme Court in their decision in Skrmetti,” said Nicholas Hite, a senior attorney at the LGBTQIA+ organization Lambda Legal. Despite the unfavorable ruling in Skrmetti — which addressed questions of federal constitutionality — the plaintiffs, who are listed in the suit under pseudonyms to protect their privacy, have continued their push to have Act 466 ruled unconstitutional as a matter of state law.

The case was originally filed in Orleans Civil District Court, but the state successfully argued in the months after the lawsuit was filed to have it transferred to the 19th Judicial District Court in Baton Rouge, whose jurisdiction includes the state capitol.
The case has been slowly moving through the pretrial process since, held up in part by a back-and-forth over discovery requests to Murrill’s office. When it was moving through the legislature in 2023, attorneys in the office — headed at the time by now-Gov. Jeff Landry — analyzed the bill, vetting it for whether it would pass constitutional muster. Plaintiffs’ attorneys sought to find out about those discussions, which Murrill claimed at first were not subject to disclosure.

Then last August, Murrill’s office filed a motion for dismissal, arguing that the case should be thrown out due to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Skrmetti, arguing that the court ordered lower courts to mind the ruling.
Hite told Verite News that despite the ruling in Skrmetti, the plaintiffs have a case against the state of Louisiana because they are making claims that rights granted to them by the state constitution — not the federal constitution, which is the purview of the U.S. Supreme Court —  are being violated. Ezra Young, a trans rights scholar and lawyer, said that was a smart move by the attorneys for the plaintiffs.
“They have a few state constitutional claims. So that would be wise, because the U.S. Supreme Court has no say on what the constitution of another state means or says. So that hasn’t been foreclosed by Skrmetti,” he said.
Judge Ronald R. Johnson, who is presiding over the case, delayed ruling on the motion so that both sides could finish discovery, but he’ll hear arguments on whether to dismiss the case on Thursday.
‘Unworkable in practice
In late July, after a year of repeated attempts to try to get the AG’s office to comply with their requests for information during the discovery phase of the case, Hite, on behalf of the plaintiffs in the case, asked Johnson to hold Murrill in contempt of court. Hite said at the time that the AG’s office had roughly 170 pages of documents that could be relevant to the case that they did not want to hand over to the plaintiffs.
According to court records, the AG’s office had been claiming for months that they had turned over all relevant records that they could, and that any records they hadn’t turned over were privileged and not subject to disclosure.
The plaintiffs’ legal team, which includes Hite and New Orleans local civil rights attorney William Most, were trying to understand the intent of public officials who were pushing to get the law passed while the bill was moving its way through the legislature.
“There’s not anything in there that I think either of us anticipate to be ultimately determinative in this case,” Hite said. “But they would still be useful so that we can get a full idea of what kinds of conversations were going on inside of our government as they were preparing and passing this legislation.”
The attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
Although Johnson eventually denied the motion for contempt, he also ordered the AG’s office to release dozens of records over the following months Included in those exhibits are emails between staffers in the AG’s office, peer-reviewed studies on trans health care, and a copy of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s standards of care.
Among the documents was a previously confidential legislative analysis of the youth trans health care ban as it was moving its way through the state legislature. The analysis was completed by Joe Donahue, who was an assistant attorney general during Landry’s term as AG.
Donahue wrote that the bill, which mandates that professional licensing boards revoke the licenses of health care workers who provide trans health care to minors for at least two years, could make state medical licensing boards targets for federal civil rights claims.
“The statutes would also likely be unworkable in practice,” he wrote later, adding that implementation of the law “would create conflicts with existing standards of conduct imposed upon certain professions leaving practitioners with no clear means of compliance and potentially subjecting them to additional liability.”
Sisyphean task
Natalie Rupp, executive director of Trans Income Project, said that before the Skrmetti decision, it was promising to know that there was a legal challenge against Louisiana’s youth trans health care ban.
“It was exciting to have something at our state level that could help define and decide what the rights for trans youth were here,” she said.
But her optimism shifted after the Supreme Court’s ruling, which guaranteed that the legality of trans health care bans would have to be decided on a patchwork, state-by-state basis, similar to what has happened with abortion since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
“It became very clear that while having a remedy for … this type of case could be helpful, this ‘return to the state’s model,’ the same way they did with abortion, really just disenfranchises anyone who lives in conservative states,” she said.
Still, she said, it’s important to try to stand up to bigotry despite the odds of losing.

“Being in trans politics right now is like being Sisyphus, where we are constantly pushing an uphill battle that we know we’re going to take huge losses on,” she said. “But we also know we’re going to keep pushing the boulder back up the hill every single time, because our lives matter, and it is essential that we keep doing the work.”
Hite took a similar long view of the work needed to try to secure rights not just for transgender youth, but all LGBTQIA+ people. Before joining Lambda Legal, he spent a decade in private practice fighting for the rights of LGBTQIA+ Louisianians.
“My entire legal experience has been devoted and built around the idea that the most marginalized among us deserve robust representation in court. Robust representation in court means that things don’t usually happen quickly. You know, when you’re fighting a whole system, when you’re fighting a whole government. It takes time.”
He said that if the judge rules in favor of the AG’s office on Thursday, the plaintiffs will likely appeal the decision.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)A child in West Virginia foster care was injured while living in an Airbnb short-term rental property after the state placed the minor there.
“The child injured in the Airbnb property received appropriate medical care and is doing well, and the situation is being addressed in accordance with state law and child welfare policy,” Angelica Hightower, spokesperson for the state Department of Human Services, confirmed to West Virginia Watch in an email. 
DoHS is using Airbnb short-term rental properties to house foster children because West Virginia doesn’t have enough foster homes or appropriate facilities for kids in the child welfare system. 
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia foster care.
There are currently 17 foster children living in Airbnb properties and hotels, according to DoHS.
“DoHS occasionally uses Airbnbs, as temporary placements when appropriate,” Hightower said. “These settings can provide a more home-like environment, additional space and access to basic amenities such as kitchens and laundry facilities, which can be especially helpful for youth who need stability and comfort during transitional periods.”
Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, who has pressed DoHS to end the use of hotels for foster children, said Wednesday he wasn’t aware that the state had been using Airbnb rental properties to house kids. 
“It is important for the Legislature and the executive branch to have a clear picture of children who are being housed in foster placements, children who are being housed in kinship placements, and children who are being housed in any other situation outside of those two traditional family settings,” Pinson said. He and his wife are foster parents who have adopted children through fostering. 
“We, the Legislature and DoHS, want families and children to do better. That’s the goal,” Pinson said. “But until we get to that goal, we have to make sure that we’re being responsive to the obstacles that DoHS is facing, which means we have to have a clear picture.”
Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, also wasn’t aware that West Virginia foster children were being housed in Airbnbs.










I was not aware of that going on. I am aware that the system has been broken for more than a decade... 


– Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell


“I was not aware of that going on,” he said. “I am aware that the system has been broken for more than a decade, and so I would expect the agency to treat the situation as is — at a critical stage now where kids certainly can’t be left like this. I expect (DoHS) and the administration to immediately pull the fire alarm and address what we’re seeing here.”
Hightower added that, “DoHS continually reviews safety protocols for all placements and remains focused on the health, well-being and safety of every child in its care.”
DoHS spent part of 2025 under a court monitor to address issues related to foster children temporarily living in hotels and 4-H camps in Kanawha County. Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Maryclaire Akers ordered the monitor after learning that a foster child involved in a case in her court had attempted suicide in a hotel.
In November, WCHS reported that DoHS had updated its temporary lodging of children policy to require that staff notify the judge and treatment team within 24 hours of any child’s attempted suicide or other medical emergencies resulting in medical attention or call to law enforcement. 
Additionally, DoHS changed its policy to include that all children in lodging have two staff on duty for supervision. 
Pinson said that the use of Airbnbs presents similar concerns as the state’s use of hotels for children.
“All of those same concerns still exist in renting an Airbnb in order to place a foster child, even if it’s just for temporary placement,” he said.
Woelfel called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey and DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer to immediately create a committee to look at “how bad the situation is” in West Virginia’s foster care system.
Lawmakers prioritize foster care reform as system still in crisis
As state lawmakers gaveled in Wednesday for the 60-day legislative session, foster care reform is on the priority lists for Republicans and Democrats.
Pinson will introduce a bill that would require DoHS to create a “central reception center” and emergency resource homes for foster children for up to 72 hours. This would be an option for children only if a home couldn’t be found immediately, and the goal is to end the use of hotel placements.
“We’re going to bring this child here into a home-like environment that’s well staffed and can begin to love on these children and try to help them during this time of crisis to prevent them from having to go to an Airbnb or a hotel,” Pinson explained. He introduced a similar bill last year. 
Morrisey has also made foster care reform a priority of his administration and announced plans to create a $6 million fund to bring hundreds of foster children in out-of-state facilities back to West Virginia. There are 380 kids in out-of-state institutions in states including California, Florida, Texas and Utah, according to DoHS data.
The governor’s plan includes renovating in-state hospitals to house foster children, and Pinson said expanding the in-state options could help reduce the use of hotels and Airbnbs for foster kids. 
Pinson stressed that the answer to the ongoing shortage of foster placements was to recruit  and retain excellent foster families.
“ … So that when children are taken into state custody, we can immediately place them with a foster family, and that child can have continuity of care for the length of time that they’re in state custody, and unfortunately, that has proven to be a long time,” he said.

While not “intended” as a forum for advocating for any one candidate — as described by committee chairman Rick Gallot — several speakers used the meeting’s public comment period as a platform to explicitly back Kolluru.
Supporters pointed to his role in building UL’s research division in making the case for his appointment.
“This man turned this university into a Carnegie Research 1 institution,” said E. Gerald “T-Boy” Hebert, a former UL system board member.
Kolluru has made no secret of his ambition to lead UL, and was at one time reported to be in-line to get the job without a search, despite system rules requiring one.
He took over as interim president in November, replacing provost Jaimie Hebert, and announced a reorganization of the university’s administration, eliminating three vice-president positions.
UL is at something of a crossroads, working through a $50 million budget gap and declining full-time enrollment, as the search for a president to guide the university through those challenges gets underway.
Search committee members were named in December. From here, the committee is poised to move quickly with a review of finalists scheduled for Feb. 27.

(Photo: EPA) A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inspection of the Smitty’s Supply Inc. petroleum packaging plant in Tangipahoa Parish discovered hundreds of other chemical spills and hazards in areas unaffected by the August explosion and fire. 
EPA officials detailed their findings in an inspection report that formed the basis of a consent order that requires the company to address violations inspectors documented during an Oct. 7 visit to the Roseland facility. The agency made the report public Tuesday, stating in a news release that inspectors found an estimated 250 damaged containers, 200 chemical spills and more than 300 containers of unlabeled or unidentified substances.
Clay Garside, a New Orleans environmental law attorney, said the findings depict a “horror show” unlike any he has seen. He is representing the advocacy group Louisiana Environmental Action Network in a lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply to ensure the company fully addresses the impact of the disaster.
“I’ve seen some pretty bad stuff but nothing this egregious,” Garside said.
Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment. It has filed its own lawsuit against the companies that made and maintained the tanks that exploded. 
The EPA conducted the inspection a month and a half after the Aug. 22 Smitty’s Supply disaster sent millions of gallons of hazardous materials onto neighboring properties and pouring into waterways, including the Tangipahoa River. 
The report includes alleged violations discovered in two undamaged warehouses that are the apparent focus of a related environmental crimes investigation, though the agency has said little about that case. The EPA Criminal Investigative Division, with assistance from the FBI, served a search warrant at the facility Nov. 18 that paused recovery operations near Warehouse 6 and Warehouse 10 for two days, according to information from other EPA records.
Records reveal federal criminal search warrant served at Smitty’s Supply

The October inspection was led by the EPA’s compliance division, which gathers evidence for the agency’s more common civil enforcement proceedings such as the administrative consent order. 
According to its report, EPA inspectors found evidence of active and old chemical spills, many from unlabeled containers that were haphazardly stored. The containers included large 275-gallon totes, 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon buckets. Hundreds were found damaged, corroded, bulging, crushed, leaking, punctured, fallen or at risk of falling from high stacks or shelves. 
Many containers had no labels except for rudimentary hand-written notes with vague warnings such as “Danger,” “Waste,” “Bad,” “Expired,” and in one instance “Do Not Touch must do Labs.” Some labeled with “Corrosive” placards had their tops cut open with oily liquids, trash and debris inside. 
In one area of the facility called the Truck Stop, inspectors found a collection of drums with “Radioactive” placards, with yellow police crime scene tape wrapped around the barrels. 
Oily liquids were found in open drums, buckets and other containers — many without lids or with pieces of cardboard serving as makeshift covers. Some open drums sat outside with unidentified oily liquids, trash and random discarded items inside. Others were in patches of grass with no containment area to prevent spills from escaping.
Many containers had spilled or were actively spilling chemicals at the time of the inspection, the records said. Some unlabeled containers were surrounded by weeds and visibly deteriorating, and others were surrounded by barren patches of soil saturated with an unknown oily material. 
Some totes, which are large, plastic containers with metal support cages, appeared damaged, corroded or bulging with pressure. In one section of pavement used as an outdoor storage area, many unlabeled totes and drums were precariously stacked on top of others without the support of pallets and dangerously leaning over.  Some stacks were leaning, and others had fallen over with puddles of chemicals on the ground nearby. None of the containers were labeled, except for one with the word “Bad” written on it.
In one warehouse, a 55-gallon drum of oil was roped off with red caution tape bearing the word “Danger.” The drum was sitting on a crushed wooden pallet next to sealed pallets of brake fluid.
Also inside of that warehouse was evidence of other spilled chemicals on the floor underneath totes and bulging containers. One  tote contained an industrial form of concentrated hydrogen peroxide, a volatile chemical that can cause skin burns and explode under certain conditions.
Inspectors were unable to fully examine one storage area because its access points were blocked by a grease spill approximately 3 inches thick and spanning about 100 square feet, according to the EPA report. 
In some cases, inspectors said Smitty’s Supply employees made half-hearted attempts to clean spilled chemicals by covering them with cardboard. Other spills were left untouched, forming puddles on the floors of warehouses and on the ground outdoors. 
Animal tracks were found on the floor inside one of the warehouses, indicating wildlife had access to the space. The animal appeared to track an unknown white substance across the floor.
Bottled and packaged chemical products on shelves were leaking and in danger of tipping over. 
Some incompatible products were hazardously stored together in the same area with one pallet of corrosive chemicals placed next to a pallet of flammable chemicals. 
Sealed drums labeled “corrosive” had an unknown liquid leaking onto them, and totes of other corrosive chemicals were actively leaking onto the floor at the time of the inspection with no evidence of cleanup attempts. 
Other findings included:

Concrete containment walls surrounding large permanent tanks had cracks with unknown liquids seeping through, some flowing offsite. There was no evidence of repairs, though someone had painted arrows on one wall to mark a crack.
A tote of sulfonic acid had a leaking spigot dripping its contents onto the floor of the facility’s grease plant. A worker had stuffed a rag in the spigot to try to plug the leak.
Grease tanks had pipes and valves caked with an accumulation of leaking contents.
Containers of open unidentified substances were stored at the top of a staircase.
Old lead-acid vehicle batteries were strewn randomly across the property. In one workshop, a collection of old batteries was leaking next to a pair of unlabeled compressed gas cylinders.  

The report totals 230 pages, most showing photographic evidence of the findings.
Many of the containers looked old and weathered and as if they hadn’t been moved in years, while others looked as if they had been moved more recently possibly as part of the recovery operations following the Aug. 22 disaster, according to the photos in the report. 
Although Smitty’s Supply voluntarily agreed to the EPA’s consent order, the company has neither admitted to or denied the allegations in the inspection report. The order doesn’t prevent the EPA from enforcing other allegations including any criminal allegations that might be under investigation. 
Candy Cardwell, whose home is among those closest to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was packing up her life in Roseland when reached by phone Wednesday. Unable to go outside without becoming physically ill, Cardwell said she is moving to California this week.
“I never thought in a million years something like this would happen,” Cardwell said, adding that she hasn’t been able to sell her house.
The EPA’s inspection findings show a company with little regard for human life, she said.
“The owners have taken every opportunity in front of them and exploited it … to the extent that I question their ethical and moral standards,” Cardwell said. “And I think this has gone on for a long time.
“I think that the company has taken every shortcut, trying to maximize profits and putting their employees at risk and the residents in surrounding areas at risk with no qualms about what they were gonna destroy.”

Rob Brown opened Da Sammich Spot Restaurant and Resource Hub in Orange Mound in March 2025 to be a “cultural hub for regular, everyday people in the community,” he said. The dining room’s walls are covered in wavy patterns of yellow and white. The space is dotted with positive quotes, hand-painted in bright-orange, bold text: “Respect humans. Protect children. Lettuce be friends.”
But on Sunday night, the restaurant became a scene of fear and confusion when dozens of law enforcement and military officers staked out the parking lot, although Da Sammich Spot was closed. The National Guard and several other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies have been patrolling the city since September as part of President Donald Trump’s Memphis Safe Task Force.
Community members said they saw people wearing military uniforms standing in front of several businesses along Park Avenue on Sunday night. “A friend texted me and was like, ‘Hey, I was riding past and saw the National Guard setting up in front of your restaurant.’ So I turned on my camera first and saw them,” Brown told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.
Brown was at his home, just minutes away from the restaurant. After seeing the live camera footage, he showed up and asked them to move their van. It was blocking the restaurant’s entrance, Brown said. They agreed to move, but soon after, more than 20 law enforcement and military officers filed into the cramped parking lot.

(Scenes from Rob Brown’s Facebook Live on Jan. 4, 2026.)
Almost instinctively, Brown started a livestream on Facebook at 8:22 p.m. on Sunday. A social media video showed that the National Guard was present first. Moments later, federal agents from the FBI, the U.S. Marshal’s Service, and Homeland Security Investigations arrived. Officers from the Memphis Police Department were also on the scene around 9 p.m. Officers were responding to a “disturbance at Park and Semmes,” an MPD spokesperson told MLK50 via text.
“I’m getting more and more scared for my life,” Brown said during the livestream as he pointed out all the weapons task force members were carrying. Brown went into “fight-or-flight” mode as a result of PTSD, he said.
“My adrenaline (was) pumping,” Brown said. “Things will go from zero to 100 in Memphis.”
The sudden police and military presence felt like an affront to the restaurant’s mission as “a safe space for the community,” Brown said. That mission is part of the reason Brown accepted the offer to put a new sign on the front door of his restaurant from a community organizer when the task force began its work in the fall.

(Scenes from Hunter Demster’s Facebook Live on Jan. 4, 2026)
“Come to find out, I’m one of the only businesses in the city that actually put it up,” he said.
Taped to the front door, the sign is a laminated sheet of printer paper. “Stop. No ICE access in this business. Notice to all law enforcement & immigration agents,” it reads. “If you attempt to enter this business without a valid judicial warrant, you will be asked to leave. This policy is in compliance with: U.S. Constitution, 4th Amendment.”
“It’s just crazy that the one space in the whole neighborhood that has this sign up, y’all come park in front of it,” Brown said while livestreaming on social media. “It’s an occupying force right here…This shit don’t make no sense.”
When Brown told guard members that he felt unsafe, one responded: “We’re patrolling this whole area.”
As Brown aired his experience on social media, other community members showed up to support him. Their presence seemed to “de-escalate the situation,” Brown said, and by 9:43 p.m., the parking lot was mostly empty. No arrests were made, nor any citations given.

Tyler Foster, a law student and vice president of the Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope, said in an email that community members were threatened with arrest for disorderly conduct as they protested law enforcement’s presence. Foster was one of the people who arrived Sunday night to support Brown.
Jackson Brown, a spokesperson for the National Guard, said the guard was aware of the interaction in front of Da Sammich Spot.
“Our mission is to make Memphis and Memphians safe by providing assistance to local and federal law enforcement agencies in their duties,” he said in a statement. “We are committed to the communities of Memphis and all Memphians.”
The U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees the task force, referred a request for comment to the Memphis police, saying, “Though the task force is indeed multi-agency, the MPD is the agency that works most [with]  the Guard. They would have a better firsthand explanation of the situation.” An MPD spokesperson described the National Guard as “extra eyes and ears in our city.”
Now, Foster and others are calling on MPD to release all body-worn camera footage from the Sunday night scene, and to adopt and publish written policies governing cooperation with the National Guard and federal law enforcement agencies.
 The task force left. The community showed up.

By Tuesday afternoon, Da Sammich Spot had returned to its normal state. Sunshine filled the dining room. The front door stood open, welcoming fresh air from an unusually warm January afternoon. Faint sounds of traffic faded into the background as classic R&B tunes filled the air. Several people were hanging out in the dining room, talking, playing games and sharing meals.
So many customers visited the restaurant on Monday and Tuesday that it sold out of food both afternoons. Like many there, Wayne VanDeveer had visited Da Sammich Spot after he saw the videos from Sunday night’s incident on social media. VanDeveer, a resident of Central Gardens, wore a Smokey the Bear T-shirt. “Only you can prevent fascism,” the T-shirt read.
“(I) had to come support the neighborhood,” VanDeveer said. “Here it is, a property [manager] can’t get people off his property. Normally, you’d call the police, but here’s the police doing the crime.”
Daniel Bader, a lifelong Memphis resident, drove from Midtown during his lunch break on Tuesday to place a to-go order. It was his first time visiting the restaurant to “support local businesses” and to “show love,” he said.
“I don’t mind the National Guard. …They’re following orders, which is not a great thing to do all the time. They don’t want to be here,” Bader said. “We don’t need the Memphis Safe Task Force here.” State and federal agents “want to be here…causing chaos,” he added.
Brown described the police and military’s presence as “just another day in Memphis.” “This ain’t new,” he said. “We’ve been dealing with this way before the task force got here. MPD will pull up the exact same way with those aggressive tactics,” Brown said, referencing the U.S. Department of Justice’s report, which found MPD has a pattern of violating people’s civil rights. The 70-page report was released in December 2024.

Bluu Davis, a friend of Brown’s, also visited the restaurant on Tuesday. She agreed that the “Memphis experience” includes seeing retaliation by police officers, and that Sunday’s interaction could have escalated into something much worse.
“They could’ve gotten into an altercation,” she said. “Rob could’ve been arrested, or guns could’ve been drawn. We’ve seen it happen for something less.”
Despite this, “Da Sammich Spot will continue to be a positive place because the right person is occupying this space,” she said. “The sun came out perfectly after that incident. We’re not going to be scared to go into a space that the task force – that we didn’t ask for – is here trying to intimidate.”
Brown’s focus is back on building “stability for the restaurant,” he said, after months of dealing with poor building conditions and a contentious relationship with his landlord. Since the Sunday-night incident, he’s faced surprise visits from the Shelby County Health Department, which is threatening to shut down the restaurant due to “missing paperwork: a certificate of occupancy,” Brown said.
Brown has also received several supportive phone calls from people in Memphis, Chattanooga, Chicago and other places across the country. “I’m just trying to get back to doing some of the stuff I’ve been doing since I opened the restaurant … community events and inviting people and organizations in,” he said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260107_TN_MLK_Da_Sammich_Spot_BV_0022-scaled.jpg-1024x768.webp,,,2026-01-15 06:57:42.074710

(Getty Images)Imagine starting the new year with the promise of at least a $147 million payout from the federal government.
But there are strings attached.
In late December, President Donald Trump’s administration announced how much all 50 states would get under its new Rural Health Transformation Program, assigning them to use the money to fix systemic problems that leave rural Americans without access to good health care. Now, the clock is ticking.
Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.
The money — divided into unique allocations for each state, ranging from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas — represents the first $10 billion installment from the five-year, $50 billion program. Congress created the fund as a last-minute sweetener in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer to offset the outsize fallout anticipated in rural communities from the statute’s nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade.
Federal officials crafted the fund to give states “space to be creative,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters after announcing the funding Dec. 29. “Some states will fail, and we will learn from that.”
The money was divided according to a complicated formula.
In 2026, each state will receive an equal $100 million share under the law for the first half of the money, plus additional funding from the second half. Oz’s staff steered payouts from the second portion based on each state’s rural score, as well as results from a “technical” scoring system for project proposals.
Within hours of the announcement, academics and researchers began to parse the awards to better understand why some states received more than others, including whether the awards reflected any partisanship or political favoritism.
At first glance, total awards do not appear to favor states governed by either Republicans or Democrats. But one academic data analysis teased out the amount awarded for each state’s technical score, which is the part determined by the discretion of agency officials.
The analysis was performed at the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which specializes in rural health. A KFF Health News review of the Sheps Center data found that states with Republican governors tended to receive more money for the parts of their application based on the technical score. Democratic-controlled states crowded the bottom quarter of those technical score awards.
Overall, though, the state awards reveal wild variation in how much money each state will get per rural resident, almost a hundredfold difference between the top and bottom.
In an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic, a spokesperson for Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs accused the administration of shortchanging rural residents in the state, which was awarded $167 million this year from the program.
CMS spokesperson Chris Krepich said in an emailed statement to KFF Health News that “politics played no role in funding decisions.”
On the December call, Oz pushed states to start working on policy actions championed by the administration — such as approving presidential fitness tests and restricting food benefits — that could require legislative approval.
Half of states promised to mandate the presidential fitness test, Oz said. Many states also proposed food waivers under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which would limit low-nutrition items such as soda. He also said some states promised to teach health care professionals about nutrition. And others confirmed they will repeal certificate-of-need laws, which require companies to prove that new health facilities they want to open are necessary.
Krepich said CMS’ new Office of Rural Health Transformation is hiring program officers to serve as point people for three or four states. Many states are setting up their own offices to oversee the new funding.
Oz highlighted Alabama’s “big maternity initiative with robotics doing ultrasounds” and said states are tackling issues ranging from behavioral health to obesity.
A KFF Health News review of state “project abstracts” and “spotlights” released by CMS shows that many states plan to address the workforce challenges in rural areas. Delaware, for example, plans to use its funding to create the state’s first four-year medical school with a rural primary care track.
A third of states said they want to improve electronic health records, and every state mentioned telehealth.
Many state legislatures must pass laws to distribute the funding to their state offices. Meanwhile, state officials are hiring staff, organizing advisory committees, and preparing to dole out money.
“I’m excited about what’s next,” said Terry Scoggin, former interim chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, or TORCH. Texas was awarded the biggest allocation. The money will bolster a rural hospital funding bill Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year, Scoggin said.
More than two dozen cash-strapped rural hospitals in Texas have closed or been converted to clinics since 2005, a nationwide trend that hit the Lone Star State particularly hard. The state has the largest rural population in the United States. Texas’ allocation amounts to about $66 per rural resident, according to a KFF policy analysis. By contrast, Rhode Island was granted about $6,300 per rural resident.
Scoggin said he has “a ton of concerns” about companies taking the money instead of it helping rural hospitals and residents. “I was blown away about how many for-profit companies reached out.” The companies have also called rural hospitals and asked to work with them to apply for state money, he said.
The awards should be judged on how they benefit rural residents because “the stated goal of the program is to improve rural health,” said Paula Chatterjee, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored a Senate Finance Committee memo on the transformation fund.
Researchers at the Sheps Center conducted the analysis to estimate how much money states received from the technical score, which is the portion of funding based on the quality of their proposals and state policy actions that align with “Make America Healthy Again” priorities.
New Mexico won the least amount of technical funding, with less than 10% of its award based on the discretionary metrics. Alaska won the largest technical award, according to the Sheps Center data.
Texas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Hawaii rounded out the top five recipients of technical funding. In addition to New Mexico, the other lowest technical awards went to Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona, and California.
Mark Holmes, director of the Sheps Center, declined to comment on whether he saw any political bias in the awards but said the nuance in the final portion of discretionary awards based on technical scores is important because those dollars can be redistributed and potentially clawed back in future years.
“We can be fairly certain that every state will get at least a slightly, if not a vastly, different amount next year based on this re-pooling and reallocation piece,” Holmes said.
States now have a limited time to show they’re using the money effectively to secure future funding.
But they can’t start spending yet. CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said.
States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.
“CMS is working closely with states to complete this process as efficiently as possible,” Krepich said.

(Photo by Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)As Idaho lawmakers convene for the 2026 legislative session, a new statewide poll shows voters are generally optimistic about the state’s direction but want policymakers to focus on transparency, tax relief, and regulatory reform rather than expanding government.
The 2026 Idaho Poll, released on January 12 by the Mountain States Policy Center, surveyed 600 registered Idaho voters and provides a clear snapshot of public priorities heading into the session.
Idahoans are telling lawmakers they like the state’s trajectory, but they want reforms that improve accountability, affordability and opportunity. This poll helps citizens and policymakers prioritize the policies that matter most as the session begins.
Key findings include:

A reform-minded electorate: Nearly half of voters say Idaho is headed in the right direction, but a majority believe reducing regulations and improving the business environment would do more to improve the state than expanding government programs.
Overwhelming support for transparency: Large majorities support measures requiring advance public notice of legislative hearings, clearer disclosure of gas taxes at the pump, and stronger transparency requirements for public school spending.
Strong appetite for tax relief and guardrails: Voters favor automatic income tax reduction triggers when revenues exceed expectations and support requiring a legislative supermajority to raise taxes. Property and income taxes top the list of taxes voters would most like to see reduced.
Education concerns paired with accountability: Most voters rate Idaho public schools as fair or poor and support policies that expand parental options and improve transparency, rather than simply increasing spending.
Housing affordability as a top concern: An overwhelming majority view housing affordability as a serious problem, with broad support for regulatory reforms such as allowing accessory dwelling units and speeding up permitting approvals.
Stable approval of state leaders: Idaho’s governor, legislature, and U.S. senators maintain net-positive approval ratings, signaling an electorate open to constructive policy leadership.

The poll was conducted online by RMG Research from January 2–9, 2026, and has a margin of error of ±3.9 percentage points.
The takeaway is clear. Idahoans want lawmakers to focus on transparency, affordability, and removing barriers that make it harder for families and businesses to succeed.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The ability to acquire cheap, fertile land drove much of American history. Ordinary people — many of them recent immigrants — could obtain land on which to sustain families with very little more than hard work. Land in America is generally owned in “fee simple,” meaning that the owner possesses every aspect of ownership and every possible use. But recent efforts around the country by extractive industries and their legislative allies are threatening this historic type of land ownership. We saw it here in West Virginia during the 2024 legislative session and may see it again in the upcoming session.
Ownership in fee simple enables the landowner to retain the property while conveying pieces of his ownership rights to another, such as by leasing the property or selling the right to develop minerals. An owner can also sell the right not to develop the property through a land protection agreement. In that way he can ensure that the property remains farmland or naturally beautiful land forever. Large timber, coal and gas companies hate this because land protection agreements remove land from the market that could be exploited by them for tremendous profits.
There are two types of land protection agreements, sometimes called “conservation easements.” Both are private contracts made voluntarily by the landowner. One type of agreement is made between the landowner and a government-supported entity, like the Nicholas County Farmland Protection Board. In that type, the landowner keeps the property, but sells the right to use or develop it for non-agricultural purposes. The owner receives income, while the Farmland Protection Board — which buys the development rights — ensures that the land remains farm or agricultural land forever.
A second type of land protection agreement does not involve the government. This type is made between a private landowner and a charitable group like the Land Trust of the Eastern Panhandle to preserve the natural character of valuable scenic or historic land by prohibiting development, including commercial mining and timbering. In this type, the owner donates the development rights and gets a tax deduction for the value of the donation.
Both types of land protection agreements are voluntary choices by the landowner, and both generate income to the landowner while preserving the character of the property for future generations.
But in 2024, an effort was made in the West Virginia Legislature to limit the ability of landowners to protect land and generate income while doing so. The irony of this is palpable. Our Legislature is controlled by Republicans, who purport to be the political party most interested in limiting government intrusion into private affairs.
The vehicle for this effort was Senate Bill 822, which remained alive until the last day of the legislative session when it was removed from the Senate’s calendar. That bill declared it to be state policy to promote land and mineral development and timber harvesting “for the economic benefit of the citizens of the state.” It went on to declare that any land protection agreement interfering with mineral development and timber harvesting would be void if its term exceeded 20 years.
If it had passed, SB 822 would have removed the historic right of landowners to determine how to use their land — or not use it. It would also have eliminated the land protection agreements used as a tool by land trusts to protect land into the future. This is because a federal tax deduction would not be available for the donation of a conservation easement that is not perpetual. And a land protection agreement that becomes void after 20 years would certainly not be perpetual. With no tax deduction, these land protection agreements would simply cease to be attractive to landowners.
The West Virginia effort coincided with the introduction of HR 2773 — the “Landowner Easement Rights Act”–- in the U.S. House of Representatives. That bill would have forbidden the Secretary of the Interior from entering conservation easement agreements with private landowners for longer than 30 years and would have permitted the renegotiation of existing easements with a longer term. That might happen when, for example, an oil company makes a subsequent owner of the protected land an offer he can’t refuse. The feeble justification for HR 2773 offered by its sponsor was concern for future owners who may want to do something else with the land.
I hope the reader will excuse me for not believing that justification. When have large extractive industries been primarily motivated by the land ownership rights of others, particularly those who haven’t even acquired ownership yet? To make sense of this, you have to follow the money. The effort to undermine land protection agreements — and land ownership freedom—- is purely driven by the profit motive of these industries, and they are wrapping that unattractive motivation in the cloak of concern for the future landowner.
The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a right-wing think tank that produces model legislation available for use by state legislators, recently considered model legislation limiting conservation easements to 20 years. The argument made in support was that landowners are somehow defrauded by government, land trusts, and “radical environmentalists” into surrendering their development rights perpetually, thereby binding future generations and freezing the land’s use “according to today’s practices and societal goals.”
To their credit, ALEC recognized a bogus policy idea when they saw it and refused to adopt the model legislation. Reference to it has been completely removed from ALEC’s website.
People often refer to the West Virginia Legislature as a “bad idea machine.” Interfering with a landowner’s property rights and destroying the land protection agreement in the process is a colossal bad idea. Let’s hope that the Legislature resists the temptation to inject government into private land ownership simply to satisfy big industry.

FRANKFORT — During the past two years political committees supporting Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman have quietly raised $1 million, most of it from out of state, including massive contributions from tobacco interests.
One committee is Coleman’s own reelection committee, which formed in 2024 and reported to the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance last week that it has raised $479,379 and currently holds a balance of $350,283.
The other is a super PAC called Safer Kentucky that supported Coleman in 2023 and apparently supports his reelection. Safer Kentucky has raised $517,724 in the past two years and currently holds a balance of $351,086.  
Unlike Coleman’s campaign committee, a super PAC like Safer Kentucky can accept contributions of unlimited amounts in an independent effort to support political candidates. Safer Kentucky reports these big contributions from tobacco interests:

PMI (Philip Morris International) Global Services, of San Rafael, California, gave $50,000 to Safer Kentucky last October. PMI is registered to lobby the Kentucky General Assembly. Super lobbyist Patrick Jennings represents its interests in Frankfort. Jennings is also a donor of $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection campaign.
RAI Services Company (Reynolds American), of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has given $52,900 to Safer Kentucky and another $2,100 to Coleman’s reelection committee. It also actively lobbies the General Assembly.  
Altria Client Services, of Richmond, Virginia, has given $50,000 to Safer Kentucky and another $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee. Altria’s top Frankfort lobbyist is John McCarthy, who gave $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee as did his wife Cindy.
Xcaliber International, of Pryor, Oklahoma, which advertises itself as “America’s largest deep-discount tobacco manufacturer’: $30,000 to Safer Kentucky. Two of its executives have each given $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee.
Juul Labs Inc., of Washington, D.C., an electronic cigarette maker, gave $15,000 to Safer Kentucky last November.

Other large donors
Tobacco-related companies are not the only large donors to Coleman’s reelection committee and Safer Kentucky:

Churchill Downs gave $29,070 to Safer Kentucky, and Churchill chief executive William Carstanjen gave Coleman’s committee $2,200.
Lawyers with the personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan, of Orlando,  combined to give $26,200  to Coleman’s reelection committee.
William Austin, chair of Starkey Hearing Technologies, of Brownsville, Texas, gave $15,000 to Safer Kentucky. He and two other top Starkey officials combined to give another $6,500 to Coleman’s committee.
Justin Thompson, owner of the coal company Iron Senergy, of St. Matthews, gave $30,900 to Safer Kentucky. He also gave $2,100 to Coleman’s committee. Another Iron Senergy executive Brian Settles, gave $3,000 to Safer Kentucky and $2,100 to Coleman’s committee.
Galls LLC, the Lexington company that describes itself as the “trusted source for uniforms, tactical gear and essential equipment for America’s public safety professionals,” gave $20,600 to Safer Kentucky. Three of its executives combined to give $4,921 to Coleman’s committee.

Reports filed last week by Coleman’s reelection committee and Safer Kentucky with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance list scores of other donors giving smaller amounts, many of them lawyers.
 What is unusual is the large  amount raised by the two committees and that so many of the donors are from out of Kentucky. The reports show that people and groups from 37 other states and the District of Columbia donated to one or both of the two committees.
The Office of the Attorney General referred questions about the Coleman fundraising to Coleman’s campaign, but Coleman’s campaign declined to answer questions emailed to it by Kentucky Lantern, including  why tobacco interests donated so much and the relationship between Safer Kentucky and Coleman.
Coleman’s campaign replied with only this statement from Coleman: “It is an honor to serve Kentuckians as Attorney General. Every day our Office is fighting to support law enforcement and make Kentucky a safer place to live, work and raise a family. We are just getting started and will continue putting our all into serving Kentucky!”
The phone number listed in election registry records for Safer Kentucky is also the phone number for C&L Compliance, a Washington-area consultant for Safer Kentucky. Messages left at that number by Kentucky Lantern were not returned.
PMI Global Services, RAI Services Company and Altria Client Services did not respond to phone messages from Kentucky Lantern.
Here’s what Kentucky Lantern found in the reports filed by the two committees.
Coleman’s committee
Coleman is the only candidate for statewide office in 2027 who has raised significant money so far. No one from either political party has registered a campaign committee for the 2027 governor’s race.
Only two other candidates for the 2027 statewide offices — like Coleman, Republican incumbents — have raised any money at all. Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell reports raising $42,800.Auditor Allison Ball reports raising about $5,700.
Stephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky, said the $479,379 raised by Coleman’s committee is a huge amount for a candidate in a down-ballot race so early in a campaign. Because Coleman holds the advantages of incumbency plus his years as a U.S. attorney, the added advantage of such a sizable war chest “almost guarantees victory,” Voss said.
Kentucky law firms that have given the most to Coleman committees in the past year include the Paducah-based Bryant Law Center, whose attorneys and their spouses gave $11,000 to Coleman’s reelection committee and $4,000 to Safer Kentucky. Eighteen attorneys at Frost Brown Todd and that firm’s political action committee combined to donate $16,034 to Coleman’s committee. Other Kentucky donors include Nate Morris, the Lexington entrepreneur who is running for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate this year. Morris donated $2,100.
Among the scores of attorneys from across the country who gave is former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, an attorney with Torridon Law Group, in Washington, listed as giving $1,000 last month. Barr served as attorney general during President Donald Trump’s  first administration.  That role made him Coleman’s boss  during part of the time Coleman served as U.S. attorney in the Western District of Kentucky.
Coleman’s committee reported that a major expense so far has been $34,346 to Delullo & Associates for fundraising consulting.
Delullo & Associates is a Republican political consulting firm based in Alexandria, Virginia. Election registry records show the firm has worked in Kentucky for only two committees, Coleman’s attorney general committee and Safer Kentucky.
Safer Kentucky
Safer Kentucky was formed in 2023. Its  registration form posted on the Kentucky Registry of Election website says its purpose is to make independent expenditures that “support candidates that share our ideals and values.”
Records filed with the election finance registry show that its only expenditures to promote a candidate came late in the 2023 campaign — about $70,000 for text messaging and phone calls in support of Coleman’s first run for attorney general.
Since then, its periodic reports show it remains very active raising and spending money. Like Coleman’s reelection committee, a  major expense over the past two years has been payments to Delullo & Associates (totaling $86,424) for fundraising consulting. 
Those records also show that many donors to Safer Kentucky also gave to Coleman’s reelection committee.
Safer Kentucky’s next largest expense over the past two years has been for strategy consulting: about $60,000 paid to SW2 Political, a Washington area consulting firm. The two top officials of SW2 are Scott Will and Seth Wimer, both formerly top officials of the Republican Attorneys General Association. Will and Wimer are each listed as having given $2,200 to Coleman’s reelection committee last month.
Big Tobacco and optics 
As attorney general, Coleman is the Kentucky official most responsible for enforcing the terms of the Master Settlement Agreement,a landmark pact between nearly all states and large tobacco companies in which the companies were released from state lawsuits seeking recovery for costs incurred for treating illnesses caused by smoking. In exchange the participating companies agreed to make annual payments to the states and restrict their marketing of cigarettes.
Perhaps the most contentious tobacco legislation during Coleman’s first two years as attorney general was House Bill 11 in the 2024 session. Backers of the bill said HB 11 would curb underage vaping by limiting vaping products that can be sold in Kentucky to those products authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or that have a “safe-harbor certification”based on their status with the FDA.
But opponents, organized under the name Kentucky Smoke Free Association, said the bill was a move by Big Tobacco to grab market share. That’s because, opponents say, the vaping products of the large tobacco companies already had FDA authorization, while smaller companies were still awaiting authorization.
After the bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, Kentucky Smoke Free filed suit to block its enforcement.
Coleman’s office defended the bill in Franklin Circuit Court. After Judge Thomas Wingate dismissed the suit, Coleman praised the ruling. “Our General Assembly is empowered to make laws protecting Kentuckians’ health and charting our course to a bright future,” Coleman said of the court’s action. “This ruling once again underscores that reality.”
Greg Troutman, attorney for Kentucky Smoke Free, said of the Big Tobacco contributions supporting Coleman, “Based upon what I have seen in other states, the legacy tobacco companies are focusing on state attorneys general with direct and PAC contributions to influence policy. State AGs are responsible for ensuring that legacy tobacco companies comply with the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. A key element of that Agreement prohibits the legacy tobacco companies from engaging in actions which are likely to lead to increased youth tobacco use. It always creates an optics problem when a regulator accepts campaign contributions from regulated parties.”

The numbers, reflective of June 2025, crystallize how many people are facing the choice between higher premiums this year or forgoing health insurance altogether.
US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote

Renewing the subsidies has been a paramount debate among federal lawmakers for months, spanning last fall’s government shutdown and persisting into the new year. Last week, when the U.S. House greenlit a measure to extend the credits for three years, U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, was the only GOP member of Virginia’s congressional delegation to join the state’s Democratic representatives in voting to pass it. 
Wittman was one of just 17 Republican congressional representatives nationwide to support the three-year extension effort. The bill still has to pass the Senate and then be signed by President Donald Trump — a vocal critic of the credits. 
 What are ACA tax credits and where are they being used in Virginia?

The subsidies, formally called the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, help people purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act. The 16-year-old federal law created government-run marketplaces for people without employer-provided insurance, but who earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid, to be able to buy coverage. The special credits make health care accessible for millions living in lower income brackets around 100 to 400% of the federal poverty level. 
That includes Williamsburg-area resident Natlie Tyer, who said she is able to maintain health insurance thanks to the credits, while she works part time and finishes her master’s degree to become a school counselor. Tyer attends William and Mary in Williamsburg, a historic city in the 1st Congressional District, which Wittman represents. About 30,000 people living there have utilized the subsidies, according to SCC data. 
When asked to explain his vote, Wittman said he was thinking about his constituents when he aligned with his Democratic colleagues to advance the measure to extend the credits.
“This vote was about responsible governance — protecting families from sudden cost increases today while fighting for better, conservative solutions tomorrow,” he said in a statement emailed to The Mercury after declining a phone interview request. 
The Mercury followed up by email asking for more details about health care solutions Wittman would like to seek beyond what he called the “strictly temporary” extension of the subsidies, but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. 
With higher premiums, financially burdened people have been left with the choice to pay more for health care or forgo it and risk being without insurance in case of medical emergencies. 
If the subsidies are not renewed, Tyer has said she may have to go without health insurance coverage in the upcoming year.
“Do I just rely on a strategy of hope until I graduate from grad school, and I get a job in the public school system?” she asked in an interview last summer.
 Analyst: Congressional Republicans’ votes on health care could put them at odds with voters

Before Wittman emerged as the lone congressional Republican in Virginia to side with Democrats on the matter, his colleague in the 2nd District, Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, pressed for one-year and two-year extensions of the subsidies. She voted no on the latest effort to resurrect the credits because the House proposed a three-year extension, she told The Virginian Pilot. 
Political analyst Bob Holsworth said that “Kiggans voted her beliefs, and one can always credit somebody for doing that.” 
“But,” he added, “I think politically this was a damaging vote.”
He noted that Democrats have eyed the districts as potentially flippable, at a time where both affordability issues like health care and a referendum on Trump can motivate people to the polls. 
The Trump-backed reconciliation bill Congress passed last sumer is expected to cause thousands of Virginians and millions nationwide to lose Medicaid health coverage and changes to hospital funding mechanisms could trigger service cuts or closures. Eventually, people with private insurance could see rate raises as hospitals will occasionally negotiate with private insurers to offset costs. 
Both Wittman and Kiggans had been outspoken against previous versions of the bill but ultimately supported it. 
“A lot of people who aren’t affected (by ACA or Medicaid) are still concerned about affordability and the votes of somebody on these high profile issues can kind of leak over into the broader affordability issues as well,” Holsworth said. 
Those reconciliation bill changes, however, won’t fully kick in until after the congressional midterms. 
In the meantime, the ACA subsidy debate is not yet over. While Trump has signaled he would likely veto the matter should it get to his desk, Republican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno plans to lead the charge to bring the credits back to life on his side of the aisle. 
Moreno has framed supporting the extension as a way to align with Trump’s motto of putting “America first.” To triage immediate financial injury to Americans and Virginians, Wittman described his vote as a short fix for now. 
“Allowing those costs to spike overnight would have punished working families while doing nothing to fix the underlying problems in the system,” he said.

Glenn Youngkin called lawmakers to Richmond for a special session starting May 13, 2024, to resolve differences between the governor’s and lawmakers’ spending plans. The special session then remained open because the Senate never gaveled out, creating an ongoing opportunity for lawmakers to address the budget — and other matters.
Virginia redraws its congressional districts every 10 years after each census. But last fall, Democratic lawmakers put forward a constitutional amendment to allow the legislature limited power to redraw the state’s congressional districts. It is a strategy to bring Virginia in line with other states that are redrawing voting districts for political leverage. 
President Donald Trump praised states like Texas for their mid-cycle redistricting efforts last summer, in an effort to bolster the GOP majority in Congress ahead of midterm elections. 
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said the 2024 special session’s achievements included passing a bipartisan budget that prioritized education — including teacher raises and more k-12 public school funding— and other Democratic priorities. 
But sending the redistricting amendment to voters was also a key victory, Scott said.
“I’m proud of the fact that we were able to get the redistricting amendment completed,” Scott said at a Wednesday press conference. “We put it in front of voters, and they knew about it. Now, voters are watching Virginia — not only in the commonwealth, not only in the United States, but all over the world — to see if America has lost its damn mind.”
He added, “I think we have an opportunity now to send a message to the rest of the country that we’re not going to stand by while you rig this election. We will do everything in our power to level the playing field we were talking about.”
Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said failing to end the session was a move to keep the governor from making his nominations to multiple boards and commissions, and not the “purported purpose” of addressing the budget.
He said one reason Senators were able to reject the 22 appointments to three public university governing boards last year was because the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee was able to meet while the Senate was still in session.
“We’ve been in a special session almost continuously during the course of Governor Youngkin’s term, which is really unprecedented,” Obenshain said. “It was used to keep the governor from making appointments (and) that was largely what it was used for. There was nothing that would have prevented the legislature from being called back, had it been necessary to do so, but we have just entered this hyperpartisan phase in which we’re gonna try and prevent governors from exercising their constitutional prerogatives.” 
House Minority Leader Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, told reporters on Wednesday that he understands the need for a special session on the state budget, but was disappointed that time was spent developing the constitutional amendment to redraw congressional districts right before the gubernatorial election in November.
The results favored Democrats, who will now control the governor’s mansion in addition to the House and Senate.
“Hopefully, we’ll get beyond where we have to be in a special session all the time,” Kilgore said.
Republican Caucus Whip Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, agreed.
“We went into a special session to solve a very specific problem. It was not meant to be used as a tool to continuously identify issues and keep what they’re doing,” Webert said. “We shouldn’t (have been) in two sessions at the same time (and) because of that confusion, I believe … it delegitimizes specific legislative processes.”
But Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, was pleased with the legislative work completed.
“I’m very proud of the progress we were able to make, even with the obstruction of a Republican governor who vetoed a historic number of important bills that Virginians really needed,” Price said.  ”I’m really looking forward to the bills (that) we’ll be able to pass and actually get a signature on this time.”
The proposed constitutional amendment, which will be considered by both chambers, would allow voters to give the legislature the authority to redraw the lines as early as this year. The General Assembly must approve the measure during two consecutive sessions.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, added more context about the purpose of Virginia Democrats’ redistricting push.
“I’m glad we were able to be in session to protect American democracy, which is what this redistricting amendment is about. We didn’t want to have to redraw congressional districts, but when a bunch of … Trump Republicans want to figure out a way to keep themselves and Trump in power as long as possible, it became necessary for us to figure out a temporary solution to address that before our bipartisan redistricting commission can act again in 2031.”
The 2024 special session also addressed the reversal of cost-cutting measures to the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, which provides tuition-free college for some military families. 
Legislators also wrestled with measures on skill games in the 2024 special session. New bills to create a commission that would oversee skill games and other forms of legal gambling in the state have been introduced in both chambers in this year’s session, which is set to adjourn March 14.

For decades in Virginia, public and private developers who encroach on protected wetlands and streams have been required to offset the impacts by paying to restore similar ecosystems nearby.
The Virginia Department of Transportation, for example, had to buy many credits to compensate for construction to expand the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.
The process, called mitigation banking, operates as a marketplace where builders and restoration groups trade credits.
But it has become somewhat of a black box, said Jonathan Rak, chief policy advisor for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.
“It’s a very inefficient market. It’s not transparent,” he said. “It’s very difficult for the participants to see what’s available, what the price of credits has been. That means that there are some very wild fluctuations from place to place within Virginia and from time to time.”
The state recently launched a website to streamline the market by making this information more accessible. It’s produced in partnership with Water Ledger, a technology company focused on water management.
The Stream, Wetland and Nutrient Credit Exchange, or SWaN, allows anyone to toggle through an interactive map and dashboard to find available credits by watershed and type, such as tidal or non-tidal wetlands.
Market participants can register to use the platform more deeply for trading and research. Eventually, Virginia will charge subscription fees to recoup the cost of launching the website, which was about $500,000, Rak said. The basic website will remain free.
The new platform does not change the way mitigation banks are permitted or operated in Virginia, he said. It’s meant to make it easier for people to move through the process, allowing wetlands to be built more quickly and efficiently.
The wetland credits system is governed by state and federal regulations.
Mitigation banking gained momentum locally in the 1990s. The national practice was formalized in 2008 through joint regulations by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency.
First, developers must prove they can’t avoid ecosystem impacts, Rak said. When they’re deemed necessary, mitigation is required.
Permittees can restore or build new wetlands if they find an appropriate site. Otherwise, they typically pay a nonprofit or private company to create the mitigation bank, or purchase credits available from an existing one.
The credits system is somewhat opaque for members of the public, but it has drawn more attention in recent years from people concerned about development and land conservation.
Residents near Pleasure House Point in Virginia Beach, for example, unsuccessfully fought against the city’s plans to convert a section of maritime forest into wetlands to earn mitigation credits.
City officials said they could not find readily available credits on the open market and needed them quickly to complete flood protection projects elsewhere in the city. Residents conducting research claimed they found other credits that the city could have used instead.
Surry County residents voiced concerns last year about a planned wetlands bank by the nonprofit Nature Conservancy that could drain the beloved Sunken Meadow Pond.
Last summer, environmental groups in Hampton Roads spoke out against an Army Corps decision for a mitigation bank in Prince George County. The groups argued that the project should not be allowed to sell credits in Hampton Roads, because it’s too far from the impacted ecosystem.
The SWaN platform could be used in such situations to provide more transparency for all involved, Rak said.
The credit system could also soon shift because of changes at the federal level.
A 2023 Supreme Court decision, Sackett v. EPA, narrowed the scope of the Clean Water Act, changing the definition of wetlands such that fewer areas will require mitigation. But Virginia’s regulations remain the same.
“There will be an increasing number of permits we expect that will be solely issued by Virginia and will not involve the federal regulations,” Rak said.

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)The Joint Finance Committee unanimously approved the release of $53 million for the University of Wisconsin system to support campuses struggling with declining enrollment. 
The UW system will have $26.5 million in the 2025-26 fiscal year and $26.5 million in the 2026-27 fiscal year that can be used for grants to campuses. The funds were initially set aside for the system in the recent state budget. 
In each year, $15.25 million will be distributed to campuses with declining enrollment over the last two years and $11.25 million will be distributed through a formula dependent on the number of credit hours undergraduates complete.
In 2025, enrollment across the system’s 13 campuses remained stable with about 700 more students enrolled in the fall when compared to 2024. The slight increase represents the third consecutive year of increased enrollment. 
UW President Jay Rothman thanked lawmakers and Evers in a social media post and said the release of the funds “affirms our shared commitment to student success and Wisconsin’s workforce.” 
“Together, we’ll keep more talented graduates in Wisconsin and ensure our universities are delivering the education students deserve and parents expect,” Rothman said.
At the time of the budget process in June, committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said the funds would “put the thumb on the scale” to help campuses with declining enrollment over the last decade including UW Platteville, which is in his district.
Lawmakers did not debate the release of the funds, though Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), who voted to release the money, noted that the system has had a growing number of staff members even as enrollment has declined.

Kelly Ayotte speaks with Matt Mayberry, president of the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, as she receives an award from the association praising her signature of 2025 pro-housing bills, Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt, New Hampshire Bulletin)It has been months since Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a suite of bills intended to help housing construction, but Matt Mayberry says he’s already seeing results.
Mayberry, the outgoing president of the New Hampshire Home Builders Association, said Wednesday a slight uptick in the number of new listings and homes sold in the past month suggests some of those reforms — like a bill creating a 90-day expedited state permitting process for large developers — are working.
“Housing inventory has gone up in New Hampshire, a little bit, and prices have come down a little,” he said. 
But despite the new laws, many of which prohibit cities and towns from zoning actions that might block new housing, the state’s housing affordability crisis continues. And the debate over how to alleviate it is far from settled. 
In Concord this week, lawmakers in both parties have sparred over weighty, fundamental questions around who should dictate the pace of housing construction and whether limits should exist over local control. On one side are those who say the state stepped too far into an arena that should be the purview of communities. On the other are those who think the state is holding back and should play a bigger role in balancing the housing market.
Sailing through the middle of that divide is Ayotte, who has hailed the top-down deregulatory approach of last year’s anti-zoning bills. With those now law, the state should sit back and watch how the laws that do exist affect the market, Ayotte argued.
“I think it’s very important that we make sure that this legislation that was passed, that we’re following up and seeing how it’s working and making sure it’s working effectively,” Ayotte said in a brief interview Wednesday. “I think it’s good policy.”
She spoke moments after receiving an award from the Home Builders Association celebrating her signature on the 2025 zoning overhaul bills. Among those are a law allowing the construction of detached accessory dwelling units by right; a law allowing developers to build residential housing units in commercial zones, with exceptions; and a law stopping cities and towns from imposing certain parking requirements for new developments. 
Some lawmakers are less willing to hold back. On Monday, Democratic representatives proposed a pair of bills that would seek to tackle housing inequities by taxing second homes. One, proposed by Rep. Jonah Wheeler, of Peterborough, would impose a statewide, 0.75% property tax on homes valued over $500,000 and occupied by their owner less than six months of the year. That tax, which would apply only to the amount of valuation of the house over $500,000, would be kept by the town and could be used to offset local property taxes paid by all residents. 
Another bill, proposed by Rep. Ellen Read of Newmarket, would impose an “unoccupied housing tax” on any property that sits vacant for more than 6 months of the year, which would amount to a doubling of the existing property taxes on the home. 
“We should not be allowing all these empty homes to sit there when we are in the middle of a housing crisis,” Read said. 
Others are seeking to dismantle last year’s law. On Tuesday, Rep. Len Turcotte, a Barrington Republican, led the backlash, speaking in favor of 12 separate bills that would undo pieces of the 2025 zoning overhaul bills and give cities and towns more freedom to set their codes. 
To Turcotte, the new laws have trampled on basic rights.
“If the federal government came and put a federal regulation into place, some kind of a zoning regulation that said … ‘all concrete cement production facilities shall be allowed by right in any zone in the United States,’ we would be up in arms, because that would be the federal government telling us what to do at the state level,” Turcotte said. “The analogy is the same here. … One size fits all mandates are not the way to go.”
At the heart of the policy divide are major unresolved questions. Polling has shown that housing affordability has dominated Granite Staters’ concerns in recent years, and that many support housing construction. An August survey of New Hampshire voters by St. Anselm College found that 62% of respondents wanted more affordable housing built in their neighborhoods, 64% think there should be more state investment in affordable housing, and 68% support allowing owners to convert single-family houses into up to four apartments provided they are connected to water and sewer services. 
But other polling has shown a more mixed picture. A May University of New Hampshire survey found that 40% of respondents opposed requiring cities and towns to adopt zoning codes to increase housing, compared to 38% who supported it, 14% with no opinion, and 9% who didn’t know. That same survey found respondents ranked housing as the “most important problem facing New Hampshire.”
Shortly after that survey, the New Hampshire Municipal Association, which has opposed the zoning overhaul bills, published a newsletter arguing that the survey showed “the claims that there is widespread support to change local zoning is a bit of, pardon the pun, a Potemkin village.”
Recent data suggests the housing market is beginning to cool — or at least is not accelerating so fast. But prices remain staggeringly high and home sales are still far below their levels a decade ago. 
The number of sales in December 2025, traditionally a slow month, increased by 15% over December 2024, according to the latest monthly snapshot from the New Hampshire Association of Realtors. The number of homes for sale rose by 16% over the same time period. The “months supply” of housing — the time it would take to sell all houses on the market if no new ones were added — increased modestly from December 2024 to December 2025, from 1.4 months to 1.5 months. 
The median sales price for a home, however, was $520,000 last month, up 5% from a year before and down only slightly from the 2025 average of $535,000. And last month, the median New Hampshire household income provided just 61% of the recommended income needed to buy a median-priced home, according to the snapshot. 
Amid those persistent cost barriers, Wheeler and Read say their approaches could help provide equity. “We’re looking at a situation where all these homes that are being bought up are being left empty, and that home could be used for somebody who could purchase a $500,000 home and use it as their primary residence,” Wheeler said. 
The proposals to increase property taxes face long odds in the Republican-led Legislature. And they have drawn scorn from owners of short-term rentals and those with second homes, many of whom testified against the bills Monday.
“It’s becoming really impossible to own a second home,” said Chelsi Christensen, a North Hampton resident who owns an Airbnb that she says is “her retirement plan.” “And I don’t feel like that we should be punished for having a second home.”
Christensen said a new tax could threaten her ability to keep the Airbnb. “…Utilities go up, everything goes up. Guest expectations go up. There’s a lot more competition. I can’t raise my rates. So I’m holding on to this property by a thread as it is right now.” She and others argued that short-term rentals provide necessary boosts to the state’s tourism economy, and that imposing higher taxes would price out the ability for individuals to run Airbnbs and advantage corporations. 
Turcotte’s approach against state intervention also faces political difficulty. After hours of testimony, the House Housing Committee voted Tuesday to recommend killing all of Turcotte’s proposed repeal bills. Many of his bills would have reversed legislation that the committee endorsed last year.
Rep. Calvin Beaulier, a Littleton Republican, challenged Turcotte’s assertions that local zoning codes preserve individual property rights more effectively than state zoning mandates. 
“Why is it, in your estimation, OK for a local community to as you frame it, take away someone’s property rights, but somehow at the state level, we’re not supposed to touch it?” he asked. 
For her part, Ayotte says the state has already made meaningful legislative strides. “It was probably the most active legislative session on housing issues, at least in a couple of decades,” she said. And she said the state has already struck an effective balance.
“We’re going to continue to make sure that we respect the local decision-making, but then provide opportunities in areas like conversion of commercial (buildings) to residential (buildings), or ADUs where it makes sense, so that we can expand the housing supply in the state,” she said. 
Mayberry agreed: The state has already passed major legislation, and now the state should let the developers build, he argued. 
”We set the machine in motion,” he said. “Let’s see if it works. Let’s tweak it. Because a good thing with a very responsive Legislature is we can tweak it.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1145537-Ayotte-Mayberry-1-1024x737.jpg,,,2026-01-15 05:56:54.793357

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderI have a recurring nightmare, a nightmare that becomes more realistic with each passing day. It goes like this:
It is November 2026. Here in Georgia and elsewhere, the midterm polls have been looking bad for Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, but the ballots have finally been cast and are being counted. Tensions are high.
That’s when President Trump sends the National Guard or ICE agents to Fulton County, DeKalb County and other blue-trending areas, claiming massive fraud, seizing voting machines and voiding the election.
If it sounds too crazy to be plausible, I’d like to think so too. 
But let me ask:
Is that scenario more crazy than what happened five years ago, when Trump summoned thousands of supporters to charge the Capitol, also in an effort to overturn an election? Is it more crazy than trying to seize Greenland by force? Is it more crazy than what is happening in Minnesota? Are we moving away from chaos, or hurtling at it?
And it’s clearly on Trump’s mind as well. 
Last month, in a meeting with House Republicans, he expressed disbelief that Democrats might triumph in the midterms, suggesting it’s only because of fraud.
“How do we have to even run against these people?” he said. “I won’t say ‘cancel the election, they should cancel the election,’ because the fake news would say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’ They always call me a dictator.”
And in a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump was reminded that in 2020 he had explored using the National Guard to seize ballot boxes in states where he had alleged fraud. 
“Well, I should have,” Trump said.  
Trump went on to tell the Times that he balked at using the National Guard in 2020 not because he lacked the authority, but because he didn’t think the Guard was “sophisticated enough” to pull it off. He had already tried to pressure the Department of Justice to seize state voting machines, but Attorney General William Barr had refused. Through Rudy Giuliani, Trump then reached out to the Department of Homeland Security to seize machines, but DHS officials also told him that they had no authority to do so.
Somehow, I think Trump’s request would get a very different response this time from the likes of Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem.
Indeed, when asked by Times reporters whether he would consider such a step in 2026, Trump changed the subject.
In those previous requests to seize election equipment, Trump had reportedly focused his attention on a specific but unknown state, a state “that had used machines built by Dominion Voting Systems, where his lawyers believed there had been fraud.”
Georgia uses Dominion voting machines. Dominion was acquired by Missouri-based Liberty Vote in 2025.
In recent social media posts, Trump has continued to rail against voting machines, voting by mail, counting votes beyond midnight of Election Day and the use of QR codes, all of which are standard features of Georgia elections. He has even issued executive orders that claim to abolish such standard features of election operation. In his mind, apparently, that makes it illegal.
According to the Constitution, of course, states are empowered to run their own elections, but the Constitution as it is written on paper is often not the Constitution as recognized by Trump.
“Remember, the States are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,” Trump wrote recently on his social media platform. “They must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.”
And what does the president of the United States tell them, “for the good of our country?”
He tells them:
“THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX, USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, MUST END, NOW!!! REMEMBER, WITHOUT FAIR AND HONEST ELECTIONS, AND STRONG AND POWERFUL BORDERS, YOU DON’T HAVE EVEN A SEMBLANCE OF A COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!!!”
So no, while I do not think it likely, I also do not believe it unthinkable that Trump might claim fraud and dispatch heavily armed, armored, masked federal agents to interrupt vote-counting here in Georgia, and in other swing states as well.

States are passing laws to prevent artificially intelligent chatbots, such as ChatGPT, from being able to offer mental health advice to young users, following a trend of people harming themselves after seeking therapy from the AI programs.
Chatbots might be able to offer resources, direct users to mental health practitioners or suggest coping strategies. But many mental health experts say that’s a fine line to walk, as vulnerable users in dire situations require care from a professional, someone who must adhere to laws and regulations around their practice.
“I have met some of the families who have really tragically lost their children following interactions that their kids had with chatbots that were designed, in some cases, to be extremely deceptive, if not manipulative, in encouraging kids to end their lives,” said Mitch Prinstein, senior science adviser at the American Psychological Association and an expert on technology and children’s mental health.
“So in such egregious situations, it’s clear that something’s not working right, and we need at least some guardrails to help in situations like that,” he said.
While chatbots have been around for decades, AI technology has become so sophisticated that users may feel like they’re talking to a human. The chatbots don’t have the capacity to offer true empathy or mental health advice like a licensed psychologist would, and they are by design agreeable — a potentially dangerous model for someone with suicidal ideations. Several young people have died by suicide following interactions with chatbots.
States will keep pushing AI laws despite Trump’s efforts to stop them

States have enacted a variety of laws to regulate the types of interactions chatbots can have with users. Illinois and Nevada have completely banned the use of AI for behavioral health. New York and Utah passed laws requiring chatbots to explicitly tell users that they are not human. New York’s law also directs chatbots to detect instances of potential self-harm and refer the user to crisis hotlines and other interventions.
More laws may be coming. California and Pennsylvania are among the states that might consider legislation to regulate AI therapy.
President Donald Trump has criticized state-by-state regulation of AI, saying it stymies innovation. In December, he signed an executive order that aims to support the United States’ “global AI dominance” by overriding state artificial intelligence laws and establishing a national framework.
Still, states are moving ahead. Before Trump’s executive order, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last month proposed a “Citizen Bill of Rights For Artificial Intelligence” that, among many other things, would prohibit AI from being used for “licensed” therapy or mental health counseling and provide parental controls for minors who may be exposed to it.
“The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” DeSantis wrote on social media platform X in November.
‘A false sense of intimacy’
At a judiciary committee hearing in the U.S. Senate last September, some parents shared their stories about their children’s deaths after ongoing interactions with an artificially intelligent chatbot.
Sewell Setzer III was 14 years old when he died by suicide in 2024 after becoming obsessed with a chatbot.
“Instead of preparing for high school milestones, Sewell spent his last months being manipulated and sexually groomed by chatbots designed by an AI company to seem human, to gain trust, and to keep children like him endlessly engaged by supplanting the actual human relationships in his life,” his mother, Megan Garcia, said during the hearing.
Another parent, Matthew Raine, testified about his son Adam, who died by suicide at age16 after talking for months with ChatGPT, a program owned by the company OpenAI.
“We’re convinced that Adam’s death was avoidable, and because we believe thousands of other teens who are using OpenAI could be in similar danger right now,” Raine said.
AI vs. AI: Patients deploy bots to battle health insurers that deny care

Prinstein, of the American Psychological Association, said that kids are especially vulnerable when it comes to AI chatbots.
“By agreeing with everything that kids say, it develops a false sense of intimacy and trust. That’s really concerning, because kids in particular are developing their brains. That approach is going to be unfairly attractive to kids in a way that may make them unable to use reason, judgment and restraints in the way that adults would likely use when interacting with a chatbot.”
The Federal Trade Commission in September launched an inquiry into seven companies making these AI-powered chatbots, questioning what efforts are in place to protect children.
​​“AI chatbots can effectively mimic human characteristics, emotions, and intentions, and generally are designed to communicate like a friend or confidant, which may prompt some users, especially children and teens, to trust and form relationships with chatbots,” the FTC said in its order.
Companies such as OpenAI have responded by saying that they are working with mental health experts to make their products safer and to limit chances of self-harm among its users.
“Working with mental health experts who have real-world clinical experience, we’ve taught the model to better recognize distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward professional care when appropriate,” the company wrote in a statement last October.
Legislative efforts
With action at the federal level in limbo, efforts to regulate AI chatbots at the state level have had limited success.
Dr. John “Nick” Shumate, a psychiatrist at the Harvard University Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and his colleagues reviewed legislation to regulate mental health-related artificial intelligence systems across all states between January 2022 and May 2025.
The review found 143 bills directly or indirectly related to AI and mental health regulation. As of May 2025, 11 states had enacted 20 laws that researchers found were meaningful, direct and explicit in the ways they attempted to regulate mental health interactions.
They concluded that legislative efforts tended to fall into four different buckets: professional oversight, harm prevention, patient autonomy and data governance.
“You saw safety laws for chatbots and companion AIs, especially around self-harm and suicide response,” Shumate said in an interview.
Medicare’s new AI experiment sparks alarm among doctors, lawmakers

New York enacted one such law last year that requires AI chatbots to remind users every three hours that it is not a human. The law also requires the chatbot to detect the potential of self-harm.
“There’s no denying that in this country, we’re in a mental health crisis,” New York Democratic state Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, the law’s sponsor, said in an interview. “But the solution shouldn’t be to replace human support from licensed professionals with untrained AI chatbots that can leak sensitive information and can lead to broad outcomes.”
In Virginia, Democratic Del. Michelle Maldonado is preparing legislation for this year’s session that would put limits on what chatbots can communicate to users in a therapeutic setting.
“The federal level has been slow to pass things, slow to even create legislative language around things. So we have had no choice but to fill in that gap,” said Maldonado, a former technology lawyer.
She noted that states have passed privacy laws and restrictions on nonconsensual intimate images, licensing requirements and disclosure agreements.
New York Democratic state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who sponsored a law regulating AI transparency, said he’s seen the growing influence of AI companies at the state level.
And that is concerning to him, he said, as states try to take on AI companies for issues ranging from mental health to misinformation and beyond.
“They are hiring former staffers to become public affairs officers. They are hiring lobbyists who know legislators to kind of get in with them. They’re hosting events, you know, by the Capitol, at political conferences, to try to build goodwill,” Gounardes said.​​
“These are the wealthiest, richest, biggest companies in the world,” he said. “And so we have to really not let up our guard for a moment against that type of concentrated power, money and influence.”

Ohio’s 136th General Assembly has reached its halfway point, as the lawmakers operate on two-year cycles. Bills have until the end of 2026 to pass or else they die. 
The Ohio Senate plans to return at the end of January and the Ohio House is expected to come back in February. 
Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act 
Ohio House Bill 486, also known as the Charlie Kirk American Heritage Act, would allow public schools and public universities to teach the positive impacts of Judeo-Christian religion on American history. 
Republican state Reps. Gary Click and Mike Dovilla introduced the bill, which the Ohio House passed in November.  
The bill outlines several examples that could be taught including the history of the pilgrims, the religious background of signers of the Declaration of Independence, the religious influence on the U.S. Constitution, Benjamin Franklin’s call for prayer at the constitutional convention, the separation of church and state, the role of the Ten Commandments “in shaping American law,” how religious influence shaped the Civil Rights movement, and the impact of evangelist Billy Graham, among others, according to the bill’s language. 
Baby Olivia Act 
Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act” would require schools to show either the ‘Baby Olivia’ video or a similar video to students every year starting in fifth grade all the way up through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year.
Ohio State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland, introduced the bill, which the Ohio House passed in November. 
The three-minute “Meet Baby Olivia” video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issues with the bill, saying the video shows gestational age two weeks earlier than starts and shows fetal development as more advanced than it is. 
Ten Commandments in classroom 
Ohio Senate Bill 34 could allow the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. 
Ohio State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, introduced the bill which the Ohio Senate passed in November. 
The bill would require public schools to display “historic texts in the classroom.” 
The list includes the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Articles of Confederation, the mottoes of both the U.S. and Ohio, the Magna Carta, the Mayflower Compact, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Ten Commandments.
School districts would have to pick four of the documents. If a document is donated to the schools though, the bill requires it to be displayed.
Success Sequence
Ohio Senate Bill 156 would require schools to teach students to graduate high school, get a job, and get married — in that order — before having a baby. This order of events is known as the success sequence.  
State Sen. Al Cutrona, R-Canfield, introduced the bill, which passed in the Senate in October and has had one hearing so far in the Ohio House Education Committee. 
The bill requires the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce to create a model curriculum for the success sequence for grades 6-12 and this would be a graduation requirement.
Academic interventions 
Ohio Senate Bill 19 would allow a public school student who scored below proficient in a state assessment test in math or English language arts to receive academic intervention services at no cost.
The academic interventions in the bill must be evidence-based and could include high-dosage tutoring at least three days a week, additional instruction time, and an extended school calendar. 
The bill passed unanimously in the Senate in November and the bill now heads to the Ohio House for consideration. Ohio Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, introduced the bill.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
In the far reaches of Appalachian Ohio, DeepRock Disposal Solutions and other companies pump salty, hazardous waste from oil and gas fracking thousands of feet underground at high pressure. Last year, the state gave DeepRock permits to drill two more injection wells for pumping such waste underground. The new wells are slated for rural Washington County, which sits on Ohio’s southeast border.


The state’s approval has drawn fierce opposition from surrounding community members and local governments that fear waste from the wells could escape and pollute their drinking water supply. Leaks have happened before, including from some DeepRock wells. But these opponents haven’t been able to stop the company’s latest drilling plans.


This lack of local authority highlights an unfair discrepancy in Ohio, according to legal experts and clean energy advocates: While state law allows counties, townships, and disgruntled residents’ groups to delay or even doom many solar and wind developments, it blocks almost all local decision-making power over fossil fuel endeavors.


The difference between how Ohio law deals with renewables and petroleum ​“is night and day,” said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law.


On one hand, state law gives the Ohio Department of Natural Resources ​“sole and exclusive authority” to permit oil and gas activities. ​“So the local governments are cut out entirely,” Robertson explained, noting a 2015 Ohio Supreme Court decision that held that the state’s comprehensive regulation of oil and gas activities preempts even city zoning ordinances that would otherwise restrict that work.


On the other hand, a 2021 law lets counties ban new solar and wind development for most of their territory. Even for ​“grandfathered” projects that are technically exempt from such bans, the Ohio Power Siting Board has used opposition from local governments as grounds for finding such developments were not in the ​“public interest.”


“What you have looks like total inconsistency” when it comes to deciding which energy projects should go where, Robertson said.


That has serious implications for the energy transition: It holds back the projects that would slash planet-warming and health-harming pollution while further entrenching the lead that the oil and gas industry has in Ohio’s electricity sector.


Ohio also treats renewables differently than it does fossil fuel projects when it comes to letting the community participate in permitting decisions. The state lets disgruntled residents intervene as official parties in wind- and solar-permitting cases, which allows those individuals to appeal permit approvals to the Ohio Supreme Court. Yet residents cannot intervene or appeal in cases about where oil and gas activities go.


Advocacy groups such as the Buckeye Environmental Network say this imbalance is making communities like Washington County, where DeepRock plans to inject more fracking waste, less safe.


Fracking — a drilling technique to extract fossil fuels from rocks thousands of feet deep — produces millions of barrels of waste per year. Regular wastewater treatment plants can’t handle those super-salty fluids, which can contain heavy metals, radioactive chemicals, and company ​“trade secret” compounds. That’s why the waste is typically disposed of in deep wells.


Ohio had more than 200 active fracking-waste injection wells as of late 2024, with several already in Washington County.

Marietta, a city of about 13,000 on the Ohio River, abuts Warren Township, where DeepRock will drill the new wells. The city’s leaders worry that the waste could migrate out of the rock layer where it will be stored. A 2019 investigation found that waste had escaped from another injection well in Washington County, although it wasn’t discovered in drinking water at that time.


The Marietta City Council passed a resolution in October that noted problems with waste escaping from other wells, and it urged the state to place a moratorium on disposing of more fracking waste in the area. The city also tried to appeal one of DeepRock’s permits, but the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management at the Department of Natural Resources responded that its Oil and Gas Commission, which reviews those administrative appeals, lacks jurisdiction for Marietta’s claims.


“People are saying we don’t want these injection wells,” said Roxanne Groff, an advisory board member of the Buckeye Environmental Network. ​“And the main reason is the water.”


Groff’s group is taking another approach to stopping the DeepRock project: It’s suing leaders at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources over the permits issued for the wells. The lawsuit, filed in November, argues the agency illegally relied on outdated regulations that were in effect when DeepRock first filed for its permits but that were replaced in 2022 by stricter rules meant to better protect public safety and health.


“The law is very clear in our view that [the department] should be applying the rules in place at the time of permitting,” said James Yskamp, a senior attorney at the nonprofit Earthjustice, which is representing the Buckeye Environmental Network. When DeepRock applied for its permits in late 2021, the current siting rules were already in draft form, and the public comment period on them had ended. Moreover, the agency didn’t complete technical reviews, provide public notice about the permits, or accept comments on them until last year.


Karina Cheung, a spokesperson for the Department of Natural Resources, said her agency has no comment on pending litigation. But she did note that any permit to operate the wells after they’re drilled will need to comply with current rules in the Ohio Administrative Code. That permit would control how the company pumps waste underground under pressure, but not where that waste goes. And the wells would already have been drilled.


Lawyers for the officials at the Department of Natural Resources and for DeepRock want the case dismissed. The department had no duty to apply the current law, the filings claim. And any harm is speculative, they argue, because it wouldn’t happen until after fracking waste is pumped down.


The Buckeye Environmental Network’s petition before the Franklin County Court of Appeals indicates the two DeepRock wells are approximately 2 miles from protected groundwater resources for people in the city of Marietta and Warren Township. Already-operating wells in the area pump tens of thousands of gallons of fracking waste underground each day. Injecting yet more fluids under high pressure could cause waste to migrate out of deep rock layers and up through rock fissures, abandoned wells, or other conduits, the group alleges.


These concerns are founded on evidence, Groff noted, unlike people’s objections to solar projects, which she said tend to be lacking in factual support or based on false information.


Robertson at Cleveland State has the numbers to back up that claim: She analyzed the grounds for testimony against a utility-scale solar project in a permitting case in 2024. Most objections either had no basis in fact or had already been addressed by permit conditions. The rest were statements of opinion.


To the extent there is any consistency in how Ohio treats different types of energy projects, ​“it’s that the oil and gas industry wins every time,” Robertson said. ​“The oil and gas industry benefits by blocking local voices in oil and gas industry decisions. And the oil and gas industry benefits by having local voices involved in the wind- and solar-energy decision-making.”

(Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Cellphones have quietly transformed K-12 classrooms into battlegrounds for focus and learning, pulling students’ attention away from their education and toward an endless digital feed. While smartphones have undeniable value outside of school, their presence during the school day has come at a steep cost to learning, mental health and school culture.
As a mom of two teenage daughters, a former school board member and an advocate for children’s well-being, I’m concerned about the effect of cellphones and devices on children’s development. Over the past year, I’ve been researching the effects of consistent cellphone access on children’s development.
What I’ve uncovered should alarm all of us.
We all know the experiences of children today are not the same that you or I experienced growing up. Technology has moved far beyond where most of us probably thought possible even a decade ago. Parents and educators haven’t been able to keep up to ensure we design environments with children’s safety and well-being in mind.
For companies creating these platforms, children’s addiction to them balloons their bottom lines. While these businesses need to change how they target children, we don’t have time to wait for them to change how we integrate technology into kids’ daily lives.
Right now, the Kansas Legislature is considering passing a consistent restriction on use of personal digital devices in K-12 schools. The bipartisan proposal already has support from much of the Senate.
Limiting access to cellphones for students in a school setting isn’t about going backward or trying to artificially resurrect some nostalgic childhood, but it’s about honestly assessing and asking ourselves how kids are doing. In this case, what is nearly constant access to screens, the internet and social media doing to our kids?
States that have implemented similar consistent policies are already seeing results. Conversations in the hallways between classes, improved test scores, more engagement between teachers and students — and I hope, happier kids — tell us this is the right direction for Kansas.
In addition to educational benefits, we expect to see improvement in children’s mental well-being. Adolescence is a precarious and precious time for children to develop and learn more about themselves. Kids who are more often exposed to frequent social media and internet access are vulnerable to more social comparison, self-consciousness, online bullying and chronic anxiety than children in past generations.
We know children are struggling. A decade of data and observations repeatedly show a negative relationship between how much a child is using their digital devices and their happiness, attention, and ability to learn. According to the Kansas Health Institute:

Kansas had the 10th-highest suicide rate in the nation for youths and young adults age 15-24 and the 11th highest for early adolescents age 10-14 in 2016-2020.
From 2016-2020, suicide was the second leading cause of death for Kansas kids and young adults age 10-24.
The Kansas youth suicide rate increased 63.8%, from 13.0 per 100,000 population in 2001-2005, to 21.3 per 100,000 in 2016-2020, which outpaced the 41.1% increase in the United States overall (9.9 to 14.0 per 100,000).

Even without the supporting data, we can sense and see the impact of digital devices on our children. For younger kids, it’s the inability to self-regulate or be in public settings without digital distractions. For teens, it’s often the lack of real-life social connections, poor sleep, the lack of reading real books, and difficulty making eye contact or holding conversations. I dare say that adults are facing these same challenges.
As educators and parents grapple with declining attention spans, rising anxiety, and disrupted classrooms, restricting cell phones in K–12 schools isn’t about taking away access to technology or punishing students — it’s about restoring classrooms as places for curiosity and connection.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)JD Vance famously admitted he was willing “to create stories” to attract media attention during the 2024 presidential campaign. 
It was his stunning defense of knowingly spreading false, racist rumors of pet-eating Haitian immigrants in his home state of Ohio. 
The lie demonized the large, legally welcomed immigrant population in Springfield to stoke anti-immigrant hostility (against a powerless community) and fuel MAGA zealotry for mass deportations.
Vance’s unconscionable deceit about Springfield Haitians brought terror and bomb threats to the southwestern town but he doubled down on the story he created to win votes and the vice-presidency. 
It was, to say the least, a low point of self-serving shamelessness for the power-drunk Millennial. 
But Vance went lower last week. His take on a Kent State-sized moment that shook the nation to its core was next level Orwellian head games. 
Repulsive hardly describes Vance’s performative spectacle last week justifying the public execution of an American citizen by state militia. 
The horrific killing was all over social media but Vance, to borrow from, Orwell’s 1984 dystopian novel, told us to reject what we saw with our own eyes. 
The vice-president insisted what we saw recorded on multiple cell phone cameras on a street in Minneapolis in broad daylight did not happen as we all saw it happen.
Those cameras caught every angle and the last-words of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in her maroon Honda Pilot before she steered the wheels of her car to leave an intense encounter with masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
“I’m not mad at you,” a smiling Good said to them while resting her arm on the rolled down window of her vehicle. She had just dropped her six-year-old off at school. Her dog was in the back seat. Seconds later she was dead. 
One of the ICE officers, with a pulled-up neck gaiter and cell phone in one hand, whipped out a gun with the other and summarily shot her through the windshield. Then twice more through the driver’s window.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Good’s SUV careened into a parked car. 
Onlookers, including a self-identified physician, who rushed to her aid were waved off by ICE officers. 
It took emergency responders, apparently blocked federal law enforcement vehicles, an estimated 15 minutes to get to the lifeless woman on foot. 
Almost immediately Trump and his minions blamed the victim for being shot in the face. They all but insinuated that she had it coming because she did not obey conflicting ICE commands. 
They wove an official account out of whole cloth without investigation or evidence. 
They exonerated the shooter they decided acted in self-defense. 
They smeared the dead woman as a “domestic terrorist” who “weaponized her vehicle” to kill law enforcement officers. 
They claimed she was part of a left-wing radical network bent on violence with no verification. 
Trump posted that Good “violently, willfully and viciously ran over an ICE officer” who was lucky to be alive and “recovering in the hospital.” It. Never. Happened.
The videos clearly showed a woman in a beanie cap try to drive away from a bad scene. 
In a blink, we see rapid gunfire. Images of a bloody front seat. A glove compartment overflowing with stuffed animals. She had a six-year-old. 
We see the ICE agent lean into the driver’s window to shoot, hear apparent audio of him call Good a profanity and watch him walk to the crash before departing the crime scene altogether. 
Yet Vance, wearing his Trumpy uniform of red tie, white shirt, and blue suit, told us not to believe our lying eyes. 
Good, he declared without equivocation or proof, “was trying to ram this guy with her car and he defended himself.” 
Vance repeated the lie to denigrate the victim who, he was certain, “tried to run someone over” and “incite violence against ICE.” His “torrent of untruths” hit a crescendo. 
“This was an attack on federal law enforcement. This was an attack on law and order. This was an attack on the American people.” Vance framed the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by a trigger-happy ICE agent as “a tragedy of her own making.” 
It was “classic terrorism” he said, “what you see is what you get in this case” and I will tell you what you see and believe, he implied.
In Vance’s telling, the ubiquitous videos of a state-sanctioned killing — that crossed the Rubicon — revealed “a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator,” not an unarmed neighborhood mom who did no such thing. 
The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes.
Vance suggested we owe a “debt of gratitude” to the paramilitary thug who shot Good three times in the head for noncompliance. 
Besides, he stipulated, (on no legal basis) the ICE agent who killed the mother of three is protected with “absolute immunity on the job.” 
He excoriated the media for “prejudging this guy as if he’s a murderer” while prejudging the victim as a “deranged leftist.” 
But as a true Orwellian prototype, Vance must control the narrative — regardless of how twisted or hateful. 
He dehumanized Haitian immigrants in Ohio. 
He disparaged a woman shot dead in Minnesota. 
His knowing lies “justifying the death of Renee Good are a moral stain on the collective witness of our Catholic faith,” wrote the National Catholic Reporter.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star.)A Maine lawmaker wants to ensure lawfully present immigrants are able to access food assistance after the federal government limited their eligibility to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The proposal, introduced by independent Rep. Bill Pluecker before the Health and Human Services Committee on Wednesday, would allow lawfully present immigrants who lost access to federal food assistance under HR 1, the Trump administration’s sweeping budget bill, to receive state-funded SNAP benefits. Under the Republican-led bill passed this summer, some immigrants including refugees, domestic violence survivors and human trafficking victims were deemed ineligible for food assistance, despite their legal presence and humanitarian protections. 
In Maine, these groups of legal immigrants have not needed to depend on the state’s SNAP program because they were eligible for its federal counterpart. But with the loss of federal support, Pluecker hopes to clarify that they can instead receive state-funded benefits.
“LD 2051 simply clarifies the definition of non-citizen legally admitted to the United States to ensure that those who should currently receive SNAP benefits in Maine can continue to receive them if they experience a hardship,” said Alex Carter, senior policy advocate at Maine Equal Justice. 
“The intent is not to expand eligibility, but rather to preserve it for as many people as possible under existing law and help make benefit determinations more efficient,” Carter explained.
Maine is one of few states that has a state-funded SNAP program, which, like its federal counterpart, offers food assistance benefits to low-income people. 
While Maine can’t make up for the significant gap left by federal safety net cuts, advocates supported LD 2051, calling it a “targeted, practical step that uses existing infrastructure to prioritize those most impacted,” according to testimony submitted by Ruben Torres of the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition. 
Carter told Maine Morning Star that the bill is an important step to ensuring food security for vulnerable groups, but is an “imperfect solution” because to qualify for Maine’s SNAP program, people have to meet a higher threshold and receive a hardship exception, which means not everyone eligible for federal food assistance would be eligible for state-funded SNAP.
Patterns of food insecurity impact immigrant communities disproportionately in Maine and beyond, and challenges are compounded for immigrant populations of color, according to Sam Zuckerman, policy coordinator of the Permanent Commission on the Status of Racial, Indigenous and Tribal Populations.
Zuckerman cited a 2025 Maine Health report that found 7% of English-speaking patients faced food insecurity, while 20% of non-English speaking patients had. Another study of food insecurity disparities among immigrants found that noncitizens are 1.28 times more likely to face food insecurity than citizens born in the United States. That gap was closed when immigrants had access to SNAP benefits, Zuckerman said, pointing to the need to continue state-funded SNAP for these groups.
Meanwhile, since federal disruptions in SNAP funding late last year, food pantries are continuing to see an unprecedented demand, according to testimony from Preble Street and Good Shepherd Food Bank. Preble Street has had to increase prepared meals from 2,000 to 2,600 a day to meet the need, and now sends out 1,000 food boxes per week, said advocacy director Terence Miller.
There’s also increasing fear of federal immigration enforcement,  according to Miller and Anna Korsen, deputy director of Full Plates Full Potential, who told the committee this has impacted access to food.
“We have been hearing from food pantries who tend to see higher numbers of immigrant families … that there has been a decline in those families because they don’t feel safe to leave their homes,” she told the committee. “And so access to SNAP is even more important for those households.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1125-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 04:57:11.778364

DOVER, Del. — The police departments in Dagsboro, Ellendale, and Selbyville have earned state accreditation from the Delaware Police Accreditation Commission, state officials announced.
The accreditation follows a multi-step evaluation process that included on-site inspections, reviews of departmental policies and procedures, and interviews with officers and staff. Assessors confirmed that each department met more than 100 professional standards required by the commission.
“State accreditation requires a commitment to excellence and determination,” said Joshua Bushweller, secretary of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security and chair of the accreditation commission. “Each agency embraced the challenge and completed the process.”
The Delaware Police Accreditation Commission, established in 2008, sets professional standards for law enforcement agencies across the state. Officials say accreditation is designed to improve officer and public safety, reduce high-risk management issues, strengthen operational efficiency and increase public trust.
Under House Bill 206, all Delaware police agencies are required to obtain accreditation by 2028. State officials said departments are actively working toward compliance through the Police Officer Standards and Training section of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security.
Delaware police agencies range in size from one sworn officer to more than 700. Larger departments often seek national accreditation through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, known as CALEA, while smaller departments typically pursue state accreditation due to staffing and funding limitations.
As of this year, 64% of Delaware police agencies are accredited, including 12 with national accreditation and 20 with state accreditation, according to the commission.
The Police Officer Standards and Training Commission, a division of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, oversees training and certification for police officers statewide and provides guidance to the accreditation commission.
More information is available through the Police Officer Standards and Training Commission.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/MInnesota Reformer)A federal immigration agent shot a man Wednesday evening after a scuffle in north Minneapolis, drawing a crowd of protesters blowing whistles and engaging in minor skirmishes with law enforcement who deployed chemical irritants. 
The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. 
DHS said the man who was shot was pulled over in a “targeted traffic stop” but ran away. When the officer caught up to him, they got into a fight, after which two bystanders also attacked the officer, according to DHS. 
The weapons used on the federal officer: “a shovel or broom stick,” according to DHS.
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said in a press briefing that he’d heard there was a snow shovel and a broom on the scene. 
“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life. The initial subject was hit in the leg,” DHS said. 
Their account couldn’t be confirmed. 
O’Hara said in the briefing Wednesday night that at 6:51 p.m., MPD received 911 calls about the shooting. 
The incident began on I-94, O’Hara said, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man. The man drove towards a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car, ran towards a house and got into a struggle with federal agents when a federal agent shot him. 
The man went into the house and refused to come out; eventually, federal agents entered the house. The man was transported to the hospital. His injuries are not life threatening, O’Hara said. 
The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene along with FBI agents to process evidence.
It’s unclear if state authorities will be allowed to continue investigate the shooting. The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the BCA from participating in the investigation into the fatal shooting of Good, leading local prosecutors to open their own probe. 
Scores of demonstrators showed up to the scene, shouting expletives at federal agents and telling them to get out of Minneapolis. Federal agents deployed tear gas and flash bangs, while some protesters shot fireworks at law enforcement. Two people were detained by federal agents after someone threw fireworks at the agents. At least two vehicles used by federal officers were vandalized.

By 11:30, law-enforcement and demonstrators mostly left the scene, though some remained.
O’Hara said the crowd had crossed the line into an unlawful assembly and State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies responded to requests for help with crowd control. 
Mayor Jacob Frey renewed his call for residents to remain peaceful and not “take the bait.” 
“Go home,” Frey said. “We cannot counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos.”
Frey also renewed his call for DHS to end its aggressive operation in the city, which the agency calls its largest operation ever. Minnesota along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit seeking to force DHS to end its operation, calling it a “federal invasion.” 
The roughly 3,000 federal agents in the state far outnumber Minneapolis’ roughly 600 police officers, who are struggling to respond to 911 calls and investigate crimes on top of near round-the-clock confrontations between federal agents and residents. 
“This is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in,” Frey said. 
Shawn Jackson was parked nearby the scene with his kids in the car. A law enforcement agency — unclear which one — set off flash bangs that detonated the airbags in his car. Officers then sprayed tear gas. The Minneapolis Fire Department took the children — including a baby suffering breathing problems, Jackson’s mother said — to the hospital. 
“They out of control,” Jackson said. 
Patricia Abrams was driving past with her sister when they saw the commotion and stopped. 
She told the Reformer that the ICE incursion into Minnesota is illegal and should end.
“The public should know to get these motherf*cking ICE people outta here. They over here illegally trying to lock immigrants up. B*tch, y’all over here illegally — excuse my French — y’all here illegally trying to lock people up.” 
She added: “D’f*ck’s wrong with you?” 
Local and state politicians were also on the scene: Rep. Mohamud Noor, DFL-Minneapolis, and Minneapolis Council Members Jason Chavez, Aisha Chughtai and Jamal Osman. 
The shooting happened just moments before Gov. Tim Walz made a statewide address encouraging Minnesotans to record federal immigration actions, promising that “accountability is coming” for abuses by federal officers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0465-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-15 00:57:25.575169

(Peña-Melnyk photo by Christine Condon, Ferguson photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s presiding officers opened the 2026 General Assembly by reminding their respective chambers that pocketbook issues should be their primary concern as lawmakers try to address rising costs without adding to them with new taxes.
The speeches by new House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), now in his seventh year leading the chamber, come as the legislature faces an estimated $1.5 billion budget deficit in the fiscal 2027 budget and demands for increased spending on education and health care, among other areas.
They also come at a time when state residents face steadily increasing costs for utilities, health care and housing, issues that must be at the top of lawmakers’ concerns when making decisions, the leaders said.
“The big issues for us to tackle are far from a secret,” Ferguson said during a roughly 10-minute speech after being unanimously reelected to lead the chamber. “Despite the actions we took last year, our state faces another $1.4 billion deficit. We still must invest in kids and health care. We continue to have an energy affordability crisis in Maryland, and Marylanders are getting whiplash from the increasing cost of their utility bills.”
Peña-Melnyk, elected by acclamation to her first term as speaker, said she fears her children will not be able to buy a home, and told the story of the surging utility bills faced by one of her daughters, a medical student in Baltimore.
“She keeps her thermostat at 60 degrees,” Peña-Melnyk said, “because her last utility bill was more than $300.”
89 days to go, but on day one of the legislative session it’s all back slaps and applause lines

The rising cost could mean that the House of Delegates takes a harder tack with utility companies, Peña-Melnyk said in a meeting with reporters after the House session.
“I told my members to be innovative, to be creative, and to leave it all out there, all right? We need to get relief,” she said. “Now, I will work with the companies, and I will sit down … and talk it out and compromise. But the number one issue that I’m concerned [about] are the people of Maryland.”
Peña-Melnyk has already voiced her support for House Bill 1, a measure that would prohibit certain utility companies from using ratepayer funds for employee bonuses.
The solutions to Maryland’s affordability challenges could come from delegates on either side of the aisle, Peña-Melnyk noted, even though Democrats hold a super-majority in both House and Senate.
“See your fingers?” she said, raising her hand into the air during a roughly 30-minute speech. “They’re not the same. Not the same, but you need them all for your hand to function. There is no reason why we can’t do that here.”
She asked all 141 delegates in the chamber to make suggestions, including about how to respond to a series of damaging audits for Moore administration agencies, which have included reports on lapses by the state foster care system and costly leases for state office buildings.
“How can we provide stronger oversight to ensure that agency audits are addressed and the taxpayer funds are wisely protected? Think about that,” Peña-Melnyk told the House.
Despite the need for cuts to close the budget shortfall, Peña-Melnyk said funds in the state’s multibillion-dollar edcucation reform pan, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, shouldn’t be among the cuts. As a young girl who immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic and did not speak any English, Peña-Melnyk said the education system lifted her up, allowing her to become an attorney, then College Park city council member and, finally, a delegate and speaker of the House.
“The Blueprint is important,” she said. “I know that we have to figure things out, but we will. But can we all agree that education is a change-maker? Can we do that?”
‘Rooted in justice’
Both leaders worried that any gains lawmakers can come up with could be upended by Trump administration cuts to federal programs and federal jobs — Maryland lost 25,000 federal jobs through the first 11 months of 2025, the most of any state in the nation, according to recent state data.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ferguson said the legislature “must do three things this year.”
“One, we must grow our economy by capitalizing where Maryland can excel in industries like health care, higher education, quantum biomedical research, transportation and logistics and other private sectors that diversify our economy in the future,” he said. “Second, we must make decisions that ask this simple question: Did we enhance affordability for Marylanders, particularly in areas of health care, energy and housing?
“And third and finally, the Senate of Maryland must protect our state’s residents from what has been too often needlessly cruel [federal] government policies that have too often sown distrust,” Ferguson said.
After the Senate adjourned, Ferguson spoke with reporters on several topics, including immigration. He emphasized that Maryland will always protect immigrants, and has already thrown his support behind legislation, which failed last year,  to ban 287(g) agreements, which allow local police to perform certain immigration enforcement roles to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“We are a country built on immigrants,” Ferguson said. “Of course, we should enforce the law, but we don’t need to do it in a way that disrespects humanity. I think that’s what ICE has become, is a paramilitary force that has disrupted and been offensive to humankind, frankly.”
Those thoughts were echoed by Peña-Melnyk, who said immigrants in the U.S. “deserve to live with dignity and respect.”
“How can we as Americans stand by the disrespect, the abuses, people losing their lives, racial profiling, civil rights violation?” she said of recent aggressive ICE tactics. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat: What’s right is right. What’s wrong is wrong. You don’t treat any human being that way. My God that I believe in loves everyone.”
Both leaders also support legislation to prohibit face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including ICE agents. Under both Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 155, face coverings include a ski mask, neck gaiter or tactical mask. The bills wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation.”
With another budget deficit in Maryland, Republicans see an opportunity

SB1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), has been scheduled for a Jan. 22 hearing before the Judicial Proceedings Committee. No hearing has been set yet in the House Judiciary Committee for HB155, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s).
When asked if it would pass the House, Peña-Melnyk said, “Yes.”
Ferguson brushed off questions about how state laws would apply to federal officers.
“How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution,” he said. “I know there is contention about this, but that will have to be figured out in the courts.”
This year’s session is the last of the cycle for lawmakers, all of whom are up for reelection this fall — one of the reasons higher taxes were taken off the table early in the discussion on the current $1.5 billion budget shortfall. But the demands of this year make it different than a typical election year, Ferguson said.
“The old adage used to be that the election year sessions are quiet, where the General Assembly tries to punt on the hard topics and avoid rocking the boat too much. That will not be the case for the 2026 legislative session,” Ferguson said. “Circumstances dictate policy, and circumstances our residents are facing require bold and immediate action.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/speaker_president-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 04:57:11.778364

You’d see scenes of golden waves of grain and farmers tilling their crops, and you’d hear a woman talking in glowing terms about the world’s largest phosphate miner.
“Our promise is to always take our commitment to the environment seriously,” the ads would say.
Speaking of glowing, one word you never heard in those TV ads was “radioactive.”  
The process of mining phosphate unearths a certain amount of radiation. That’s what led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to decree that the waste from phosphate mining and processing would have to be stacked up in gigantic mounds, to protect everybody who’s not in the phosphate business.
The land where the mining once occurred tends to remain radioactive, which means builders do their best to avoid building on top of it. Ha ha, just kidding! Builders in Florida have never cared much about what happens to their buyers.
An estimated 50,000 Floridians now live atop what used to be mining pits. Conditions are still the pits.
Glenn Compton of ManaSota-88 via Glenn Compton
“The owners think the property is safe, but it’s not — it’s hazardous,” said Glenn Compton of the environmental group ManaSota-88. “It poses a serious health risk for people.”
Now some of those people are suing Mosaic for leaving behind so much poison.
“The ground and soil that support and form the very foundation upon which [the plaintiffs’] homes sit is contaminated with uranium and radium-226 caused by Mosaic’s phosphate mining operations,” one lawsuit says.
Poor, pitiful (but highly profitable) Mosaic is s-s-scared the company is going to lose — so scared, in fact, that the Fortune 500 company has turned to the Legislature for help.
The Florida House is leaping to shield the big polluter from having to pay for what it’s done. It’s on today’s Special Order Calendar in the House floor, meaning the floor debate will begin.
An X-ray a week
If you ever get sick of the flatness of the Florida peninsula, take a drive through the soaring 200-foot gypsum stacks in the region known as “Bone Valley.”
Bone Valley got that name because it’s the location of an ancient fossil bed full of such extinct animals as giant sloths and saber-toothed tigers. Thanks to the pressure of the 20 to 40 feet of earth above them, those prehistoric creatures’ bones have turned into phosphate rock.
Ever since 1899, when ex-Confederate soldier Albertus Vogt discovered the original phosphate deposit while digging a well near Dunnellon, people have been digging the stuff up and converting it into fertilizer. Phosphate mining now extends through 450,000 acres of Central Florida. Most of the mines are owned by Mosaic, based in Tampa.
When the miners are done, the law requires them to undertake what’s known as “reclamation.” In other words, they put back all the soil, sand, and other “overburden” that they excavated. But there are no rules that say to get rid of the radiation, so the radioactive material that they exposed tends to stay at or near the surface.
Erik Crown via IMDB
A filmmaker and cancer survivor named Erik Crown discovered the results when he traveled through Bone Valley with a Geiger counter while shooting a documentary called “Phosfate.”
“We checked the radiation levels in every place we stopped,” Crown told me. In every place they checked — parks, playgrounds, housing developments — the radiation levels were far above what’s considered safe.
The reclaimed areas all looked nice, Crown told me — “as long as you don’t think about the fact that radiation is everywhere.”
In 2017, residents of Lakeland’s Oakbridge and Grasslands communities sued the developer who built their homes on top of old mining sites.
They reached a confidential settlement in 2024, but, in announcing the deal, their law firm pointed out that “testing before development of the subdivisions showed radiation levels 11 to 21 times higher than the acceptable risk limit.”
Yet the company never warned homebuyers of the danger.
In 2020, residents of two more Mulberry communities, Angler’s Green and Paradise Lakes, filed suit against Mosaic, hoping to hold the company liable for any health damage to the homeowners.
“Exposure to levels of radiation similar to those identified in the Angler’s Green and Paradise Lakes communities,” the suit contends, “translates to residents receiving over one chest X-ray per week — with obviously no diagnostic or health purpose whatsoever.”
Piney Point and other disasters
Phosphate mining has had a huge economic impact on Florida. It also has had a disastrous impact on its ecosystems, contrary to what those TV ads claimed.
For instance, in 1997 a dam full of acidic water atop a gypsum stack at a Mulberry Phosphates fertilizer plant broke during heavy rains. It spilled 56 million gallons of acidic wastewater into the Alafia River, killing every living thing in the 42 miles between Mulberry and Tampa Bay. The company declared bankruptcy.
Or look at the horrific Piney Point disaster five years ago, which resulted from state regulators repeatedly bending the rules to accommodate the mining industry.
Mosaic has played a major role in quite a few of these environmental disasters.
In 2004, to pick just one example, Tropical Storm Frances broke the dam atop a gypsum stack at Mosaic’s Riverview plant. Some 65 million gallons of waste flowed into a creek flowing into Tampa Bay, killing fish, mangroves, and seagrass.
The company generates a lot of pollution to dump, so in 2012 it got a state permit to suck 70 million gallons of water out of the aquifer every day. Mosaic uses the water to dilute its waste before spewing it into various waterways. The permit allowed Mosaic to tap more than 250 wells in Hillsborough, Manatee, Polk, Hardee, and DeSoto counties, an area that since 1992 had been under tight water-use restrictions.
In 2015, the company reached a $2 billion settlement with the EPA over its handling of hazardous waste in both Florida and Louisiana. A government spokesman called it “the most significant enforcement action in the mining and mineral processing arena” in the U.S.
Bruce Bodine via Linkedin
I don’t think the penalty made much of a dent in the company’s finances, though. Its CEO, Bruce Bodine, makes $9.9 million every year.
Anyway, our legislators don’t care about all that environmental damage stuff. To them, drinkable, swimmable, fishable water doesn’t mean much. Piney Point and those other disasters did not lead them to impose any new rules or regulations on this dirty industry.
What they do care about is how generous Mosaic has been to their campaign coffers.
Not just an ATM
For this part of the story, I tip my hat to independent journalist Jason Garcia’s “Seeking Rents” Substack.
“Mosaic is one of the largest campaign contributors in Florida politics,” Garcia reported recently. “Records show the company has donated more than $500,000 to state candidates and committees through the first nine months [of 2025] — including more than $100,000 to a fundraising committee led by GOP leaders in the Florida Senate.”
If you do the company a favor, Mosaic shows that it’s not just an ATM.
Rep. Lawrence McClure via Florida House
Three years ago, Dover Rep. Lawrence McClure, a Republican who’s a partner in an environmental consulting firm, successfully pushed through a bill Mosaic wanted. The bill would let the mining giant test its phosphogypsum waste as road-building material instead of continuing to stack it up in giant mounds. After the bill passed, Mosaic paid $100,000 to sponsor a fundraiser for McClure’s political action committee, Conservative Florida.
When the Tampa Bay Times broke the story on this, McClure contended the fundraiser was not a payback for doing Mosaic’s bidding. He insisted it was nothing more than standard practice, which should tell you a lot about how politics works in Florida.
Still, McClure was so grateful to Mosaic that he’s one of two sponsors on this bill to protect the company from being sued. I picture McClure walking the halls in Tallahassee like that kid with the Pepsi can walking around school in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” except instead of saying “Save Ferris,” he’s urging everyone, “Save Mosaic!”
“Our Legislature shouldn’t be looking out for them,” said Ragan Whitlock of the Center for Biological Diversity. “They should be looking out for Floridians.”
Once upon a time
Here’s what Mosaic needs to be saved from: a very good law called the Water Quality Assurance Act.
“First enacted nearly 40 years ago, the law imposes something known as ‘strict liability’ on companies that release pollution into the ground or water,” Garcia reported.
That means “they can be forced to compensate people impacted by that pollution regardless of whether the release was accidental or the result of corporate carelessness. The idea is to ensure companies handling materials that can sicken or kill people and wildlife have maximum financial incentive to be as careful as possible.”
Rep. Richard Gentry via Florida House
The bill that Mosaic wrote, and that McClure is co-sponsoring with Rep. Richard Gentry, R-Astor, would undercut that standard. Instead, notes Garcia, “it would no longer be enough to just prove that Mosaic is responsible for the elevated radiation levels. A plaintiff would also have to prove that Mosaic was somehow negligent, too. That’s a much higher bar to have to clear in court.”
In order to avoid lawsuits, the bill says, the phosphate company would have to record a legal notice that the land is a former mine. Then it would have to call in the state Department of Health to conduct a radiation survey. You, as a buyer, might not know about either of these.
McClure told WUSF-FM that the existing law is totes unfair to poor widdle Mosaic. He said it’s wrong to hold the company liable for endangering everyone’s health just because “once upon a time, a machine unearthed some rock.”
By passing this bill, he said, “we’re going to have more data as a function of this than we currently do today.”
Whitlock scoffed at that argument for letting Mosaic off the hook.
“This is still very much a handout to the phosphate companies to reduce their liability,” Whitlock told me. “The breadcrumbs they have provided in return change nothing.”
Making mines into subdivisions
Mosaic execs have been trying since at least 2024 to get the Legislature to protect them from these pesky suits. Each time, though, the effort fell short because that’s how dysfunctional our Legislature is these days.
Why have they been so intent on passing this? Because, Garcia wrote of the 2025 effort, “Mosaic framed the legislation as the key to unlocking real-estate development in one of the most rural parts of Florida.”
Phosphate is a finite resource. Mines don’t last forever. The company is looking ahead to its future.
It learned the lesson of the St. Joe Co., a Panhandle pulp and paper giant that eventually realized it needed a new product. St. Joe closed its paper mill and switched to developing and selling its extensive real estate holdings (with help from the taxpayers).
Mosaic itself, in a handout to legislators last year, told them that “many lands that once supported phosphate mining have untapped potential due to legal uncertainty that limits reuse. By providing liability protections for the sale of previously mined phosphate lands, this legislation removes barriers to repurposing them for new opportunities.”
Now they’re back to try it one more time. The Florida House is so eager to please this major campaign contributor that it’s already held two committee meetings on HB 167. Both of the hearings occurred last year, before the session began this week.
I watched a video of the Judiciary Committee meeting from last November. This bill was the only item on the agenda. The discussion took less than 10 minutes, and then every member of the committee voted yes.
Holding the two committee votes before the start of session means the bill is teed up for fast passage this week. Then it will head to the Senate, where Senate President Ben Albritton is already on board.
Since the skids are so obviously greased for this bill, I say everyone should jump on board – but only if Mosaic agrees to one teeny amendment.
I think the only way the company should avoid being socked with a major monetary penalty is if it agrees to give every person who buys some of its reclaimed land a full hazmat suit to wear while occupying the property.
Then they should run a series of glowing TV ads about it.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Phosphate-mining-via-DEP.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 00:57:25.575169

What began in late December 2025 as nationwide protests driven by economic collapse has become a deep political revolt. Across cities large and small, ordinary Iranians are calling for fundamental change. The regime has responded with escalating brutality. This response shows its fear and weakness.
Information from inside Iran suggests the death toll is staggering. More than 12,000 protesters have reportedly been killed by security forces since the uprising began. These figures come from human rights groups and on-the-ground sources reporting under blackout conditions. Many more have been arrested, disappeared, or injured amid heavy use of force.
Security forces including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Basij militia have fired live ammunition into largely unarmed crowds. Hospitals across the country report hundreds with serious gunshot wounds. The regime has imposed near-total internet shutdowns to hide the violence from the outside world and isolate protesters within Iran.
The sheer scale of the crackdown has alarmed international human rights bodies. United Nations officials have expressed grave concern over mass detentions, threats of execution, and the escalating use of lethal force against civilians.
This uprising goes beyond economic grievances. Protesters are rejecting all forms of dictatorship. They want an end to theocratic rule and reject monarchy as well. Demonstrations have featured chants rejecting both clerical rule and any return to monarchy. Iranians are calling for a secular democratic republic governed by the people, not by clerics or kings.
At the core of these protests is a clear demand. The Iranian people insist on their right to freely choose their future government. They reject any system imposed by force, ideology, or heredity. Their struggle is not for reform within dictatorship, but for a representative government rooted in popular sovereignty and the rule of law.
Reports from opposition networks show that protests have spread to hundreds of cities and towns. The movement reflects a unified demand for systemic change and an end to authoritarian rule.
The regime’s response reveals both terror tactics and deep insecurity. It has relied on mass arrests, lethal force, internet control, and threats of execution against those who dare to stand up. State media attempts to portray the unrest as chaos or foreign-inspired. Yet protesters continue to mobilize despite extreme risk, driven by a determination to reclaim their future.
Despite the danger, the spirit of resistance continues. Iranians inside the country and in the diaspora are calling for a unified push toward a democratic and secular future. Their actions reflect a widely recognized principle: people living under tyranny have the right to resist oppression.
The international community must do more than issue statements of concern. It must recognize the Iranian people’s legitimate right to resist a brutal and unaccountable regime and to determine their own political destiny without interference or imposed alternatives.
The world cannot afford to ignore these demands. With thousands of lives lost, the Islamic Republic’s systematic violence against its own people requires a firm and principled international response. Respect for human rights, self-determination, and justice must be central to any engagement with Iran.

D’Amico,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/15/lets-stop-ignoring-whats-happening-in-americas-nursing-homes/,"Elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes is not a mystery, not a surprise, and not an accident. It is the predictable, inevitable outcome of our system.","Let’s tell the truth. Elder abuse and neglect in nursing homes is not a mystery, not a surprise, and not an accident.
It is the predictable, inevitable outcome of a system that allows the squeezing of profit from the bodies of the elderly while far too often delivering poor care in return. And just when the crisis reached a breaking point, our federal government made it worse.
As reported by MedPage Today (“HHS Officially Rescinds Nursing Home Minimum Staffing Rule,” Joyce Frieden), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officially rescinded the national minimum-staffing rule enacted in May 2024 that required nursing homes to provide at least 3.48 hours of care per resident per day and to have a Registered Nurse onsite 24/7.
Those protections were not luxuries. They were the minimum needed to keep residents safe and alive.
Patient-advocacy organizations called the decision “very disappointing,” warning that this repeal returns us to a status quo where residents will continue “suffering and dying because nursing homes are not staffed adequately.” They are right.
We know ;exactly what understaffing does, because we have been fighting this system for more than 35 years.
We have represented countless families whose loved ones were injured, abandoned, or betrayed by facilities that promised safety and delivered suffering. We have spent decades hearing the same lines — “falls just happen,” “bedsores are unavoidable,” “we did the best we could.”
But let’s be clear about something critically important: frontline staff are not the enemy. Many aides, nurses, and caregivers desperately want to provide good care. Some cry on their way home, knowing they couldn’t reach all of their residents. They are victims too — trapped in a system where too often administrators, management companies, and private-equity bosses understaff facilities to maximize profit.
These workers are not the cause of the crisis. They are casualties of it. The abuse is not hidden. It has just been ignored for far too long.
Here’s what “cost-cutting” looks like behind closed doors:

A man on a restricted-diet chokes to death because her aide was untrained or never given the essential instructions for her care.
A woman with dementia falls again and again because no one answers call lights for an hour—or longer.
A resident who cannot walk or speak appears with fractures, bruises, and internal injuries… and the facility shrugs.
Bed sores rot into bone because staffing is so low that no one has time to turn a patient.

These are not rare tragedies. They happen too frequently in facilities that know they are understaffed, undertrained, and unsafe — and simply do not care enough to fix it.
And now, thanks to the HHS decision, they no longer will have to meet a national basic safety floor.
We have allowed a system that treats human beings as disposable.
For decades, the elderly have been treated as if they are somehow “worth less” because they are frail or nearing the end of life. Insurance companies argued it openly, while many injury lawyers told families that their loved one’s suffering “didn’t have much value,” and that bringing a lawsuit was not practical.
This is morally wrong and frankly not what we all know to be true.
An elderly person’s life does not shrink in value when their body weakens. Their dignity does not evaporate when they lose the ability to speak, hear, or feed themselves. Their humanity does not vanish when they enter a nursing home.
If anything, the opposite is true: the more vulnerable someone is, the fiercer our obligation to protect them.
Where are our lawmakers? Where is the outrage?
The truth is already in plain sight:

Staffing ratios are dangerously low.
Training requirements need strengthening.
Regulators are understaffed.
Penalties are weak and delayed.
Corporate owners are not held accountable in a meaningful way. 
And now, federal minimum-staffing protections have been gutted.

 And people are dying because of it.
Accountability must finally mean something. We need to stop pretending civil fines and sternly worded letters will fix this. They won’t.
What will?

Mandatory staffing ratios tied to resident acuity
Criminal charges — not just civil penalties — when neglect leads to serious injury or death
Transparency in ownership, finances, and staffing
Real whistleblower protections and encouragement for staff who report abuse
Automatic suspension of licenses for falsified records
Public reporting of all injuries, not just the ones facilities choose to disclose — with significant penalties for failure to report

If a trucking company can face criminal charges when negligence kills someone, why can’t a nursing home?
If an airline can be grounded for safety violations, why can’t a facility that leaves residents to fall, fracture, choke, and die?
Lawsuits alone are not enough — but they matter. For 35 years, we have advocated for the elderly and lawsuits do matter when verdicts finally make neglect more expensive than prevention.
That is why nursing homes work so hard to keep these cases out of court. That is why they hide records, falsify charts, and pressure staff into silence. That is why they push families into arbitration agreements.
They fear the truth. And they should.
This is not just about the elderly. It is about us.  We are all headed in the same direction. If we allow this broken, cruel system to continue, we are condemning not only today’s residents — but our future selves.
This is not merely a fight for the elderly. It is a fight for what kind of society we choose to be.
Enough excuses. Enough silence. Enough injury and death.
We must demand bold reforms. We must insist on real oversight. We must hold corporations personally, financially, and criminally accountable. And we must reject the poisonous idea that an aging life is worth less than any other.
The elderly are not invisible. They are not disposable. They are ours. And it is long past time we acted like it.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A youth sports facility has come up as another potential use as part of a North Omaha business park site to be developed with help from a $90 million state grant.
Described as an indoor-outdoor multipurpose complex for “soft turf” sports — such as football, soccer, softball and baseball — the possible project would rise at the Enterprise Park near 16th and Locust Streets, a tract that had previously been downplayed because of environmental cleanup costs.

That area is one of three sites that a development team working with the Omaha Inland Port Authority is seeking to acquire for use as business parks. A community meeting was held Wednesday night to discuss the locations and to get input on what uses the community prefers at each.
Purchases by mid-February
Michael Maroney of the Omaha Economic Development Corp., which leads the private development team working with the port authority, said his team is moving to acquire all three sites. But nothing is final. He said purchases should be made by mid-February.
Maroney was pleased by the turnout of about 75 people and believes the community is getting excited for what is to come.

“We got good feedback,” he said. “We wanted to keep an open mind.”
For those attending the meeting at the Highlander Accelerator campus in North Omaha, the development team laid out possible uses at the three sites. 
The other two tracts and possible uses:

 A 13-acre site centered by a new 150,000-square-foot warehouse and 148-stall surface parking area at 5906 Abbott Drive likely would be leased to commercial tenants. Possible operations include a food hall, offices and event center. The development team compared its possible use to the multi-tenant Ashton Building in the Millwork Commons district in north downtown.
A roughly eight-acre site west of North 16th Street and north of John J Pershing Drive could be used for housing manufacturing, trucking and warehousing or other light industrial uses, said Garry Clark, executive director of the port authority.

Neighboring  sports complexes
The site envisioned as space for the sports complex also would contain an area for commercial businesses to settle, said George Achola, another representative of the private development team.
 

Community favorites
An electronic survey at Wednesday’s meeting asked which potential business park site was most exciting. The community picks, in order: 16th and Locust Streets tract; site near 16th and John J Pershing, 5906 Abbott St. property.
Also asked, What does success look like in the project? Top responses were job creation and community growth.



He said the location seems ideal for a youth sports facility that would complement another rising nearby, the $45 million Levi Carter Park Activity and Sports Complex along the north shore of Carter Lake in Levi Carter Park.
Achola said that nearby facility, to be owned and maintained by the City of Omaha, is to focus on a different set of sports — volleyball and basketball games played on hard courts. He said the two would mesh nicely.
It is likely, Achola said, that his development team would prepare a shovel ready site and an investor would build and operate the sports facility, but all options would be considered.
Achola believes an athletic facility aligns with the objective of the $90 million in state funding: to generate jobs and income for the North Omaha area.
“What North Omaha needs is an economic driver — something that allows people to spend money within the community. That will create jobs,” he said. 
Achola pointed to new youth sports facilities in places like Kearney. “A whole economic system grew up around that and those are jobs,” he said. 
‘Valuable piece of dirt’
Omaha port authority makes key hires, moves toward $90M state-funded business park project

The Nebraska Legislature directed $90 million from pandemic recovery funding to create a shovel-ready industrial business park. The Department of Economic Development and Gov. Jim Pillen in early 2024 awarded the grant funds to the development team led by Maroney’s Omaha Economic Development Corp., Burlington Capital and Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce. State law later was changed to require oversight of the project by the Omaha Inland Port Authority board. And the port authority board earlier this month released necessary funding to purchase the sites.
Asked about cleanup costs at the 16th and Locust Streets site, which was previously used as a dumping area, Achola said that has been a concern. But he said the value of the area is undeniable, as it is close to the airport, a lake, downtown Omaha and perhaps a professional soccer stadium.
“This is going to be one of the few opportunities you have to clean something up and make it an economic driver,” he said. “We’re going to reap the long-term economic benefits of bringing to life a valuable piece of dirt.”

Brown/Maryland Matters)The first day of the General Assembly is traditionally a time for more back slaps than broadsides, more applause lines than arguments, and opening day 2026 was no exception.
The actual business of the day took about an hour in the Senate, about and hour and a half in the House, as each chamber elected its leaders for the session, approved rules and read the first batch of bills across the desk — 231 in the Senate and 301 in the House.
Each chamber was packed with family members, former member and visiting state and local officials — and an international visitor in the House, where the ambassador of the Dominican Republic was on hand to witness the swearing-in of new Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), a native of the island and the first Afro-Latina leader of the chamber.
Peña-Melnyk spent a chunk of her nearly 30-minute speech heaping praise on former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), who was the first woman and first Black lawmaker to lead either chamber of the Maryland General Assembly when she was sworn in in 2019. She announced in early December that she was stepping down as speaker, but would retain her seat as a delegate.
“You have made it possible for someone like me, this little island girl inside, to come here and dream of this possibility,” Peña-Melnyk said to Jones, who was seated front-row center in the House.
“Onc day as we look at all these men in the chamber in these pictures, your picture, your portrait is going to be here,” Peña-Melnyk said, pointing toward the paintings of former House speakers, all men, that ring the chamber. “When little girls come into this chamber, Madam Speaker, your picture will be here and they can dream and they can see it’s possible. You did that.”
Ferguson, who enters his seventh session as leader of the 47-member Senate, spent 3-4 minutes of his roughly 10-minute speech delivering a short history lesson on America and the importance of state governments, as the country celebrates 250 years.
“This is the first time in humankind that this many people in a single country have operated under the same system of representative democratic government for this length of time. The American experiment has not been without significant challenges and extremely painful flaws,” Ferguson said. “That said, the fundamental promise, though, is of a better society over time that is rooted in justice, equality and opportunity has propelled our nation ever forward.”
Ferguson also highlighted lessons he learned from a legislative conference he attended last month in Ohio. Because of what’s going on in the federal government, he said action at the state level “is the only way … to restore people’s trust in government. States truly are the laboratories of democracy. It has been that way for 250 years.”
Most of the day’s speeches were not so weighty, however. Much of the floor time was taken up by lawmakers lauding the nominees, interrupted often by standing ovations. Leaders thanked their families, their constituents, their staff and others.
They often joked with members of their chambers or visitors. After Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) was unanimously chosen to remain as president pro tem of the Senate, he thanked Ferguson “for his confidence and partnership and his haircut. It’s very fresh. I didn’t notice that earlier. It is quite fresh.”

Ferguson returned the compliment when he was unanimously reelected as president of the 47-member chamber, telling Augustine, “I don’t know if my haircut is as good as yours.”
In the House, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott was tagged twice, by Peña-Melnyk and by the new speaker pro tem, Del. Luke Clippinger  (D-Baltimore City).
Peña-Melnyk, to illustrate the problem of high utility bills, told the story of how her daughter keeps the thermostat in her Baltimore home “at 60 degrees, because her last utility bill was more than $300, Mr. Mayor,” as she turned to Scott. When that drew laughter from the chamber, she quickly added, “It’s not his fault.”
Clippinger, whose job it was to introduce all the guests, prefaced his introduction of Scott with, “Is this a good time to talk about the potholes on…” before introducing “the mayor of the great city of Baltimore, Brandon Scott,” to laughs.
“We’ll talk later,” he added as an aside.
After that it was time for photos and handshakes with the local and federal officials who packed each chamber,  and then on to the half-dozen receptions being held around the State House by lobbyists and interest groups.

 No cred in State House credentials
But getting to the day’s events in the first place proved a challenge for reporters, lobbyists and some staff, who learned for the first time Wednesday morning that the police-issued credentials that normally let them bypass the weapon detection systems at the State House and legislative office buildings were useless.
As the state works out the kinks in a new AI detection system, badge holders — who are subject to background check by Maryland Capitol Police before a credential is issued — were told they had to wait in line to pass through security, credential or no.


The Maryland-Delaware-District of Columbia Press Association, after getting an inquiry about the issue from Maryland Matters, sent a letter to state officials expressing “deep concern” about the unannounced changes.


“Historically, credentialed members of the press who have completed criminal background checks and obtained official press badges have been permitted to enter these buildings without passing through metal detectors,” MDDC Executive Director Rebecca Snyder wrote.

	“This policy has long recognized the realities of newsgathering: reporters are often entering and exiting buildings multiple times a day to cover matters of public importance, and their work is frequently time-sensitive,” she wrote. “These journalists are clearly identified, vetted, and credentialed by the state.”


The change in policy was not previously announced to the State House press corps, the press association, lobbyists or others with credentials who were affected. Snyder called the opening day roll out “an unpleasant and concerning surprise to learn this morning that members of the press are now required to wait in general security lines—sometimes dozens of people long—to enter public buildings.”


“In recent weeks, Maryland Capitol Police have been seen in the State House engaging in SWAT training and the new system was installed,” Snyder wrote. “While framed as a safety measure, this policy change raises serious concerns about freedom of the press…. The new requirements instead create unnecessary barriers to timely newsgathering, delaying access to public proceedings and information that the public has a right to receive. Over time, such barriers risk chilling coverage of government activity and undermining transparency.”
A spokesperson for the governor said they were working on fixing the problem and that, for the time being, reporters and others with credentials could jump to the front of any line when they needed to get into one of the buildings.

Let the rallies begin
Before the floor sessions began, another part of Annapolis legislative life was already sliding into gear, with a rally on Lawyer’s Mall.
On Wednesday, it was the Chesapeake Climate Action Network that handed out dozens of posters made to look like solar panels, as speakers touted the Affordable Solar Act, which would direct funds already being collected from utility companies toward new solar energy projects.
Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery), the bill’s sponsor, said the bill is partially a response to policy changes from President Donald Trump’s (D) administration. This July, a key federal tax credit for solar projects will disappear, as a result of the “Big, Beautiful Bill.”

“This year, the new threat is Trump and the MAGA regime that is hell-bent on lining the pockets of their fossil fuel buddies, and creating a petrol state in the United States of America — and we will not stand by while that happens,” Charkoudian told the rally.
As she spoke, rally-goers, including dozens of seniors representing Third Act Maryland, held signs with messages like “The Future Runs on the Sun.”
Robin K. Dutta, executive director of the Chesapeake Solar and Storage Association, a trade group for solar developers, said that his group — and the industry — weathered the storm the last time that Congress cut solar tax credits, in 1986.
“We survived the first one. We’re going to survive the second one,” Dutta said. “But here’s how we thrive: We thrive because of the tireless work in state capitals like Annapolis.”
This year might provide a unique opportunity for climate advocates hoping to make their case. With high utility bills at the center of debate, climate groups are arguing that solar and battery storage are the cheapest and quickest ways to add energy to the grid — as opposed to new fossil fuel or nuclear facilities.
“I have a good feeling for the 2026 legislative session,” Charkoudian said.

Candelora, R-North Branford, sat side by side Wednesday night, amiably talking before a live audience about a working relationship that survives partisan differences. In some capitals, that alone would make news.
Had the event occurred in Washington, D.C., featuring their congressional counterparts, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the city would have been abuzz. A week ago, Axios reported their shaky ceasefire was no more, and “the smack talk has gotten personal.”
Not so in Hartford, where Ritter and Candelora are in the sixth year of a legislative bromance of sorts. They are not averse to occasional smack-talking, but it’s always over their significant policy differences. As they say in the oft-quoted “The Godfather,” “It’s not personal, it’s strictly business.”
On Wednesday, they sat for public questioning by John Dankosky as part of The Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” series with the state’s elected leaders. Sprinkled through the audience were lobbyists who, like journalists, make a study of the Ritter-Candelora dynamic.
Thirty minutes into the one-hour conversation, they disagreed forcefully, albeit respectfully, over the state’s Trust Act and its various revisions, which limit official cooperation with federal ICE agents carrying out the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. 
Candelora called the crackdown “a politically charged disaster.” 
But he faulted Connecticut’s laws as far too restrictive on the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with ICE, and he suggested that the tactics of some protesters are putting people in harm’s way, leading to fatal confrontations, like the shooting of Renee Good.
“What we saw with the killing in Minnesota, you know, that woman had no intention, I’m sure, of hitting an officer with her car,” Candelora said. “I think she also did not believe that she was going on a suicide mission.”
Ritter seemed relieved at the opportunity to disagree. Both men are mindful that their constructive working relationship can be double edged: Are they too cooperative? Does cooperation equate with a less-than-aggressive defense of the core differences between the Democratic majority and Republican minority?
“I don’t agree with what Vinnie just said, right?” Ritter said. “I’m proud of the Trust Act laws that we passed, and I think we should focus on the most dangerous people, whether they be American citizens or not.” He added, “Let there be no mistake. We don’t agree on everything. But I’m almost so glad that question came up and you could see that there are differences, and this is how you deal with it.”
There is potential for sharp differences this year in the three-month legislative session that opens on Feb. 4.
Ritter said the Democrats plan to implement no-excuse absentee voting, something possible due to an amendment to the state Constitution passed by voters in 2024. 
Despite vehement opposition from parents who home-school their children, Ritter said legislators also will be looking at limited new oversight of homeschooling, which now is virtually unregulated.
The impetus is the shocking case last year of a 32-year-old Waterbury man who authorities say was held captive by his stepmother after she pulled him out of school when he was 11. The family had interactions with child welfare authorities, but no one investigated the boy’s disappearance from school.
“If you’ve had a lot of interaction with DCF and law enforcement, you just suddenly withdraw your kid. We might need to have better follow-up on that,” Ritter said. “That might get really ugly, Republican versus Democrat. I think it depends how it gets drafted.”

Both leaders said school funding formulas also will be on the table, as will the state’s continuing struggle to meet the challenges created by federal spending cuts and other actions, some of which come with little notice and no explanation. Ritter and Candelora share frustration over the unpredictability coming from Washington.
Candelora said he and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, wrote the Trump administration, questioning the rationale for twice shutting down construction of the offshore Revolution Wind project. Each time, a federal judge lifted the stop-work order.
Similarly, Candelora said, there was no explanation for why a provider of behavioral health services to schools in his district was informed this week that $600,000 in federal funding was being canceled, effectively immediately.
“They have not been given a reason to why that money has been clawed back,” Candelora said.
Candelora was among the Republicans who joined Democrats in creating a $500 million fund to respond to federal cuts, which can be spent at the discretion of Gov. Ned Lamont until the start of the session.
Ritter became speaker five years ago, the same time that Candelora became the Republican minority leader. But they developed a relationship earlier, working on a  bipartisan budget in 2017 that broke a protracted stalemate in Ritter’s first session as majority leader, his first leadership post.
Ritter was dubious about Republican overtures to be part of a budget deal, which would take away one of any minority party’s key tools: the ability to criticize the more unpopular portions of a tax-and-spending plan.
“Matt was the majority leader, and he came to me and he said, ‘You guys really serious about negotiating this? Are you just going to pull the rug out at the last minute?’ And that was at the very beginning of negotiations,” Candelora said.
Comptroller Sean Scanlon, a mutual friend, vouched for Candelora as substantive and trustworthy, Ritter said. 
At the time, Scanlon was a state representative from Guilford, a community that Candelora also represents. He met Candelora on election night in 2014, when he won his first term defeating a candidate backed by Candelora. Scanlon was impressed when Candelora stopped by his victory party.
“It’s nice to meet you, and I want you to know we’re going to work together on behalf of this town,” Scanlon recalled Candelora telling him. “And there was never a day after that day that I did not have a truly productive, good working relationship with him.”
Scanlon said Ritter and Candelora are institutionalists — “two guys who believe in the importance of institutions running well and who believe that the foundational principle of it running well is trust and communication, even when you disagree ideologically over things.”
Candelora, 55, was elected in 2006 to the 86th House District of Durham, East Haven, Guilford and North Branford. The district is 88% white, and the poverty rate is 3%.
Ritter, 42, was elected in 2010 from Hartford’s 1st District, representing the West End, Asylum Hill and a few blocks of the North End. As a white man, he is a racial minority in a district where one in five residents are white. The poverty rate is 25%, and half the population is considered low income.
Their political differences are many. Like every other Republican, Candelora opposed the omnibus housing bill passed in special session last year. But Ritter was stumped when Dankosky asked for an example of a difference that was especially difficult. Candelora was not.
“The religious exemption,” Candelora said.
“Oh, yeah,” Ritter said.
Their differences on Ritter’s successful push to end religious exemptions for school-age vaccinations were heated and unusually public. Mothers opposed to the vaccination mandate filled the Legislative Office Building, and the dispute became a national story.
The debate in the House stretched past midnight, a rarity during Ritter’s time as speaker.
“It was a difficult process to negotiate, and you had people very impassioned on each side,” Candelora said. “You couldn’t get consensus. And, you know, then it became the challenge of having to somehow figure out a way to turn the temperature down and get the bill to a vote.”
There was a compromise over the timetable for implementation, and the bill finally came to a vote.
Democrats hold a 102-49 advantage in the House, but Ritter said he soon will consult with Candelora about the Democratic agenda, if only to give him a heads up and inquire about potential areas of compromise or common ground.
“I can, because we’ve been dating for a while now,” Ritter said straight-faced, pausing briefly for the inevitable laugh. “I got a sense of where I think I could engage with him and where I probably couldn’t.”
At some point in the next three months, Candelora undoubtedly will denounce some element of that agenda, either over its substance or out of a need to rally a small GOP minority.
“I have to understand that Vinnie has a job, right?” Ritter said. “He’s got a job to do, and I have a job to do. I think we know that.”
It will upset some people at the state Capitol, but not the speaker or minority leader.
“A lot of people up there are much more sensitive,” Ritter said. “Vinnie and I have lost all sensitivity.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)More than 200 gathered Wednesday evening in Raleigh’s Moore Square to mourn Minneapolis activist Renee Good and to condemn ICE for her death and other violent encounters in recent months.
The candlelight vigil, organized by Siembra NC, included a call to prayer, the singing of the spiritual “Gospel Plow,” and remarks from activists and lawmakers. Mourners shielded their candles from the wind on a blustery night where temperatures hovered around 40°F. Some struggled to relight them after gusts blew them out.
The group held accompanying vigils in Charlotte, Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina.
Good’s fatal shooting by an ICE agent has sparked protests and condemnation across the U.S., including calls from members of Congress for U.S Dept. of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or be impeached. Thousands demonstrated in Minneapolis last week to demand accountability for the shooting.
Alissa Vermilion, among those at Wednesday’s Raleigh vigil, said she came out to show her anger over violence by ICE.
“I’ve been outraged almost from the beginning about how brutal and how unaccountable ICE has been,” she said. “It’s infuriating to know that the only thing that I can do is to come out and peacefully protest and remember and hope that it’s enough to stop the brutality.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the protests. Noem and other officials have argued the ICE agent shot Good in self-defense during a vehicular assault, though video of the incident seems to show her steering away from the officer.
Wednesday’s demonstration blended memorial with protest. Attendees held small candles and bowed their heads for a moment of silence. Some raised signs reading, “We saw the video,” and “No PolICE State.” Some, concerned for their safety, wore masks to hide their identity.
John Arndt, who said he has been protesting the Trump administration since last spring with the grassroots anti-Trump group 50501, said he believes Good is the “tipping point” to turn Americans against ICE. “She wanted to make a difference. She made the ultimate difference,” he told NC Newsline.

Nikki Marín Baena, co-founder of Siembra NC, told the crowd that it was up to them to keep immigrants and legal observers safe from violence.
“El mañana debe prometerse a todos. Tomorrow should be promised for everyone,” she said. “Tonight we hold space for those whose tomorrow was stolen by federal violence in this last year. We say their names.”
In addition to Good, she asked the demonstrators to honor Silverio Villegas González, Keith Porter Jr., Jaime Alanis Garcia, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez, and Joe Castro Rivera, all of whom were allegedly either killed by ICE agents or died from other causes as they fled from encounters.
She also highlighted the case of Edwin Godinez and Yair Napolés, two U.S. citizens who say they were assaulted by ICE officers during a stop in Salisbury, North Carolina last week. Video from their phones appears to support their claims.
State Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) said she and her Democratic colleagues will introduce the Making Enforcement Liable and Transparent, or MELT, Act in the legislature’s short session, aiming to prohibit federal law enforcement from wearing masks, block immigration detentions at churches, hospitals and schools, and open ICE and Border Patrol to civil litigation at the state level for violating North Carolinians’ rights.
“The burden is now on the states to protect our communities from the invasion of ICE and CBP. It is up to us state legislators to step up as fundamental American liberties like the right to assembly, due process and the rule of law are threatened,” she said.
Any successful measures to restrict ICE are unlikely to advance in the current North Carolina General Assembly, however, with a sizable Republican majority controlling both chambers.
In an interview after the vigil, Marín Baena said Siembra NC is discussing what precautions may help keep its trained community observers safe in the wake of Good’s death. Observers in Minnesota have made changes, but none have been implemented yet in N.C.
She said she was surprised by the “incredible” turnout in Raleigh.
“I wasn’t expecting so many people with the cold. But I think it does confirm what we thought, which is that a lot of people don’t want to see this in our community,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1145243-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 23:57:33.435047

Patrick Morrisey gives his second State o the State address at the state Capitol in Charleston, West. Virginia on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday delivered the 2026 State of the State address, doubling down on his request for an income tax cut and asking the Legislature to fund flood prevention.
It was the governor’s second State of the State address, and the hour-long speech struck a tone similar to his first, including praising President Donald Trump. While the speech was broken up into nearly 20 different topic areas — everything from broadband infrastructure, energy policies and flooding preparation to drugs, the border and small government — details and specific policies on those issues were sparse.
While he celebrated previous efforts to decrease rights for transgender people, cut red tape for businesses and expand school choice initiatives, no new information or next steps were shared regarding those efforts or several others. 
As opposed to last year — when a $400 million budget deficit loomed — Morrisey said that the state’s current ​​$128 million budget surplus will allow for more leeway in funding priorities. He was clear, however, that the state budget will remain “flat,” as it has in recent years.
Specifics that were given focused on increasing funds for certain projects, including $100 million dollars to supplement road and bridge repair work and $20 million to improve state parks.
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia
Morrisey wants lawmakers, who gaveled in Wednesday, to approve a 10% cut to the state’s personal income tax, pointing to budget surplus as reason to push it through. 
“We are also asking the Legislature to conform with the permanent tax changes signed into law by President [Donald] Trump,” he said. “Members of the House and Senate, we can afford this tax cut.”
Sen. Mike Oliverio, R-Monongalia, said lawmakers will have to see how a proposed tax cut “looks on paper.” The governor has already asked agencies to cut their budgets this year and some are facing a significant loss of federal funding due to Trump’s budget cuts.
“We’re going to have to hear a lot more to understand how we’re going to cut agencies by 2%, but reduce taxes by 10%,” Oliverio said. 
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said he wasn’t sure a tax cut was fiscally responsible, pointing to the state’s declining revenue collections.
“That seems like we don’t really have a plan. We’re just doing things for campaign fodder, right?” he said. 
The governor also requested a 3% pay raise for all state workers.
Sen. Brian Helton, R-Fayette
Flooding prevention is also a priority for Morrisey, and he asked lawmakers for $10 million to fund a new flooding preparation initiative that aims to modernize how the state detects flood risk and warns the public. 
“By expanding sensors in key areas, we can build predictive models and react to leading indicators instead of lagging indicators,” Morrisey said. “Those forecasts promise to identify flood risk one to six hours ahead with a target accuracy of more than 90%. This is about protecting lives.”
Sen. Brian Helton, R-Fayette, said the flooding prevention money was fantastic news for Southern West Virginia. 
“We were devastated through Wyoming, McDowell County, parts of Raleigh and even Fayette County. We took a big hit this last year,” he said. “To hear the governor’s remarks tonight, and that funding is available, means so much to our families and our communities. I’m just really
excited about it.”
Morrisey didn’t share plan for skyrocketing utility costs  
While the governor opened his speech lamenting “significant increases in all forms of energy” prices for West Virginians and an ever-growing need for more electricity production, Morrisey did not share any plans or thoughts on how the state should control those costs for consumers.
Republicans in the state House of Delegates have said they want to prioritize legislation this session to ease the burden of increased energy prices on residents. To date, however, no specific legislation has been shared that would do so.
Morrisey lauded last year’s passage of House Bill 2014 (the microgrid and data center bill) and his still-to-be-developed “50 by 50” plan, which aims to see the state increase its electric generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050. 
He did not, however, announce any new energy-related policies he would like to see explored or adopted by the Legislature.
Little focus on West Virginia’s poor health outcome 
For a second year, there was little focus given on the state’s poor health outcomes or efforts to turn them around. Morrisey mostly spoke about his ongoing “Mountaineer Mile” initiative — which asks every resident to try and walk a mile a day — and lauded policies adopted last year to remove a list of colorful dyes from food (an effort that’s been held up in courts) and stop residents from purchasing soda with their federal food benefits.
Hornbuckle said it “was highly disturbing” that the governor didn’t talk about health care needs in the state.
West Virginia per capita in 2021 led the nation in deaths caused by cancer (184.7 deaths per 100,000), drug overdoses (90.9), diabetes (47.6) and kidney disease (25.8), according to mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The state is also set to lose federal Medicaid money that will impact hospitals’ budgets.
“We are set to lose over a billion dollars to health care. He did not talk about that. … It’s going to lead to rural hospital closures. That is something that really stuck out to me,” Hornbuckle said.
Regarding the state’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic, Morrisey shared no new priorities and instead praised Trump’s efforts to “secure” the nation’s southern border and “fight crime.”
Morrisey did not mention Certificate of Need repeal, a priority of his last year that resoundingly died twice in the state House of Delegates.
The most specific requests came from Morrisey asking lawmakers to “support” the new Rural Health Transformation Program by “advancing legislative initiatives” to “promote prevention, wellness and personal responsibility.” He said he wants to see student doctors trained on nutrition, more efforts to educate the public on “new dietary guidelines” and the reinstatement of the Presidential Fitness test.
Regarding the Public Employees Insurance Agency, Morrisey said Wednesday that progress has been made to slow the rising health care costs faced by state employees. He called on lawmakers to “work with me on real reforms” for the state insurance agency, but didn’t specify what those reforms might be. 
“I was pleased to see the commitment to the public employee pay raise, but really believe we need to do more than that, and we need to help them with their PEIA premiums,” Oliverio said. 
Later this year PEIA will raise health insurance premiums by 3%. In July, their rates went up by 14%. 
Many of the governor’s other requests had been previously announced in press conferences, including his idea to invest $6 million dollars for a “Bring Them Home Fund” to build “world-class centers of care” for foster children. Morrisey plans to bring hundreds of foster children living in out-of-state facilities back to West Virginia after opening the new in-state facilities. The state spent $70 million last year paying for foster children to live in out-of-state facilities around the country.
“This approach will save our state tens of millions of dollars and provide our children the stability, care and foundation they need to grow, heal, and prosper,” Morrisey said. “Let’s bring our kids home, where they belong.”

A campaign website went live with a donation page not yet active. She has yet to register as a candidate, a step required before raising or spending money.
WTNH, Channel 8 and the New York Post, which has published her columns, reported her announcement.
McCaughey makes her debut as a Connecticut candidate at age 77 with a profile in national right-wing politics but facing a difficult task for qualifying for public financing by raising $250,000 in small-dollar donations. 
The other two Republicans in the race, former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart and Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, have crossed the $250,000 threshold, and Stewart’s campaign already has received a convention grant of more than $800,000.
WTNH reported that McCaughey was asked by a woman if she could win the endorsement of President Donald Trump.
“I will say this,” McCaughey responded. “I’m running on my own, but it’s very possible President Trump will support me.”
The Democratic Governors Association was quick to associate her with Trump.
“Betsy McCaughey has spent the last years of her career shilling for Donald Trump’s deeply unpopular agenda that is driving up costs for middle-class families,” the DGA said. “The last thing Connecticut families need right now is a Trump mouthpiece as their governor.”
McCaughey grew up in Westport and returned to Connecticut after living in New York. She now resides in Greenwich. She was briefly married in the 1990s to Wilbur Ross, the wealthy financier and former U.S. Commerce secretary.
She has been broadly hinting at a campaign in recent weeks, visiting other Republican town committees and criticizing Gov. Ned Lamont over the high cost of living in Connecticut.
McCaughey read a poem that places her on the side of homeowners and property tax payers, not renters, WTNH said.
“I wrote a little jingle for you,” she said. “Owners vote red. Renters vote blue. Fight for homeowners. It will make a winner out of you.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC01321.jpg,,,2026-01-15 00:57:25.575169

Mike Braun delivered a State of the State speech Wednesday night that was heavy on achievements, light on new goals and with a few football callouts.
“With our strong business environment, it’s not surprising that another organization has noticed that Indiana is open for business: the Chicago Bears,” he said. “We are working hard to bring the Chicago Bears to the Hoosier State.”
But most of the address focused on affordability for Hoosiers — from electric bills and rent to property taxes and child care.
“Affordability is our highest priority,” Braun told General Assembly members gathered in the Indiana House chamber.
“Together,” he continued, “we can make Indiana the state where your dollar goes further, where opportunity abounds for all who are willing to work hard, and where every Hoosier worker can build the life they deserve.”
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray called it a good speech.
“He talked about some of the highlights and the really good story that Indiana has to tell,” he said.
Braun didn’t mention the bitter December redistricting battle that has strained some relationships in the Statehouse. Braun specifically said Bray and other Senate Republicans who opposed redistricting should lose their seats.
“There’s lots of hard things that happen in this place,” Bray said after Braun’s speech. “We are going to continue to come to work and do good work for Hoosiers, and look forward to working with the governor for that and with the House as well.”
Democrats pointed to numerous ways that Republicans are now hopping on the affordability bandwagon, giving examples of bills that the Democratic caucuses have offered in recent years but that Republicans rejected.
“If Statehouse Republicans wanted to lower cost, they would have already done that by now,” said House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta. “They’ve been in charge for the past 20 years, and Gov. Braun is catching up the fact that Hoosiers are struggling.
Backing these bills
Braun didn’t unveil a typical legislative agenda for his office, instead simply announcing support for several bills already moving through the legislative process.
For instance, he said he supports Republican Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to protect Hoosiers from unnecessary utility rate hikes.

While on the topic of energy, Braun issued a full-throated declaration of support for data centers. The behemoth centers have roiled numerous Indiana communities with Hoosiers concerned about electricity and water usage.
“AI is going to be key to the jobs and wages of the future, but data centers can’t stick Hoosiers with the power bill,” Braun said. “Companies that want big power in Indiana should pay their own way.”
That goal isn’t fully codified but rather an informal policy in negotiations for state support.
He specifically hailed Amazon building a $1.5 billion data center in northwest Indiana, saying “they’re going to pay for every cent of their power needs, and then some.”
Moving to homeownership, Braun said he supports a bill from GOP Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, to remove government hurdles and make it easier for Hoosiers to chase the American dream of owning a home.
“Home prices have surged because we aren’t building enough, and unnecessary regulations are driving up costs,” he said.
He also announced support for bills to limit cellphone use in schools; ensure that parents have veto power over their kids’ creating social media accounts; curb homelessness in public spaces and a constitutional change to make it easier to hold accused criminals in jail pre-trial.
Braun said affordable child care is needed to grow the Indiana economy and help Hoosiers get better jobs. But that specific priority item will have to wait a year.
“I look forward to digging in during the budget session (in 2027) on what we can do to invest in lowering child care costs,” he said. “I would like to see a program where businesses have skin in the game to help grow child care programs.”
But under his watch, the administration has cut reimbursement rates and capped child care vouchers for low-income parents. That has led to waitlists and day care centers closing around the state.
Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said child care deserts are spreading and parents are on waitlists for years.

“Costs are higher. Workers are leaving jobs they want because care does not exist. That did not happen by accident. It happened because child care was treated as an afterthought,” she said. “Child care is not an option, it’s an economic infrastructure.”
But GOP House Speaker Todd Huston pushed back, saying Republicans have passed measures to improve child are options, such as deregulation and tax credits for businesses to get involved.
“The best thing we can do is help support more supply and the government’s not going to be the best avenue to do that,” Huston said. “The best avenue to do that is reduce the regulations and let a lot of these folks that used to provide child care provide child care without having the burden of of all these government regulations that just do nothing but drive up costs.”
Kudos to Indiana
Braun also took time to list key accomplishments for his administration during his first year in office.
He reminded Hoosiers that he pushed a property tax bill that will save taxpayers $1.5 billion over the next three years. He has no plans for more property tax changes this year.
Braun pointed to cuts in state government that are making state agencies leaner and more efficient. He specifically applauded Indiana’s Medicaid program for finding $465 million in savings.
These savings have come through increased eligibility checks, tightened regulations and cuts to some programs.

“We’re continuing to deliver high-quality essential services that Hoosiers rely on, while you keep more of your money — because it’s not ours, it’s yours,” Braun said.
The education front also provided key highlights, with increased reading scores, a record-high graduation rate and new school accountability grades coming soon.
Braun also noted that Indiana’s real GDP is growing faster than the national rate and listed a string of big jobs announcements from recent months.
“Project after project, industry after industry, the story is the same: Indiana is the Midwest’s growth engine for more jobs and bigger paychecks,” he said.
Additionally, the governor listed public safety wins and efforts at retraining Hoosier workers.
Lawmakers gave two standing ovations for law enforcement and also included a “Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoosiers” chant at one point.
Braun ended the speech with a nod to the Indiana Hoosiers playing for the national college football championship on Monday night.
“My administration has people from up and down the state. We have Butler fans, Notre Dame fans, Purdue fans … but on Monday I expect to see all of them wearing cream and crimson. Go Hoosiers!”
He also said a 9-year-old from Shoals, Jack Gibson, asked whether the governor could delay the start of school on Tuesday morning so he could stay up late and watch the Hoosiers win on Monday.
“I like the sound of that,” Braun said. “I’ll leave it up to each school district to decide, but I think that sounds like a good idea.”

Gov. Tim Walz encouraged Minnesota residents to carry their phones at all times to record federal immigration actions, promising during a statewide address on Wednesday night that “accountability is coming” for abuses by federal officers.
“Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans, not just to establish a record for posterity but to bank evidence for future prosecution,” Walz said. 
Walz made the remarks during a six-minute address on Wednesday night as the state confronts a surge of between 2,000 and 3,000 agents, as well as widespread reports of violence against citizens and immigrants alike, including the killing of Renee Good last week. 
“News reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities,” Walz said. 
The Trump administration has only intensified its focus on immigration actions in the state since Good’s killing and calls by Democratic leaders to end it. 
Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration, alleging that the increased federal actions are unconstitutional and a violation of federal law. U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in a Wednesday hearing that there wasn’t enough time to make an informed ruling on state officials’ request for an injunction to stop “further legal violations and unlawful escalations” by federal agents reporting to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Walz renewed the call for ICE to leave on Wednesday evening, telling President Donald Trump and Noem: “End this occupation. You’ve done enough.” 
Walz and Minnesota Democrats have also condemned the administration for ending a joint investigation into the Good killing; the Department of Justice kicked the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension off the case, though local prosecutors say they’ll continue to investigate. A group of six federal prosecutors quit this week in protest over the U.S. Department of Justice’s push to investigate Good, her widow and their ties to anti-ICE activists, the New York Times reported.  
Walz warned the federal focus on Minnesota may only get more intense in the near future, pointing to Trump’s recent Truth Social post that said, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”
Walz encouraged Minnesotans to continue protesting peacefully and said this operation can’t last forever.

The oral arguments presented by Peters’ attorneys and the state attorney general’s office to the Colorado Court of Appeals, the state’s second-highest court, were the latest episode in a scattershot campaign of legal maneuvering and political coercion seeking the release of the prominent election conspiracy theorist, who is serving a nine-year sentence in state prison for her role in a 2021 breach of her office’s secure voting equipment.
A Mesa County jury convicted Peters on multiple felony counts in a 2024 trial during which the county’s former top elections official continued to spread conspiracy theories about voting machines, including in a rambling 40-minute statement just before her sentencing.

But Judges Craig Welling, Ted Tow III and Lino Lipinsky de Orlov of the appellate court raised concerns about that trial during Wednesday’s hearing, questioning whether an improper jury instruction led to Peters’ conviction on a felony charge despite drawing language from a misdemeanor statute. More broadly, the panel appeared sympathetic to arguments made by Peters’ attorneys that her sentencing — which followed statements made by presiding District Court Judge Matthew Barrett calling Peters a “charlatan” who peddled “snake oil” — violated her right to free speech.
“My read of the (sentencing) transcript is that the judge considered that, and it went into the calculation of the sentence,” Welling said. “And that’s a First Amendment problem.”
He added that the issue “fundamentally calls into question the fairness of the sentence.”
 Peters’ appeal asks the court to dismiss the case against her entirely, or else remand it to the district court for further proceedings.

Question of jurisdiction
Since President Donald Trump’s return to power in 2025, Peters’ allies, including senior administration officials, have worked to bring about her release through a series of overlapping legal maneuvers, including the appeal of her criminal case; a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court; a Department of Justice request seeking her transfer to federal custody; and a presidential pardon that does affect her state-level conviction.
Though the Court of Appeals case is a direct appeal of her criminal conviction, Peters’ attorneys have also sought to use it as a venue to test an unsupported legal theory holding that the presidential pardon power applies to state charges. A filing in the case last month asked the court to “enter an order indicating that it lost jurisdiction and finding that … the Pardon which was issued on Dec. 5, 2025, was effective and vitiated the convictions against Tina Peters in the State of Colorado.”
The pardon issue wasn’t raised at all during Wednesday’s hearing. John Case, one of Peters’ attorneys, instead reiterated a handful of other arguments made in briefs before the court, including a claim that Peters was immune from prosecution under the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause because she was carrying out her duty to preserve election records under federal law — and, further, that the merits of such an argument can’t be decided by state courts.
“Our position is that state courts have no jurisdiction to determine supremacy clause immunity,” Case said.

That prompted a bemused reaction from the appellate judges, who noted that two federal courts had previously rejected attempts to remove Peters’ criminal trial to the federal level.
“If you’re right, and we can’t decide it — then doesn’t the conviction just stand?” Welling said to Case. “I’m not sure you really want what you’re asking for.”
Erroneous language
The charges on which Peters was convicted included a felony count of conspiring to commit criminal impersonation, stemming from her misrepresentation of election conspiracy theorist Conan Hayes as a county employee, Gerald Wood, during the 2021 secure elections software update at the center of the case.
Peters’ indictment, and the instruction to the jury in her trial, erroneously included language drawn from the criminal statute for misdemeanor impersonation. The misdemeanor standard requires only that the crime “might” have exposed the impersonated individual to liability, while the felony charge requires the liability to be proved. The appeals panel noted that the felony conviction in question added 15 months to Peters’ prison sentence.

The state’s appellate brief contends that this is not a “reversible error,” because “the evidence overwhelmingly established that the conduct would and did subject Mr. Wood to criminal liability.”
“I am baffled as to the position that’s being taken — that we can somehow overlook that … because the evidence that was presented at trial would have supported the felony,” Welling said.
“I understand it’s a difficult position for the people to be in,” said Lisa Kay Michaels of the attorney general’s office, who represented the state.
Michaels also argued that the trial court judge’s comments during sentencing about Peters’ role in spreading election conspiracy theories was distinct from the reasoning he gave for the severity of her sentence.
“I think the court made some comments, and then, the court, if you look at the transcript, talks about the basis of the sentence, which is her criminal conduct,” she said.
Pressure on Polis
Concurrently with Peters’ legal appeals, the Trump administration has launched an unprecedented pressure campaign targeting Colorado, including the veto of a unanimously passed bill to fund a southern Colorado water project, the denial of two disaster declaration requests, and the proposed dismantling of Boulder’s National Center for Atmospheric Research. The moves follow Trump’s threat to take “harsh measures” against Colorado if Peters wasn’t released, and an unnamed senior official last month appeared to acknowledge their retaliatory motive in comments to the New York Times.
Since last year, Gov. Jared Polis has maintained that he will review any request for a pardon or commutation for Peters as he would any other request. But he appeared to go further in an interview with CBS Colorado last week, for the first time describing Peters’ sentence as “harsh.”
The comment has again raised alarm bells among Colorado elections officials, including Secretary of State Jena Griswold and the Colorado County Clerks Association, who in a joint letter Tuesday renewed their repeated requests to Polis not to grant leniency to Peters.
“Peters was found guilty of seven felonies and misdemeanors by a jury of her peers, in conservative Mesa County,” the letter said. “Today, she remains one of the only people to face real accountability for attacking American elections. She has taken no responsibility for her actions and has shown no remorse.”
The letter — signed by Griswold, CCCA director Matt Crane and Hayle Johnson, the Republican Jackson County Clerk and CCCA president — said a pardon or commutation of Peters’ sentence would “embolden election denialism in Colorado and across the country.”
“It would send a loud message to those who would attack our elections and democracy that they too may have immunity. It also would send the demoralizing message to those of us who protect our elections and democracy — our county clerks, their staff, election judges, and Secretary of State staff — that our work is meaningless.”

The cuts will make it more difficult for frontline groups to provide treatment and harm reduction care that has been crucial to combating overdose deaths, and breaking the cycles of addiction and housing insecurity. Resources like Narcan medication used to save lives by reversing overdoses, peer support, and treatment access could dry up, just as communities nationwide began to see reductions in overdose deaths.
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which issued the letters, hasn’t yet commented on the cuts. There are 30 SAMHSA-funded opioid treatment programs scattered across Wisconsin including in Appleton; Beloit, Eau Claire, Fond Du Lac, Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee, Oshkosh, Kenosha, and others, according to the agency’s website. One of those programs, Vin Baker Recovery, is named after a Milwaukee Bucks basketball team player and assistant coach.
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley condemned the sudden funding cuts. “The Trump administration’s cuts are not just numbers on a budget sheet; they are threats to the wellbeing of real people — our neighbors, our families, and our loved ones,” Crowley said in a statement. “While I will continue fighting for funding and resources to deliver results for our most vulnerable communities, the federal government must recognize the urgent need to preserve these vital services. These cuts cannot stand, because the lives of Wisconsinites depend on it.” 
A Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said that so far, no termination letters have been sent to the county. DHHS received $13.9 million in direct SAMHSA funds, with $6.2 million remaining as of December. The county also receives another $15.3 million in state mental health and substance use disorder grants which  partially consist of federal funding through SAMHSA.
In an emailed statement the spokesperson said that “any termination of SAMHSA funding would result in immediate termination of mental health and substance use services in Milwaukee County.” Wisconsin’s most populous county has no other funding alternatives, and the loss of federal grant money would lead to more hospitalizations and higher incarceration rates, the spokesperson warned.
Elizabeth Goodsitt, a spokesperson for Wisconsin’s Department of Health Services (DHS) wrote in an email statement Wednesday that the department was “notified late yesterday that effective January 13, the Tribes of Wisconsin Prescription Drugs/Opioid Overdose-Related Deaths Prevention Program (PDO) grant has been terminated by the federal government.” Goodsitt described this as “part of a much larger set of cancellations across the country for federally funded projects that provided life-saving mental health and substance use disorder services.” 
Wisconsin had received nearly $1 million to operate the PDO until August 2026. The program was in the third year of a five-year grant. “The goal of the PDO is to save lives,” said Goodsitt. “The funding supports training first responders and other key community sectors on overdose prevention strategies, and it supports the purchase and distribution of naloxone, the overdose reversal medication for opioids.” 
For now the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin and the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents have not received termination letters regarding SAMHSA funding. Native American communities are disproportionately affected by overdose deaths in Wisconsin at a rate of 75.4 people per 100,000 in 2023, as compared to a rate of 20 people per 100,000 for white Wisconsin residents. 
“We are assessing all avenues possible to ensure the federal government is following all requirements in these existing funding agreements,” said Goodsitt. “While there continues to be much uncertainty about this evolving situation, we will keep working to serve Wisconsinites and support their behavioral health needs. We will continue to closely monitor this situation and will share more information as it becomes available.”

Joseline A. Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel) is sworn in Wednesday as Maryland's House speaker. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s newly minted House speaker said she wants an ad hoc budget committee of senior legislative officials to meet on the budget Gov. Wes Moore (D) is expected to deliver to the General Assembly next week.
The governor vowed his spending plan would include general fund spending that is less than the current year as well as no tax increases, all while resolving a projected $1.5 billion budget gap.
The Senate will get the first opportunity to make changes to that budget.
House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) said in an interview at The Daily Record’s Eye on Annapolis opening day event, that she has asked for a series of regular meetings between the two chambers.
“What I want to do, and I have expressed this to the Senate president, is for us to come together early,” Peña-Melnyk said. “And we have actually agreed on putting together a budget committee where the Senate (president), myself and the chair and vice chair of the budget committees will meet with staff, so that we can have discussions first, right? It’s best not to have surprises, so that we can again, have a meeting of the minds and have agreement as well.”
Both presiding officers said they agreed with crafting a budget that does not increase taxes.
“People are having a hard time,” Peña-Melnyk said. “This is a session to find relief and to get help.”

The speaker in a meeting with reporters stressed her focus on “bread and butter” affordability issues, stressing that those were the most important issues that she believed needed to be tackled this year. She talked about a daughter who lives in Baltimore who has been keeping her apartment heated at 60 degrees because she cannot afford a higher utility bill.
“Those are the issues that people care about. It’s about energy right? Those energy bills. It’s about health care,” she said. “With everything that is happening at the federal level, people are very nervous. So this session, we have to really focus…. This session is about giving people relief, and that is my focus.”
Poll: Trump remains unpopular in Maryland
President Donald Trump remains deeply unpopular in Maryland, according to a poll released Wednesday.
“The numbers reveal a dynamic that feels baked into Maryland’s political DNA: A presidency that commands fierce devotion from a minority and equally fierce rejection from a minority,” Patrick Gonzales, director of the poll, said in a release.
In the poll by Gonzales Research & Media, 36% said they approved of the job the president is doing and 63% disapproved. Of that, 90% of Democrats rejected Trump’s performance. A roughly equal number of Republicans said they approved.
The poll of 808 registered Maryland voters who said they were likely to vote in 2026 was conducted between Dec. 21 and Jan. 6. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5%.
Trump’s approval numbers are nearly identical to his election results in the state in 2024, when the now-second-term president won 34% of the vote to then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ nearly 63%.
Six in 10 of those polled rated Trump’s handling of the economy as poor, while a combined 32% gave him “good” or “excellent” marks for the economy. The poll also found deep concerns about rising costs of living, with 67% saying costs were worse than last year. Another 24% said it was about the same. Just 9% said costs are better than last year.
Union wants better deal
Leaders of one of the state’s largest public employee unions called on lawmakers to do more to improve pay and working conditions for Maryland government employees.

The demands were part of a legislative package rolled out by leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees at a news conference an hour before the start of the 2026 General Assembly session.
“I want to be crystal clear about our demands and needs from the state leaders,” said Patrick Moran, president of AFSCME Council 3. “We must invest in our state government. We must protect public servants who show up every day, often in dangerous conditions and at the expense of time with their families to serve and protect Marylanders. Our membership keeps Maryland running, and it’s time the state’s budget reflects that reality.”
The union is one of the largest in the state with more than 50,000 members in Maryland, including roughly 26,000 in state government. It remains at odds with Gov. Wes Moore (D) after rejecting a proposed contract that would offer AFSCME workers a roughly 2% increase, which the union said does not keep up with inflation.
Moore said he will include the increase in the budget.
Moran said when his union’s employees do better the state does better.
“It is our job to ensure that state services are adequately provided for the people of Maryland, that they are resourced, and that the people doing those jobs have the resources they need in order to provide for their families, and they are not falling behind,” Moran said. “Any time that we’ve seen this over the years, especially during the previous administration, that if our members do not keep up with the rate of inflation, then community suffer because the economy, it all slides downhill.”
Republicans want more oversight of departments with bad audits
A recent batch of bad fiscal audits of some state agencies has House Republicans calling for an investigative committee.
“These weren’t things that we cooked up. These are things that came out of DLS [the Department of Legislative Services] and other places, and the numbers are staggering,” said House Minority Leader Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick). “I mean, we’re at a point now where we misplaced or misappropriated or are fraudulently overcharging billions of dollars. It’s insane. So we’re at a point now where Maryland citizens are demanding accountability.”

Over the last year, the Joint Audit Committee has received reports from Office of Legislative Audits outlining $761 million in unemployment insurance overpayments that cannot be clawed back, more than $300 million on unauthorized charges on highway projects receiving federal funding, and the death of a Kanaiyah Ward, 16, who was in state custody when her body was found Sept. 22 in a room at a Baltimore hotel.
Typically, legislative budget committees will withhold budget money to get departments to correct problems identified in audits. But Pippy and other lawmakers note that the amounts withheld are frequently inconsequential.
“We cannot simply wait for another additional audit to catch these activities, or for whistleblowers to come forward,” Pippy said. “Marylanders want and deserve answers now, the powers of any investigative committee are prescribed in statute and include the ability to subpoena, take testimony under oath, and hold individuals in contempt for failing to comply.”
Members of the joint audit committee have expressed frustration with agencies that have repeated audit findings. In November, Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen said the number of repeat findings has increased to 34%.
““I don’t think it’s more auditing that’s necessary,” Tanen told lawmakers at the time. “I think it’s more fixing that’s necessary. We provide the recommendations. Ultimately, it’s the agencies that are responsible for putting the fixes in place. And I think what we’re finding is whether it’s because of a lack of adequate IT or human resources that those agencies oversee, controls those they’re just not doing it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00677-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 03:58:10.559308

I.
The state troopers came first for Tupe Smith. 
They arrived in a pair on November 30, 2023, travelling a stretch of highway that starts in Anchorage but quickly becomes quite rural. They drove past a ski resort and a small shopping center, then turned off through a forested valley with no cell service, until they reached the entrance to the longest highway tunnel in the country: the portal to Whittier, Alaska. 
The one-lane tunnel, which carves 2.5 dark, musty, bumpy miles through a glacial mountain, opens for two 15-minute periods every hour, once for each direction; the troopers caught the 10 a.m. window heading east. On the other side, Whittier’s punishing microclimate—more snow than Aspen, Amazon-level rainfall, and almost nonstop wind—greeted them with cold, wet bluster.
This small port town was built by the military during World War II, as the U.S. warred with Japan. In the 1950s during the Cold War, the military constructed two gigantic housing structures, one of which is still in use: The 14-story complex, set back a few blocks from the waterfront, houses nearly all of Whittier’s roughly 300 residents. Inside this tower, people shop for groceries, get mail, attend church, exercise, and gather in community. The officers parked their Ford Explorer outside the complex. 
Smith is part of a large, tight-knit community of people who’ve moved to Whittier from American Samoa, a U.S. territory some 5,000 miles across the Pacific Ocean. She’s called this complex home for years, so when the troopers knocked at the door of her third-floor unit, she didn’t bother to look through the peephole before opening it; in Whittier, there are no strangers. 
She had just fed breakfast to her children, one a kindergartener and the other an 11-month-old. Her husband, Mike Pese, a first responder, had worked a late shift and was still sleeping.
“You got a few minutes to talk?” Sergeant Nathan Bucknall asked when Smith opened up. He read out her Miranda rights.

The month prior, on Oct. 3, Smith had been elected to the local school board. She hadn’t particularly wanted to run, but had been urged over several years by teachers at Whittier’s school, which serves grades pre-K to 12 in a single building. The student body is so small that some years nobody graduates. Though the school is mere steps from the apartment tower, students often commute via an underground walking tunnel connecting the two buildings. It’s possible to pass many consecutive days in Whittier without ever stepping outside.
Smith, a frequent volunteer at the school, revered educators from a young age; her aunt, a special-ed teacher, had always been especially good with Smith’s little sister, Eseta, who has Down syndrome. Growing up in American Samoa, Smith dreamed of becoming a teacher herself one day, and in 2011 enrolled in college courses to that end. But when Eseta’s medical needs outgrew American Samoa’s health care system, Smith dropped out of college and accompanied her sister to California. There, she connected on Facebook with Pese, who grew up in her village and had himself moved to the U.S. mainland, and they fell in love. The couple moved to Alaska in 2017 to be close to Pese’s mother Mili, a pillar of Whittier’s Samoan community who owns Kozy Korner, the grocery store inside the apartment complex, and leads youth services at the church in the basement. 
At the Whittier school, Smith read to and cooked for the kids, more than half of whom were Samoan. Smith speaks Samoan, so was a valuable aide to the many students who were still learning English. Her pancakes were a hit with the kids and, during the COVID pandemic, she prepared and delivered meals to their apartments.
There wasn’t much of a candidate pool in such a small town, so Smith was an obvious choice for the school board. She ran unopposed and won, with 106 votes.
And that, she learned, is what brought the Alaska State Troopers through the Whittier tunnel on that wet November morning. In registering to vote and filing to run, Smith violated election law, Bucknall explained. “The voting integrity system is actually held pretty high up,” he said. “It’s got to be protected.”
Unbeknownst to Smith at the time, she had no right to vote in Whittier elections, much less run for office. Though she was born in a U.S. territory, and has a U.S. passport and Social Security number, she is not a U.S. citizen. American Samoa is the only U.S. state or territory where people are born without automatic citizenship, and without the right to vote in state, federal, and most local elections anywhere outside of American Samoa.
Unlike people born in the other U.S. territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoans are classified simply as “U.S. nationals”—a sort of limbo state that acknowledges they are American by birth, but still denied the full rights and privileges of citizenship. 
Even though they pay taxes, owe “allegiance” by law to the United States, and can join or be drafted into the military—American Samoans have long served in and died for the U.S. military at exceptionally high rates—non-citizen American Samoan nationals cannot register to vote, run for office, serve on juries, or hold any job requiring citizenship. Unless they can claim citizenship through a parent or grandparent, American Samoan nationals must apply for citizenship as though they were immigrants. That process can be costly, confusing, and long.
As non-citizen nationals, they exist in a formal underclass of democracy that precludes them from, for one, running for a local school board.
“I’m not saying you murdered someone or anything like that, OK?” Bucknall told Smith. “Unfortunately, I have some bad news here: There’s an arrest warrant out for you.”
Smith told the troopers she had no idea she’d done anything wrong. The fine print of American Samoa’s exclusion from full participation in U.S. democracy is not well understood by most people—including many American Samoans themselves, and even most Alaska officials. “I know that I cannot vote for the president,” Smith told the troopers. “I didn’t know that I can’t vote for anything else.”
As the troopers handcuffed Smith in front of her son and baby daughter, her husband, Pese, fought the urge to lash out in her defense. She tried to conceal her hands under a jacket so that neighbors would not notice the cuffs when the troopers perp-walked her out of the building and into their SUV. Smith sobbed silently in the car, through the tunnel and over a rainy 72-mile drive to a jail north of Anchorage. Pese followed in his own car, pulling off only to withdraw $500 to bail out his wife. At the jail, Smith was ordered to strip naked, and cried while officers searched her. She sat alone behind bars in a jail uniform, waiting to make bail, and cried some more.
“I felt so embarrassed, because people looked at me as this really nice girl who helped do all this good stuff, go to church every Sunday,” Smith told me when we met in August in Whittier. “I thought that I was doing something good with my life, having my kids in this place and volunteering.”
Smith recalled that she could hardly speak on the car ride home from jail. “The experience was something that I never thought, at my lowest, that I would go through,” she told me. “Especially seeing my children cry when they took me out in cuffs.
“That broke me.”

II.
Almost a year passed before the troopers returned to Whittier, this time to cast a far wider net.
Smith’s arrest warrant included 10 felony counts of voter misconduct. The state took five of them to a grand jury, which rejected three charges and indicted Smith on two counts that each carry five-year prison terms. 
But it turned out she wasn’t the only U.S. national in Whittier who was unsure of their voting rights and vulnerable to prosecution. In the months following Smith’s arrest, Bucknall investigated dozens of her relatives and neighbors; Whittier became a target for officials eager to track down—and to punish—illegal voting. 
There has long been confusion around the voting rights, or lack thereof, of American Samoans in Alaska, where they make up a greater share of the population than in any U.S. state but Hawaii. And plenty of non-citizen nationals in Alaska had been voting for years. It had never been an issue, mostly because few people were aware any issue existed. 
Many American Samoans have come to Alaska, the second-nearest U.S. state to the Pacific Islands, for education, jobs, and health care. And over the years, candidates for offices major and obscure across the state have solicited their votes. Government officials who register people to vote have often registered American Samoans and failed to give residents the option to identify as non-citizen U.S. nationals on official forms. The Alaska DMV, which doubles as a voter registration office, admits it did not include that option on its forms until 2022—well after Smith, Pese, and others in Whittier first were registered. 
The state has also recently admitted that it registered an unspecified number of non-citizens to vote between 2022 and 2024. Alaska’s own mistakes are causing problems beyond just Whittier: A couple in Kodiak could now be deported over their erroneous registrations, according to a new lawsuit filed just last month. 
“Hardly anybody knows the difference between a citizen and a national. Only lawyers know that,” Margaret Stock, an immigration attorney in Anchorage representing the Kodiak couple, told me. “The Alaska DMV or other entities of Alaska’s government are registering people to vote when they’re not citizens; they do it all the time.” She told me she knows of “dozens and dozens” of cases in which the state registered people who were not eligible.
In 2022, a year before Smith’s election, some Samoans in Anchorage founded a nonprofit group called Pacific Community of Alaska to tackle health and social disparities that widened during the pandemic. Anchorage was about to hold a mayoral election, and the nonprofit realized that many American Samoans had no clear understanding of whether they were eligible to participate. So the group contacted Alaska’s Division of Elections with a simple query: Could American Samoan nationals vote in local and state elections?
Pacific Community says the Division of Elections claimed it didn’t know the answer, and that it referred the nonprofit to Anchorage’s municipal elections office, which said it also didn’t know, and referred the nonprofit back to the state. The 2022 election arrived and Pacific Community still had no clear guidance, so it shared none with its members; some people did end up voting under questionable eligibility. “The people interpreting the laws don’t even understand the damn laws,” Tafi Toleafoa, Pacific Community’s director, told me over the summer.
It was not until 2024 that the state finally sent the group a letter with a firm answer: “If a person who is not a U.S. citizen registers or votes, legal penalties could apply.”
Over several months of interviews with a wide variety of Alaska officials, including state lawmakers, local elected leaders, and law enforcement personnel, I found that very few of them could define a U.S. national and that most had no knowledge of what non-citizen American Samoans can and cannot do by right. 
John Coghill, a Republican state lawmaker from 1999 to 2021, who served at different points as majority leader of both statehouse chambers, told me he didn’t even learn of the democratic exclusion of non-citizen nationals until 2025. In all his years legislating on voting and elections policy, he said, “The Samoan issue didn’t even come up.”
Toleafoa told me she’s personally aware of “more than 100” non-citizen American Samoans in Alaska who have voted in state or local elections. I met several such folks myself. 
“I walked into an elementary school to vote; I showed them my Alaska state ID and they handed me a ballot,” said one non-citizen American Samoan woman in Anchorage, who requested anonymity out of fear she’d be punished like Smith. “Me just even telling my story worries me. There was misinformation. They were confused, I was confused.”
III.
Just before Anchorage held its 2022 election, as Pacific Community was seeking clarity, Whittier held its own local election. Many Samoans there, including Smith and her family, united around Dan Blair, a former Whittier mayor who was seeking a comeback. It was an important election for Whittier, which was, and still is, at an economic and cultural crossroads. 
The area is abundant in natural wonders—the town is ringed by mountains and glaciers and waterfalls, and sits at the head of a magnificent deep-water bay—but it has struggled to capitalize on its resources. The single-lane tunnel, which didn’t even open to road traffic until 2000, is a frail connection to the outside world, and the town has few commercial offerings for tourists: hardly any lodging, a handful of restaurants and gift shops and tour companies, and a beat-up waterfront that isn’t very walkable. 
Still, dozens of cruise ships dock in Whittier every year, usually as a final stop before travelers fly home from Anchorage. A new, second cruise terminal has just opened in town, promising a projected 150,000 more annual visitors. But Blair and his supporters fear it could prove more curse than blessing. He believes Whittier must grow its economy, and sees great potential for new shops and restaurants to cater to all these new tourists, but he wants commercial leases and licenses to stay local, lest big business enter and snatch Whittier’s soul in the process.
“We’ve almost gone bankrupt as a city, at least twice,” Blair told me over a few Bud Lights at a dive bar on the edge of town. He looks and sounds like a windblown Woody Harrelson.
“Every time we get enough money to build a swingset, the thieves show up and take it out of the tunnel,” Blair said. He grumbled about newcomers, so-called “gentrifiers” who, in his view, are moving in to fancify Whittier and price out poor and middle-class locals. Things may be trending that way already; units inside the apartment complex that not long ago sold for $30,000 now command four or five times that amount.
Blair, who is white, is popular with Whittier’s Samoan population and among many of the town’s old-timers. 
“He’s for the community,” Smith’s husband, Pese, told me. But Blair is unpopular—loathed even, in some cases—among many of the newer, upwardly mobile residents whom he distrusts. Still, in 2022, Blair managed to get elected by 13 votes, 66 to 53, against a candidate more closely aligned with town administrators pursuing an aggressive plan for Whittier’s development. Smith, Pese, and many of their relatives were proud to support Blair.
“Some of the older regime don’t like change and I really believe that is the bottom line. So they stymie it,” said Blair critic Kelly Bender, a 30-year Whittier resident and head of the local chamber of commerce, who also owns a boat-charter company and a cafe at the waterfront. “I think the new people, voices new to Whittier, would like to see Whittier move forward, improve options for business, improve the looks of Whittier, open the door.”

In a town so tiny, the Samoan families comprised a powerful voting bloc easily large enough to have swung the 2022 election in Blair’s favor. Some locals started to chirp about this, including on a private Facebook forum called “What’s What in Whittier,” a very active and sometimes combative page administered by some of the “new” voices Bender spoke of. 
News of Tupe Smith’s arrest, which happened about a year after Blair’s win, spread quickly through the town. Her criminal case inflamed suspicions of those who resented the Samoans’ place in local politics, and, on December 30 of 2023, exactly a month after she’d been arrested, the state Division of Elections received an anonymous complaint alleging that “‘a large family group, many of whom were not U.S. Citizens,’ had also registered, and had voted in a recent election,” according to state documents. 
The complaint was referred to the Division of Alaska State Troopers, and Bucknall, the sergeant who’d arrested Smith, began a nearly year-long investigation. He combed through Whittier’s voter rolls in search of non-citizens, then sent the list to the federal Department of Homeland Security, which, documents show, concluded that some Whittier voters were not citizens, while the status of some others was “unclear.”
On Sept. 5, 2024, another rainy day in Whittier, the Alaska State Troopers returned through the tunnel, this time with a dozen cars, one of which carried a police dog. It was a highly unusual show of force from a department that in recent years has complained of a staff shortage so severe that it has not had capacity to train some officers or to address certain serious crimes. 
The team spread across Whittier, surprising people at the waterfront, at the town gas station, by the tunnel, and at apartment doors.
Karen Dempster, who runs the post office in the lobby of the complex, told me, “I’d gone out to get something from my unit and I see all these troopers, some in plainclothes and others in uniform. I said, ‘Is there a problem?’ They didn’t want to talk. While they’re waiting for the elevator they’re calling out names on their list.” All the names were Samoan, Dempster noticed. 
The troops fanned out in pairs, one of which headed for Smith’s unit. This time, when the knock came, she peered through the peephole; she’d learned well by then to fear police. But the troopers weren’t there for her. They wanted to speak with her husband.
Video of their interrogation of Pese shows that the police were also confused. “I thought people of American Samoa were U.S. citizens,” Trooper Richard Chambers said, fiddling with Pese’s passport at the kitchen table.

Pese said he was nervous to answer questions the “wrong” way. He told the troopers that he had thought he could vote in Alaska elections, but not in federal ones, and that he only learned U.S. nationals could not run for office once his wife was arrested. 
Neither did Chambers’ partner that day, Jason Knier, understand the law: Now that Pese and his family knew they couldn’t run for office, Knier suggested, the next best thing might be to find another like-minded Samoan candidate in Whittier who was a U.S. citizen. “Help them get elected. Campaign for them. Hang up signs,” Knier advised. “You can vote for that position, right? Because you can still vote in the state election.” This botched interpretation of the law came almost an hour into the interrogation.
“No, that’s what got us here,” Chambers reminded his partner.
Similar interviews were playing out all over town. Pese and Smith’s text message groups began to light up. No one was arrested that day, but nine months later, in May of 2024, Pese and nine other family members—his mom, his twin brothers, and a slew of cousins—received court summonses in the mail. They were all accused of felony voter misconduct, along with perjury, and they were due to appear in court in Anchorage. They each now face up to 10 years in prison.
IV.
Pese wonders if much of this trouble might have been averted by simple public education. As a child growing up in American Samoa, he remembers being taught about righteous American wars and the basics of U.S. government structure; he vividly recalls a lesson on Gettysburg. But he doesn’t remember ever being taught in school about American Samoa itself—about its history and role in the broader American empire, about why people born everywhere else in the country are citizens by birthright.
“Everyone speaks Samoan over there, but the main subjects we all have to pass were English, writing, math, and history,” he told me. “In the history books we learned from, it has nothing to do with the U.S. territory.”
American Samoa became a U.S. territory in 1900, having been previously governed in a shared power agreement among the U.S., England, and Germany over what were previously united Samoan lands. After 1900, the islands were broken up into two separate entities: the current territory of American Samoa and what is now the independent nation of Samoa. The U.S. Navy secured deeds of cession from Samoan chiefs in a colonial governance structure that ensured U.S. government control but promised preservation of local customs, including the governing authority of traditional chiefs.

This was a period of major American expansion around the globe. Military and economic ambitions, blessed by the Monroe Doctrine, led the U.S. to explode into a global imperial power, snatching up islands all over the world at feverish pace for their natural resources and strategic positioning. At one point, the U.S. controlled, either formally or informally, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Guam, and The Philippines, among other territories and countless unincorporated islands. 
American Samoa’s current status as a member of a democratic underclass was cemented starting in 1901 in a series of plainly racist U.S. Supreme Court rulings that stand to this day. The rulings together are known as the Insular Cases, which clarified that people living in U.S. territories, including American Samoa, were not entitled to the same constitutional protections as other Americans. The court called people living in the territories “alien races” and referred to colonial subjects as “savage tribes,” “uncivilized” and not practiced in “Anglo-Saxon principles.”
None of this was taught in school to Pese, nor to the many other American Samoans I met in Alaska. Pese said he didn’t know that other territories even existed until he was a teenager. He knew American Samoa was part of the U.S.—it’s in the name, after all—and it was instilled in him from a young age that he should be proud to be American. U.S. flags wave atop government buildings in American Samoa; July 4 and the NFL are as big, or bigger, there as in the mainland U.S. 
While people born in other U.S. territories eventually gained birthright citizenship, American Samoa never did, in large part because many islanders worry that giving automatic U.S. citizenship to people born on American Samoan soil would compromise the territory’s own sovereignty. American Samoa’s government has, in fact, formally opposed automatic citizenship for its people, out of fear that various local rules, including those that prohibit non-native Samoans from owning most property there, would be repealed as a result.
Pese says he never had to consider his ambiguous status as a non-citizen U.S. national until he moved to the mainland. “I pay the same taxes as a U.S. citizen, but I cannot have a voice to represent what I feel is right within my own community. It’s frustrating,” he told me. “I was born with a Social Security number, I’ve got a U.S. passport.”
In Anchorage, I met an American Samoan woman named Maddy Unutoa, who runs an advocacy group to advance civil rights for Samoans living in Alaska. Like Pese, Unutoa told me she never thought about American Samoa’s place in the U.S. empire until she left home.
“The feeling there is pride—proud of being American,” she said. “I grew up being told we were always more powerful than the independent state of Samoa, because of currency, and being protected by the most powerful military ever. That was the safety net, that’s the mindset everywhere you go in American Samoa.
“I do not remember ever being taught that I have second-class citizenship,” she continued. “I learned all of that moving back here.”
The question of American Samoan suffrage remains a matter of significant debate, both informal and legal. It most recently gained steam in 2021, when the U.S. District Court in Utah ruled in favor of three American Samoans living in the state, who’d argued that they should be entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. That amendment states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals took up the case and reversed the district court’s decision—in part, it said, out of respect for the wishes of American Samoa’s own government. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and so the ruling stood.
Now, anti-colonial lawyers see a new chance in Tupe Smith’s case. Attorneys with the national group Right to Democracy, which works to unwind the legacy of colonial rule in the U.S., initially sought to dismiss Smith’s case. Last November, after it lost that fight, the group took her case to the Alaska Court of Appeals, arguing in favor of citizenship for American Samoans under the 14th Amendment. Oral arguments in that case are set for Jan. 15. 
Politics in Whittier are usually as local as local gets, but many there have lately gotten up to speed on and are now backing the 14th Amendment argument. Blair, who’d been re-elected as mayor in that 2022 election, introduced a resolution last year decrying “discrimination” against American Samoans and urging that Alaska amend its constitution to grant state and local voting rights to American Samoan nationals. One longtime white resident and reindeer owner painted a sign outside her gift shop at the waterfront: “American Samoans are Americans / 14th Amendment,” it reads.

“This shouldn’t be an option under the 14th Amendment,” Blair told me. “It’s the typical colonization B.S.
“One of the most valuable things you can ever have is citizenship,” he said. “To say, ‘Welcome to the United States—where you’ve already been living!—you have no voice,’ is pretty sad.” Blair’s resolution passed the city council last spring by a vote of 6-1. 
V.
There’s something else nagging at Blair and other Whittier residents I met: They want to know how the state troopers came to target Whittier in the first place. 
Austin McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Division of Alaska State Troopers, told me his office doesn’t seek out voter misconduct cases. It does, however, respond to citizen complaints. Deputy Attorney General John Skidmore, who supervises all criminal prosecutions in Alaska, told me his office, which is now prosecuting the 11 Samoans from Whittier, is simply doing so in response to evidence handed over by the troopers.
Court documents suggest that the original complaint came from someone in Whittier. According to these filings, the anonymous complainant claimed that they learned from one of Mike Pese’s brothers, Mark, that “he was not a U.S. Citizen but had nevertheless voted in the most recent municipal election.”
Everyone in town has a theory on who sent in the complaint. “It’s very clear,” Blair said, “that someone in our community hates somebody bad enough, and knew a phone number to call.” No one has yet admitted to the act, either publicly or in a long series of conversations I’ve been having with Whittier residents since July. Most connect the complaint to Blair’s 2022 victory. 
“Somebody decided that his margin of winning was skewed by the people who may have voted illegally,” Deputy Mayor Peter Denmark told me from the deck of his kayak-tour company at Whittier’s waterfront. “Some people think there was some skullduggery afoot.”
“There was an unwritten rule: ‘What happens in Whittier stays in Whittier,’” he added, pulling from a Marlboro Red. The anonymous complaint changed that.

When I interviewed Skidmore, the deputy attorney general, I mentioned how the criminal cases looked from the family’s perspective: They insist that they did not know they were breaking the law, and that government officials, including people who handle voter registration and the troopers who conducted the investigation, were clearly just as confused as they were about the voting rights of American Samoans. I asked Skidmore why the state is still pursuing charges.
“Ignorance of the law is not a defense,” Skidmore replied.
I asked him if this situation might be better resolved through public education, and with improved training for the state officials whose own confusion about voter eligibility had helped create this mess. There is some precedent, after all, for a non-punitive fix to this exact problem: Nobody was prosecuted when Oregon last year discovered it had registered hundreds of non-citizens, nor when an American Samoan national ran for the Hawaii state House as a Republican in 2018, not realizing she was ineligible.
But Skidmore made clear that the state does not regard this as a matter of harmless confusion. “We have to establish, in order to charge a crime, that someone knew that they were in fact not a U.S. citizen, that they were not eligible to vote as a result.” He would not comment on specific evidence in the Whittier cases. Transcripts of the state’s presentation to grand juries in these cases—documents that would presumably elucidate the state’s precise arguments—remain sealed, as the cases are all still pending.
But this much does seem clear: The state, per Skidmore, is not moved by the family members’ insistence that they identified as citizens on registration forms because they were confused, and in some cases directly misinformed by officials who were supposed to be sources of clarity. On the contrary, he emphasized that the state is determined to prove that this family acted with criminal intent.
I asked Skidmore whether it matters to these cases that officials were themselves confused about the law; he said it does not: “The fact that law enforcement might tell someone something that’s inaccurate doesn’t impact our opinion.”
He went so far as to say his office has an “obligation” to prosecute this case, in order to demonstrate to the public “that our elections are held in a way that the citizens can trust.”
“Otherwise,” Skidmore said, “we end up with violence, and that’s the worst thing for us all in a democracy. I think when people don’t trust elections, when they don’t trust what’s going on, then they have a tendency to lash out.” 
VI.
On a Friday evening last spring, a couple of weeks after the group of Whittier Samoans received their summonses in the mail, one of the accused family members, Mike’s 65-year-old mother, Mili, collapsed from a stroke while leading a youth service in the chapel in the basement of the town’s apartment complex. 
Mili, the matriarch of the local Samoan community, was one of the first Samoans to lay down roots in Whittier. She owns Kozy Korner, the food market inside the apartment complex, where she sells non-perishables, kitchen staples, and even a few comforts from home, like coconut milk. She lets the kids raid the ice cream cooler and organizes local events, including an annual July 4 cookout.
Pese began to cry as we discussed his mother’s health. “She doesn’t want to feel stressed, she’s always smiling and doesn’t want us to worry,” he said. “But that day during the youth service when she gave her sermon and had her stroke, that’s when I knew she’d been hiding her stress. She doesn’t want us to see it.”
Mili’s condition had worsened by the time I got to Whittier this past summer, months after her stroke. Additional testing had revealed a lump in her leg that had metastasized into Stage 4 of a rare and aggressive cancer. She spent the summer in Seattle getting treatment and was scheduled for a major surgery in October.

Over a video call in August, Mili told me she never meant to break the law. “I did not know,” she said. “It stresses me out, it stresses me a lot, going through with my treatments and everything. I try to be happy and forget everything until my treatment is all done.
“It’s really sad. It’s so sad, when I think about it. I love Whittier. The first time I arrived there, I was really happy. It’s really safe for my family, my kids. That’s why I spend all my time helping the community. All these things happening, it’s kind of changed my mind. My kids ask me why we don’t leave Whittier. But I think we need to stay, we need to fight for what’s right for us.”
Smith had wanted to join her mother-in-law in Seattle before the surgery as her round-the-clock caretaker, but ultimately she and Pese decided to stay home to keep earning money in case they end up owing court fines. Smith, who works as a toll collector at the Whittier tunnel, is especially worried about money now that she might have a conviction on her record, which could affect future employment prospects. She worries she won’t get promoted ever again because of the charges, and her childhood dream of becoming a teacher now seems more distant than ever.
“I feel like it’s too much sometimes, when I’m alone,” Smith told me. “I usually run down to the store to talk to my mother-in-law to try to distract each other from what’s going on. I don’t get to have that anymore because she’s away.”
On nights when Pese is away at work, as the kids sleep, Smith finds herself desperate for distraction. “There are times when I sit in a room, and it’s so quiet,” she says. She cleans to stay busy. 
More than once, after midnight, she’s found herself scrubbing down an area of the house only to realize she’d already just cleaned it.

Late last summer, the state offered plea deals to all of the defendants except Tupe Smith. This would have allowed them to avoid incarceration; some were offered deals promising to clear their records if they went a year without another offense. 
On a Sunday morning in August, while these offers were still fresh, Tafi Toleafoa, director of Pacific Community of Alaska, visited Whittier and joined the Samoan community in the church in the basement of the apartment tower. Samoan families sat on one side of the room, and on the other side were some of their white neighbors. One of the defendants, Nelson Vaimoa, led the service, and others charged with illegal voting, including Smith, sang in the choir.
Toleafoa addressed the congregants, as piano music played and young children squirmed in the back of the room. She asked the defendants not to accept any plea deals, telling them she was worried about the precedent that might be set: If the state could claim any measure of victory in the Whittier prosecutions, how would that affect the many non-citizen nationals living elsewhere in Alaska? Might they be prosecuted on the same grounds? 
“I ask for perseverance,” Toleafoa told the room. “Because the justice system takes a very long time and sometimes it’s not even justice, right? You don’t find justice in our justice system. 
“You make the decision that is right for you, but know that the impact of this case will be very vital for our community here in Alaska.”
Soon after, Mili spoke on a video call from Seattle, where she was awaiting her big surgery in October. Smith held a phone up to a mic: “I don’t fear anything,” Mili told the congregation. She began to cry and then almost wail, as slow, moody piano music played in the background. “We have to stand proud,” she said. “We have to stand firm, not just fade away.” 
She went on: “I miss everyone. I just want to come home. … Everyday, I pray for God’s healing.” The choir started up again as she wrapped her remarks, so that for 30 seconds or so her sobs were layered over their song.

All this seemed to be enough to convince any family members tempted by a plea deal not to go through with it. 
Earlier in the week, Mike Pese had told me he was inclined to accept the offer, just to get it all over with. He’s the type to plan for the worst, he said, and pleading guilty would at least guarantee that he and Smith wouldn’t be incarcerated at the same time, both away from their children. But after the service, he said, “If the state is using us as a starting point to start prosecuting all these U.S. nationals all over the state, then taking the deal is not a viable option for us.”
I asked Taleafoa to tell me more about American Samoans in Alaska who are potentially vulnerable to future prosecutions for voting, or at least registering to vote, without knowing they’d done anything wrong. “It’s not potential,” she said. “There are thousands of people.”

VII.
The State Troopers insist they weren’t searching for voting crimes in Whittier. “We didn’t go out looking for this; we received a complaint,” McDaniel, the spokesperson, told me. “We don’t go through and cull voter rolls and check in this or that database to see if someone’s a resident or a citizen. We don’t do that.”
There is plenty of evidence, though, that Republican officials in Alaska—and across the country more broadly—are very much looking for a fight over non-citizen voting, to make it appear widespread and to further the false claim that the nation’s elections are rife with fraud. In the Whittier case, they may have found their best opportunity yet. 
The state Division of Elections has happily complied with the Trump administration’s hunt for illegal voting by non-citizens, handing over its voter rolls to the U.S. Department of Justice when asked in 2025. 
But illegal voting by non-citizens is exceedingly rare, both in Alaska and across the country. According to the state attorney general’s office, only seven people had even been charged with any form of voter misconduct in Alaska in the last decade, meaning that the Whittier defendants alone make up the majority of the state’s voter fraud cases in the Trump era. Only four people in that period were convicted, and none of them for offenses having anything to do with non-citizen voting. 
In Anchorage I met with Andrew Gray, a Democratic state representative who chairs the House Judiciary Committee. Last year he convened a special legislative hearing to discuss the Whittier cases. “I absolutely think that the reason there was a raid [in Whittier] and why we’re pursuing these prosecutions is because it gives some ammunition to the folks who want to say that our election system is not safe, and that non-citizens vote,” he told me.
Alaska’s next legislative session opens this month, and Gray argued that lawmakers should respond to the Whittier prosecutions by referring to the ballot a constitutional amendment to grant state and local voting rights to non-citizen nationals.
The Alaska legislature is run by an unusual coalition of Democrats and Republican lawmakers who’ve broken from their party, while the governor is a conservative, Trump-friendly Republican. Gray finds it unlikely the constitutional amendment would succeed in this context. “There is simply no way that I can market anything to expand privileges to American nationals. The way that will be perceived by folks on the right is that we’re trying to make Alaska a sanctuary state,” he said. “I can hear that already.”
He went on, mulling his feelings aloud: “Is there value in filing to raise the issue? To use it as a talking point? I don’t know. This is the right thing to do, so maybe we have the discussion about it.”
Meanwhile, prominent Alaska conservatives are forging ahead with their own ballot proposal, to ban non-citizen voting in the state. It’s already forbidden in Alaska—and everywhere else in the country, save for the handful of towns and cities that allow non-citizen voting in certain local elections—and the new ballot measure would do little except emphasize current law: someone “may” vote in Alaska if they are a U.S. citizen above 18 years old who has lived in the state at least 30 days prior to an election; the ballot measure would change the law to say that “only” people meeting those qualifications may vote in Alaska. The measure will appear on the 2026 ballot, if organizers get enough signatures to qualify.
Coghill, the Republican former majority leader of the Alaska House and Senate, is now co-chairing the amendment campaign. He told me he’s seen that several cities around the country allow local voting by non-citizens, and that he wants to make sure that never happens in Alaska. He told me the measure isn’t a response to the Whittier case. 
There is a special irony to the ballot measure and the Whittier case: Alaska was itself a U.S. territory, with limited voting rights and political representation, until 1959, and many Alaskans, led by Native and women activists in particular, fought for their democratic inclusion prior to statehood. What’s more, Tupe Smith is hardly the first person to seek a government position there under dubious qualifications: The second person to ever serve as territorial governor of Alaska, John Franklin Strong in 1913, was himself an undocumented Canadian immigrant.
VIII.
The day before the Whittier folks were formally arraigned in court in May 2025, Nelson Vaimoa, who led the church service I attended, was driving some water samples from the town to Anchorage, when he saw police lights behind him. Vaimoa, who worked for the tunnel and was driving a company truck, said he was distracted by the upcoming court date, and didn’t realize he was speeding. 
“I was only thinking about the case, because the next day is the case, is the hearing,” Vaimoa told me. He said he was fired later that day after he told his boss about the speeding ticket.
The next day, Vaimoa stood in court alongside his family members, including his wife, who was pregnant with their first child and also faced charges for non-citizen voting. Many of the defendants struggled to keep up with what was being said; the court made little effort to translate materials into Samoan, and botched some of what it did try to translate. Taleafoa couldn’t help laughing from the back of the room, she told me, when the court, attempting to translate the word “criminal,” simply made up a word for it: “criminale,” which has no meaning in Samoan.

Everything Vaimoa knew about the justice system to that point had come from television and movies. “My hands never sweat that much before,” he said of that first court appearance. “This was a whole different experience—terrifying.”
He was despondent in our interview a few months later in August, far from the joyful leader I’d seen during the church service an hour prior. “I have no job. I need to stay up with paying my car, my insurance,” he said.
Vaimoa told me that when he voted locally, he felt proud—a real part of his community. He’d seen so many ads encouraging Alaskans to vote, and the state had certainly cleared the path for him to do so by sending him a voter registration card. “I was so happy that I had to exercise my right to vote,” he said. He had the card handy in his wallet and showed it to me.
Now, he added, “Whenever I see someone I just put my head down and don’t say anything because of this whole case. I just don’t want to make any more mistakes.” The birth of his daughter last year has changed his perspective, he said, instilling a new sense of responsibility: “I’m at a point where it’s better to be silent, not to share my thoughts to anyone. … I have trouble trusting people now.”
After Vaimoa and the other defendants rejected the plea deals they were offered, the state secured grand jury indictments against each of them. It’s unclear where their cases go from here; no trials have yet been scheduled. Each of them—including Mili, who is now back in Whittier but who remains in fragile health—faces potentially lengthy prison time if convicted. So does Smith.
As a result of all this, some Samoans are contemplating leaving Whittier altogether. “I poured everything into Whittier,” Pese told me. “I don’t know what I would do if my mom was no longer here with me, but she’s the only reason I’m still here.”
Some longtime residents told me that this type of reaction is fairly common here: Whittier is too small, they said, to live for too long under the shadow of any public scandal. A lot of people end up simply vanishing, they said. They rarely come back. 
Meanwhile, Whittier’s evolution marches on: In July, the town administration debuted a grand plan for the future of business activity in the town. The opening of the new cruise terminal here means annual cruise-ship visits are poised to jump from 46 to 72. The town may concurrently look to increase municipal fees on Whittier businesses in order to boost the local government’s revenue and attract a higher class of operator to the shore. The town development plan also includes a new RV campground and a new walking and biking corridor stretching from one end of town to the other. 
Dan Blair isn’t sold on the plan. “The only thing that’s changed is that now we have more potential for money, and a lot more people trying to take it from us,” he told me. On Oct. 5, he stood for re-election, facing off against Lori Borg, the wife of the town’s harbormaster, who is more popular among newer Whittier voters who tend to favor the development plan. Borg declined my interview request.

It was an important local election, the kind in which the Samoan community in Whittier would have been eager to participate, back when they thought they could vote. Mike Pese had himself once dreamed of running for a seat on the council here, before Tupe Smith was arrested. He’s abandoned that dream, of course, and started to withdraw from public life in Whittier—even by pulling the couple’s son, Max, out of school. He and Smith now homeschool him inside their apartment. 
Pese now and then runs into school teachers around town. “Sometimes they approach me; they say, ‘Hey, we miss Max!’ But after everything…” he trailed off wistfully.
Election Day came and went in Whittier, but this time Blair, who’d won by 13 votes three years ago, could not count on the support of the local Samoans. Beyond the 11 facing criminal charges, several other Samoans in the community who are citizens, and thus eligible to vote, decided to sit this one out. “They’re all too traumatized after the troopers came,” Smith told me. 
Blair lost by 14 votes.

Kennedy, Jr.","MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS OFFERED their own childhood immunization recommendations on Wednesday that depart from recently announced federal vaccine guidelines. 
The state is continuing to recommend the pediatric vaccination schedule that’s been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The move deviates from changes in vaccine recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control under the direction of the Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“No matter what happens in Washington, in Massachusetts we make public health decisions based on evidence and what will best protect our children and families,” said Gov. Maura Healey. “Secretary Kennedy’s rollback of long-standing federal vaccine recommendations creates confusion for parents and providers and erodes trust. Our message to families is simple: we will continue to stand behind science and preserve access to the vaccines children need to stay healthy.” 
On January 5, HHS reduced the number of vaccines recommended for US children from 17 to 11. The move followed a directive from President Donald Trump, which ordered the agency to “review international best practices from peer, developed countries,” according to HHS. Federal officials have said the change would not affect health insurance coverage of vaccines.
“President Trump directed us to examine how other developed nations protect their children and to take action if they are doing better,” Kennedy said on January 5. “After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the US childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent. This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.”
The CDC’s list of recommended vaccines for all children includes: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tenants, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B, pneumococcal disease, human papillomarivus or HPV and varicella also know as chicken pox. It’s up to parents and doctors to decide whether children should receive COVID-19, influenza and rotavirus vaccines. Another category outlines recommendations for children depending on risk factors and includes vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, and meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.
A 2025 state law grants the Massachusetts Department of Public Health the authority to set independent vaccine standards, regardless of federal recommendations.
DPH has issued guidance to health care providers and community stakeholders across the state recommending that clinicians use the American Academy of Pediatrics schedule for pediatric vaccination.
The academy’s schedule includes vaccines for: COVID-19; dengue; diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis; haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis A and B; human papillomarivus; multiple kinds of flu shots; measles, mumps and rubella; meningococcal ACWY, ABCWY and B; Mpox; pneumococcal conjugate; pneumococcal polysaccharide; polio; RSV; rotavirus; and varicella.
The state’s recommendation also aligns with the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, which was formed last year in response to shifting federal public health changes.
“The science is clear,” said DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein. “Vaccines remain one of the most effective tools we have to prevent serious illness and save lives. In Massachusetts, we will continue to lead with integrity, transparency, and an unshakeable commitment to protecting children’s health and well-being.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Vaccine-1.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 20:57:47.621898

(Utah Department of Commerce)When one illicit massage business is shut down in Utah, police and state regulators say another opens nearby. 
And when they suspect prostitution and human trafficking may be happening behind storefronts with neon signs, they told reporters on Wednesday, they often get nowhere because workers won’t talk to them and owners disappear. 
Their shared frustrations are the basis for a new state law they say will help them hold bad actors accountable. 
“This is your warning. Get out of town. Get out of our state,” Margaret Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said at a news conference in Salt Lake City. She said the illegal operations detract from the hard work and professionalism of massage businesses offering legal, safe therapy. 
The 2025 law removes a “glaring administrative loophole” that allowed state licensors to punish only the workers and not the business owners, Busse said. “We are now able to shift our site from the exploited to the exploiters.”

The new law requires massage businesses to register with the agency this year, mandates background checks and finger printing for owners and general managers, and gives the state authority to carry out inspections. 
“And in fact, it’s unlawful conduct to resist, to lock the door, to keep the inspectors from entering the premises to ensure compliance with the law,” said Mark Steinagel, director of the Utah 
Division of Professional Licensing. He said Utah gives inspectors similar power to see pharmacy records and contractor job sites. 
The law took effect in October, and the Commerce Department plans to make its registration form available to companies sometime in spring. 
The division has long regulated individual massage therapists by requiring them to be licensed, but not the businesses and owners. If those owners don’t register in compliance with the new law, the state can inform city governments, which can then revoke their business licenses. 
Illicit massage businesses are a growing problem in Utah, law enforcement tells legislators

Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said of nearly 200 suspected illicit massage businesses in Utah, 61 are in Salt Lake City. 
“It’s very hard to shut these businesses down,” Redd said. “It’s hard to get to the bottom of who the business owners actually are.” He said the new licensing system will help provide police with critical information in future cases. 
The measure passed last year after an earlier version faced pushback from the American Massage Therapy Association, which said it would have weakened oversight, rather than strengthen it. 
Roger Olbrot, a licensed massage therapist in Sugar House and a past president of the association, said the new law will help him and others separate themselves further from businesses they don’t want to be associated with. 
“The people that I have talked to have been very excited about the fact that we can now segregate ourselves, good versus bad,” Olbrot told Utah News Dispatch. “I’ve been in the business now 27 years, and even today, I get solicitations for illicit practice.” 
While some other states already have similar laws requiring businesses to register with the state, “they lack teeth because of resources,” said Jeff Shumway with Utah’s Office of Professional Licensure Review. 
In Colorado, Aurora passed an ordinance to the same effect, raising requirements to obtain a massage business license and making it easier to revoke.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 01:19:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Problems persist in CT special ed system despite federal compliance,Theo Peck-Suzuki,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/report-problems-persist-in-ct-special-ed-system-despite-federal-compliance/,The report was commissioned amid concerns CT wasn't doing enough to support students with disabilities. Its findings affirmed those concerns.,"Flaws in Connecticut’s special education system are impeding the state’s ability to provide adequate services to students, according to a report released Wednesday by state Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker.
Russell-Tucker commissioned the report six months ago amid concerns the state wasn’t doing enough to support students with disabilities. The findings affirmed many of those worries, revealing a system struggling with staffing shortages, arduous data collection software and a widespread lack of confidence in how disputes are resolved. As a result, children may struggle to access the resources they require for a free adequate public education — a legal standard also known as FAPE.
“We didn’t do this because we thought we were going to get a … report that says, ‘You’re doing everything well,'” Russell-Tucker told the State Board of Education at its meeting Wednesday. “That was not the point. 
“We did this because it was a need — to make sure that we understand and uncover where the challenges are, so we can literally be having this conversation today, very clearly and concisely, about what it is our next steps need to be,” Russell-Tucker said.
Representatives of WestEd, a consulting group, conducted the evaluation and presented the findings alongside Russell-Tucker at Wednesday’s meeting. 
Several individuals also shared views on the report during a public comment period at the meeting.
Andrew Feinstein, an attorney who represents children with disabilities and a founding member of the group Special Education Equity for Kids in Connecticut, called the report “devastating.”
“The fundamental problem appears to be that the Bureau of Special Education sees itself primarily as a conduit to transmit district-generated data to the federal Department of Education. It does not see itself as accountable to parents and teachers. The bureau is ineffective in improving results for students,” Feinstein told the board.
Kathryn Meyer, an attorney with the Center for Child Advocacy who works with low-income families, agreed. “Right now too many of our clients are sending their children with disabilities to school — our most vulnerable students — worried not just about the quality of their education, but their child’s safety and supervision. We are seeing district by district unable to provide adequate staffing support to meet their basic needs, and our children are paying the price,” Meyer wrote in an email to the Connecticut Mirror.
There was a bright spot: The report found Connecticut does routinely meet federal targets regarding special education.
The problem, Feinstein told CT Mirror, is that the state itself sets those targets. If the state sets and meets a low target, the federal government won’t see a problem, he said— even if a large number of kids still aren’t receiving adequate support.
That blind spot is what Russell-Tucker said she’d sought to clarify by commissioning the report. 
Rorie Fitzpatrick of WestEd, the consultancy that produced the report, praised the commissioner for taking a proactive approach to improving Connecticut’s approach to special education. “This was not a compelled endeavor. The compulsion here was a commitment to results for students,” Fitzpatrick told the board.
The report included four categories of recommendations to the state Department of Education. 
That included better defining the state’s “vision” for students with disabilities to ensure everyone in the system understands the goals and mission; mapping out and streamlining how staff and workflows are organized; coordinating more effectively within the department to address staffing shortages; and strengthening legal oversight and transparency in how the state handles disputes between parents and teachers.
That last category is especially important to families that feel schools are not adequately assisting children with disabilities, whether due to a staff shortage, an improper IEP or another issue.
Right now, Feinstein said, the most accessible option for low-income parents is the state’s administrative complaint process. The process is free, but it suffers from extended delays, and the results can be legally suspect, he said. As a result, Feinstein said, he seldom relies on state complaints.
Meyer told CT Mirror her organization has also experienced issues with the state complaint process.
“We have experiences with cases where … corrective action has not been fully monitored or enforced, and that’s something that we continue to urge [the state Department of Education] to really take a look at,” Meyer said. “Corrective action is not meaningful if a district doesn’t think it’s going to be required in a timely manner.”
Meyer also said she thought the report’s data on the number of complaints filed in the state seemed low. “That was surprising and doesn’t align with my experience,” she said.
In the report, WestEd recommended that the state hire a legal expert to support investigators and analyze their findings, with the aim of ensuring legal integrity and determining appropriate corrective actions. 
Meyer said that seems like a step in the right direction. “A lot of investigators have a lot of experience and want to do well by these families, but having someone with a legal lens to support them in that process, I think, is really critical,” she said.
Families who can afford to hire a lawyer can also set in motion what is known as due process. If they cannot reach an agreement with a school district, the case will eventually come before an impartial arbiter known as a hearing officer. 
These officers are similar to court magistrates, in that they are expected to render a finding that resolves the dispute. However, the report found widespread mistrust in the quality of Connecticut’s hearing officers, with doubts about how knowledgeable they are in federal and state law. 
By way of a solution, the report recommends that Connecticut establish clear criteria for hearing officer competence and make those criteria transparent to the public to rebuild trust. It also recommends providing guidance to parents without legal representation to help them navigate the process.
Feinstein urged the board to read the report’s findings and “demand that the department [of education] make fundamental change, both in the structure and operations of the Bureau of Special Education and, more importantly, by making clear that the mission is not to passively collect data, but to enhance the education of students with disabilities.”
Meyer concurred. “At its most fundamental level, SDE needs to prioritize the voices of parents, students, and educators by following through on WestEd’s recommendations, particularly around monitoring and enforcement of children’s legal rights to a meaningful and safe education,” she wrote in an email. “Urgent action and accountability are needed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_315-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 20:57:47.621898
,DC,2026-01-15 01:05:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Court considers end to legal protection for nearly 1 million immigrants from Haiti, Venezuela",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/court-considers-end-legal-protection-nearly-1-million-immigrants-haiti-venezuela,,"WASHINGTON — A panel of appellate judges Wednesday heard a challenge from civil rights groups to the Trump administration’s decision to revoke an extension, as well as end, temporary protections for nearly 1 million immigrants from Haiti and Venezuela. The challenge comes from the National TPS Alliance, which represents immigrants with Temporary Protected Status because their home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or other instability. The hearing came two weeks after the U.S. military actions in Venezuela, where the country's president and his wife were captured and brought to New York City to face an indictment. Despite the upheaval in the Venezuelan government from the U.S. operation, the Trump administration has continued to move forward with stripping TPS for more than 600,000 Venezuelans. Before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vacated extended protections put in place by the Biden administration, TPS for Venezuelans was set to expire in October. TPS for roughly 330,000 nationals from Haiti is set to expire Feb. 3, which the panel of judges acknowledged could make the issue of TPS for Haiti moot.Ahilan T. Arulanantham, from the UCLA Center for Immigration Law, who is representing the National TPS Alliance, said there are members in all 50 states who are experiencing harm as a result of their TPS being terminated by the Trump administration.He said some of those harms include “people separated from their infant children, families deported, people detained, lots of people detained.”The panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Wednesday’s oral arguments are Kim McLane Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony D. Johnstone. Former President Bill Clinton nominated Wardlaw and former President Joe Biden nominated Mendoza and Johnstone.DOJ says Supreme Court in agreementDepartment of Justice attorney Sarah Welch said because the Supreme Court has twice granted the Trump administration’s request to move forward with TPS termination for Venezuelans, the high court must have determined the Trump administration was likely to prevail in court. A lower court in December found that Noem’s decision to vacate protections for Venezuelans and end their TPS destination was unlawful.  Wardlaw questioned how the Supreme Court’s decision, which was made on an emergency basis and gave no reasoning, impacted the case before the panel.Welch said the Supreme Court “must have concluded that we were likely to succeed on the merits of that claim, whether or not it provided reasoning published in an opinion.”Arulanantham said the Supreme Court’s orders regarding TPS for Venezuelans are “not precedent because the Supreme Court does not treat them as precedent."" He added that in the past, the Supreme Court has reversed its initial rulings, especially those made on an emergency basis. He also pushed back against Welch’s argument that Noem had the statutory authority to vacate an extension granted under TPS for Venezuelans. “The statute says once you have made an extension, it lasts for the time prior that’s given in the Federal Register notice,” Arulanantham said, referring to the TPS statute.He added that the authority to vacate a TPS extension that Noem claimed is “nowhere written in the statute.”",,,,2026-01-14 20:57:47.621898

Glenn Youngkin looks into the gallery of the House of Delegates before delivering his final State of the Commonwealth speech on Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) In his final State of the Commonwealth address Wednesday evening, outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin offered a sweeping defense of his four-year tenure, arguing that Virginia is stronger economically, fiscally and educationally than when he took office in January 2022, as he prepares to hand power to Abigail Spanberger, who will be sworn in as the state’s 75th governor this weekend.
Speaking before a joint session of the General Assembly, Youngkin framed his farewell address as both a victory lap and a warning — praising bipartisan cooperation where it occurred, but urging lawmakers not to undo core policies he credits for economic growth, particularly right-to-work laws, tax cuts and his administration’s approach to energy and education.
“This is the state of the commonwealth that I have had the immense honor of serving these past four years,” Youngkin said, thanking lawmakers and Virginians as he prepares to leave office. “By every single metric, today Virginia is stronger than she has ever been.”
Youngkin, a Republican elected in 2021, entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic’s aftermath, school closures, rising violent crime and economic uncertainty. 
He repeatedly contrasted those conditions with what he described as a “Great Virginia Renaissance,” asserting that his administration reversed population loss, restored job growth and stabilized state finances.
Among his central claims was that Virginia has attracted more than $157 billion in business investment during his term, which he said exceeds the combined total of the previous six administrations. 
He pointed to major projects involving companies such as LEGO, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca and Hitachi, along with recent manufacturing announcements in Southside and the Piedmont.
Virginia, he said, is “a winning state,” with nearly 270,000 more people working now than when he took office and tens of thousands of additional jobs in the pipeline.
Those investments, Youngkin argued, are directly tied to policies that future lawmakers should preserve, including Virginia’s right-to-work law, which prohibits mandatory union membership. 
“Change Right to Work and jobs will disappear,” he warned. “No amendments. No reforms. No changes.”
Youngkin also emphasized record state revenues, citing more than $10 billion in budget surpluses over four years and roughly $9 billion in tax relief enacted during his administration. 
He said December revenue numbers showed continued growth, allowing for additional tax cuts alongside expanded funding for education, Medicaid, public safety and capital projects.
Those budget decisions have been a point of contention for Democrats, who argue that repeated rounds of tax cuts risk limiting long-term investments and question whether recent revenue surpluses are sustainable.
Education was another cornerstone of Youngkin’s address, particularly his administration’s response to pandemic-era learning loss. He cited Virginia’s ranking near the bottom nationally in reopening schools when he took office and claimed the state has since led the nation in math recovery and reductions in chronic absenteeism.
“We were 46th in the nation to reopen our schools,” Youngkin said. “The learning loss was devastating.”
He credited bipartisan legislation, including the Virginia Literacy Act and investments in tutoring, lab schools and career and technical education, for improved outcomes. 
According to Youngkin, four out of five Virginia high school students now graduate with a credential or certificate, and teacher pay has increased nearly 20%, contributing to a sharp drop in vacancies.
Those reforms have also drawn scrutiny, with ongoing disputes over testing standards, lab school governance and parental rights policies championed by Youngkin, including restrictions on school mask mandates and curriculum content.
Public safety and behavioral health featured prominently as well. 
Youngkin said violent crime, including murders, has declined roughly 30% statewide during his term, crediting law enforcement funding, anti-gang initiatives and fentanyl enforcement. He highlighted a 59% reduction in fatal fentanyl overdoses, attributing the drop to tougher penalties, public awareness campaigns and expanded access to naloxone.
On behavioral health, Youngkin touted what he called a complete system overhaul, citing major expansions in crisis beds, mobile crisis teams and the 988 hotline. The administration’s “Right Help, Right Now” initiative has drawn bipartisan praise but also questions about workforce shortages and long-term funding. 
Energy policy marked one of the sharpest contrasts with Democrats and the incoming administration. 
Youngkin reiterated his opposition to rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and urged lawmakers to repeal the Virginia Clean Economy Act, arguing that renewable energy mandates alone cannot meet Virginia’s growing demand, particularly from data centers.
“We need to double our generating capacity in the next 10 years. Renewables alone, which will drive up costs and risk brownouts, just can’t get it done,” he said, calling for expanded natural gas and nuclear power.
Democrats have countered that abandoning clean energy targets would undermine climate goals and increase long-term costs, a debate likely to intensify under Spanberger’s administration. 
Youngkin closed his address with a reflection on Virginia’s role in the nation’s upcoming 250th anniversary, linking his administration’s emphasis on “commonsense” governance to the state’s founding legacy.
“It has been the honor of a lifetime for Suzanne and me to serve,” he said. “We have strengthened the spirit of Virginia — together.”

Free.,"War powers resolution fails in US Senate after 2 Republicans flip, Vance breaks tie",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/war-powers-resolution-fails-us-senate-after-2-republicans-flip-vance-breaks-tie,,"WASHINGTON — Vice President JD Vance broke a tied Senate vote to block advancement of a war powers resolution that would have stopped President Donald Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional authorization.Senate Republicans used a procedural maneuver Wednesday night to halt debate on the Vietnam War-era statute that gives Congress a check on the president’s deployments abroad. Sens. Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri flipped on their previous votes to advance the resolution, splitting support at 50-50 — and delivering a victory to Trump, who had strongly criticized Republican senators who earlier defected from the administration.Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted to keep the effort alive in the Senate. Paul is the only Republican co-sponsor of the bill. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was the leading Democratic co-sponsor.Young said while he “strongly” believes Congress must be involved in any decisions about the commitment of U.S. troops, administration officials assured him that is not the state of play in Venezuela.“After numerous conversations with senior national security officials, I have received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela. I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force,” Young said in a written statement after he cast his vote.Rare rebuke doesn’t lastThe vote came less than a week after Young and Hawley were among the  five Senate Republicans who broke with party ranks to move the resolution across an initial procedural hurdle — a rare rebuke of Trump from some in his own party.Trump pointedly attacked the five GOP senators after they voted, writing on his Truth Social platform that the lawmakers “should never be elected to office again.” Senate Republicans argued a resolution to rein in Trump’s military actions against Venezuela is not relevant because “there’s no troops there, there is nothing to terminate,” as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Jim Risch said on the floor ahead of the vote.“Now, I know some of my colleagues will argue that a vote for this resolution is a prospective statement about limiting future action in Venezuela. That's not what it says. They argue, ‘we still have ships in the Caribbean, and clearly the president is ready to invade again,’ they say. But again, that is not what the resolution says. … No language in this resolution addresses future action,” said Risch, R-Idaho, who moved to table the measure.The vote came 11 days after U.S. special forces apprehended Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their bedroom during a surprise overnight raid. The couple was wanted by U.S. authorities on federal drug and conspiracy charges.The vote also comes after a monthslong bombing campaign on small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in which U.S. strikes killed more than 115 alleged “narco-terrorists,” according to U.S. Southern Command.Within an hour before senators voted to block any advancement of the war powers resolution, Trump posted on social media that he “had a very good call” Thursday morning with Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodríguez.“We are making tremendous progress, as we help Venezuela stabilize and recover. Many topics were discussed, including Oil, Minerals, Trade and, of course, National Security. This partnership between the United States of America and Venezuela will be a spectacular one FOR ALL. Venezuela will soon be great and prosperous again, perhaps more so than ever before!” Trump wrote on his own platform, Truth Social.Trump hosted oil executives at the White House Friday for a meeting on potential investment in Venezuela’s oil industry. Prior to the meeting, the president announced the South American nation had already agreed to give the U.S. between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil. Trump said he would control the money made from the sale.‘We are heavily engaged’Paul and Democratic sponsors of the war powers resolution vehemently disagreed with the GOP statements about the U.S. presence in and around Venezuela.“You don’t have to be a great expert in military affairs to know that we are heavily engaged,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, ahead of the vote.“Donald Trump says we’re not engaged in hostilities? Tell that to the 16,000 U.S. service members currently deployed in the Caribbean. Tell that to our service members on the Ford carrier strike force. Look at the Marine expeditionary unit operating in the region,” Schumer said. “Donald Trump is turning the Caribbean into a dangerous powder keg — and Congress must rein him in before one mistake ignites a larger, more unstable conflict.”Kaine likened the Republicans’ procedural move to “a parliamentary gag rule on discussion of this military operation.”“If this cause and if this legal basis were so righteous and so lawful, the administration and its supporters would not be so afraid to have this debate before the public and the United States Senate,” Kaine said on the floor ahead of the vote.Paul said the administration’s claim that Venezuela is not an official war is “an absurdity.”“The invasion of another country, blockading of a country and removing another country's leader, to my mind, clearly, is war,” Paul said on the floor ahead of the vote.U.S. Southern Command declined to confirm Wednesday the exact number of troops and warships present in the region.Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said more than 100 were killed in the raid, according to numerous media outlets that posted a video of his statement. The Cuban government announced on Facebook 32 of its citizens were among the dead.Seven U.S. troops were injured in the incursion, according to the Pentagon. Five returned to work within days after the attack, while two were still recovering as of Jan. 8.

The governor released a statement Wednesday afternoon saying he and his team have “carefully consulted with law enforcement and members of the Legislature” and “concluded this warrants a criminal investigation by law enforcement.” Pillen says he told the Nebraska State Patrol to refer the materials from the incident to the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office.
On the first day of this year’s legislative session, Cavanaugh, a progressive lawmaker in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, removed the frames because she said, “We are not allowed to adhere anything to the walls in the hallway of the Capitol.”
She said that, typically, any such display would be placed near the information desk, not on the walls along the Capitol’s hallways.
Cavanaugh said she tried not to damage the artwork and called the State Patrol to let them know where to find the paintings. The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which Speaker John Arch said had approved the display’s use of the walls. The images were rehung later that day.

Since then, the incident has been amplified by conservative influencers and media outlets after Pillen, a Republican, tweeted security footage of the incident and wrote that he was “disappointed in this shameful and selfish bad example.” 
No “apparent damage” was done to the art, a State Patrol spokesman said last week. He also said at the time that there was no active investigation of the incident. Cavanaugh apologized last week as State Sen. Jared Storm of David City asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand her for her actions.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, which handles internal issues of discipline, said the issue would be discussed during a closed portion of the meeting, but said Cavanaugh’s apologies were “sincere.” 
The Exec Board took no immediate action on Cavanaugh. 
Pillen, in his Wednesday statement, said, “Many Nebraskans and officials in the Capitol have expressed, if a private citizen had engaged in similar conduct, there would be a consequence for such misconduct.”
The nonprofit behind the images has faced criticism for sharing content that historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The latest display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, outreach designed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. President Donald Trump has endorsed Pillen’s 2026 reelection bid.
During a legislative session, Nebraska lawmakers can only be cited, not arrested, based on a provision of the state constitution meant to prevent outside interference in the Legislature’s actions.
Cavanaugh had no immediate comment. 
Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The question for Vermonters is not whether inclusion matters, but how we will sustain it 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brian Bloomfield: Equity means giving the shorter kid a stool.","This commentary is by Brian Bloomfield, Ph.D., head of school at Lyndon Institute and chair of the Council of Independent Schools for Vermont.



In my first year of teaching, a mentor pulled me aside to talk about equity. I was struggling to connect with a few students, and she offered a simple illustration: if two students are trying to reach the top of a cabinet and one is shorter, treating them the same does not give them the same chance. Equity means giving the shorter student a stool.
Nearly 30 years later, that lesson remains central to how many educators understand their work. Education is not about producing uniform outcomes or serving an imagined average student. It is about creating the conditions in which every student can learn, grow and participate meaningfully in school and in civic life.
Today, that principle is especially important as Vermonters debate how schools serve students with disabilities and learning differences. 
One persistent misconception is that some schools—particularly approved independent schools—do not share the same responsibilities as public schools when it comes to special education. 
Vermont law is clear: under Act 173, all approved schools are obligated to enroll and support students with individualized education programs (IEPs) and to provide access to services comparable to those available elsewhere in the public education system.
Act 173 was designed to move Vermont away from a deficit-based, label-driven approach to special education and toward a system that emphasizes equity, inclusion and shared responsibility. 
The law does not lower expectations for schools: it raises them. It recognizes that students learn in different ways and that schools must organize staffing, expertise and resources accordingly.
Today, Vermont faces a growing, statewide challenge that deserves more public attention: while overall student enrollment continues to decline, the number of students requiring special education support is rising. 
Yet the supply of trained special educators, related service providers and specialists has not kept pace. This shortage is not a talking point—it is an ethical and practical problem affecting classrooms across the state.
Special educators are not interchangeable aides or add-ons. They are highly trained professionals who manage complex learning plans, collaborate with classroom teachers and ensure that legal and educational obligations are met. 
Their work improves outcomes not only for students with identified disabilities but for entire classrooms and school communities. Diluting that expertise or treating complex learning needs as minor variations in attention or motivation undermines both students and teachers.
Independent schools, public schools and supervisory unions are all navigating this reality together. At Lyndon Institute, where I serve as head of school, students with IEPs and health plans are a significant part of the student body—an experience that mirrors trends seen statewide. 
LI is one example among many Vermont schools working to meet legal obligations while responding to increasingly complex student needs. The specifics differ from school to school, but the responsibility is the same.
The broader question for Vermonters is not whether inclusion matters, but how we will sustain it. Doing this work well requires investment in professional training, realistic staffing models and policies that recognize the true scope of student needs. 
There are no shortcuts. Equity demands time, expertise and commitment—especially to the more rural communities of Vermont. 
As Vermont continues to examine its education system, we should resist narratives that pit schools against one another or suggest that inclusion is optional. 
It is not. 
Inclusion is a civic obligation grounded in law, research and basic fairness. If we believe that every student deserves a real opportunity to succeed, then our policies and our public conversations must reflect that belief.

Janet Mills said her administration could not confirm any planned federal immigration operations but said she's working with leaders of Portland and Lewiston to prepare. (Screenshot)The mayors of Maine’s two largest cities announced Wednesday that they are expecting increased federal immigration presence in their communities soon, as tensions rise across the nation following the fatal shooting by a federal officer in Minnesota. 
Gov. Janet Mills says, “Maine will not be intimidated.” 
The governor is working with the cities of Portland and Lewiston to prepare, she announced in a video Wednesday night, in which she also called for any protests to be peaceful. 
“To the federal government I say this: if your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused – those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said. 
The Mills administration hasn’t been able to confirm any planned operations, and neither mayor responded to questions about how they were notified. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not confirm nor deny a forthcoming escalation in Maine.  
“Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” McLaughlin wrote in a statement. “We do not discuss future or potential operations.”
Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline and Portland Mayor Mark Dion urged residents and businesses to know their rights and create a plan in case they are stopped by federal authorities. 
Maine immigrant rights groups launch statewide ICE watch hotline

“I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents,” Sheline wrote in a social media post. “Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other.”
After a federal immigration agent shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good, protests broke out across the country, including Maine. 
Like Minnesota, both Portland and Lewiston have large immigrant populations. Androscoggin County, which includes Lewiston, has one of the nation’s most robust Somali populations, a community that has recently drawn President Donald Trump’s ire. 
The Trump administration had increased operations in Minneapolis ahead of the shooting specifically to target Somali immigrants because of alleged welfare abuse. Similar accusations are being investigated in Maine
Minnesota has been the subject of several federal investigations into fraud in its social service programs. But the Trump administration’s focus on Minneapolis comes after allegations by a right-wing YouTuber of Medicaid fraud at daycares run by Somali Americans in the city. 
Similarly, a Portland-based nonprofit that serves immigrants is facing allegations of Medicaid fraud and is currently being investigated by the state and federal government, with Republican legislators drawing direct parallels to Minnesota.
“It has nothing to do with certain populations, unless and until it does,” Minority Leader of the Maine Senate Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said during a press conference in late December. “I think that’s what we’re seeing, it play out in Minnesota, is that there is a strong corollary there. We should be looking at whether there’s a strong corollary here in the state of Maine.”
Trump also took further aim at Somali immigrants on Tuesday, announcing an end to humanitarian protections for that community that grant deportation relief and work permits, which had been established in 1991. 
“There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents,” Dion said of Portland. “In that view, Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.”
Sheline also wrote on social media, “As a reminder, Lewiston Police do not enforce federal law.” 
How police discretion has contributed to immigration arrests, and how that’ll change

Police are not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws, however local authorities have contributed to immigration arrests in Maine, including through traffic stops and following 911 calls. 
A new Maine law set to take effect later this year aims to prevent that. 
The Portland Police Department is already banned from inquiring about a person’s immigration status under city code. “We do not cooperate with ICE, nor would we ever call them to a scene,” the department’s Public Information Officer Brad Nadeau told Maine Morning Star in the fall. 
That’s not the case for the Lewiston Police Department. But when asked about their policy in the fall, the department’s public information officer Lt. Derrick St. Laurent reiterated that municipal officers can’t enforce immigration laws.
“We don’t run routine license checks through our federal partners,” he said. “However, when we encounter someone suspected of a violent offense whose identity is in question, we may request their assistance.” 
 A coalition of groups in Maine launched a hotline in October to provide real-time information about federal immigration activity and connect Maine families to resources and support services.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-7.20.57 PM-1024x509.png,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-15 00:18:56+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘I am terrified.’ Federal government unexpectedly cuts over $9M in grants for Mississippi mental health,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/14/federal-cuts-mississippi-mental-health/,"Emily Presley, a naloxone trainer with Communicare, demonstrates the use of naloxone and explains its life-saving potential during a training session at the Northeast Mississippi Addiction Summit in Tupelo, Miss., on Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2024.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi mental health organizations say they lost at least $9.2 million when the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration terminated grants across the country Tuesday, a loss they say could be devastating for Mississippians. 
The federal agency cut hundreds of mental health and addiction grants that are estimated to be worth roughly $2 billion, according to NPR. The news organization reported many of these grants went directly to private nonprofit organizations. 
Melody Madaris, executive director of the North Mississippi community mental health center Communicare, said the cuts had also severely impacted organizations like hers. Four of Mississippi’s 12 community mental health centers had federal cuts to their organization totaling $8.7 million. 
About $3.7 million of those terminations are coming from grants for Communicare, Madaris said. Most of her organization’s cuts were for efforts to prevent addiction-related overdoses and to connect children with mental health services. 
Madaris said Communicare had consistently shown through measures such as job and housing placement data that it had used these types of federal grants to improve Mississippians’ mental health.
“This was completely shocking,” she said. 
With this cut, Madaris said she is nervous about how Communicare and other mental health centers will address needs in their communities. 
“I am terrified, to be honest,” she said. “We’re going to figure it out, we always figure it out. But it’s definitely going to be hard.”

Madaris said the cuts would completely change how Communicare can help children in schools get mental health services and whether North Mississippians can access naloxone, the opioid overdose-reversing medication. It could also mean Communicare may have to reduce its staff. 
“We’re going to have to make some pretty significant changes across the agency,” she said. “It will include programs being stopped and reduction in some of the services that we have been providing for years now through the help of the SAMHSA funding.”
Phaedre Cole, president of the Mississippi Association of Community Mental Health Centers, said cuts to the other three public mental health agencies were also mainly for services related to children and addiction.
Unlike most private facilities, community mental health centers are expected to treat Mississippians regardless of their ability to pay. Cole said that model creates financial challenges that are furthered by SAMHSA’s cuts. 
“Even minor or surface-level cuts go very deep with regard to our long-term sustainability and being able to continue our mission,” she said. 
Mississippi Department of Mental Health spokesperson Adam Moore said the federal government terminated an additional roughly $440,000 from the agency that had been intended to help law enforcement respond to mental health emergencies. The department is aware of the community mental health center grant cancellations and is “still assessing the total impact of the cuts to the state,” he said.
The SAMHSA letter Madaris and the dozens of other organizations received says the federal agency is terminating the contracts to align its grant spending with its priorities. The priorities it lists — addressing mental illness, addiction, suicide and other societal challenges — are similar to what the community mental health centers told Mississippi Today they were doing with their now-terminated grants. 
The letter said the terminations are final. Spokespeople for the federal agency did not respond before publication to a Mississippi Today email asking how much money SAMHSA is canceling from Mississippi organizations, how the grants didn’t align with its priorities and whether new funding would replace these terminated funds.

Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford and a member of the state’s Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council, lives in Lafayette County — a region served by Communicare. She said the organization does a fantastic job of addressing mental health problems in North Mississippi. 
“It’s devastating,” she said of the cuts. “They have been really aggressive and proactive in addressing mental health issues and concerns in our community.” 
Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, said it’s been difficult to keep up with what the federal government does on a day-to-day basis. He said he and other lawmakers would have to see how the federal mental health cuts play out.
“Obviously, it’s not good news,” he said after his committee met Wednesday. “But in order to know exactly what to do about it or what we might do about it, just have to wait until we get the details.” 
The federal government also cut funds directed to private, nonprofit Mississippi mental health centers, but neither community mental health nor Department of Mental Health officials who spoke to Mississippi Today knew of any as of Wednesday. An executive with one Mississippi nonprofit that received a SAMHSA subgrant administered by the University of Mississippi Medical Center said over $100,000 of its funding was cut Tuesday.

The executive asked not to be named because they had not spoken about the cut with UMMC yet. Patrice Guilfoyle, communications director for the medical center, said she had not heard about any cuts as of Wednesday but would look into them. 
Madaris said SAMHSA also cut nearly  $3 million from Hinds Behavioral Health Services, the community mental health center that serves Jackson. Nyaband Buong, the Hinds Behavioral executive director, said one of her canceled federal grants was $1 million to help navigate a complicated mental health system. 
In March, SAMHSA cut about $4.1 million from Mississippi community mental health centers, saying the funds were initially to address the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the centers and their patients told Mississippi Today that those cuts would have life-or-death effects, such as eliminating ways for people recovering from addiction to sustain long-term sobriety. 
In the aftermath of the cuts last spring, Cole said she wasn’t expecting another round this year. 
“I thought we were past any more cuts,” she said. “I was really shocked by this.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/04205937/3X0A0193-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

“Who can draw when the world is burning?” asks celebrated Vermont cartoonist Alison Bechdel in her new graphic novel, Spent.
This tension between the political and personal has been a deep well for Bechdel in her art. Bechdel has been cartoonist laureate of Vermont, as well as a recipient of a MacArthur “genius award” and a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. 
She garnered a cult following with her early comic strip, “Dykes to Watch Out For.” Her best-selling graphic memoir, Fun Home, was named Best Book of 2006 by Time. It was adapted into a musical that won five 2015 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Fun Home tells the story of growing up in a family that ran a funeral home, and how, after Bechdel came out as a lesbian, her closeted gay father died in a presumed suicide. 
The cartoonist is also known for the Bechdel Test, which rates movies on whether they include at least one scene in which two women talk to each other about something other than men.
Bechdel is now a professor in the practice at Yale University. She divides her time between teaching for a semester at Yale and living and drawing at her home in West Bolton, Vermont. Bechdel’s wife Holly has been the colorist for her last two books. 
This week, she had an op-ed cartoon featured in the New York Times about how to stand up to tyranny. 
She spoke to me from her home in Vermont.
The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David Goodman
You wrote on social media while sharing your New York Times op-ed that you were especially moved by the murder of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, because it occurred in a neighborhood that you lived in. Can you say more about that?
Alison Bechdel
I was living in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis in the late 1980s when I was starting to create the characters of my comic strip, Dykes to Watch Out For, who I’ve continued to write about over the years, and sort of resurrected quite recently in my latest book, Spent. This cartoon in the New York Times was just a little funny glimpse at the world of this Vermont goat farm I invented for my book, and I’ve brought my old comic strip characters into this world. They live in a group household together, even though they’re in their 60s, they’ve always lived the same way they did when I started the strip out and I was in my 20s. 
It was strange to be working on this cartoon for the New York Times with these characters as that whole terrible story was unfolding. It just hit me so viscerally to realize that any of my characters would have done the same thing she and her wife did, which is stand up to help their neighbors, to alert them to this ICE raid that was going on, and she got blown away. It’s horrifying any way you look at it, but just having this personal connection to that particular neighborhood and the culture of activism in that neighborhood was just very, very upsetting.
David Goodman
Early media accounts referred to Good’s child as having no parent after her murder, but you made the point that the child does have a parent: Good’s wife Becca.
Alison Bechdel
It was kind of stunning how clueless the media were in piecing her story together. They called her relatives, which I guess is what you do. But I started to think, “Oh my God, this is some lesbian. No one has a clue how to figure out who her family is, what her story is.” 
What’s been most upsetting to me is the weird way that the shooter published his own cell phone video of the whole incident, thinking that it was somehow going to exculpate him. That was horrifying. I think he was banking on the fact that these women were clearly not suburban ladies, but a lesbian couple, and Becca Good, a mouthy lesbian, really telling him off. She was harassing him, but in a completely nonviolent way. He somehow thought that was going to win people’s sympathy. That is really disturbing to me.
David Goodman
It reminded me of the 2020 shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger in Georgia. The shooter released his own footage thinking it would justify his actions. Instead, the footage was used to convict him. 
Alison Bechdel
I doubt that’s going to happen in this case, but it should.
David Goodman
As we speak on January 13, the Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case that may ban transgender kids from participating on girls sports teams. Right now, 27 states ban trans athletes. You have been writing and fighting for visibility of LGBTQ people your whole career. How do you explain the moment we’re in with this incredible backlash against LGBTQ people?
Alison Bechdel
I feel like I’m still in a state of shock. For the past few years, it’s just been one blow after another. It seemed to me as I went along in my life watching progress after progress happen in this movement, that this was something that wasn’t going to go back. I think about Weimar Berlin, and how it was like this little oasis of queer freedom before the Nazis shut it down. And I was thinking, “Could that happen again?” Yes, clearly it could, but I really wasn’t sure. It seemed like maybe we’d reached a tipping point—people understand that we’re not a threat, that we’re just extending democracy to more people. But I guess it’s pretty threatening for the powers that be. I’m a cartoonist, not a political analyst, but that’s my general take.
David Goodman
You are also a very astute social commentator through your cartoons. But let’s turn to your latest piece in The New York Times, “Eight Things You Need to Start Your Own Commune.” Tell us what some of those eight things are and what the deeper meaning of this is.
Alison Bechdel
The idea was to just show the lighter side of banding together during the apocalypse. Like these characters with their group household is just a lighthearted take on the things that they’re doing, like building a safe room in their attic for their trans and immigrant neighbors. It’s evoking this moment that we’re living in and how it’s best done together with our friends.
David Goodman
Which comes right out of your latest book Spent. It is subtitled “A Comic Novel,” but it is also very much a memoir. So much of your work is autobiographical—Fun Home, Dykes to Watch Out For, Secret to Superhuman Strength were drawn from your own life experience. How do you find ways to go back to your own story and tell it differently?
Alison Bechdel
This time I found the well drying up a bit, which is why this most recent book is not strictly memoir or autobiography. It’s based on the kind of life I live now. I’m a character in it. My partner Holly is a character in it. But we’re living on a goat farm, which is not actually—we don’t live on a goat farm at all. I totally made that up. So it was fun to take these fantasies and loosen up the rules about what’s strictly true. And the best part of that was making my friends in this new world, my old characters from Dykes to Watch Out For and seeing how they’ve aged and how they’re still living in that house and doing all the work in the community that they’ve been doing for decades now.
David Goodman
You parody the struggles of a modern, progressive person with fame and fortune, the things that may or may not come with midlife. How much has that been a struggle for you, as it has for the fictional Alison Bechdel in Spent?
Alison Bechdel
I have been improbably successful in my life, when I think about getting started drawing a lesbian soap opera comic strip that ran in the tiniest newspapers that were constantly folding and starting up again. To actually have become someone who’s considered a legitimate figure in the comics world kind of blows me away. It’s come with some strange reckonings. I formed my identity in my youth as this outsider, as this lesbian, as someone who’s not aiming for mainstream fame and fortune, yet I’ve kind of ended up somehow making it or crossing over in a strange way.
David Goodman
What was the moment of crossover? Why do you think your story finally captured people’s imagination in the general public?
Alison Bechdel
That moment came when I published a memoir about my family called Fun Home, which was about my learning that my father was a closeted gay man at the point when I came out to my family and what a strange, disconcerting realization that was. It’s also about his suicide, which happened very shortly after that came out in the open, which is something I was trying to figure out for a long time before I finally started writing about it in my 40s. Somehow that book touched a nerve. My Dykes to Watch Out For work has never quite crossed over to that same extent. It kind of got grandfathered in a bit in the process, which is great, but I think most people know me for that family story.
David Goodman
Now you are wearing a new hat: you’re a professor at Yale. You are new to teaching and you never studied writing. So how do you now teach it, and what is the challenge of teaching college students?
Alison Bechdel
I am having so much fun teaching. This isn’t something I ever envisioned that I would be doing, but the opportunity came up and I deliberated over it, and I’m so glad I pursued it, because it turns out I really like it. I don’t have children. I’m not around young people very much, and it is such an amazing feeling to just talk with and be around young people and to see their hope and their energy. These students at Yale are pretty remarkable. They all do multiple things and many of them are good cartoonists. So it’s really fun to be able to try and teach them things that can help guide them. It’s stuff that I had to learn on my own, because comics wasn’t something you learned in school when I was young. In fact, I applied to the Yale art school to their graduate program in graphic design and didn’t get in because most of my work was weird cartoons, which didn’t really make sense in the early 1980s to anyone who was looking at them.
David Goodman
What has surprised you about working with young people and teaching?
Alison Bechdel
I was afraid that the kids were going to be disaffected or bratty, and it is so the opposite of that. They are so dear. I just feel kind of love for each of these kids that I’m working with. I love helping them to tell their stories, and I find that is something useful I can do. I know a couple things about telling stories, and it’s amazing to watch kids actually take what you tell them and run with it and do more than I even could have hoped for.
David Goodman
You’ve described yourself as a writer who draws. What does that mean?
Alison Bechdel
Different cartoonists map out differently on the writing and the drawing. Some people are really good artists and maybe not such great writers. Some people are stronger writers than artists. I feel like my writing is kind of stronger than my drawing and leads the drawing. Some people, the images lead the way. They would probably call themselves more artists who write.
David Goodman
You have a pretty remarkable partnership with your wife Holly, who is the colorist.
Alison Bechdel
We’ve started working together on my last two books and that’s been so fun. Coloring is really a lot of work and it’s nothing I could do on my own—it would take me twice as long to produce these books. So she has stepped up to learn Photoshop and learn how to create color palettes and it’s a fun way for us to be really collaborating and working closely, instead of me just being off in my room doing this by myself.
David Goodman
Some people might be terrified to work with their spouse. How do you navigate that?
Alison Bechdel
It certainly has its fraught moments, but we’ve gotten a lot better at it. Part of the reason I even became a cartoonist is because I’m such a lone wolf and I like doing everything myself. So I definitely had a learning curve when it comes to collaborating, but it’s paying off, and I’m glad we’re doing it.
David Goodman
I saw an interview with one of your students at Yale who had never drawn. What’s your first bit of advice to somebody with no background in telling stories, in creating art?
Alison Bechdel
I don’t insist that kids know how to draw or draw well at all to take the class. It helps to have some drawing skill but what I’m teaching them is not how to draw or how to write, it’s how to combine those two things. That’s its whole own skill, and some people have a real knack for it but other kids, you can teach it. What are you trying to convey in this story? What’s the best way to do it? Don’t say in the pictures what you can say in the words and vice versa. There are some very simple formulas. It’s a whole new way of telling a story.
David Goodman
What is the key element of a good cartoon?
Alison Bechdel
I think it is the little gap, like in a spark plug, between the pictures and the words. That is just enough space for the reader to come in and make that connection, make the spark. It gives them a way in and just kind of makes the magic happen, unlocks that fusion between those two planes.
David Goodman
In Spent, you lampoon the fact that the main character uses a cartooning program, but there’s a serious element to that. How is AI impacting your world?
Alison Bechdel
In fact, I kind of went over to the dark side a little bit on my latest book, Spent, because I did not draw that all with a pen and paper. I did half of it digitally just because I needed to work faster, and digital drawing is a lot quicker. I’m still drawing it myself, but it’s just on a screen, and it’s kind of different. Interestingly, I used AI for the first time as I was writing that New York Times cartoon—one of the panels is about how to generate your own electricity, given that now the AI data center down the road has jacked up your electricity rates. So I drew myself on a treadmill with my flock of goats and we’re generating our own renewable energy. I asked ChatGPT to make me a drawing of goats on a treadmill, and it did, and I sort of copied it. So who knows where I’m going now—I’m just going right down a chute to hell.
David Goodman
One of the subtexts throughout Spent is the background noise of the incredibly disturbing deluge of daily news. How do we get through these times? What wisdom can you offer from your own experience?
Alison Bechdel
One thing I’m really grateful for is this teaching job because it is so all-consuming I don’t have time to sit around watching the news all day. Does it really help to know exactly what horrors they’re perpetrating? I just try to follow the headlines and I can’t spend any more time than that. I need to do more stuff in the real world, do more activism, connect with my friends. 
David Goodman  
What gives you hope in this moment?
Alison Bechdel  
The protests that are going on. There’s this weird silver lining which is that it is getting more people out into the streets and we’re on our way to that 3.5% tipping point, which gives me great hope.
David Goodman  
And by that you’re referring to if 3.5% of the people are engaged in any form of protest, the regime falls.
Alison Bechdel  
Supposedly that’s been true in history and in different political situations and countries. I certainly hope it’s true here and I hope that we can get to that number. We’re over halfway there in terms of who’s been showing up. People are waking up. Many of us have just been asleep through all of recent history. We’re not going to be around if we stay asleep. It’s pretty dark. It’s pretty bad.
David Goodman  
Thank you for sharing your work and your thoughts in these crazy times.
Alison Bechdel  
Thank you for your work in these crazy times. Just keeping people together, talking to each other, is so important.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in a Wednesday hearing that there wasn’t enough time to make an informed ruling on state officials’ request for an injunction on “further legal violations and unlawful escalations” by federal agents reporting to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and legal representatives for the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed suit on Monday to stop what multiple state and local officials have called a “federal invasion.”
Menendez did not outright reject Ellison and his co-plaintiffs’ claims, saying only that she needed more time to fully consider the facts of the case, KSTP reported. She asked the federal government for its response to the suit by Monday and for the state to file a reply by Jan. 22. A ruling could follow soon after.
In other legal news, Chris Madel, a Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, told the Star Tribune that he was providing legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.
Madel said he is still running for governor and that he wanted to help Ross get legal representation from the U.S. Department of Justice.
Outside the courtroom, a cold front sweeping through Minnesota had little apparent effect on the thousands of ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents working in the Twin Cities and outstate. Federal law enforcement activity spread into smaller Minnesota communities, with agents active this week in Detroit Lakes, Circle Pines and multiple Twin Cities suburbs.
St. Paul Public Schools announced on Wednesday it would provide a virtual learning option beginning Jan. 22 for students who do not feel comfortable coming to school amid the surge in federal agents. Minneapolis Public Schools plan to offer a remote learning option for students through at least Feb. 12.
In Minneapolis, bystander video posted to City Council President Elliott Payne’s social media accounts showed agents shoving him off the sidewalk as he met with other local officials near the intersection of Central and Lowry avenues.
Payne told CBS News he was filming a public service announcement with state Sen. Dorian Clark, DFL-Minneapolis, and City Council Member Jason Chavez.
Meanwhile, immigration enforcement may be ramping up at the Hennepin County Medical Center, the state’s largest public safety net hospital, and the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
MPR News reported Wednesday that ICE agents were entering hospitals with detainees, sometimes without warrants, and — according to five Hennepin Healthcare nurses who asked to remain anonymous — sitting in on patient appointments.
An anonymous Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport employee shared a memo with FOX 9 detailing plans for ICE agents to spend three weeks at the hub checking travelers’ and employees’ documents.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission told FOX 9 in a statement that “federal regulations provide federal agents with broad access to MSP Airport property [including] the airfield, pre- and post-security areas in the terminals and public spaces like parking ramps and lots.”
Federal authorities are also stepping up their efforts to move detainees not released soon after their arrest for one reason or another through the legal process. The Pentagon plans to dispatch at least 25 military judges to Minnesota, according to CNN, while MPR News reported immigration enforcement agencies appear to have dramatically increased deportation flights out of the state.
ICE appears to need all the help it can get on the ground, too. The agency hired independent journalist and Army veteran Laura Jedeed apparently without even a cursory check of her vocally anti-ICE online presence, Jedeed revealed in an engrossing article for the online magazine Slate.
“It takes about five seconds of Googling to figure out how I feel about ICE, the Trump administration, and the country’s general right-wing project,” Jedeed wrote. In other words, too much time for an agency with more money than it knows what to do with.
Ordinary Minnesotans continued pushing back on the stepped-up federal law enforcement presence. Hundreds of St. Paul public school students staged a coordinated walkout on Wednesday that converged on the state Capitol. Multiple recent polls show solid majorities of American adults disapproving of ICE’s tactics and disbelieving the Trump administration’s official line on Good’s killing.
Perhaps in response, President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to soften his stance on Good, who senior administration officials previously called a “domestic terrorist.”
“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person,” Trump told CBS News anchor Tony Doukopil, who has faced criticism for fawning coverage of the Trump administration since stepping into the role last week.
Trump then added: “But, you know, her actions were pretty tough.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260112_1039-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

The postcard, which landed in many Montana mailboxes last week, preceded an announcement this week from the Secretary of State’s Office about a new program to strengthen election security — and its initial results.
The program is a partnership with the federal government to verify voter citizenship. A news release said it is free to election officials.
“Already, the federal government’s SAVE tool flagged 23 records as potential non-citizens, most of which appear to have permanent alien status and no record of citizenship,” the news release said.
SAVE stands for the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements.
“Several of the flagged individuals had voter histories indicating participation in dozens of previous Montana elections,” the news release said.
The postcard shows a picture of Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and President Donald Trump.
It announces the SAVE partnership between Montana and the Trump administration to “strengthen election security” to disallow non-citizens from voting.
“Only citizens should be allowed to vote,” the postcard said.
To vote in Montana, people need to be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years old before the election, and a Montana resident for at least 30 days before the next election.
In the United States, some places allow non-citizens to vote in local elections, but Montana does not.
The program, the postcard
In response to questions, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office directed the Daily Montanan to the news release from the office.
The spokesperson did not address which counties those potential non-citizens were from, when they most recently voted, and when the office would determine whether they were citizens.
However, Missoula County Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman said every vote matters.
Statistically, it’s likely that one of those 23 potential non-citizens is from Missoula, he said, so he is eager to hear what the next steps might be from the Secretary of State’s Office.
“The sooner we’re able to work on this, the better,” Seaman said.
Seaman also said the number indicates the current system is working well; Montana has 784,911 registered voters, and 23 potential non-citizens is 29-one-thousandths of 1 percent.
He said verification takes place using a driver’s license or Social Security number, and a Social Security number is effective, although any system can have errors.
But Seaman also said a non-citizen might have a driver’s license. Usually, he said, the mistakes that happen are when people check an incorrect box on a registration form.
Although Seaman said he believes verification is working well, he couldn’t say whether the new SAVE program will be a benefit to election security because he doesn’t know enough about it yet.
He said his office did not know the state would be sending out the postcard until it landed in someone’s mailbox, and it would be helpful to know about such a program before getting questions about it.
“We love working closely with the Secretary of State, and these are big-scale plans that we would love to know about before they happen to our voters,” Seaman said.
Seaman also pointed to a recent instance in Missoula County where an election outcome could have been affected by just one vote, such as if one of the 23 potential non-citizens were among the local voters.
A city council race in 2023 resulted in a tied vote after a recount, so the Missoula City Council made the decision in an appointment.
“When you have a dead tie on a recount, you feel it,” Seaman said.
Seaman said those outcomes show the importance of verification and voter education, a focus in Missoula.
He said he believes the Secretary of State wants to reverify the 23 potential non-citizens, and Missoula County would want the same.
“If there’s an election coming up, let’s not wait,” Seaman said.
The complaint
The postcard has led to several inquiries with the Commissioner of Political Practices and one complaint, said Commissioner Chris Gallus.
Received on Jan. 9, the complaint alleges a misuse of taxpayer funds.
In the complaint, Montana resident and registered voter Susan Beley of Harlowton expressed deep concern the postcard implied “any random person can vote.”
“This is blatantly untrue as only citizens ARE ALLOWED to vote,” Beley wrote.
“She (Jacobsen) used her State of Montana office and my tax dollars to align herself with the current president (including a photo) in the narrative that has been proven false claiming that ‘elections are rigged’; that ‘someone other than citizens are voting.’”
The spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office did not answer a question about how much it cost to produce and mail the postcard.
In the complaint, Beley said Montana already has stringent identification requirements and fair and impartial elections judges, and the mailer builds distrust and “is party aligned.”
“My tax dollars SHOULD NOT fund such propaganda,” Beley wrote.
Gallus said he is conducting an initial review to assess whether the allegations present legal questions that are under his authority and whether he has the factual evidence to support them if so.
Questions include whether the postcard constitutes electioneering or campaign activity, Gallus said. He said the electioneering concept includes depicting a candidate or group of candidates in a way that casts a positive or negative light upon them.
Jacobsen was re-elected as Secretary of State in November 2024 and has not publicly announced a run for any office in 2026.
If the complaint is under his jurisdiction and moves forward, Gallus said he would request a response from the Secretary of State. He said respondents aren’t required to respond, but 99% of the time they do.
In this case, Gallus said the allegations are straightforward, so he anticipates being able to complete his initial review by possibly next week.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6608-scaled-e1768433925204-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

Up until spring 2022, Jeff Corle identified as a fourth-generation dairy farmer tending to his herd of Guernsey cows in Somerset County. But that year, “economic pressures had just caught up to us, and I made the most difficult decision of my life.”
He sold his “beloved and beautiful” cows. 
“I said to the cows, ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry that it’s come to this, and I’m sorry that somehow I couldn’t have been better and figured out some way to keep this thing going,’” said Corle. “I must have led a charmed life up until that moment, because I honestly didn’t know you could experience so much pain.”

In his bedroom, Corle said he had two items leaning against the wall: a loaded shotgun and a guitar. Picking up the latter brought him unexpected fame when he recorded and released “Empty Barn,” a song he wrote to process his own emotions.
Now, Corle tours as a musician, raising awareness and funds for mental health advocacy work in the agricultural space.
He visibly struggled to share his story before an audience Wednesday that included legislators, farmers and 4-H competitors. The state Senate and House Agriculture & Rural Affairs Committees held a joint hearing to discuss ways to support farmers through mental health crises during the annual Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg. 
Farmer suicide rates are significantly higher than the rates for the overall population, as detailed by the American Farm Bureau. The profession also has higher rates of depression anxiety and substance use when compared to non-farmers. 
“People are more than statistics. It is safe to say that most people involved in agriculture know at least one person who has struggled,” said Lisa Wherry, a Pennsylvania Farm Bureau member.
 Grant cuts in Pennsylvania

Guiding efforts like the organization’s Farm State of Mind, the Penn State Extension services’ Farm Stress Team works statewide to spread the word about available resources, but are hindered by slow broadband speeds and a shortage of rural health providers. 
But mental health and addiction advocates got a shock Tuesday night when the Trump administration terminated an unknown number of grants distributed through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, estimated to be worth around $2 billion nationwide.
Richard Edly, the president and CEO of the Rehabilitation and Community Providers Association (RCPA), which advocates for mental health and substance abuse treatment providers in Pennsylvania, said the letters came without warning.
Three members Edly spoke to Wednesday afternoon reported losing nearly $4 million dollars.
“No one got any heads up,” he said. “One provider said, ‘We have a three-year contract that we have all staffed up,’” but no money to run the program.

The SAMHSA grants are awarded to both county governments, which are the primary providers of public mental health services, and private contractors that offer services on behalf of the counties.
Melanie Gordon, who oversees human services and criminal justice policy for the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, said it remained unclear Wednesday whether the cuts were limited to substance abuse treatment programs in Pennsylvania.
“What programs are going to be affected is what we’re trying to wrap our hands around,” Gordon said.
RCPA’s national affiliate, the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, on Wednesday asked its members that received notices their grants were terminated to report it to the organization. It also asked groups to contact their U.S. representatives and senators.
Edly said the Trump administration’s move was “nonsensical” to him and the political goals unclear. He noted that the administration has rolled back sweeping funding cuts in response to political pressure or legal action.
“Are we contacting legislators in Washington just to complain or is there a feeling this can still be impacted?” he asked. “This is really bad, but in Washington there’s always another inning.”
 Many demands, few funds

Gov. Josh Shapiro pointed to millions of dollars invested in student health care and county-level services through the state budget, but acknowledged its limitations. He noted that several federal programs had been cut in the last year, including nutrition assistance and Medicaid. 
“I have said it over and over and over again. We cannot backfill that. We cannot make that up,” said Shapiro. “The consequences of these federal actions are real, and it’s going to hurt Pennsylvanians.
“We’ll make the investments we can make, but we cannot backfill the cuts that they’re making in (Washington) D.C.”

Sen. Elder Vogel, Jr. (R-Beaver), the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who oversaw the meeting on mental health, noted that tariffs levied against foreign states had added to the stress felt by Pennsylvania’s farmers. 
“It took us four or five years the last time (President Donald Trump) put tariffs on China to get our soybean exports back … and now they’re gone again,” said Vogel, whose family farm has existed for over 100 years.
He pointed to continued partnerships with organizations like the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau or Penn State to meet the needs of farmers, but acknowledged the budgetary restrictions that come with that. 
“There were $70-some million worth of requests, and we had $10-15 million worth of money to give out,” said Vogel about the budget process. “The need is there. We just have to find the money to be able to fulfill all these requests.”
In the meantime, farmer-turned-musician Jeff Corle said he’d found some success sharing his story with others and in just being vulnerable. 
“I don’t know if we can solve the economic problems today, but if there’s anything we can do for our fellow farmers, it’s to be there,” said Corle.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6315-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

The deadlines are Feb. 17 for any current officeholders and March 2 for others.
A spokesperson for Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen confirmed that those wishing to run for Legislative District 41, in central Nebraska, or the NU Board of Regents in District 4, in eastern Douglas County, will follow regular filing deadlines this year due to the timing of the vacancies.

Both races will appear on the May 12 primary election ballot and the Nov. 3 general election ballot. Two of eight regents seats were already up for election this  year, as were 24 of 49 legislative seats.
The legislative race would be for the final two years of a four-year term vacated by former State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who resigned Tuesday. The regent’s race would be to finish the final four years of a six-year term vacated by former NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, who resigned Friday.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen on Wednesday appointed former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul to succeed McKeon. He has not yet appointed a successor for O’Connor. Meyer will serve until at least Jan. 5, 2027, while O’Connor’s eventual successor will serve until at least Jan. 7, 2027. 
Meyer did not rule out running in the special election.

Both O’Connor and McKeon had faced disciplinary action in the Legislature, which has the sole authority to expel senators or impeach constitutional officers. 
O’Connor resigned Jan. 9 after seven years as a regent. She faces a felony charge of drunken driving and causing serious injury in a crash in mid-Omaha last May. The criminal case continues in Douglas County District Court. She has pleaded not guilty.
She had faced possible impeachment. It would have required at least 25 votes to pass. The Legislature last impeached a state official, also a former NU regent, in 2006. Impeachment requires approval from the Nebraska Supreme Court to remove the official.
McKeon resigned Tuesday, after little more than a year in office. He faces a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace in Lancaster County Court. He has pleaded not guilty.
He had faced possible expulsion, the debate for which was set to begin Tuesday, until he announced his resignation. Had he not resigned, multiple senators said there were at least 33 votes to expel him, which would have been a first in Nebraska history. 
The resignations ended both disciplinary efforts.
Neither O’Connor nor McKeon would be prohibited from running again this year for the same office. However, O’Connor could not run if convicted of a felony under a provision of the Nebraska Constitution.

(Photos via the Legislature; Capitol photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix.)It’s the Florida House’s turn to address school voucher accounting shortfalls. The Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved its package to fix problems uncovered by a state audit that created major consternation among lawmakers. 
The package SB 318, amending the laws governing the state voucher system, received support in the upper chamber, but its fate is now in the hands of the House, which hasn’t proposed a fix.
“The money is supposed to follow the student, but the students are on the move, before, during, and after the school year by the tens of thousands,” Sen. Don Gaetz, a Republican from Crestview, the sponsor, said during the first floor sitting of the session.
School daze: Rapid expansion of voucher program leaves public, private schools underpaid

In October, lawmakers in the House spent hours questioning Department of Education officials and administrators with scholarship funding organizations about how state funding navigates its way to schools, private and public. The universal vouchers are available for all families, regardless of income.
Not long after, a state audit found that the money was not moving the way it was supposed to. The audit concluded that “funding did not follow the child,” counter to the rallying cry of school-choice proponents that tax dollars should be allocated to students, not schools. 
“Fraudsters, unfortunately, have discovered our school choice program and they scammed millions of dollars by creating fictitious students. Not Minnesota, but not a good look,” Gaetz said, insisting that lawmakers must not let the budgeting problems persist, and pointing to alleged fraud in Minnesota‘s daycare system.
“North of a million” dollars are associated with fraudulent activity, Gaetz estimated during a news conference following the vote. Last year, the Phoenix reported about a private school receiving vouchers to educate students more than 100 miles away.
The Senate bill, more than 4,000 lines long, looks to establish clearer application and scholarship acceptance deadlines and to boost competition among scholarship-funding organizations, which manage the flow from the state to the schools, while providing more oversight to the state.
“A lot of times in government, we roll out things and the implementation part of it is a disaster, and what I appreciate today is not only did you keep us from committing legislative malfeasance, but you brought it publicly that we identified that we implemented a program, we couldn’t find students. We still have questions about money, but we were open, transparent about it, and we are addressing it through this bill,” Democratic Sen. Rosalind Osgood of Fort Lauderdale said.
The governor, Senate, and House all have recognized a need to make changes. The path to get there is not clear, however. The House has yet to propose a fix. 
A key provision from the Senate, differing from House leadership’s philosophy, is separating line items in the budget, creating an appropriation specifically for funding school choice vouchers, separate from overall school spending.
The Senate bill would expand the education stabilization fund to $250 million, something Gaetz said he believes could help the House agree to terms. The fund is supposed to help supplement funding for schools that enroll fewer students than the budget projected.
In the past four years, the voucher program has grown rapidly, serving about 500,000 students during the past school year. In 2021-2022, the program had served about 200,000 students. In 2024-2025, the program dished out $3.17 billion in Family Empowerment Scholarship vouchers and recorded another $804.5 million in scholarship programs funded through corporate tax credits, totaling nearly $4 billion dollars.  
The Senate approved an amendment eliminating a declining-enrollment supplement from the original conversation. Gaetz indicated he has “hope” that, in the budget-making process, that provision will resurface.



Voucher funding problems by the numbers

22-page-audit.
According to Gaetz, at any given moment, 30,000 students are unaccounted for.
Those students represent $270 million in education funding.
In 2024-2025, the DOE paid $655 million to scholarship funding organizations before school started, creating a “paying and chasing” system.
At least $7 million were sent to families by scholarship funding organizations before verifying if the student was attending a private school.
The education budget was $47 million short at the end of the last fiscal year, leaving some districts without money.
The audit found that at the end of last fiscal year, more than $400 million sat, unused, in scholarship accounts.
At the end of the 2024-25 school year, nearly 300 accounts for students with disabilities held “excess balances,” or more than $50,000 each in unspent money. The sum of the excess alone was $2.3 million.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Untitled-design-16-1024x538.png,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

She spoke about the shooting deaths of former Democratic Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home last June, as well as conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed at an event on a college campus last September.
“No matter how bitterly we might disagree on the important issues, we have to raise the decency in our rhetoric, together,” the Dillon Democrat said. “Violence can never be the price of democracy.”

She also pledged to “protect the progress” Democrats have made in recent years when it comes to civil rights protections in the state.
“We won’t shove our immigrant and LGBTQ neighbors back in the shadows,” she said. “We won’t give up on disability access or voting rights. We are a model for abortion rights in the post-Dobbs reality, and we won’t roll them back.”
Both McCluskie and Senate President James Coleman touted laws the Democrats passed in recent years with their wide majorities in the Legislature, including measures that protect reproductive rights, increase funding for schools and expand access to health care.
But funding freezes and other threats from the federal government will once again color the session as the second Trump administration enters its second year. The Legislature met last summer in a special session to mitigate the effects of federal tax policy on the state’s budget, and Colorado more recently faced a funding pause for its child care and other safety-net programs as the federal government investigates those services for potential fraud.
“I fear this administration will target Colorado no matter what we do. So members, let’s do what’s right,” McCluskie said. Colorado is a “bulwark” against the unpredictability of Congress and the Trump administration, she said. 
Coleman said the state’s already tight budget environment will be exacerbated by the federal government’s actions. 
“The federal government’s tariffs, haphazard clawbacks of funding for critical programs have sown uncertainty in our economy,” Coleman said. “They threaten our ability to provide the resources Colorado kids, families, seniors and rural communities depend on.”

This year, Democrats hope to grow the state’s affordable housing stock, stabilize health care premiums, streamline workforce training programs and push toward the state’s climate goals.
“We have, and will, work across the aisle to build a better Colorado, because the challenges facing our state demand nothing less,” Coleman said.
Coleman and McCluskie both paid tribute to former state Sen. Faith Winter, who died in a car crash last November. Coleman asked senators to honor her memory in how they show up at the Capitol, calling her a “coalition and team builder for the ages.”
“Faith’s loss is immeasurable, and as we embark on our work this session I hope that we can incorporate her tenacity and the joy that she found in this work into our policies, as well as the conversations we have with one another,” Coleman said. 
Republican perspective
Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican, commended the Democrats’ efforts to work across the aisle, but he said there will still be “fierce but respectful disagreements on policy.”
He spoke about the essential conservative priorities of his caucus, including parental choice for education and health care, gun rights and opposition to increased regulation, especially when it comes to energy and climate goals.
“We can work toward a cleaner environment, but we must do it pragmatically,” he said, adding that the state’s current trajectory is “activism on a collision course with reality.”
He pushed back on the Democrats’ assertion that federal law, including the One Big Beautiful Act passed last summer, is contributing to the state’s budget challenge.
“The reality is these challenges did not begin this year or with a single federal law. The issues Coloradans are facing have been building for years as a result of state-level decisions,” he said. “Overburdens, overregulation and unprecedented government growth from this building stifle economic prosperity.”
Caldwell also spoke about Kirk’s death, and said it was difficult to witness people “mock” Kirk’s death, especially because many conservatives share his Christian beliefs.

Coloradans want a government that listens to them and respects their work, Senate Minority Leader Cleave Simpson said in his opening speech on the Senate floor. The most urgent priority for the session is to lower costs, and he said Republicans will bring forward ideas “rooted in freedom, accountability, and respect for the people we serve.” 
“Lowering cost means making responsible decisions with taxpayer dollars,” Simpson said. “It means scrutinizing spending, reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and recognizing that every policy choice we make has real consequences for real people. Government should be a partner in affordability, not an obstacle to it.”
First bills introduced
After the opening day speeches, the House and Senate introduced the first batch of bills for the session.

One bill, Senate Bill 26-5, would let a person sue a federal immigration agent over constitutional violations. It comes as U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents ramp up operations in cities like Minneapolis and viral videos show officers breaking car windows, tackling residents and teargassing protestors. An officer fatally shot a Minneapolis woman, Renee Good, during an operation last week.
Senate Bill 26-4 would further expand who is able to file an extreme risk protection order against someone under Colorado’s “red flag” law, which allows a judge to temporarily remove a firearm from someone they deem potentially dangerous. It is often used in instances when a person is suicidal. The bill would now allow health care professionals and the facilities where they work to file an ERPO, as well as behavioral health treatment facilities, K-12 schools, and higher education schools to petition a judge as an institution. Legislators previously expanded the law to include educators and mental health providers, but the change hasn’t resulted in a larger number of petitions. Of the 164 ERPO petitions filed in Colorado in 2024, 118 were granted by a judge.  
House Bill 26-1001, dubbed the HOME Act, would let school districts, some nonprofits and transit districts to build housing on their land. A similar bill last year would have also included churches and other faith organizations, but it failed to pass. 
House Bill 26-1002 is bipartisan and would expedite credentialing for mental health and substance use providers to address that industry’s workforce shortage. 
House Bill 26-1005, the Worker Protection Act, which would remove a second election in the state’s union formation law, was also introduced on Wednesday.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina GOP leaders want to add colleges to 2-year-old rules requiring K-12 public school students to use bathrooms and locker rooms corresponding to their biological sex at birth.
A House panel began hearing Wednesday on the legislation sponsored by 60 Republicans that largely mirrors a law that’s been part of the state budget since 2024. Other than making those rules permanent state law, the proposal would extend them to the public colleges.
About 20 people weighed in during the one-hour hearing, with legislators calling on opponents and advocates in rotation. No vote was taken. A second public hearing is planned for Tuesday.
Like the existing rules, the bill’s restrictions apply to multi-stalled restrooms and places where students undress, to include locker rooms and gym showers. During overnight trips, students of different genders can’t sleep in the same room.
Colleges would newly be required to give students in dorms the option of living only with people of the same biological gender.
The penalty would be the same as the budget law: School districts and colleges risk losing up to 25% of their state aid for violations.
Legislators knew of no school district punished under rules first inserted into the state budget during Senate floor debate. While such clauses are technically one-year laws, they carry the same authority as permanent code.
Wednesday’s hearing came a day after lawyers argued two cases involving transgender students before the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices heard back-to-back arguments about laws in West Virginia and Idaho that ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports teams. South Carolina lawmakers passed a similar ban in 2022.
“In South Carolina, we know what a woman is,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said during a news conference ahead of the House hearing.
“And if it falls on South Carolina to educate the rest of the country about what a woman is, we are happy to,” the Edgefield Republican added.
Legislators contend it’s not a debate over discrimination but one of privacy.
“For generations, restrooms, locker rooms and overnight trips have been separated by sex, not because it was political, but because it’s common sense,” said Rep. Fawn Pedalino, R-Turbeville. “This is not about targeting anyone. It’s about setting firm statewide standards.”
Why now?
GOP leaders said legislation is needed to make the rules more permanent.
“We just want to get this straight and move on so we’re not having to continually deal with it,” said House Speaker Pro Tem Tommy Pope, the bill’s main sponsor.
Transgender SC student drops appeal in bathroom lawsuit after switching to virtual school

But debate to remove budget clauses — called provisos — is rare.
The one-year laws generally roll over from one budget to the next indefinitely, unless legislators specifically vote to take them out. There was zero debate on the bathroom rules last year.
Courtney Thomas of the American Civil Liberty Union’s South Carolina chapter called it election-year politics.
It’s concerning what the Legislature’s Republican leaders decided to highlight during the second day of the 2026 legislative session: “This is low-hanging fruit, unfortunately, to politicize a moment when they need eyes and attention and campaign dollars,” Thomas said.
The ACLU opposes both the existing budget rule and the proposed legislation, arguing it stigmatizes transgender children and adults and opens all people to scrutiny of their gender.
“Let’s just say your daughter or your niece wants to try out a shorter haircut,” Thomas said. “What if someone sees her in a bathroom and decides, ‘Hey, you shouldn’t be here.’ That is harmful for that girl.
“This bill creates an air of suspicion that would ask students and teachers and administrators to police who is and who isn’t feminine enough,” Thomas added.
Other existing laws criminalize harassment and violence in restrooms to protect all South Carolinians, making this proposal unnecessary, she said.
A matter of privacy?
Pope said legislators understand that transgender students have rights, but other students have rights too.
“We want to respect that child. That child can have access to privacy,” said the York Republican. “But to do it, we don’t need to rob everyone else’s daughter.”
A then-eighth grade transgender student in Berkeley County filed a federal lawsuit in November 2024 challenging the budget rule. The student dropped his appeal in October after switching to virtual learning, but the underlying case is still pending.
However, the case is on pause until the U.S. Supreme Court hands down a decision in the cases it heard Tuesday.

Public testimony
Opponents at the hearing included Jessicka Spearman Childs of Anderson County. Her transgender son took summer classes to graduate high school early “because he was exhausted due to bathroom bans in our local high school,” she said.
“This bill is not about privacy,” she said. “This is about making a bathroom into a courtroom. It’s about legislating fear, punishing schools financially and inviting lawsuits over hypothetical situations.”
Spearman Childs, who is nearly 6 feet tall, said strangers have questioned her about her own biological sex. Strangers have asked her to expose her breasts to prove she is a woman, she said.
Cristina Picozzi, executive director of Columbia’s Harriet Hancock Center for the LGBTQ+ community, said people often question the gender of her wife, a military veteran with a short haircut.
“I have seen firsthand how stereotypes impact her,” Picozzi said. “Before her last deployment, we were stopping in Charleston and the person at the counter repeatedly chose to misgender her when we were discussing clothing, even after we offered corrections.”

And when the couple goes out on dates, Picozzi said she intentionally accompanies her wife to the bathroom to prevent harassment.
“South Carolinians already manage privacy in multi-occupancy restrooms every day through stalls, doors and shared norms,” she said. “This bill invites scrutinization of one another’s bodies and identities, which undermines privacy for everybody.”
Picozzi also said 40% of LGBTQ+ youth who attend programs at the Harriet Hancock Center choose home schooling because of bullying in the public school system.
Greg Green spoke Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, at a House hearing in opposition to a bill restricting transgender bathroom use at public colleges and K-12 schools. (Screenshot courtesy of SCETV legislative livestream)
Greg Green of Lexington, a transgender man, said he’d be attacked if he entered a women’s restroom. “I’m going to be called sick,” he told legislators about what they’re requiring students to do.
Most proponents who signed up to speak voiced their support without giving any personal details.
Elizabeth Enns of York County said “many girls feel exposed, anxious and unsafe. Some have stopped using facilities altogether. Others have suffered harassment or voyeurism.” She did not cite any specific situations.
Marsha Gross, president of York County Republican Women, pointed to the same scenario cited in 2024 by the budget rule’s sponsor. Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill said at the time that his proposal was in response to a then-18-year-old senior at Rock Hill High daily using the women’s locker room.
Questions raised
A pair of Democrats on the committee, Reps. Tiffany Spann-Wilder of North Charleston and Jerry Govan of Orangeburg, questioned how much schools might have to spend to comply with the law and whether proponents had any data on the number of complaints against schools. No one did.
Sara Beth Nolan, who represents Alliance Defending Freedom, the group championing the bill, said many schools already have single-stall restrooms, or students can use bathrooms in the school nurse’s office.
In the Berkeley County case, school officials said the student was given the option of using a single-stall bathroom in the nurse’s office. But that wasn’t practical, since it was significantly further away from the student’s classes, according to the lawsuit.
Pope said the only concern he’s heard from colleges is over locker rooms. Colleges often assign away teams to use the opposite sex’s locker room during games. He said he plans to address that with language clarifying that members of male and female teams can’t be in a locker room at the same time.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3972-scaled-e1768435954613-1024x587.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

The Legislature is poised to pass the “Immigrant Safety Act” in the upcoming session. (Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM) New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will include legislation banning immigrant detention on the agenda for the legislative session starting Jan. 20, her office told Source NM on Wednesday. The Senate majority leader said the bill has growing support and strong prospects for passage.
But even if the Legislature passes and the governor enacts the legislation, two of the state’s three immigrant detention facilities run by a private prison contractor could potentially still be able to operate here.
The proposed “Immigrant Safety Act” would prohibit public entities from working with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or other federal agencies to house immigrant detainees in the state. Three rural New Mexico counties — Cibola, Torrance and Otero — have agreements with ICE and private prison companies that enable ICE to house a growing number of detainees in local jails.
Torrance County ICE contract extension ‘likely improper and invalid,’ NMDOJ says

If the Legislature passes the bill, counties will be prohibited from joining those contracts, known as “intergovernmental service agreements.” But nothing would stop CoreCivic, a private company that owns the jails in Cibola and Torrance counties, from contracting directly with ICE to continue housing detainees at its facilities, local officials and immigrant legal advocates tell Source. 
That’s what Torrance County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach presumes would happen, he told Source on Wednesday during a break in the commission’s regular meeting in Estancia.
Schwebach said he strenuously opposes the measure and said it puts the Torrance County facility on the “chopping block” should ICE decide to house detainees elsewhere. 
Brian Todd, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, declined to answer Source’s question about whether the company would contract directly with ICE if the “Immigrant Safety Act” becomes law, instead referring comment to ICE, which did not respond to Source’s request for comment. 
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based immigrant legal organization that does weekly jail visits in Estancia, said Wednesday that CoreCivic contracting directly with ICE is a “plausible” next step for the company, if one that his organization would oppose.
“It is well documented that ICE detention is harmful in all locations, and we believe that ICE detention should be ended in its entirety in the state of New Mexico,” he said. 
According to recent estimates, the Estancia facility currently houses an average daily inmate population of 480 detainees, some of whom have continuously reported poor conditions at the jail, including inadequate access to lawyers, mail, tablets or water. 
The current average population at the Cibola County Detention Facility in Milan is about 217 and is about 850 at the Otero Processing Center in Chaparral.
Unlike the Cibola and Torrance facilities, the Otero Processing Center is county-owned, and would be subject to the “Immigrant Safety Act.” 
Supporters of the bill say it removes New Mexico’s complicity in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. ICE arrested at least 1,800 immigrants in New Mexico last year, according to recent estimates. 
Local officials, on the other hand, have said the bill would devastate their towns by eliminating tax revenue and jobs the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency provides to house inmates.
NM committee chair who once stymied ICE detention center ban says he’s reconsidering

Philabaum, however, countered that “to suggest that this bill is going to remove these prisons and is actively aiming to harm these local economies, is disingenuous.”
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) told Source on Tuesday he believes that a “breakthrough” in his caucus occurred during interim committee meetings this summer, one that means both chambers of the Legislature will approve the bill, he said. He expects they’ll do so within the first two weeks of the session. 
“We have the votes in our caucus to send this up to the governor,” he said. “The agreement certainly is to move forward on an expedited basis, and I’m confident we’ll get this across the line.”
As for the facilities that might be exempt from the bill, Wirth said “those legal issues — understanding the impact on existing contracts, and the lay of the land moving forward with private contracts — are things we’ll discuss. I think the real big signal, though, this would send is that the state of New Mexico no longer should be part of this, and local government should not be part of this, immigration-focused detention.”
NM Republicans — and one Democrat — tour Otero ICE Detention Center 

A comparable bill introduced last year died without a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Sponsors in the state House of the “Immigrant Safety Act” told Source on Tuesday that they will reintroduce a version soon with minor changes. Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) describes the measure as a first step.
The bill doesn’t “end private detention overnight, but it ends New Mexico’s public role in it and forces any ICE/private prison operations to happen without county help, contracts or public resources,” Rubio said in a text message. “I can speak for my House colleagues I’m working with…that we’re committed to making sure this isn’t the only step we take.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7241-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 19:57:04.183954

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Senate is not giving up on a “rural renaissance.” Wednesday, the second day of the regular legislative session, saw unanimous support in a floor vote for Senate President Ben Albritton’s priority legislation.
The vote sent SB 250, sponsored by the citrus farming Albritton, on it’s way to the House.
Last year, the Senate passed the bill early on but the House wasn’t willing to pass it on to the governor.
“When you look in the eyes of some of my communities, and when I show up for our delegation meetings and they are coming, and I’m telling them to ask, ‘What do you need? What do you need?’ and they’re almost embarrassed to walk into those meetings with their hand out because they’re just hard-working people and honestly they don’t want to ask the government for anything,” the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Corey Simon, a Republican representing 12 rural counties near Tallahassee, said.
“But there are things that are needed in these communities, roads that are torn down, water systems that are failing, and so they do have that need,” Simon said.
Simon called it an à la carte system for rural communities rather than a mandate for them to grow.
“This won’t be the last time that I’m asking for rural Florida,” Simon said.
The bill includes appropriations and policy to expand funding opportunities for rural roads, housing, education, health care, and business.
The bill would increase the threshold for what a “fiscally constrained county” is from $5 million in property tax revenue per 1 mil to $10 million per 1 mil.
Fiscally constrained status is used in statute to qualify certain counties for extra support.
The bill, like last year’s, would create the Office of Rural Prosperity within the Department of Commerce. The office would facilitate planning and connect local governments to state and federal resources.
SB 250 would include a $1 million block grant for counties with declining populations. The grants would target population growth and be available annually until a county achieves three consecutive years of growth.
Rural teachers would be eligible for a student loan repayment program worth $15,000 per individual over five years.
Addressing the health care disparities between patient outcomes in rural and urban areas also is a goal of the legislation, specifically improving outcomes in rural areas for stroke and heart attack as well as obstetric care.
Simon sponsored an amendment to his bill that eliminated from the plan the Rural Access to Primary and Preventive Care Grant Program and the $25 million in the bill to help fund it. The program would have made grants of up to $25,000 available to physicians, physician assistants, and advanced practice nurses, who are authorized to practice independently from physicians, to open offices in a qualifying rural area. Only practices that are at least 50% owned by health care providers would have been able to qualify for the grant money.
The amendment also deleted language that would have updated statutes regarding the Rural Hospital Capital Improvement program to specify what the $100,000 grants under the existing program could be spent on. Specifically, the bill allows for mobile health care units that provide primary care, behavioral health services, or obstetric and gynecological services in rural health professional shortage areas as well as telehealth kiosks.
Last, the amendment deleted a Stroke, Cardiac, and Obstetric Response and Education (SCORE) Grant Program and $5 million earmarked to make it a reality.
The bill initially directed the  Department of Health to award grants to high-risk providers serving rural communities to develop training programs in stroke care protocols and best practices.
A staff analysis cites a Centers for Disease Control study showing that rural Americans are at 30% higher risk of stroke and 40% more likely to develop heart disease and live an average of three years fewer than urban counterparts. The analysis also cites CDC Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System data comparing pregnancy-related mortality in rural and urban areas between 2011 and 2016. The data show the death rate in rural areas was between 19.5-22.4 per 100,000 women compared to 15.7-17.9 deaths per 100,000 women in urban areas.
But the amendment struck the creation of the program
Trump administration awards Florida $209M for rural health improvements

Simon said he removed the provisions because they no longer are required now that Florida has received $209 million in rural health funds, made available  under the federal One Big Beautiful Bill law.
“Thanks to the Big One Beautiful bill, Florida has a unique opportunity to leverage significant federal funds to strengthen its delivery of rural health care,” Simon said.
Simon’s second amendment, more technical in nature, adjusts the funds in the bill directed to the state Agency for Health Care Administration for the development of a new Medicaid reimbursements methodology for federally certified critical care hospitals, or facilities with fewer than 35 beds that provide around-the-clock access to emergency care located in a rural area at least 35 miles from another hospital (or 15 miles in difficult terrain).
The amendment doesn’t lower the overall dollar amount ($437,613) directed to the agency but instead tinkers with how much will come from state general revenue compared to the Medical Care Trust Fund, which is where the state deposits federal health care dollars.

Brian Kemp speaks at 2026 Eggs and Issues. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLast year, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s priorities going into the 2025 legislative session had an almost singular focus: overhauling the state’s civil litigation system through a series of policies that proponents refer to as “tort reform.”
This year, with the fight over tort in the rearview mirror, Kemp has begun to roll out his plans for his last session in office. During a celebratory speech at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s annual Eggs and Issues breakfast, he previewed a series of new infrastructure proposals aimed at easing traffic, investing in natural gas infrastructure and reducing homelessness in Atlanta.
The Republican governor’s full budget proposal will be outlined during his annual State of the State address Thursday. But in his remarks to business leaders during Wednesday’s breakfast, held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Kemp offered a glimpse into his 2026 wish list, starting with capital projects aimed at reducing traffic.
“Road congestion doesn’t care if you’re a Republican or a Democrat, only that you’re running late to work or an appointment or to your kid’s ball game,” Kemp said. “It costs commuters time with their loved ones and money, it costs businesses valuable production output, and it costs the entire state potential economic development projects.”
Kemp’s proposed budget will include $1.8 billion to expand the I-75 South corridor in Henry County, as well as an additional $200 million to continue work on State Route 316/University Parkway, he said. Communities across the state would also receive an extra $250 million for local road projects, and rural areas would receive $100 million to strengthen or replace failing bridges. Rural communities would also receive an additional $35 million in the amended budget for natural gas infrastructure upgrades under Kemp’s proposal.
“All of this additional funding for transportation projects is certainly needed, but it also has the added benefit of keeping Georgians working in the years to come,” Kemp said.
He debuted a proposal to address homelessness in Atlanta by creating a $50 million grant that will allow the state to work alongside local nonprofit organizations, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and other advocates to decrease homelessness.
“This grant will act as a force multiplier to complement the good work already underway by Mayor Dickens and other champions on this challenging issue,” Kemp said.
Legislative leaders float different visions for tax relief for the 2026 session

Funds will provide funding for emergency shelter and transitional housing, mental health and substance use services and other outreach efforts to reduce homelessness in Georgia’s capital city ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which is expected to bring 500,000 visitors to Atlanta, according to some estimates. 
Other legislative leaders also discussed their priorities, with House Speaker Jon Burns highlighting his chamber’s plans to eliminate property taxes on primary residences, while Lt. Gov. Burt Jones pledged to continue lowering the state income tax rate.
“For too many families in our state, the cost of purchasing or building a home has put ownership out of reach,” Burns said. “This doesn’t just impact potential home buyers, it’s also a workforce development issue hurting businesses, job creators and local economies.”
Georgia Chamber President and CEO Chris Clark speaks at 2026 Eggs and Issues. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Chris Clark, the president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, lauded the new investments in Georgia’s infrastructure and efforts to reduce homelessness across the state.
“We all want to look good when the World Cup comes to town, but this is about men and women that live, work, play and pray here,” he said. “I think this was a wonderful announcement today, and hopefully it’s a trend for how states can work with local leaders to address those critical issues.”
On the topic of the Legislature’s dueling ideas for cutting taxes, Clark said he was eagerly awaiting the full proposals, but would not endorse either idea until more details become available.
“What we don’t want is to shift the tax burden from one place to another place, or have to raise taxes somewhere else to make up for it,” he said. “We’ll work with both the House and the Senate, we’ll listen to what their plans are, and then we’ll take a look and see how we weigh in.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A bill that would prohibit the acquisition of land via eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa advanced Wednesday from a House committee. 
House Study Bill 507 is one of several expected bills related to property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines expected in the 2026 session. 
Opponents of the bill said it would kill the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline which, according to lobbyists for the company, already has more than 1,400 easements with willing landowners for the pipeline. 
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, sponsored the bill and said it protects Iowans’ “fundamental right” to private property.
“Eminent domain should be incredibly rare and must meet the constitutional requirement of a public use,” Holt said. 
Proponents of the bill said it is a simple bill, unlike the bill that Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed last year that would have restricted the use of eminent domain by CO2 pipeline operators. 
A group of Republican lawmakers have been vocal in their opposition to the carbon sequestration project, which was granted the right of eminent domain by the state utilities commission in 2024. The House passed a similar bill in 2025 to ban the use of eminent domain by carbon capture pipelines, but the Senate did not take up the bill.

Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, expressed hesitancy advancing the bill Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting on the proposed legislation, because of the Senate’s inaction on the similar bill last year and the governor’s veto.
Wilburn reiterated his concern Wednesday, noting that Reynolds was “silent” on the issue of eminent domain and property rights during her Tuesday Condition of the State address.
“So when I say nothing has changed, the political conditions around this have not changed,” Wilburn, who was one of two no votes on the bill, said. 
Holt responded that neither the House nor the Senate can control what the governor does, nor can the two chambers control one another. 
“What we do is, we do what is right and we move forward and who knows what dynamics might change,” Holt said. 
In addition to bringing tax credits associated with the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, lobbyists for Summit argued in the subcommittee Tuesday the pipeline project would also be an economic opportunity for Iowa due to tax credits for enhanced oil recovery that were recently made available in the federal “big beautiful” law. 
Ethanol producers would have access to 45Z tax credits for producing the low carbon fuel by sequestering carbon dioxide into the pipeline. The carbon sequestration pipeline would be eligible for 45Q tax credits as it transports the carbon to underground storage and now, as that carbon is strategically pumped underground to increase the efficiency of oil wells. 
Holt said the Summit project is not a public use project, but “an economic development project.” 
Holt said public use refers to infrastructure projects like roads, schools or essential energy projects that are “convenient and necessary.” 
“The use of government power to seize property for a private economic development project is not constitutional,” Holt said.
Senate leadership has also indicated it plans to file a bill that would address the property rights issue by allowing pipeline operators to deviate from their state-approved routes in order to find willing landowners. 
House Republicans appear to be united over the eminent domain ban, despite the differences from the Senate. The only other dissenting vote on the bill in committee Wednesday came from Rep. Rick Olson, D-Des Moines. 
House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a Wednesday taping of “Iowa Press” that the House’s narrow eminent domain bill was rolled out early on to show that “it still is something that we really care about.” 
Grassley said the fact that the Senate is working on its own bill is a “positive sign towards finding some level of resolution.” 
“For the last several years, it’s just been bill after bill from the House’s perspective, heading over to the Senate,” Grassley said. “Regardless if we agree with one another, I think it’s a positive step forward … that there’s actual movement on both sides.”

Wooden Knife, the first female president of Rosebud, delivered the annual State of the Tribes speech to a joint session of the South Dakota Legislature on Wednesday at the Capitol.
The State-Tribal Relations Committee endorsed bills on health care and public safety before the session began, and both have been filed and have sponsors.

 Listen to Searchlight reporter Meghan O’Brien’s audio story on the State of the Tribes address. (Broadcasters: Scroll to the bottom of this story for downloadable scripts and audio files.)
Lakota and Dakota people have a lower life expectancy than the general population, Wooden Knife said, a sign that the federal government’s treaty obligations to provide for the health of Native Americans isn’t being upheld. Rosebud has sued the federal Indian Health Service more than once for failure to provide adequate health care.
Wooden Knife said the tribes need to look beyond IHS. 
A managed care model for tribal members on Medicaid has the potential to improve outcomes and efficiencies on and off the state’s reservations, she said.
In such a model, tribes could contract with the state of South Dakota to direct federal Medicaid dollars into a pool of funds for health care. An entity of the tribes’ choosing could negotiate costs with off-reservation providers and coordinate care — including preventative care or incentives for healthy habits — for tribal members who seek care on or off tribal land.
“When we stand together for health care, our Sioux Nation tribes, working with the state, can bring the strongest health care resources to the table to improve health care for Native Americans,” Wooden Knife said.
Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and is chair of the State-Tribal Relations Committee, which endorsed a bill he’s now sponsoring that would create a task force to study a managed care model in South Dakota.

Public safety
The State-Tribal Relations Committee also endorsed a bill that would recognize tribal law enforcement members as certified law enforcement under state law. That would enable legal protections for tribal police who assist state, county or local officers.
On Tuesday, Gov. Larry Rhoden endorsed that bill during his State of the State address. Wooden Knife did the same on Wednesday.
Tribes and state leaders have also pushed in recent years to get more tribal officers trained through the state’s basic law enforcement certification course, as most officers on tribal land are expected to train at a federal facility in New Mexico.
Tribal police to lawmakers: Recognize us as law enforcement

U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, has pushed for a Great Plains law enforcement academy for tribes, a move also endorsed by the State-Tribal Relations Committee, and, on Wednesday, by Wooden Knife.
“We look forward to working with you to improve law enforcement, to get training locally for our police officers, and to improve public safety for all South Dakotans,” Wooden Knife said.
Crow Creek Tribal Chairman Peter Lengkeek, among the tribal leaders on hand for Wooden Knife’s speech, said cooperation between state and tribal officials can work to improve public safety, provided that tribes maintain sovereignty.
For about a decade, Crow Creek has had an agreement whereby state troopers act as a police force on the reservation during its powwow. This year, Lengkeek said, the tribe expanded that agreement. Now the Crow Creek reservation, which can call on Bureau of Indian Affairs officers for aid but lacks a tribal police force, can call upon the Highway Patrol in public safety emergencies.
“We bring them on when we need them,” Lengkeek said.
Foster care
Wooden Knife also encouraged state leaders to work with tribes on foster care. Around 70% of children in foster care are Native American, according to the state’s most recent figures.
Efforts to expand the number of Native American foster homes have shown some promise, but most South Dakota foster parents are non-Native.
“We need an equal chance to preserve our children and families as the future of our Native communities, so the state should enter kinship placement agreements with the tribal governments,” Wooden Knife said, referring to a form of foster care placement that connects children with family members. 
Tribes hope to ‘reset’ state relations after Noem leaves office

There are no bills directly related to foster care and Native American families on the docket for the 2026 session at this point, but Rep. Peri Pourier, R-Rapid City, said she doesn’t expect that’s needed just yet.
Pourier, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, is on a group called the Indian Child Welfare Act Advisory Council, a state-level group named for the federal act that prioritizes keeping Native American families together. 
The council was born of a bill introduced and passed in 2024, and Pourier said important conversations about collaboration on kinship care and foster family recruitment are moving forward as a result.
The group, Pourier said, is “getting down to the nitty gritty, and they’re going to work together to see what things that they could come up with.
“If we need to step in with legislation,” she said, “we will.”
Water rights, consultation
Wooden Knife also encouraged the state to be in conversation with tribes on issues of water rights, water pipelines and drinking water access in the years ahead, noting the needs yet unmet by projects like the Mni Wiconi water pipeline. That project was first funded at the federal level in 1988 and needs upgrades, Wooden Knife said.
“As the state Legislature plans for water system improvements, we ask that you stay in touch with the Sioux Nation tribes, because we have senior water rights in the Missouri River basin and we are active water system operators,” she said.
Wooden Knife called for the governor and state lawmakers to meet at least quarterly to address the need for “increased consultation, mutual respect and consideration of mutually beneficial solutions to our shared concerns.”

I’d venture that most high school buildings do not have escalators. Not in Vermont at least. Burlington’s high school students, however, have a big one, right smack in the middle of their makeshift school at the former Macy’s department store.
For five years, the former outlet has served as a temporary home for Burlington High School students. Why? In 2020, high levels of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs — a known carcinogen — were discovered at their former high school building.
It forced the district and city to demolish the old high school building and construct a new one. It’s set to open (hopefully) by the start of the fall semester. 
The situation prompted Vermont lawmakers to create a state-led testing program, mandating strict limits on the level of PCBs in Vermont’s schools — limits that went well beyond federal Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.
But it has since cost the state millions of dollars, has been a general source of anxiety for superintendents awaiting testing at their districts and has exacerbated the already dire state of Vermont’s aging school buildings.
Now, lawmakers are mulling whether to end the first-of-its-kind program altogether. A bill, introduced last week by House Education Committee Chair Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, would terminate any scheduled testing for PCBs in Vermont’s schools.
Schools that have already tested positive would still have remediation and removal costs covered by the state under the bill.
State money to fund the program has since run dry, though. Michael O’Grady, a legislative attorney, said that although the Legislature intended to pay for all of the related testing and remediation, “the reality is those costs were much more than the money that’s available.”
Conlon, meanwhile, called the testing program “the mother of all unfunded mandates.”
It wouldn’t be the first time lawmakers in the House tried to repeal the testing program. 
“The bottom line is, if we’re going to do this, we’ve got to put our money where our mouth is, and say we’re going to pay for everything,” Conlon said Wednesday.
It’s questionable whether other lawmakers will jump on board. But in Vermont’s current political environment — where there appears to be broad agreement that education costs too much — perhaps we’ve reached a tipping point.
Still, the ethics of ending a testing program to detect known carcinogens could get complicated. Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, questioned whether lawmakers might be doing more harm than good in ending the program.
Conlon noted that the point of the bill “is not to say PCBs are dangerous or not dangerous. It’s not about the science, it’s about the funding.”
Still, it “doesn’t mitigate the reality that they are dangerous,” Harple said.
“I understand why we’re doing this,” she added. “I’m really torn on, what is the human cost, if we’re making a mistake.”

In the know
House Republicans hosted a press conference Wednesday afternoon, and like their Senate counterparts — and Democrats too, for that matter — they highlighted an agenda focused on affordability. 
Central to that agenda is education reform — and following through on the path started by last year’s Act 73.
“We also stand ready to follow through on desperately needed education reform. We all know the status quo is unacceptable,” Rep. Pattie McCoy, R-Poultney, the House minority leader, said. “It’s leading to higher and higher taxes with declining performance. Last year, we started on a transformation path, and it’s critical we stay the course.”
McCoy also said the GOP Caucus intends to pursue repeals of the Global Warming Solutions Act and Clean Heat Act.

State officials steering the $195 million federal grant for rural health care transformation told the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare this morning how they are working to put that money into use under a tight deadline.
Things have moved fast and loose with the federal agency administering the funds to the state. When Vermont learned it had been awarded the grant in late December, the agency had little information about the process and timeline set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Wednesday, officials had slightly more insight. 
The federal agency just sent the Vermont Agency of Human Services a welcome packet, said Jill Mazza Olson, who oversees the agency’s Medicaid and health systems and led the grant application. CMS has yet to meet with representatives from the state, she added.
Committee members were particularly concerned about which providers will qualify as “rural,” making them eligible to receive the funds. Chittenden County is the one part of the state that does not fit the definition of rural that the feds have been using; but, the county is also home to the state’s only high-acuity center.
“I’m concerned about (Chittenden County) for a lot of different reasons, not simply because it’s my district,” said Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, the committee chair. “But also because it’s fundamental to care in the state.” 
For now, Olson’s understanding is that all providers in Vermont are eligible for the rural health transformation grant funds, regardless of location, so long as the money benefits rural patients. But, if one thing’s clear about how these rural health dollars are set to be used, it’s that the state still needs to learn a whole lot more.

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott wants to use the state’s annual midyear budget tuneup to set aside $75 million for property tax relief. But legislative leaders said they would rather hold on to that money, at least for the time being.
“It’s just not appropriate to be doing it at this point in time,” said Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, who chairs the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee.
At issue is how lawmakers will contend with the nearly 12% average increase in property taxes projected this year across the state. To blunt that expected hike, Scott wants to include about $75 million in this year’s Budget Adjustment Act.

Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns.
An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.
After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.
But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.
In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “unless deadly force is authorized.”
About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.
We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.
This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.
“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”
“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.
Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot a man and woman in a hospital parking lot.
Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”
Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.
Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count how often it detains citizens or smashes through vehicle windows during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.
Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.
But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.
That norm has now been broken.
 One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old.

Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.
Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.
One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.
“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”
DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.
McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.
Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.
“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”
DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”
 After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out.

In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.
Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.
According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”
Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.
Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.
But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.
The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death.
“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”
In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.
“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ use-of-force policy states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”
In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested he had only pretended to have a medical crisis while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.
“These statements were lies,” Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)
A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”
Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”
 DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway.

When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”
But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.
In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.
Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”
When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”
That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.
The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.
Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito limped into court days after the incident. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.
 Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous.

A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently passed out after officers pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street. “Aire, aire, aire,” he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo” — I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.
Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.
“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.
Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”

Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.
When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.
“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.
Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.
 Protesters have also been choked and strangled.

In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground.
“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”
DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.
Along with two similar choking incidents at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.
“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”
“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”
“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”
 Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics.

In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.
The Charlotte operation was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by commander-at-large Gregory Bovino claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently chased down landscapers, construction workers and U.S. citizens in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.
Freelance photographer Ryan Murphy, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.
“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”
Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.
“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.
“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”
There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a lack of consequences amid gutted oversight. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”
As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, where citizens — and protesters — abound, takes another.
DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.
 Experts may think there’s abuse. Holding officers to account? That’s another matter.

Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.
Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.
From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.
Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.
The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.
“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”
Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.
In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.
In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)
In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester and reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which announced it was looking into the incident.
In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government cut the state out of its investigation.
Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.
The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.
Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”

How we did it
Nicole Foy is ProPublica’s Ancil Payne Fellow, reporting on immigration and labor. journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.
We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.
Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.
We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino.

La caída de la tasa de libertad condicional demuestra que eso no es una garantía.,Joe Garcia,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2026/01/muchos-presos-de-california-reciben-una-segunda-oportunidad-la-caida-de-la-tasa-de-libertad-condicional-demuestra-que-eso-no-es-una-garantia/,"Muchos presos de California pueden tener la oportunidad de ser liberados gracias a la ampliación de la libertad condicional. Sin embargo, para obtenerla, es necesario demostrar crecimiento personal y responsabilidad ante la Junta de Libertad Condicional estatal.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Miles de presos en California comparecen cada año ante la Junta de Audiencias de Libertad Condicional con la esperanza de obtener la libertad. Es una situación desalentadora que implica un alto riesgo para todos los involucrados.
Los comisionados de libertad condicional deben cumplir con las normas legales, a la vez que consideran las cuestiones de rehabilitación, seguridad pública y los daños duraderos causados por el delito cometido. Los delincuentes condenados deben intentar presentarse con sinceridad , con todo y sus defectos, mientras se discuten abiertamente sus expedientes de custodia y evaluaciones de riesgo psicológico. Las víctimas y los fiscales asisten a las audiencias, generalmente para argumentar en contra de la libertad condicional. De vez en cuando, abogan por la liberación de la persona encarcelada.
Aparte del poder de veto del gobernador , las conclusiones de los comisionados suelen ser la última medida preventiva contra la liberación de un exdelincuente. Los comisionados reciben una capacitación exhaustiva y son muy cuidadosos al decidir si alguien es apto para la libertad condicional, como lo demuestra una tasa de reincidencia inferior al 3%, lo que significa que el 97% de los presos en libertad condicional nunca reinciden. Menos del 1% reincide por delitos de violencia contra otra persona.
Durante la última década, aproximadamente, California amplió las oportunidades de libertad condicional para las personas condenadas por delitos cometidos durante su juventud y para los presos de edad avanzada. El número anual de audiencias de libertad condicional aumentó de forma constante: de 5226 en 2018 a 9017 en 2022, antes de estabilizarse en unas 8000 en 2023 y permanecer en ese nivel. La población carcelaria del estado también se redujo significativamente durante esos años, de 128 000 en 2018 a unas 90 000 en la actualidad.
 El Departamento de Correccionales y Rehabilitación de California ha intentado cambiar su modelo de encarcelamiento para centrarse en la liberación y la reinserción social de los reclusos jóvenes. Ofrecer mejores oportunidades a los reclusos jóvenes al inicio de su encarcelamiento puede ayudarlos a evitar los riesgos del consumo de drogas, la violencia y las pandillas en prisión. Los reclusos mayores generalmente tienden a superar su comportamiento delictivo previo con la edad.
Al incentivar los programas de rehabilitación, el tratamiento del abuso de sustancias y la educación superior, el sistema ahora aspira a ayudar a los delincuentes a trabajar productivamente hacia el crecimiento y la superación personal.
Pero al mismo tiempo, incluso con aparentemente muchas más oportunidades e incentivos, la tasa de éxito de los presos que solicitan ser considerados para la libertad condicional ha disminuido gradualmente: del 39% en 2018 al aproximadamente 35% entre 2019 y 2021, y a menos del 25% en 2025.
CalMatters conversó con expertos en libertad condicional para comprender la dinámica detrás de las cifras. Nadie pudo señalar una única razón para la significativa disminución en las tasas de concensión de las peticiones de libertad condicional; los expertos, en cambio, afirmaron que esta tendencia descendente puede atribuirse a diversos factores.
Esto es lo que descubrimos con esta investigación: 
Algunos presos de edad avanzada tienen dificultades en las audiencias
 Muchos presos mayores de California con cadena perpetua comenzaron sus condenas hace décadas, cuando las oportunidades de libertad condicional eran escasas. Creían, lógicamente, que no tenían esperanza de obtenerla. Muchos se quedaron atrapados en prisiones remotas sin acceso a programas de rehabilitación. Ahora enfrentan desafíos significativos para comprender y articular plenamente las pruebas de transformación personal que exigen los comisionados de libertad condicional, como la comprensión, el remordimiento y la responsabilidad.
“El número de personas mayores que ahora pueden optar a la libertad condicional está aumentando significativamente”, afirmó Lilli Paratore, directora de servicios legales de UnCommon Law, una organización que representa a decenas de aspirantes a la libertad condicional cada año sin costo alguno para los presos. “En 2013, solo el 19% de las audiencias eran para mayores de 60 años, pero ahora el 32% de las audiencias son para personas mayores de 60 años, y, por supuesto, esto refleja el envejecimiento de la población carcelaria”.
Aproximadamente 19,000 presos tienen 55 años o más, según la propuesta de presupuesto estatal que el gobernador Gavin Newsom publicó este mes.
 Y a medida que estos presos mayores envejecen, su salud mental y física puede deteriorarse y afectar negativamente su capacidad para presentarse ante la junta de libertad condicional. En lugar de prepararse mejor con el tiempo, las reiteradas denegaciones de libertad condicional solo los dejan cada vez más frustrados, confundidos y desanimados. 
 Menos urgencia por parte de algunos jóvenes infractores
 Los riesgos no son los mismos para los delincuentes sin cadena perpetua que cometieron delitos siendo menores de 26 años. La ampliación de las oportunidades de libertad condicional ahora les permite comparecer ante la junta después de 15 años. A diferencia de los condenados a cadena perpetua, saben que tienen una fecha de liberación predeterminada. Que les nieguen la libertad condicional podría significar esperar otros cinco o diez años para volver a casa, en lugar de potencialmente no ser considerados aptos para la libertad.
 Además, es posible que los jóvenes no aprovechen al máximo esos primeros 15 años tras las rejas para rehabilitarse. Algunos lo hacen, pero muchos flaquean antes de descubrirse a sí mismos. Suelen ver su audiencia de libertad condicional como una oportunidad para cumplir una condena reducida, en lugar de como su única oportunidad de libertad.
 En cambio, los delincuentes juveniles que cumplen cadena perpetua tienen su primera oportunidad de libertad condicional tras cumplir un mínimo de 20 o, más habitualmente, 25 años. Esto, naturalmente, les da más tiempo para madurar y prepararse para una audiencia. Aprecian la libertad condicional de una manera que quienes no cumplen cadena perpetua no pueden, ya que sus condenas son indefinidas. 
Barra alta para los delincuentes sexuales
 Los delitos sexuales generan el mayor escrutinio en las audiencias de libertad condicional y despiertan la mayor cantidad de alertas psicológicas. Debido a la dificultad para hablar abiertamente de estos delitos en grupos de discusión, especialmente en comunidades carcelarias, pocos programas de rehabilitación están diseñados para abordar los desencadenantes específicos, los factores causales y los sistemas de creencias erróneos que los sustentan.
 “Hay muchos tipos diferentes de personas que cometen delitos sexuales por una gran variedad de razones, y una programación eficaz para estas personas debe adaptarse a ese problema específico”, dijo Jennifer Shaffer, exdirectora ejecutiva de la Junta de Audiencias de Libertad Condicional. “Así, por ejemplo, hay sádicos, personas que se excitan físicamente torturando a otras personas. Eso es muy diferente de alguien que tiene problemas de ira y los expresa básicamente dominando sexualmente a alguien”.
Debido a que es mucho más difícil para los delincuentes sexuales demostrar a la junta de libertad condicional la comprensión y transformación personal necesarias, los comisionados de libertad condicional tienen menos probabilidades de absolver a estos delincuentes por no considerarlos ya un “riesgo para la seguridad pública”.
 Parte del problema radica en que a los agresores sexuales les resulta más difícil superar una evaluación de riesgo psicológico. “Por horrible que suene, es posible que en algún momento hayan equiparado el dolor con la excitación sexual, y romper esa conexión es realmente difícil y requiere una programación muy intensa”, afirmó Shaffer. 
 La huella digital de un prisionero
 Los comisionados de libertad condicional revisan el expediente completo de una persona días antes de su audiencia y tienen la tarea de interpretar todos los hechos desde la perspectiva de la seguridad pública. Cualquier información, como registros de visitas, informes, gastos personales y más, podría considerarse pertinente.
 “En los últimos años, el volumen de información que la junta analiza ha aumentado, aunque no esté necesariamente relacionada con el riesgo de violencia”, dijo Paratore. “Se centran cada vez más en el fraude (por desempleo) y la evasión de indemnizaciones. Analizan los historiales médicos. Analizan cada vez más la información confidencial.
“Lo que creen que deben considerar ha aumentado sin ningún tipo de parámetros, lo que ha resultado en que a más personas se les niegue la libertad condicional porque la junta no sabe interpretar correctamente esa información. Esto aplica especialmente a los historiales médicos.”
 California comenzó a proporcionar tabletas electrónicas gratuitas a su población carcelaria en 2021, lo que garantiza que todas las llamadas telefónicas y mensajes de texto se monitoreen digitalmente y estén listos para su análisis y búsqueda mediante inteligencia artificial. Este tipo de registros detallados ahora se pueden identificar fácilmente y poner a disposición de los comisionados de libertad condicional.
 Por ejemplo, se puede prestar más atención a cómo los presos obtienen dinero externo depositado en sus cuentas fiduciarias institucionales y cómo pagan el comedor y otros servicios. Tras la ayuda por la COVID-19 y la gran cantidad de solicitudes fraudulentas de desempleo en todo el estado, la actividad de las cuentas fiduciarias de algunos reclusos se puso en tela de juicio. Este mayor escrutinio atrajo una atención no deseada hacia otras posibles formas de mala conducta.
 Fraude de restitución
Los tribunales penales pueden ordenar grandes cantidades de restitución cuando una persona es condenada, generalmente divididas en costos judiciales y honorarios por servicios a las víctimas. A los presos que adeudan restitución siempre se les deducirá el 50% de cualquier salario o ingreso hasta que la deuda se salde. Si una persona trabaja en una cocina por $80 al mes, se queda con $40. Lo mismo ocurre si su familia le envía $200. Recibirá $100 para gastar.
 En particular, para los condenados a cadena perpetua por delitos violentos, la restitución puede ser bastante elevada y, al parecer, imposible de pagar mediante estas cuotas deducidas al 50%. Para evitar perder la mitad de su dinero, algunos presos piden a sus familiares y amigos que depositen dinero en las cuentas de otras personas que no deben restitución. Los presos acuerdan entre ellos una cuota de deducción mucho menor, generalmente del 20%, y reservan más dinero para la cantina.
 Pero estas transacciones clandestinas ahora dejan una huella digital más profunda. Los comisionados de libertad condicional quieren ver a una persona mostrar arrepentimiento y ser consciente del impacto de su delito en las víctimas. Es una mala imagen que esa misma persona participe en la evasión de la restitución para ahorrar dinero.
 “El tema de la restitución es lo único que se me ocurre para explicar realmente la disminución en la tasa de concesiones”, dijo Vanessa Nelson-Sloane, directora de Life Support Alliance, un grupo de defensa de los condenados a cadena perpetua, tanto encarcelados como excarcelados. “A veces, cuando se aprueba una nueva ley, una nueva población entra en el ciclo de libertad condicional, pero recientemente no ha habido leyes nuevas que cambien las consideraciones”.
 “Estoy tan seguro de que es así porque eso es todo lo que oigo de la gente a la que se le niega: restitución, restitución, restitución”.

Flu in North Carolina is widespread right now, and state health officials say they’ve seen a significant uptick in flu-related deaths in the first two weeks of January.
New data released Wednesday by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services shows 63 new flu-related deaths, bringing the total to 134 deaths this flu season. Last year at this time, NCDHHS reported 74 flu-related deaths.
Dr. Erica Wilson, medical director for the Medical Consultation Unit within the state’s Division of Public Health, says every flu season is a little different, and it’s unclear when North Carolina’s flu season will peak this year.
“Last year, we had a much later flu season. It didn’t really peak until February,” said Wilson. “This year, we’ve seen one very high peak already in early January.”
Last year’s flu season was also one of the worst since North Carolina began recording the number of flu deaths. The 2026 flu season could be just as deadly.
NCDHHS is encouraging people who have not had a flu shot to get vaccinated this season. Vaccines remain one of the most effective means available to prevent severe illness or hospitalization, Wilson said, and it’s not too late to get one.
“That’s the only way that we can mitigate the flu season and hopefully see fewer deaths this year than last year,” Wilson said.
A lot of North Carolinians haven’t yet heeded that advice. The state’s Respiratory Virus Surveillance Dashboard shows just 21% — roughly one in five people — have received a flu vaccine for the 2025-26 season. (For the Covid vaccine, less than 6% of the state’s eligible population has been vaccinated.)
“When we see lowering vaccination rates, we see not only the spread of flu, but recurrence of diseases that we have not seen in years, such as measles,” said Wilson.
While some critics have suggested this year’s flu shot is not very effective against the new strain of influenza A virus that’s now circulating, Wilson stressed it does offer protection.
“We often see peaks in a flu season with different types of flu. So our first peak was that new subclade K [variant], but it’s also possible that we could get a second peak that is another flu virus that may be a match to the vaccine as well,” she said
Nearly everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season, according to NCDHHS.
If you’re particularly vulnerable to the flu and other respiratory viruses, health officials recommend masking if you’re in a crowded place. If you do have any flu-like symptoms, cover your cough and stay home so that you don’t spread the illness to others, they said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_295793977-scaled-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 18:57:58.184469

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The attorney for a south Arkansas candidate for a state House seat said Wednesday that he plans to appeal a judge’s decision not to disqualify his client’s opponent from appearing on the Republican primary ballot.
John Kyle Day asked the Pulaski County Circuit Court in December to disqualify his opponent, Laura “Missy” Wardlaw, from running to represent House District 94 in the Legislature.

Day v. Wardlaw decision 
Wardlaw had been charged in 2018 with writing a hot check and had forfeited bond, which typically happens when a defendant fails to appear in court. Day had argued that amounted to a conviction, making Wardlaw ineligible to run for elected office.
Arkansas’ constitution prohibits people convicted of an “infamous crime” such as embezzlement or forgery from holding elected office. 
Circuit Judge Cathleen Compton ruled after a trial Tuesday that Wardlaw may remain on the March 3 ballot. Compton sided with Wardlaw’s attorney, who had said the candidate is eligible because she forfeited bond and didn’t plead guilty or face trial over the misdemeanor charge.
Jacob Swatley, Day’s attorney, told the Arkansas Advocate he plans to appeal the matter to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The upcoming primary election on March 3 “will be taken into consideration” in Day’s request for an appeal, Swatley said.

Landon Sanders, Wardlaw’s attorney, noted that the primary is “right around the corner” and said Wardlaw will continue to campaign while the appeal is pending.
“Her votes should be counted, they should be certified, and a bond forfeiture is not an admission of guilt,” Sanders said.
If the Arkansas Supreme Court rules before the primary that Wardlaw is disqualified from running for office, any votes cast for her in portions of Bradley, Desha and Drew counties would not be counted.

Wardlaw and Day are running for the House seat held by Wardlaw’s husband, term-limited Republican Rep. Jeff Wardlaw of Hermitage. The winner of the March primary will be unopposed in November’s general election.
Last week, Compton ruled that Casey Reed of Sheridan is ineligible to run for a House seat in parts of Grant and Saline counties because he signed a guilty plea in 2012 for a felony charge of abuse of public trust, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Reed had filed to run in the Republican primary to succeed Republican Rep. Julie Mayberry of Hensley, who declined to run for reelection. Two other Republicans are running in the primary, and the winner will be unopposed in November.

Water experts warn that New Mexico still needs more data and policy to address a potential ‘looming groundwater crisis’ from climate change and human use. (Diana Cervantes for Source NM)Even as water advocates praised lawmakers’ record funding proposals for aquifer mapping and other water priorities in the upcoming 2026 legislative session, a report urged the Roundhouse to do more to protect the state’s declining groundwater.
The New Mexico Groundwater Alliance, made up of water policy experts from around the state, released the 80-page report Wednesday. Groundwater accounts for more than half of New Mexico’s total supplies and about 80% of the state’s drinking water. The report builds on previous findings that the already arid state faces a shrinking supply, estimated to be 25% to 30% by 2050, from hotter temperatures and continued pumping. 
“New Mexico is at the front lines of climate change impacts, which threatens water resource availability,” the report stated. “Groundwater management is paramount to the resilience of water supplies, communities, and economies for generations to come.”
In the last several decades, the fastest-dropping groundwater levels include important agricultural and residential basins: the Ogallala aquifer near Clovis and Portales; the Mimbres Basin near Deming; Estancia Basin in east-central New Mexico; the Albuquerque Basin; and the Placitas and East Mountains areas.  
In order to address the threat of a “looming groundwater crisis,” the report requests that lawmakers and the state government map aquifers; better monitor pumping; develop technical assistance for local management; and ensure groundwater is included and understood in regional planning efforts. The report also includes for consideration groundwater management policies from around the state and neighboring Western states.
The policies don’t require New Mexico “to reinvent the wheel,” coauthor Aron Balok, superintendent of the Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy District, said in a statement. “Many of our local communities already have the experience, knowledge and determination needed to protect our groundwater,” Balok said. “The state should look to these communities and figure out how to replicate what we know is already working.”
Already, lawmakers have proposed record funding for water priorities, including more than $22 million to map the state’s aquifers, more than double 2025’s funding of just over $7 million. 
Everyone agrees: Big data gaps remain as state explores brackish water market 

“Policymakers understand that we need sound science, data and modeling to better manage our groundwater resources and we’re ready to supply it,” said Stacy Timmons, associate director of Hydrogeology Programs at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, in a statement. “Building on the initial funding provided by the Legislature last session, we’re prepared to execute a long-term strategy that will close our water data gaps and modernize our antiquated systems using 21st century technology.” 
Additionally, the Legislature proposed $15 million for the River Stewardship Program for the environment department for rivers, streams and wetlands projects; and $15.5 million for the Strategic Water Reserve after changes to the program in 2025 to allow additional uses for banking water in New Mexico rivers. 
Water getting this much funding and attention at the Roundhouse is “rare but welcome,” Tricia Snyder, the rivers and water director for New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, told Source NM in a call. 
“We’re seeing the water crisis with the naked eye,” she said, referring to the summer drying of Rio Grande and continued snow drought.  “There’s challenges there that we have never experienced before, it’s becoming self-evident that we really have to figure out solutions because it only gets harder from here.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Release-21-Edited-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 18:57:58.184469

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)New Jersey’s congressional Democrats and Roxbury residents are decrying Trump administration plans to turn a warehouse in this Morris County town into the state’s third immigration detention center.
The lawmakers called it “unconscionable” that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would consider building another migrant jail in New Jersey, even after an uprising and a detainee’s death at Delaney Hall, the Newark facility that opened last year. They urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons to “immediately cease” any plans for a jail in Roxbury.
Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

“Immigration detention facilities in New Jersey have become notorious for inefficiency and waste in addition to humanitarian failure. These failures have inflicted trauma both on detained individuals and on surrounding families, communities and local governments who have been forced to grapple with the ongoing harms associated with immigrant detention,” they wrote in the three-page letter.
According to the Washington Post, internal ICE documents show the Trump administration is seeking contractors to turn industrial warehouses into jails to hold thousands of immigrant detainees. Roxbury is among two dozen locations across the country where officials are mulling warehouse jails.
“The proposal would subject thousands of people, the majority of whom pose no threat to public safety, to confinement under cruel and inhumane conditions. Warehouses are designed for storage and shipping, not for safely housing people,” the lawmakers’ letter reads.
They stressed that ICE detention facilities “already have a poor track record.” Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, making it one of the deadliest years in the agency’s history, according to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that track in-custody deaths.
The Democrats noted in their letter that prior to Delaney Hall’s opening, they warned of the dangers of expanding immigrant detention and urged officials to reverse those plans. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement entered into a 15-year contract with prison company Geo Group to operate the 1,000-bed facility anyway, and the facility opened last spring.
Since then, Delaney Hall has been at the center of numerous controversies. Newark city officials alleged Geo Group opened it without securing the proper permits, prompting a lawsuit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested there May 9 — he was charged with trespassing, and prosecutors quickly dismissed the case — and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D) was charged with assault in connection with the melee that occurred when agents moved to detain Baraka. In June, four detainees escaped after knocking down a shoddy wall, and in December, a detainee died less than a day after arriving at the jail.
The letter from Democrats comes on the heels of Roxbury’s all-GOP council unanimously passing an ordinance that says the town is “not an appropriate municipality” for a detainee processing facility. The ordinance says township officials have not been approached or solicited by the federal government about opening the facility there.
Currently, New Jersey is home to two detention centers, Delaney Hall and Elizabeth Detention Center. A state law bars local, state, and county governments from entering into contracts with federal immigration authorities for housing migrant detainees, though private companies may still do so.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Deborah Yetter)LOUISVILLE — Large, “hyperscale” data centers are expanding rapidly in the United States and unless people are willing to give up the internet, cloud computing, navigation systems — and yes, even Netflix — communities should be planning how to locate and regulate them.
That was the consensus of a Louisville Forum panel Wednesday that met to discuss the controversial but seemingly inevitable growth of the massive centers that one panelist described as “a warehouse full of computer equipment” powering a wide range of internet services.
“Data centers are increasingly important in our country and around the world because of our reliance on the internet, cloud computing, AI,” said Cliff Ashburner, a lawyer at the Dinsmore firm who has been involved in the only one currently underway in Kentucky.
The $11 billion center is under construction on Camp Ground Road in southwest Jefferson County.
“This is a thing that is happening and I believe that Kentucky should position itself and Louisville should position itself to take advantage of it and allow for data centers to locate in our state and our community,” Ashburner said.
The one-hour forum hosted by the nonpartisan public interest group included questions from the audience about the purpose and potential impact of data centers.
Such centers have been controversial because of their size, potential noise or pollution, the huge amounts of electricity they require and fears of possible rate increases by utility companies that must expand generating capacity to serve them.
But Rob Houchens, with We Are Oldham County, and a member of Wednesday’s panel, said he’s not opposed to data centers even though his group helped organize a successful fight to block a 1.7 million square foot center proposed last year in his county.
“It’s about location, location, location,” he said, adding the proposal developers eventually dropped was too near residential areas and not far enough off the main highway. Also, Oldham County lacked adequate regulations for such developments, which officials now are close to adopting, he said.
Newly installed, industrial-sized cooling equipment for a massive data center in Loudon County, Virginia, is seen on a cold day, Jan. 21, 2025.
“That’s what we didn’t have in Oldham County,” he said, referring to pending regulations. “It caught us off guard.”
Houchens said he does not oppose a data center in Oldham County on a more suitable site.
As for electricity rate increases, panelist and utility executive John Bevington argued that’s unlikely in Kentucky.
Utilities are regulated by the state Public Service Commission and utility companies must justify plans for expansion and any rate increases, he said. And data centers would buy an enormous amount of electricity, bringing significant revenue to the power company, said Bevington, , a senior director of business and economic development for Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities.
“In the end, I think data centers could actually put downward pressure on rates,” Bevington said.
Power demand from data centers is straining supply for the nation’s largest power grid operator, PJM, as power rates have risen for consumers, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. PJM manages a 13-state grid that includes part of Eastern Kentucky.
Consumer advocates have warned that ratepayers could get stuck with higher bills if utilities expand capacity only to have data center plans fall through. Houchens noted that some states, including Ohio, have adopted consumer protections that add “tariffs” for data centers to make up the difference if they use less electricity than projected. 
Houchens allowed that traffic, especially during the construction phase, and pollution, could affect communities. The pollution could come largely from enormous diesel generators data centers use onsite in the event of a power outage.
In that event, “You’re going to have a great number of diesel generators operating,” he said.
But data centers can generate important revenue including property taxes Houchens acknowledged he’d like to see for Oldham County schools.
In Louisville, the data center under construction will generate about $46 million a year for Jefferson County Public Schools, about $10 million for Metro Government and $12 million for the Pleasure Ridge Park fire department, Ashburner said.
Scheduled to open in 2026, it will create about 210 jobs  — mostly internet technology and systems related — at an average salary of $112,000 a year, he said, adding most communities would view those jobs as “big wins.”
“They are very real and high-paying,” he said.
One question focused on tax incentives and whether Kentucky needs more to attract data centers. The GOP-dominated General Assembly in 2024 enacted tax breaks for centers seeking to locate in Jefferson County.
Houchens, of the Oldham County citizens group, said he doubts further tax breaks are necessary given the eagerness of developers to build data centers.
“There’s already an appetite to build them here,” he said. “I’m not sure we need any more incentives.”
As for the future of data centers in Louisville and Kentucky, panelists agreed more are likely — though mostly outside urban settings.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa lawmakers and community college leaders have found themselves on the same page about the potential benefits of offering baccalaureate degrees based on local needs, with legislation to make that potential a reality already filed.
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields, joined by Iowa Central Community College President Jesse Ulrich, Eastern Iowa Community Colleges Chancellor Bryan Renfro and Iowa Western Community College President Dan Kinney, presented to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee Wednesday on a study into community college bachelor’s degree programs.
Based on research into other states’ policies and impacts of implementation, Shields said the move into bachelor’s degrees has been seen less as a pivot away from the traditional community college mission and more as an expansion of it.
“As an expansion of the mission, what we really look at for community college baccalaureate degrees is the ability to provide local, affordable and accessible four-year degrees to folks,” Shields said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Committee Chair Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, requested the study during last year’s legislative session and previously stated this would be one of his priorities for the 2026 session. He has also filed House Study Bill 533, which would allow community colleges to develop programs leading to a bachelor’s degree as long as they relate to job fields that “address a high-demand, sustained, and unmet workforce need within the community college region as shown by the community college” and aren’t offered entirely online.
A subcommittee meeting on HSB 533 is scheduled for Jan. 20.
Nearly half of all U.S. states already incorporate bachelor’s degrees into their community college offerings, Shields said during the meeting, with Illinois and Nebraska currently contemplating legislation to do the same. States like Florida and Washington have found success in students meeting degree requirements and in employment and wage gains.
Health care professions, business, technology and agriculture sciences are some of the most popular degree programs available nationally, she said, but in Iowa, community colleges would identify the biggest needs of the communities they serve and develop degree programs using that information.
Each of the community college leaders identified issues with access to education in their region, from being located in an “education desert” with no four-year institutions close by to dealing with a “brain drain” of students traveling elsewhere to learn.
Ulrich said currently if a student finishes their education at Iowa Central but wants to continue with their degree, their options are online-only schooling, which is not preferred for some, or leaving home, which some people cannot do and comes with extra costs and other issues.
He met one person whose child had wanted to attend Iowa Central but didn’t want to have to transfer to complete their nursing degree. Ulrich said everyone in Iowa should have the option of staying at their institution of choice to fulfill their education.
A recent regional job study from the Quad-Cities area found that there is a lack of baccalaureate degree options for working adults who want to further their career through education and training, Renfro said. Being able to offer bachelor’s degree programs at Eastern Iowa Community Colleges would open doors for both students and employers hoping to upskill workers, he said.
“Community colleges have the ability to take those two-year associate degrees that we know the information is critical and relevant to doing their job, but then building a bachelor’s degree on top of that,” Renfro said.
Kinney said during the meeting the topic of community college bachelor’s degrees came up many times in public meetings he held last year, with questions from people whose students would have chosen to stay close to home for their education if they had the chance.
In order to handle start-up costs associated with incorporating bachelor’s degrees into community college offerings, including expenses relating to faculty, facilities and more, Shields said the higher education system is requesting a grant fund totaling $20 million over five years. According to other states, it costs around $300,000 to start up a new program and there won’t be tuition yet at that point to cover expenses.
Collins said during the meeting the funding request is not included in the legislation on community college bachelor’s degrees, and Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, asked the community college leaders what their plan would be if this legislation passes, but money doesn’t follow.
Each was in agreement that, even if no state funding is available, program development will still occur, but not at the pace and capacity they could get to with startup money. Ulrich said if the legislation passes, he would still implement degree programs to combat brain drain, but the college would focus on programs with lower start-up costs like a bachelor of science in nursing program.
“I have to do … something to stop brain drain in my region, so we would start something,” Ulrich said. “It would probably have to start smaller. It’d have to probably be a more targeted area.”
Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, brought up a concern during the meeting that these programs wouldn’t be sustainable, pointing to declining traditional student-age populations, but community college leaders stated high school students heading straight to college aren’t the main target for these bachelor’s degree programs.
Community colleges’ bachelor’s degree offerings would be aimed not at 18-year-olds hoping to live in dorms and have the traditional college experience, Shields said, but at adult learners, those who are place-bound and those who financially cannot afford a university education.
Jacoby’s point about student numbers identifies “one of the most compelling arguments to do this,” Shields said, as just educating recent high school graduates will not be enough to meet workforce needs in the state.
“We absolutely have to get people back to education, upskilling, reskilling, and this is another part of that as well,” Shields said.

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)President Donald Trump’s threat this week to stop federal funding to both so-called “sanctuary” cities and the states where they’re located was greeted with disbelief by many states and cities since the administration has fared poorly on that issue in court. 
“We will go to court within seconds, and we will win if he does this. It’s already proven unlawful. We’ve already won multiple times,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta told ABC News7 in San Francisco on Wednesday. 
“Those are funds that belong to the people of Chicago, not the President,” Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement. There were similar reactions in Massachusetts and New York City.
Trump administration vows to ‘come after’ sanctuary states and cities, despite court setbacks

Trump, speaking Tuesday to the Detroit Economic Club, said he would cut off “any payments” starting Feb. 1 “to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.” 
Trump was responding to those communities with policies against helping U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest people suspected of living illegally in the United States. States and cities reacting thus far have said it would be illegal for the Trump administration to withhold all federal funding, noting that judges have made that clear in recent rulings. 
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids and refuse some requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation, depending on the crimes involved.
There’s no universal definition of a “sanctuary city,” but the U.S. Department of Justice published a list in August that includes 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. States either listed as sanctuary by themselves or as including one of the cities were: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. 
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal last July, when a federal judge dismissed a federal sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and surrounding Cook County.










We will go to court within seconds, and we will win if he does this.


– California Attorney General Rob Bonta, Democrat


The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” U.S. District Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote. That order is now under appeal.
A California judge also issued a preliminary injunction in August stopping the Trump administration from cutting unrelated funding over sanctuary policies. The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states. That case is also now on hold pending an appeal by the Trump administration. 
In that case, U.S. District Judge William Orrick ruled that the Trump orders to stop funding over immigration policy were “coercive” and “intended to commandeer local officials into enforcing federal immigration practices and law.”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)An administrative law judge has ruled that an Iowa school teacher committed job-related misconduct when he posted negative Facebook comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Matthew Kargol worked for the Oskaloosa Community School District as an art teacher and coach until he was fired in September 2025. Kargol then filed for unemployment benefits and the district resisted, which led to a recent hearing before Administrative Law Judge David Steen.
In his written factual findings of the case, Steen reported that on Sept. 10, 2025, Kargol had posted a comment to Facebook stating, “1 Nazi down.” That comment was posted within hours of authorities confirming Kirk had been shot and killed that day while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When another Facebook user commented, “What a s—-y thing to say,” Kargol allegedly replied, “Yep, he was part of the problem, a Nazi.”
Steen reported that Kargol posted his comments around 5 p.m. and then deleted them within an hour. By 6 p.m., the district began fielding a number of telephone calls and text messages from members of the public, Steen found.
According to Steen’s findings, the district’s leadership team met that evening and included Kargol via telephone conference call. District leaders asked Kargol to resign, and he declined, after which the district officials said they were concerned for his safety due to the public’s reaction to his comments.
The district placed Kargol on administrative leave that evening, Steen found. The next day, district officials fielded roughly 1,500 telephone calls and received 280 voicemail messages regarding Kargol’s posts.
“These calls required the employer to redirect staff and other resources from their normal duties,” Steen stated in his ruling. “The employer also requested additional law enforcement presence at school facilities due to the possibility of physical threats, which some of the messages alluded to. The employer continued to receive numerous communications from the public for days after the post was removed.”
On Sept. 16, 2025, Superintendent Mike Fisher submitted a written recommendation to the school board to fire Kargol, with the two primary reasons cited as a disruption to the learning environment and a violation of the district’s code of ethics. Upon Fisher’s recommendation, the board fired Kargol on Sept. 17, 2025.
According to Steen’s findings, the district calculated the cost of its response to the situation was $14,332.10 – and amount that includes the wages of the regular staff who handled the phone calls and other communications.
As for the ethics-policy violation, Steen noted that the policy states that employees “are representatives of the district at all times and must model appropriate character, both on and off the worksite. This applies to material posted with personal devices and on personal websites and/or social media accounts.”
The policy goes on to say that social media posts “which diminish the professionalism” of the district may result in disciplinary action, including termination, if it is found to be disruptive to the educational environment.
The district, Steen noted, also has a policy on “employee expression” that states “the First Amendment protects a public employee’s speech when the employee is speaking as an individual citizen on a matter of public concern,” but that “even so, employee expression that has an adverse impact on district operations and/or negatively impacts an employee’s ability to perform their job for the district may still result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.”
Based on the policies and Kargol’s conduct, Steen concluded the district fired Kargol for job-related misconduct that disqualified him from collecting unemployment benefits.
The issue before him, Steen observed, wasn’t whether the district made a correct decision in firing Kargol, but whether Kargol is entitled to unemployment insurance benefits under Iowa law.
In ruling against Kargol on that issue, Steen noted Kargol was aware of district policies regarding social media use as well as work rules that specifically state employees are considered representatives of the school district at all times.
Kargol’s posts, Steen ruled, “reflected negatively on the employer and were against the employer’s interests.” The posts also “caused substantial disruption to the learning environment, causing staff at all levels to need to redirect focus and resources on the public’s response for days after the incident,” Steen stated.
Kargol’s federal lawsuit against the school district, alleging retaliation for exercising his First Amendment right to expression, is still working its way through the courts.
In that lawsuit, Kargol argues that in comments made last fall, Fisher made clear that his condemnation of Kargol’s Facebook posts “was rooted in his personal beliefs, not in evidence of disruption. Speaking as ‘a man of faith,’ Fisher expressed disappointment in the state of society and disapproval of Mr. Kargol’s expression. By invoking his personal religious identity in condemning Mr. Kargol’s speech, Fisher confirmed that his reaction was based on his own values and ideology, not on legitimate pedagogical concerns.”
The district has denied any wrongdoing in that case. A trial date has yet to be scheduled.
Several other lawsuits have been filed against their former employers by Iowa educators, a public defender and a paramedic, all of whom allege they were fired or sanctioned for online comments posted in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s death.
Earlier this week, two Iowa teachers sued the state’s teacher-licensing board and its executive director, alleging they improperly solicited complaints related to anti-Kirk social media posts.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers took final steps this week to prepare for next week’s special session to authorize the spending of federal health care money.
Congress last year created the $50 billion for Rural Health Transformation Program as a way to offset losses rural states will incur due to Medicaid cuts.
North Dakota received $199 million for the first year of the five-year grant, but is also budgeting for the additional roughly $200 million it expects for the second year.
After the Legislature approves the money, the Department of Health and Human Services will allow groups to start applying for grants. The federal government will have to review and approve every grant.
“I can’t stress enough the short timeline for funding,” Donna Aukland, the agency’s chief financial officer, told lawmakers Tuesday.
North Dakota officials celebrate being among big winners in federal rural health funding

The Legislature’s Rural Health Transformation Committee this week revisited four bill drafts to consider during the session that the state pledged to adopt in its application for the federal dollars. The federal government incentivized the policies by promising more grant money to states that enact them.
One bill would expand the prescriptive authority of pharmacists and allow them to order lab tests. Proponents of the policy say it would make it easier for North Dakotans to get treated for common conditions, especially for those in rural areas.
Under the proposal, pharmacists’ prescriptive authority would include drugs for conditions including the flu, COVID-19 and strep throat, as well as lice, cold sores, motion sickness, hypoglycemia and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Pharmacists would also be able to prescribe the use of inhalers, nebulizers, diabetes blood sugar testing supplies and pen needles.
Additionally, pharmacists would be able to switch patients’ drugs to a substitute expected to have a similar therapeutic effect.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, on Tuesday said she’s concerned that this could be dangerous for sensitive groups.
“It is a fear for a lot of people, by having the language this broad it would allow for pharmacists to do therapeutic substitution for psychiatric meds for juveniles,” she said. She suggested that lawmakers should create an “exclusion list” that limit this prescriptive power in certain situations.
Roers, a nurse, also said the legislation should include more guardrails for the treatment of common diseases.
She recommended an amendment that would require pharmacists to conduct a lab test before they can prescribe medication for some conditions, including urinary tract infections.
“Without a lab test, I struggle to know how that’s uncomplicated,” Roers said. 
The committee held off on approving the amendment but indicated lawmakers will discuss it again during the special session, which begins Jan. 21.
The committee also discussed draft legislation to have the state be part of a licensure compact for physician assistants.
Lawmaker working on free school meals bill ahead of North Dakota special session

Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, called physician assistants an “extremely important part” of rural health care in the state, and said the amendment could help address workforce shortages.
Lawmakers during the session will also likely consider adopting a one-hour continuing education requirement for doctors related to healthy eating.
“We’re talking about one hour, we’re not talking about one semester,” Lee said.
Another bill draft would require North Dakota K-12 students to participate in the presidential physical fitness test.
Traynor said Tuesday that he hadn’t reviewed the bill draft with Department of Public Instruction Superintendent Levi Bachmeier but that he’s confident the agency would support it.
“From a general perspective, he is very excited about physical activity and diet in the schools,” Traynor said. 
States are guaranteed at least $500 million over five years from the Rural Health Transformation Program, but could receive up to $1 billion depending on the strength of their applications and other factors.
The $199 million awarded to North Dakota in late December is almost double the minimum funding available to states this year.
The state plans to budget $33.4 million of its award on technology, $116 million to expand health care access in rural areas, $32.2 million to address workforce issues and $17.1 million to promote healthy lifestyles.
North Dakota has until the end of September 2026 to obligate the funding, and until September 2027 to spend it.
The funding amounts to roughly $561 per North Dakota resident, according to an analysis by policy research organization KFF. Only six states received larger per-capita awards. The average grant amount was about $200 million per state.
It’s still unclear if lawmakers will allow bills on other topics to be introduced during the special session. Rep. Mike Nathe has said he’s drafting a bill related to providing school meals to all K-12 students for possible discussion. Legislative Council has drafted about 20 bills, but not all lawmakers plan to proceed with those proposals, Director John Bjornson said. The bill drafts have not been made public.
The Legislative Management committee will meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday to decide which, if any, additional bills will get introduced. Lawmakers have said they want to keep the session narrowly focused.

“I was doing my job even though it was unpopular,” said Michael Drescher, the former top federal prosecutor in the state for the last year.

MONTPELIER — Michael Drescher prosecuted cases on behalf of the federal government in Vermont during the first year of President Donald Trump’s administration —  which dealt him historic immigration cases like those of Rümeysa Öztürk and Mohsen Mahdawi. 
Now, Drescher is a nominee to serve on the Vermont Supreme Court, leading senators this week to interrogate his past. 
Gov. Phil Scott appointed Drescher to serve on the state’s top court last week, along with former top Vermont federal prosecutor Christina Nolan. Both candidates led Vermont’s U.S. Attorney’s Office under Trump, with Nolan serving in the role during his first presidential term. To serve as a state Supreme Court justice, both nominees need state Senate confirmation.

Drescher prosecuted the cases against Öztürk and Mahdawi, representing the federal government. Öztürk was a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University who was arrested in Massachusetts by plainclothes officers in March after co-writing a student newspaper op-ed critical of Israel’s war in Gaza. She was then whisked to Vermont, where she was held in an immigration office in St. Albans. 
Mahdawi was a Palestinian student activist at Columbia University who vocally opposed Israel’s war in Gaza. He was arrested in Colchester in April during a routine immigration meeting. 
Drescher resigned from his role as Vermont’s top federal prosecutor — under the title “First Assistant Attorney” — last week.
“I did that because, in order to be able to speak freely at this hearing, I think I needed to be unencumbered by being employed by the Department of Justice,” Drescher said Tuesday. 
Lawmakers in the Senate Judiciary Committee heard from Drescher again on Wednesday, grilling him about his moral compass and views on free speech. Four senators in the committee said they’ve received hundreds of emails about his appointment. 
“I still hold concerns about decisions that you made in your role,” Sen. Nader Hashim, D-Windham, the committee’s chair, said. Other senators expressed the same concern. 
What was Drescher’s defense? “I was doing my job even though it was unpopular,” he said. 
Drescher reminded senators Tuesday that Trump never formally appointed him to the role. He served as assistant U.S. attorney starting in 2002 and was promoted to the second highest position in the office in September 2023. He became the top federal prosecutor in the state last year, when the then-U.S. attorney for Vermont, who had been appointed by former President Joe Biden, resigned upon Trump’s inauguration. 
Though Drescher held the office for about a year in an acting capacity, Trump never appointed him to a permanent U.S. attorney or sought his confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Drescher also did not seek out that appointment, he said. 
Drescher said Tuesday that he found out in March his office would be prosecuting Öztürk’s case “out of the blue.” He saw the video of masked agents pulling the student into an unmarked car and described it as “irregular at least.” Drescher said he represented the federal government in the case because he didn’t want anyone else in his office to have to bear the burden. 
“I could not in good conscience subject anybody in the office to be in that position. So I concluded that if anybody was going to be fired, it was going to be me,” Drescher said Tuesday, his voice cracking with emotion. 
Drescher said he didn’t resign from his role because he thought his resignation would only prolong Öztürk’s and Mahdawi’s cases. And he would’ve violated his oath of office to not performa his due diligence in prosecuting the two immigration cases. 
Drescher’s decision-making in those two cases influenced why Scott chose him.
“The Governor was aware of Michael’s role in both of those prosecutions and believes he showed great leadership by assigning those cases to himself, rather than asking his team to take the cases,” Amanda Wheeler, the governor’s press secretary, said in an email to VTDigger. “As Michael recognized, these assignments would either put the jobs of his career staff in jeopardy or subject them to threats and abuse from members of the public.”
But for some lawmakers, Drescher’s former position is a hard pill to swallow.
“It doesn’t sit well with me,” said Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, in an interview. 
The civil cases filed on behalf of Öztürk and Mahdawi respectively disputed the legality of their detention. In Öztürk’s case, Drescher repeatedly argued against her release from detention. 
To Vyhovsky, that shows that Drescher wasn’t just filling shoes, rather he was in practice enforcing federal immigration actions. 
Hashim, in an interview, shared the same concerns as Vyhovsky. The way Drescher handled Öztürk’s case gave him concerns about Drescher’s legal discretion, he said. 
The national political climate only increases the need for the committee to do its due diligence when considering the appointments, Vyhovsky said. And she wants to make sure that state Supreme Court justices are committed to protecting people’s rights, she said. 
Other senators expressed similar concerns in the Wednesday committee meeting. 
“I’ve never seen a crisis point in America like we’re facing,” said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central. While Trump’s immigration agenda sweeps the country, Congress has “neutered itself” and left too much up to the judiciary, Baruth said. 
Drescher told senators he understood those concerns. But he asserted that the legal cases wouldn’t have been able to move forward without competent legal counsel on each side. 
He argued that in his former role, he was a counterbalance necessary to have a functioning legal system. And he held the executive branch to a high standard, he said. 
Drescher said that while he understands why he’s being associated with Trump’s policies and attitudes, lawyers are not usually judged based on the character of those they represent. 
Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, asked Drescher if he would have done anything differently. 
“I don’t think so. I don’t think so,” Drescher replied.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong will kick off the special session of the Legislature next Wednesday with a State of the State address.
Armstrong will speak to lawmakers as they convene in Bismarck to allocate federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding, Armstrong’s office announced Wednesday.
The address will begin at 10 a.m. CT and will be livestreamed on the governor’s office website and on the legislative website.
Armstrong is expected to address his executive order that convened the special session and the federal rural health funding, awarded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as part of the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act that was signed into law in July.
North Dakota will receive at least $500 million in rural health funding over the next five years, but could receive up to $1 billion. The $199 million award for the first year of the program is about average compared to other states but is one of the largest per-capita awards in the country.

Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) encourages members of the House of Representatives to support his bill to bar K-12 students from using their phone during instruction time. Jan. 14, 2026 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceIn a push to start the year off with a potential bipartisan win, the Republican-led Michigan House has revived a piece of legislation aimed at banning cell phones in schools after a failed vote on the bill last July.
On Wednesday, the House voted 99-10 to send state Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) House Bill 4141 to the Senate for further consideration alongside Sen. Dayna Polehanki’s (D-Livonia) Senate Bill 495.
“There were a couple of bumps along the road, but you know, that’s Lansing,” Tisdel told reporters following the vote on Wednesday, saying he’d take a 99-10 vote on a piece of legislation he’d put together any day of the week.
While Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called out a cell phone ban as a priority during her 2025 State of the State Address, Tisdel’s bill did not initially receive the majority vote needed to pass through the chamber. State Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) put forth a similar bill with Whitmer’s blessing last year, but the policy has not advanced through the Republican-led chamber, remaining in the House Committee on Education and Workforce.
Now, Tisdel and Polehanki are moving forward on a bipartisan package with pieces in both chambers, tie-barring Tisdel’s bill to a piece of legislation from Polehanki that establishes protocol for when and how students are allowed to use cell phones in emergency situations. Both pieces of legislation will need to pass for either to take effect.
Ahead of Wednesday’s session, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) criticized House Democrats for broadly voting against Tisdel’s policy in July, but said they were ready to start the year off on a new foot by putting the bill to another vote.
“We want our kids focused on the classroom, focused on their teachers,” Hall said. “We want them learning. We don’t want them distracted playing games on their phones, you know, messaging each other. They need to put the phones away and be focused. And unfortunately, most of these school districts don’t have the courage to deal with this locally. So we’re going to pass a law that requires them to do it.”

Hall said he looked forward to working with Whitmer to improve student literacy in the state, with Michigan ranking 44th in the nation for 4th grade reading scores. Passing a cell phone ban is part of that effort, Hall said.
“I think it’d be a great thing if before the governor’s State of the State, we can get this to her desk and she can sign it and we can put this into effect,” Hall said.
Tisdel’s bill requires schools to implement a policy banning public school students from using their smartphones during instruction time by the start of the 2026-2027 school year. Older-style basic phones would be exempt from the ban. 
That exemption stemmed from concerns on the Republican side of the aisle where students in rural areas without a bus service have extended walks or bike rides to school, Tisdel said.
“It was important that there be that kind of contact or availability,” Tisdel said. “And the beauty of a basic phone is you make a phone call or you send a text and then you put it away because there’s nothing else you can do with it.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
There are also exemptions for emergencies, medical reasons and school-related purposes. If signed into law the bill would require administrators to implement the policy in the upcoming school year, with the policy acting as a floor, allowing schools to set stricter policies if they desire.
While previous versions of Tisdel’s bill set different standards based on grade level during the school day with high school students, the version passed on Wednesday applies the same standard to all grade levels. 
While many school districts across the state already have some form of cell phone policy, implementation and enforcement is key, Tisdel said. 
“If you start to enforce and get any parental pushback, it can be very easy to just say, ‘this is not a fight we want to pick today,’ and that’s why it’s necessary for a statewide standard,” Tisdel said.
While there are no penalties for districts who do not put these policies into place, ultimately the state holds the power of the purse, Tisdel said. However, he also pointed to a survey from the National Education Association in which 90% of the members polled were in favor of a cell phone ban.

In an interview with Michigan Advance, Polehanki said she had complete faith that Michigan’s school districts would take the legislation seriously. 
Polehanki said she and Tisdel have been in agreement on how to move forward with legislation for some time; they were simply waiting for the House to move forward on Tisdel’s bill. 
While Tisdel’s bill moves to the Senate for further consideration, the upper chamber also has to consider Polehanki’s Senate Bill 495.
That bill is under consideration by the Senate Education Committee, which Polehanki chairs. It has not been taken up for a vote.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Though medical practitioners and advocates spoke against the bill, a House subcommittee moved forward Wednesday with a measure limiting minors’ ability to access vaccines related to sexually transmitted diseases without their parents’ approval.
Senate File 304 would remove the ability of minors to consent to vaccinations related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or infections without their parent’s or guardian’s permission. It is specifically proposing a change to an existing state law that grants minors the legal ability to consent, without input from their parent, to receive medical care related to sexually transmitted diseases.
The proposed change would require parental approval for Iowans under age 18 to receive the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, as well as for the Hepatitis B vaccine. Minors could still consent to other medical care, like diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and infections, without parental consent.

Other vaccinations require parental consent. But the carveout for HPV and Hepatitis B vaccines was created in Iowa law to allow minors — particularly teenagers and adolescents — to access preventative care that their family may oppose for reasons including fear that approving the vaccine may signal approval of sexual activity, and concern that sexual abuse could be exposed if a minor talks to their doctor about the sexually transmitted disease.
Chaney Yeast, speaking on behalf of Blank Children’s Hospital, said parental consent and involvement in health care is always encouraged — but the current language in Iowa law was crafted to support minors in Iowa who may not be in safe home environments.
“We know that intra-familial sexual abuse is the highest type of sexual abuse amongst children, so it typically is someone they know, they love, they trust within the family,” Yeast said. “And so potentially, you have a parent that would keep them from accessing that lifesaving care of the HPV vaccine, because they’re worried about information about the abuse coming to light. So we want to make sure we’re giving kids all the tools they can access to be able to make sure (they’re) safe and healthy.”
But Bree Johnson with Informed Choice Iowa said the language in Iowa’s current law does not serve a majority of Iowa families in which parents are trying to make the best decisions for their children.
“In the end, it is the parents’ role to help determine what is right for their own child, and they are the ones who have their child’s best interests at heart,” Johnson said. “We won’t dispute that isn’t always the case, but the current law doesn’t serve the majority of parents. It is catering to a minority of instances where parents and children are or have the potential to be at odds over this issue.”
Dr. Amy Shriver, a pediatric doctor currently serving as president of the Iowa Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said getting parental consent and involvement is “already the standard of care in pediatrics,” and that doctors are not administering vaccines to young children without their guardians’ knowledge. However, she said more autonomy and discretion is given to adolescents at ages 16 and 17 on several medical decisions.
“Iowa already recognizes adolescents’ ability to receive confidential care for certain health concerns, including mental health, sexual health and substance use, because it improves safety and health outcomes,” Shriver said. “… Iowa pediatricians want to partner with families and legislators to protect kids’ health and reduce cancer in our state. Senate File 304 moves us away from established best practices in adolescent care and cancer prevention.”
Amy Campbell, representing the Iowa Nurses Association, said the measure would create an “unnecessary barrier to one of the most effective cancer prevention tools.” HPV can cause several types of genital cancer, including cervical cancer, penile cancer, anal cancer and vaginal cancer. Campbell said studies have shown the use of the HPV vaccine dramatically reduces instances of cervical cancer, especially for people vaccinated before age 17, in comparison to unvaccinated populations.
“I think it’s really important to also note that the earlier you get it, the better,” Campbell said. “You only have to have two doses of the vaccine if you do it at a younger age, versus when you get older, you have to have an additional third vaccine. It also is only really effective if it happens before sexual activity begins.”
Jackie Cale with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said the organization was encouraged by Gov. Kim Reynolds and state lawmakers stating they want to address Iowa’s place as a state with the second-highest cancer rate and one of the fastest growing cancer rates in the country. However, she said, this bill would be “a step backwards in the fight against cancer in Iowa.”
“Even the governor yesterday mentioned cancer prevention and early detection of the state, which is fantastic to see, but this bill would directly conflict with that message,” Cale said. “So instead of looking at ways to prevent minors from having access to safe and effective forms of cancer prevention, we would encourage focusing on promoting education and awareness of the vaccine.”
The bill passed the Iowa Senate in April 2025 in a 33-14 vote, but was not taken up by the House before session ended. But as 2026 is the second year of the 91st Iowa General Assembly, legislation from the 2025 session can be brought up and considered as a continuation of the previous year’s actions.
Republican Reps. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and Austin Harris, R-Moulton, supported the bill moving forward while Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, opposed the bill. It moves next to the full House Health and Human Services Committee.
Harris said he did not doubt the science showing the HPV vaccine’s effectiveness in cancer prevention efforts.
“To me, it’s never been about questioning the efficacy of the vaccine,” Harris said. “It’s about whether parents have ultimate control over their children’s health.”

Fourteen groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth, Planned Parenthood Great Plains, El Centro and the Sierra Club, joined forces to promote the rally. The crowd swelled to elbow-room only around the center of the floor, with dozens more demonstrating from the railings above.
Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, which helped organize the rally, told the crowd, “We are living in troubling times.”
“America is showing its dark underbelly,” Rieber said. “The original sins of the United States — anti-Black racism, brutal oligarchic capitalism and slaveholder Christianity — are all in power right now. The wealthy and powerful are completely protected from their criminal activity and the consequences of their actions.”
Rieber and other speakers addressed food insecurity, voting rights, climate change, health care, reproductive right, public education, and immigration enforcement — themes that also appeared on handwritten signs throughout the crowd.

Several signs referenced U.S. Immigration an Customs agent Jonathan Ross killing Renee Nicole Good in her car last week in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
“You may have been surprised that they shot a ‘normie’ white woman in the face, but when Christian nationalism sees white people standing with the ‘other,’ they see that as treason worthy of death, and that is what we are facing today,” Rieber said.
Before the speeches began, the crowd sang lines from Woody Guthrie’s “All you Fascists Bound to Lose.” Mandy Todd, a Lindsborg pastor and director of engagement and development for Kansas Interfaith Action, led a rendition of the civil rights anthem “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ‘Round.”

At various times during the two-hour rally, the crowd sustained chants of “f*** ICE” and “human needs are human rights.”
Several people held signs that read: “Necesidades humans son dereschos humanos,” which is Spanish for “human needs are human rights.”
Demonstrators also carried signs that read:
“What was the $ bonus ICE got for murdering Renee??”
“Renee Nicole Good is not collateral damage.”
“Justice for Renee.”
And “Unmask and disarm ICE killers.”
One person sat on a box that read: “Salt melts ICE.”

Chris Wilson, pastor at Saint Andrew Christian Church in Olathe, held a sign reading, “The power of the people is stronger than the people in power.” He said lawmakers were too busy targeting transgender people, public education and things that “make our state better.”
“They’re spending way too much energy targeting the few versus supporting and funding things for the larger majority of people in the state,” Wilson said.
He attended the protest with Carol Nistler, of Miami County, who said she wanted to make her voice heard about “everything” and “to remind our legislators of their real job, which is to serve the people of Kansas.”
Her sign read: “Legislators: Who do you serve?”

Lawmakers have a new plan to overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness, an issue that has remained stubbornly persistent in recent years even as state leaders have thrown hundreds of millions of dollars at easing the problem.
A bipartisan bill introduced last week is legislators’ latest attempt at reform. The bill would dramatically wind down Vermont’s use of motel rooms as emergency shelter over the next two years, while ramping up funding for shelters, transitional housing and related services.

It would also create a new, voluntary program dedicated to paying for travel for unhoused people in Vermont “who wish to return to their home states.” 
Rep. Eric Maguire, R-Rutland City, the bill’s lead sponsor, said his goal is to wrestle the costly motel voucher program back down to its pre-pandemic size, before an influx of federal COVID funds and worsening homelessness ballooned the program’s scale. Funding that once went to the motel program would instead get directed into creating an improved continuum of shelter and housing options, he said, including converting motels into apartments.
“Let’s get it back to where it’s temporary, and get (those) investments made into permanent settings that give people that outlet – that place to go to come out of homelessness, not remain stagnant in the circumstances that they are in,” Maguire said. 
The bill places time limits on how long individuals can remain in shelter and transitional housing (60 or 180 days, depending on the program) and sets expectations for engagement with services, something Maguire sees as critical for holding clients “accountable.” 
Outside of the Statehouse, Maguire works as the shelter director for BROC Community Action in Rutland, an overlap that he does not view as a conflict with his legislative service.
He envisions the bill as a two-year bridge to a homelessness system that’s primarily run by community-based agencies rather than the state, which had been the goal of legislation that failed last session.
The bill’s co-sponsor, Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, said she wanted to show support for the reform effort even though she doesn’t agree with all of the details. For instance, she thinks a provision to halt the use of motel rooms in fiscal year 2028 – something that would only happen with an administrative check that enough shelter and housing exists to meet demand – isn’t practical. 
“I don’t think we can totally eliminate the use of hotels,” Wood said. “It’s not realistic.”
Still, Wood, who chairs the human services committee in the House, sees the bill as a good starting point. And her cross-aisle collaboration with Maguire has garnered praise from the administration of Republican Gov. Phil Scott, a notable achievement after Scott vetoed the reform effort Wood drove last year.
“We’re really grateful for the partnership between Reps. Wood and Maguire,” said Sandi Hoffman, interim commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. “There’s a lot of things in [the bill] that we like,” and others that need more discussion, Hoffman added, though refrained from sharing details.
The future of the motel voucher program has proven to be a political lightning rod in recent years. Scott has long pushed for its expansion to end, arguing that the program is too expensive – and ineffective – to continue on the state’s dime. Democratic leaders in the Legislature have resisted that aim, though haltingly agreed to winnow down the program’s scale over the last few years, setting restrictions that have resulted in relentless waves of evictions. 
The Agency of Human Services quietly convened a working group in December to consider the future of the motel program and the state’s homelessness response system more broadly, according to meeting documents obtained by VTDigger/Vermont Public. 
Those discussions focused in part on limiting the use of motel rooms, creating new shelters for people with complex medical needs and verifying Vermont residency before ensuring benefits, according to meeting presentations, agendas and minutes reviewed by the newsrooms.
Advocates for unhoused Vermonters have begun to register their concerns with policymakers’ direction. Brenda Siegel, director of End Homelessness Vermont, said she’s particularly concerned about a renewed focus on people from out of state using Vermont benefit programs.
But a 2024 investigation by Vermont Public/VTDigger dispelled a common narrative that Vermont’s spike in homelessness was driven by unhoused people moving to Vermont from other states. 
The bill’s dedicated program to pay for relocation of people with family connections outside of Vermont is unnecessary and stigmatizing, Siegel said.
“What it says is: We don’t want poor people here. And that is a really big problem,” she said.

The majority of Vermont farmers claim 2025 was the worst drought they’d ever seen. Now, agricultural advocates are asking the state to fiscally support farmers facing climate extremes. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Drought cost Vermont farmers $15.9M .","The preliminary results of a 2025 state survey show that last year’s drought cost Vermont farms more than $15.9 million.
Most farmers said it was the worst drought they’d ever seen, according to the survey, which was conducted by the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Vermont Agriculture Recovery Task Force. The final survey is expected to be published by the end of January, according to the agency. Numbers are not expected to significantly change. (As of publication, the current public dashboard does not contain the most updated information from the survey.)
Respondents came from 200 farms across Vermont’s 14 counties, the majority from Addison, Orleans and Rutland counties. The results show 79,000 acres were impacted by the drought, a total swath roughly one and a half times the size of Grand Isle County.

Farmers faced lower crop yields and insufficient pasture for livestock, according to survey responses. They had to pay to bring in additional feed and water. Some had to sell animals such as goats and sheep early because their food stores were scarce. When asked what resources they needed, most farmers responded that they needed financial assistance. Now, agricultural advocates are again asking the legislature for that help.
“Farmers cannot continue to bear the cost of these disasters without support from the state,” Maddie Kempner, policy and organizing director at the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, or NOFA-VT, told lawmakers in the Senate Agriculture Committee last week.
Vermont’s latest drought forces a broader reckoning with how the state prepares for – and pays for – climate-driven agricultural disasters. As lawmakers again debate whether to create a standing disaster fund for farms, the losses documented in the survey sharpen a central question for the Legislature and the public alike: can Vermont continue responding to extreme weather events ad hoc after the damage is done, or should it establish a system that protects farms before disaster hits. 
Kempner asked lawmakers to back S.60, a bill proposed last session to establish a Farm Security Fund, a permanent well of money to provide financial assistance to farmers facing losses from weather conditions such as high winds, flooding, extreme heat, abnormal freezes, fire and drought. 
The bill, first introduced by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, was passed by the Senate last year and ended up in the House Committee on Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry, where it was expanded to include other working lands like forests. It lagged in the Appropriations Committee as the session ended. 
Removal of climate
Since then, House Appropriations added amendments to the bill that were presented to the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday morning, including the removal of references to climate. The phrase “climate-based” was struck and replaced with the phrase “weather-based,” for example. 
“The committee asked for any reference to climate or climate change to be removed because they didn’t want to create controversy or discussion or debate on climate,” Michael O’Grady, deputy chief counsel for Vermont’s Office of Legislative Counsel, told lawmakers.
Climate change, largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels, leads to more extreme weather events like heat waves, drought, flooding and wildfires.
“Our food system is really resilient and really robust in this state, but with the amount and frequency of weather and economic challenges that farmers are facing, they’re really taking the brunt of climate change,” Eli Hersh, a farmer who runs Honey Field Farm in Norwich, said over the phone.
Lindsey Brand, marketing and communications director at NOFA-VT, said on Friday, before the amendments were added, that her organization is hoping the House will pass the bill soon, moving it closer to a law this legislative session. NOFA-VT wants a $20 million fund, which Brand said would be the minimum useful number based on average losses documented on farms over the last three years.
“The losses from the drought are really devastating,” Brand said, emphasizing the impact not only on farmers but on downstream communities. “Farmers impact their local economy so much that when they experience big losses like that because of factors outside of their control, it’s really serious.”
About a quarter of survey respondents had crop or livestock insurance, but the majority did not have access to such aid. Many farms in Vermont, which are often small and have diversified sources of income, are not covered by rainy day funds like federal crop insurance programs, according to the proposed legislation.
Hersh said that in fields without irrigation access, he struggled to get a good harvest. 
“In most other seasons, we had never gotten dry enough for some of those fields to really start showing the lack of water,” Hersh said. Drought conditions made fall cover cropping challenging, which could impact soil quality moving forward, he said.
“There really is a need for the state to support the farming community with that safety net to ensure that you don’t just lose a couple dozen farms every time there’s a bad weather year,” Hersh said. “It starts adding up in terms of who’s left to grow the food for us.” 
Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, told advocates that farmers’ voices needed to be heard in the Appropriations Committee, where such disaster relief funds could be doled out by the state.
“You’ve already sold us,” Ingalls said.
Drought versus floods
The losses from the drought are similar to prior floods, according to Abbey Willard, agriculture development division director at the agency that managed the survey. The 2023 flood resulted in about $16 million in agricultural losses; the 2024 flood claimed farming losses totalling more than $15 million, she said.
These impacts build over time, according to the survey. Three-quarters of respondents were impacted by previous major weather events like floods, freezes, or wind storms, and the majority of those respondents were impacted by two or more events. 
But the impacts from the drought felt more obscured across the state than more visceral events like floods, she added.
“What’s hard and different about this drought versus the floods of 2023 or 2024 is that unless you’re growing crops or raising animals outdoors, or your industry is dependent on the climate, you may not be aware that we’re experiencing a drought in Vermont,” Willard said. “We have snow on the ground, we’re getting rain events and yet we still have agricultural businesses that don’t have enough feed for their animals.” 
Willard said a statewide disaster assistance program like the Farm Security Fund seemed reasonable, if only because it took so long for federal dollars to trickle down. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture allocated millions of dollars in block grant funding to support Vermont’s agricultural and forestry businesses impacted by the 2023 and 2024 floods, but it’s been more than a year since those funds were appropriated by Congress and they’ve yet to reach the state, Willard said.
The drought has continued into January for the eastern half of Vermont; most of Caledonia and Essex counties are still in a severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor housed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For the rest of the state, even if drought-like conditions are over, it will take time for the land to recover. 
In September, Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts asked the federal government to declare a secretarial statewide disaster designation for the impacts of the ongoing drought in the state. 
By mid-January, the state had not heard back.

Free.,Trump signs law to allow whole milk in school lunches,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-law-allow-whole-milk-school-lunches,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a law Wednesday that will restore whole milk in federally subsidized school lunches.The dairy staple — out of school meal programs for more than a decade amid a broader push to curb childhood obesity — will soon return to school cafeterias under the law. Trump said during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office that the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act will “ensure that millions of school-aged children have access to high-quality milk as we make America healthy again.” Seated with a jug of milk on the Resolute Desk, Trump said the changes will also be “major victories for the American dairy farmers who we love and who voted for me in great numbers.” White House ceremonyAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins celebrated the legislation becoming law and said her department would post Wednesday the “new rulemaking that is necessary to get whole milk back into school lunches.” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also lauded Trump’s efforts and described the measure as a “long overdue correction of the school nutrition policy that puts children’s health first.” Trump was also joined by Dr. Ben Carson, national advisor for nutrition, health, and housing at USDA, along with Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont, GOP Sens. John Boozman of Arkansas, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Roger Marshall of Kansas, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and advocates who supported the bill.Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, and Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, also attended the ceremony. The U.S. House passed the bill in December, following unanimous passage in the Senate in November. Welch and Marshall, along with Pennsylvania Sens. Dave McCormick, a Republican, and John Fetterman, a Democrat, introduced the measure in the Senate. Thompson and Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier of Washington state brought corresponding legislation in the House.What the new law does Under the law, schools that are part of the USDA’s National School Lunch Program can offer “flavored and unflavored organic or nonorganic whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free fluid milk and lactose-free fluid milk.” The program — which provides free or low-cost lunches in public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions — saw nearly 29.4 million children participate on a typical day during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Food Research & Action Center.The schools can also provide “nondairy beverages that are nutritionally equivalent to fluid milk and meet the nutritional standards established by” the Agriculture secretary.The law exempts milk fat from being considered saturated fat as it applies to schools’ “allowable average saturated fat content of a meal.” Parents and guardians, as well as physicians, can also offer a written statement for their student to receive a nondairy milk substitute. Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association, celebrated the bill becoming law in a Wednesday statement.Dykes dubbed the law a “win for our children, parents, and school nutrition leaders, giving schools the flexibility to offer the flavored and unflavored milk options, across all healthy fat levels, that meet students’ needs and preference.” The signing marked the second major nutrition policy change this month. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourages more full-fat dairy and protein.",,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(Photo: ncleg.gov screenshot)A state House committee on involuntary commitment of people with mental illnesses began after Iryna Zarutska was killed last year by a man with a long criminal history and a schizophrenia diagnosis. 
Now, another death has brought new immediacy to the committee’s work. 
At the request of Wake Co. Republican Reps. Erin Paré and Mike Schietzelt, the committee will examine the circumstances leading to the death of Ravenscroft School teacher Zoe Welsh. Ryan Camacho, who has a long criminal history and a diagnosis of schizophrenia, allegedly attacked Welsh in her Raleigh home Jan. 3 . 
Weeks before Welsh’s death, a Wake County District Court judge denied a prosecutor’s request to have Camacho involuntarily committed, even after the judge determined Camacho was incapable of proceeding to trial on a misdemeanor breaking and entering charge. 
“What additional tools would assist law enforcement and the courts in preventing horrific crimes like this from occurring in the future?” the lawmakers asked in their Jan. 6 letter, which Paré posted to X.
Rep. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke), a committee co-chairman, said the panel will look at the circumstances surrounding Welsh’s death and determine whether their discoveries will be included in its legislative recommendations. 
Last year, the legislature passed Iryna’s Law, which, among other changes, creates new pretrial release procedures and requires judicial officers to initiate involuntary commitment proceedings in certain circumstances. 
The House Select Committee on Involuntary Commitment and Public Safety is examining the practice of forced psychiatric treatment with the goal of recommending improvements. 
Experts say that people with mental illnesses are far more likely to be crime victims than they are to commit violent crimes, but people with severe mental illness charged in several deaths in North Carolina in the last year have politicians focused on the link between mental health and public safety. 
“Despite recent occurrences, these are rare occurrences,” Dr. Marvin Swartz, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, told the committee Wednesday. 
“Crafting a policy objective that recognizes that this happens rarely, that it’s almost a needle in a haystack to find the person that’s actually going to commit serious acts of violence, is really tough,” he said.
The committee on Wednesday focused on involuntary outpatient commitment, where civil court orders require people to receive treatment. 
It’s been effective in New York, Swartz said. However, it’s unclear how often involuntary outpatient commitment has been used in North Carolina after 2001, when government mental health offices stopped providing treatment and moved to have mental health services offered by private providers instead, he said. The state doesn’t collect that data.
Patients in outpatient commitment can’t be forced to take medications, Swartz said. But most do because it’s a court order. 
“Most patients think that they are required to take their medication, and then they do,” he said. 
Dr. Carrie Brown, chief psychiatrist at the state Department of Health and Human Services,  said involuntary outpatient treatment is suitable for a limited number of adults – those who don’t have insight into their illness, decline voluntary treatment, have repeatedly been hospitalized or arrested, or have repeatedly committed violent acts.
Dr. Carrie Brown, chief psychiatrist at NC DHHS, talks to a House committee about outpatient involuntary commitment on Jan. 14, 2026 (screenshot)
Involuntary outpatient commitment is a key to addressing the “revolving door” of repeated arrests, hospitalizations and ER visits, she said. 
However, Brown added, outpatient commitment as it operates now has a number of weaknesses, she said. Those include court orders that aren’t specific and a shortage of specialized providers. 
Initiatives aimed at helping recently incarcerated people who have mental illnesses, called FACT, or Forensic Assertive Community Teams, are launching in five locations around the state will help, she said.  
A team providing centralized statewide oversight is needed in addition to the intensive case management, Brown said. 
And judges need to know that outpatient commitment is an option. 
“If they’re faced with someone who doesn’t meet involuntary impatient criteria, but requires treatment to be safe in the community, then outpatient commitment may be appropriate,” she said. 
Some House members are focused on ways to make more beds in state psychiatric hospitals available. At least 300 beds in state hospitals remain unused because the state does not have enough staff to handle additional patients. 
“We know that everybody cannot live outside an institution,” said Rep. Donna White (R-Johnston). “They can be outside of an institution, but they cause havoc for everybody else,” she said. 
It’s the state’s responsibility to treat those patients in state hospitals, White said. She asked for ideas for adding qualified staff to state hospitals. 
Blackwell said the committee may be in a position to have some recommendations for the legislature to consider in the upcoming short session, but said lawmakers will need additional time to focus on long-term solutions.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-13-at-11.32.44-AM-e1763068717337-1024x499.png,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed an additional $10,000 Wednesday from one of Arkansas’ disaster recovery funds toward the response to the deadly storms that swept through northeast Arkansas last year.
The funding Sanders released through an executive order is on top of $380,000 already authorized by the governor since tornadoes killed three people during the severe weather on March 14 and 15.
Fifteen tornadoes touched down during the storms, including what the National Weather Service described as an “exceptionally rare” long-tracked EF-3 twister. That particular tornado ravaged Cave City and was the cause of the three deaths in the state from the storms, all in Independence County.
Over 150 homes were destroyed in the March storms, with 93 more sustaining major damage, according to a preliminary damage assessment prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Just over $377,000 of the $380,000 authorized from the governor’s disaster response and recovery fund for the March storms has been spent, according to Arkansas Division of Emergency Management spokesperson Ashley Luningham.
The state’s emergency management director, A.J. Gary, will have the discretion to spend the funds on “defraying program and administrative costs,” according to the order.
The March 15 storm was one of several that tore through northeast Arkansas and the rest of the state last spring. Less than a month later, the state was inundated with rainfall that caused“generational” flooding, according to the weather service.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)FRANKFORT — Kentuckians who have finished treatment for organ cancers and melanoma, among others, no longer need to wait more than a year to donate blood at the Kentucky Blood Center, the organization announced Wednesday. 
According to the American Cancer Society, people who have had Kaposi sarcoma or a blood cancer like leukemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma will never be able to donate blood. 
People who have had “most other” cancers can usually donate if treatment has been complete for 12 months and during that 12 months, there were no signs of recurrence, according to the American Cancer Society. 
Dr. Dennis Williams, the medical director at Kentucky Blood Center, said in a press release from the organization that there is “no evidence that cancers are transmitted by blood transfusion.” 
“While there are certain cancers and treatments that will still impact donation, we are excited to offer a wider opportunity for those who wish to give blood to do so,” Williams said.
It’s difficult to determine how many newly eligible donors this could apply to, according to center spokesman Eric Lindsey. 
Several hundred people who were in the system on deferral because of their cancer status have been notified that they are now eligible, he said. Many more could be now eligible and were never in the system.

He also sees other content that he recognizes as fake, making him feel the need for a “clear borderline” between what’s real and what’s AI. 
“I feel like AI is improving and becoming realistic every day, day by day,” Moon told state lawmakers Wednesday. “Because people are facing AI more often, people have to clearly know this is AI.” 
Reining in artificial intelligence is a key goal for Washington state lawmakers this year. But ideas about how to do so are drawing pushback from the tech industry and could set the state up for a clash with the federal government.
State lawmakers are considering bills requiring AI detection tools and disclosures to address deepfakes and to establish new safeguards for children using the technology.  
They’re hoping the legislation will add guardrails for AI chatbots like ChatGPT, protect users from discrimination in algorithms, address the use of AI in school discipline decisions, and require union talks over government use of the burgeoning technology.
A state House panel considered three of the measures Wednesday. 
State regulation of AI has been a sticking point for the Trump administration. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month threatening federal broadband funding for states if the federal government believes they’ve passed “onerous AI laws.” 
Trump believes the federal government should set regulations, instead of a patchwork of states. But there are no signs federal lawmakers will approve comprehensive AI regulations in the near-term.
The Legislature created a task force dedicated to devising potential legislation on AI in 2024.
Deepfakes
Moon was testifying Wednesday in support of House Bill 1170. The legislation would require generative AI companies with over 1 million users to make an AI detection tool available. 
It also pushes these companies to disclose, such as through a watermark, that an image, video or audio recording was AI-generated. 
The tech industry opposes the legislation. Amy Harris, director of government affairs for the Washington Technology Industry Association, said it’s not as simple as watermarking the content, since those can be removed. 
“There’s no single reliable way today to detect AI content across formats,” Harris added. 
The House Technology, Economic Development and Veterans Committee is set to vote on the legislation Thursday. Last year, the panel passed the bill along party lines, but it didn’t make it to the House floor.
Jai Jaisimha, co-founder of the Transparency Coalition, told the committee Wednesday that “things have only been worse” since lawmakers considered the legislation last year.
Chatbots
House Bill 2225 responds to cases of young people who shared their ideation for self-harm with AI chatbots that, in some cases, reportedly gave them ways to die by suicide.
OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, reported in October that more than a million users each week indicate “explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Roughly 560,000 show “possible signs of mental health emergencies.” The platform has hundreds of millions of users. 
The company faces lawsuits from families of children who killed themselves after engaging with the chatbot companion. OpenAI says it has worked with mental health professionals to improve the platform.
Washington’s legislation sets requirements for the operators of these tools when dealing with minors. These systems include ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot and Google’s Gemini.
If the operator knows a user is a minor, it must inform them that the chatbot is artificially generated and not human. It also must implement “reasonable measures” to prevent the chatbot from generating sexually explicit content or suggestive dialogue. And it prohibits “manipulative engagement techniques” that try to intensify an emotional relationship between the user and the bot. 
“We know this is happening,” said prime sponsor Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah. “It’s happening for emotional manipulation, becoming your best friend, talking and supporting everything that you’re saying that’s making you feel good. The dangers are there.”
Katie Davis, co-director of the University of Washington Center for Digital Youth, confirmed teens go to these chatbots for more than help with schoolwork, sometimes seeking support for romantic issues and exploring their identity.
Companies with these chatbots must also implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation, including by referring users to crisis resources and preventing responses that describe self-harm. 
Violations of the policy would be enforced under the state’s Consumer Protection Act. This mechanism, which would allow individuals to sue, drew ire from the tech community. Harris said it would expose companies to “sweeping liability.”
“This approach risks reducing access to helpful tools without meaningfully improving safety,” she said. “We support targeted safeguards for truly high-risk uses, and urge the committee to pause and work with us further on this.”
The bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2027, if passed.
The legislation is modeled to an extent on a law in California that took effect this month. New York has also passed regulations on this issue.
Gov. Bob Ferguson requested the bill. Beau Perschbacher, senior policy advisor to the governor, said that when he talks to his boss about AI, the governor references his own teenage children and “the challenges of parents today with trying to keep up with rapidly evolving technology.”
“It will put us at the forefront of regulating AI companion chatbots,” Perschbacher said.
AI discrimination
Another bill focuses on the use of AI-fed algorithms in high-stakes decisions, like hiring and medical insurance. 
House Bill 2157 would require both the companies developing and deploying the technology to take steps to protect people from discrimination potentially embedded in the algorithms. The bill covers businesses making over $100,000 in annual revenue.
Other potential issues mentioned in the bill where this could come up are school admissions, housing and loans. 
“In the absence of federal guidelines and regulations, state oversight is essential,” said bill sponsor Rep. Cindy Ryu, D-Shoreline.
Ryu’s bill doesn’t cover spellcheck, calculators, robocall filters, antivirus technology and more benign applications. Governments are exempt from the requirements.
Business groups said the measure could have a chilling effect that pushes companies to stop using the technology entirely.
The legislation is based on a Virginia bill passed last year but vetoed by the state’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond on Wednesday announced the settlement with George’s, Inc.
George’s, Inc., a company headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, committed to remove poultry litter from the watershed over seven years and reduce the remaining amount.
The company agreed to pay $5 million to the state for remediation and conservation projects and attorney fees. It will also pay a special master $250,000 to monitor compliance.
The company also agreed that poultry litter removed from the watershed will not be applied to land in any other nutrient-sensitive watersheds in Oklahoma.
In exchange, the state released all claims against the company.

“This settlement demonstrates that fair, good-faith negotiations can produce outcomes that serve everyone’s interests – protecting Oklahoma’s water resources while respecting the economic realities facing our agricultural partners,” Drummond said. “George’s willingness to come to the table and work toward meaningful remediation, rather than prolonged litigation, reflects the kind of responsible corporate citizenship I hope to see from all parties in this case.” 
George’s could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
Last month, a federal judge issued a judgment holding seven large poultry companies jointly responsible and requiring them to pay for decades of cleanup along the Illinois River Watershed. The judge also imposed strict restrictions on poultry waste application.
The settlement announced Wednesday does not affect ongoing proceedings with the other defendants: Tyson, Cobb Vantress, Cargill, Simmons, Peterson Farms and Cal-Maine.
“I remain committed to working with all parties to achieve comprehensive solutions for the Illinois River Watershed while preserving the economic vitality of Oklahoma’s  poultry producers,” Drummond said. 
In 2005, former Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson sued the companies, alleging the excessive spreading of poultry litter as fertilizer had degraded the watershed, which runs through Eastern Oklahoma and the Northwest Ozark Mountains in Arkansas.
Edmondson said Wednesday that George’s should be entitled to a break because they were the first to settle, which deserves an incentive.
“There is a significant amount they are going to pay in for restoration of the watershed and there is also an amount that they are going to pay toward a special master,” Edmondson said. “Those are good things.”
But Edmondson said he is concerned that the company will be able to walk away after seven years, unless that time frame is extended by mutual consent.
“I find that a little dangerous,” Edmondson said.
Edmondson said George’s settlement should incentivize the other companies to settle, “but I’ll be surprised if it does.”
The settlement only affects one grower, said Gov. Kevin Stitt, adding that he is concerned for all of the others.

He said he was renewing his call for Drummond to seek a stay from the federal court order and continue settlement discussions that include his Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Environment.
Edmondson said a map of the impacted area shows that it is nutrient impaired or nutrient sensitive.
“There’s unusual algae growth,” Edmondson said. “The biosphere of the water has been changed. The fish that can survive are different.”
It is no longer as attractive of a watershed as it was in the past, Edmondson said.
The poultry industry has become a “sacred chicken,” rather than a sacred cow, he said.
“Legislatively and administratively, we have violated our own act, we the people, by allowing that to happen,” Edmondson said. “And the worst player in the watershed has been poultry.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)For three seconds on the floor of a Ford Motor Co. plant in Dearborn, a solitary autoworker did what the political establishment has largely failed to do for three months: remind the country exactly who its president is.
As Michigan Advance reported, when Donald Trump walked through the  facility Tuesday, a worker in a now-viral video shouted that Trump was a “pedophile protector,” a reference to the president’s long-running ties to Jeffrey Epstein and the still-unresolved question of why the full Epstein files have not been released. 
Trump’s response wasn’t denial, reflection or restraint. He flipped off that Ford employee, since identified as 40-year-old TJ Sabula, a line worker and member of UAW Local 600.
That moment — crude, unpresidential and unmistakable — cut through weeks of both-sides noise and strategic silence. In one exchange, the country saw the same man it has seen for nearly a decade: thin-skinned, angry at accountability, and hostile to anyone who challenges him, especially working people.
A Ford worker called out Trump. The president flipped him off. Now, he’s been suspended.

And then Sabula was suspended.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), whose district includes many Ford workers, confirmed what Ford itself would not say publicly: Sabula was suspended immediately after the incident. 
Tlaib didn’t mince words about what that decision said.
She expressed shock that Ford would punish a worker for stating something “factually true,” while saying nothing about a president who responded by flipping off one of their own employees. 
“He’s the president of the United States and he did that,” Tlaib told me in a phone interview Tuesday night. “But they say nothing, and they punish him for speaking up … for survivors.”
That’s the part that should linger. This wasn’t just a heckle. Sabula’s comment went to the heart of a question that refuses to go away: why Trump’s Department of Justice has failed to follow the law and fully release the Epstein files, and why so many powerful people seem determined to let the issue fade.
Tlaib made that connection explicit, noting that the Epstein matter has slipped from headlines even as survivors and advocates continue asking when they’ll get justice. 

 @michiganadvance #trump #epsteinfiles @Distillsocial ♬ Quiet Music – Stacey Barelos 

 
There certainly has been a lot to be distracted by, whether it’s the killing of an unarmed mother of three in Minneapolis, a military incursion into Venezuela to depose its leader or threats to invade a staunch NATO ally’s territory.
But Sabula wasn’t distracted.
That’s what makes this moment so damning. For months, Republicans have tiptoed around Epstein, issuing vague statements about “process” and “transparency,” while refusing to say plainly what millions of Americans already believe: that Trump’s DOJ is obstructing accountability, and that the failure to release the files protects powerful men, not survivors.
Instead, it took an autoworker, with no press staff, pollsters or protective bubble, to say it out loud, at personal cost.
In doing so, Sabula exposed more than Trump’s ingrained cruelty. He exposed Ford’s priorities.
As Tlaib pointed out, Ford planned the visit, brought Trump onto the factory floor and failed to give workers a heads-up. They placed employees in a volatile situation with a deeply divisive president and then acted shocked when someone exercised their First Amendment rights.
Ford could have hosted Trump at headquarters. They could have limited his access. They could have coordinated with the UAW, which Tlaib noted has historically been involved in presidential visits but notably was not part of this one. 
Instead, they made a choice, and then punished the worker who bore the consequences.
That choice sends a message. As Tlaib put it, it tells workers that standing up for sexual assault survivors is a firable offense, while accommodating power is corporate policy. It suggests a company more concerned with pleasing a president than protecting the people who build its cars.
It also reveals how normalized Trump’s behavior has become. A president flipping off a factory worker should be a national scandal. Instead, the fallout landed almost entirely on the person without power.
This is why those three seconds mattered.
They cut through the noise and reminded us that Trump, as well as his administration, still treats accountability as a personal insult. But it also means that institutions — from the DOJ to Fortune 500 companies — still bend to protect him.
Tlaib hopes the public will protect Sabula, noting the real risks he now faces for speaking out. She’s right. 
We shouldn’t let a factory worker carry alone what should be a collective demand: release the Epstein files, follow the law, and stop punishing truth-tellers to appease an angry president.
For three seconds, America was reminded who Donald Trump is. 
And it took a union member and working stiff to do it.

Mike Parson to fund voter-approved Medicaid expansion  (Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).A milestone moment for the Missouri state budget passed unmentioned Wednesday in a House committee — for the first time since Medicaid expansion was passed by voters in 2020, the general revenue fund is being tapped to pay for it.
In the four years that the voter-mandated program has been set aside in a separate line item, lawmakers have appropriated $13.5 billion and the number of people covered has grown to more than 363,000. Until Gov. Mike Kehoe presented his budget this week, there was never a request to use general revenue — money from income and sales taxes — for the program.
Instead, federal COVID aid, plus money from taxes on medical providers, has paid the state’s 10% share.
The money for eligibility expansion is part of the $1.1 billion supplemental spending request for the overall Medicaid program. The number of people served by the expansion program has been growing, and it will take $79.9 million of general revenue — matched by $409 million in federal funding — to finish out the fiscal year, according to Kehoe’s budget request.
No one on the 31-member House Budget Committee questioned or commented on the request during a hearing on Kehoe’s $3.3 billion supplemental spending plan for all of state government. Kehoe is asking for $572 million in general revenue in that total.
Lawmakers are being asked to send the bill to Kehoe’s desk by March 15 — far earlier than normal — because there is a federal grant for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Kansas City that must be spent within 45 days of being received.
The money is not in the state’s hands yet but it is expected by the end of the month.

That the general revenue request for Medicaid expansion drew no questions is evidence that the program — which majority Republicans funded in 2021 only after an order from the Missouri Supreme Court — has worked for the state, said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, ranking Democrat on the budget committee.
“​​When you look at increased access to health care, increased access to hospital and primary care clinics across the state, I think Medicaid expansion has been a positive for Missourians,” Fogle said. 
The entire additional cost for Medicaid to complete the year drew only one question during the hearing.
“The question is, are these in line with what we’ve seen in previous supplementals, or are any of these spikes that should raise an eyebrow,” asked state Rep. Del Taylor, a Democrat from St. Louis.
The request is similar to past years, state Budget Director Dan Haug said. Part of it is because lawmakers lowball the overall cost of the program each year to help lower the overall budget total, he said.
“Some of it is some increased cost, as we’ve seen in other lines, like our health care costs for our state employees,” Haug said. “Medical costs just are going up in various areas around the country, not just in Medicaid programs, but in private pay.”
Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays 90% of the cost of coverage for adults from 18 to 64 with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. That is about $21,600 for a single person.
Expansion in Missouri occurred during the federal health emergency for COVID-19, when the state was receiving extra federal funds for Medicaid because no one on the program could be removed. In 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act, the signature COVD recovery bill under President Joe Biden, boosted Missouri’s federal Medicaid funding because it enacted expansion.
Missouri banked those funds and, along with funds generated from taxes on medical providers, has paid its share of Medicaid expansion.
The federal budget reconciliation act, called the Big Beautiful Bill by President Donald Trump, will bring changes to the expansion program, including work requirements and more frequent eligibility reviews. The supplemental spending plan includes $131 million — with $9 million in general revenue — to implement changes to Medicaid expansion and other social welfare programs.
The funding will be used to rewrite application systems and provide additional services to prevent errors in eligibility determinations that could cost the state. In the coming year Missouri will have to take on half the cost of administering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps.
And depending on the error rate for eligibility determinations for SNAP, the state may have to pay a share of the cost for food benefits themselves.
“These are the rules of the game now, and we just have to play by them and do the best we can to maximize the revenue coming down to Missouri, or minimize the error rates so that we don’t get the penalties, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Haug said to explain the appropriation.
Fogle said she was disappointed Haug could not estimate the cost to taxpayers if error rates are not reduced.
“Those are hundreds, hundreds of millions of dollars of consequences,” Fogle said.
The supplemental spending bill’s other big items are $916 million in various line items, most of it federal funding, to pay for recovery from disasters like the May 16 tornado in St. Louis, and nearly $640 million to provide a full year of funding to the Missouri Department of Transportation.
Lawmakers tried to separate federal road aid into its own fund last year following a court decision that all money in the state road fund “stands appropriated” and can be spent by the Highways and Transportation Commission as needed. The legislation for a separate fund didn’t pass, but the spending bills for the year did not reflect that.
State Rep. Don Mayhew, a Republican from Crocker, said he’s inclined to deny the supplemental request.
“Theoretically they can go and pay this bill, if I read the decision correctly,” Mayhew said. “I would like to see that happen, to see if they truly are ‘stand appropriated.’”
Haug said the money was requested because it keeps state budgeting cleaner.
“If you want to take this out and see what happens, that is your prerogative,” he said “We would like to see it appropriated.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_0319-scaled-e1768427427848-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

Maura Healey’s attempts to lower energy costs.","MASSACHUSETTS ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS are delaying implementation of a clean heat program until 2028, according to a note the Healey administration quietly sent to stakeholders in late December, just days before the regulation was set to take effect. 
The clean heat standard, which the Baker administration initiated in 2021, is designed to incentivize fuel suppliers and the thermal sector to adopt cleaner heating technologies like electric heat pumps to cut emissions and meet the state’s aggressive climate commitments. The standards were supposed to kick in this year. 
The oil, propane, and natural gas providers would need to gradually cut their emissions each year under the program and buy credits to offset their pollution. Those costs in theory could be passed on to consumers, risking further price increases that would run counter to Gov. Maura Healey’s attempts to lower soaring energy costs as she seeks reelection this year. 
“Governor Healey is focused on lowering energy costs,” Karissa Hand, a Healey spokesperson, said in a statement.” That’s why we went straight to the public to get their thoughts on the implementation of the Clean Heat Standard. We heard a clear desire to take additional time to implement these changes, let the market develop, and keep costs down.” 
The memo, sent to “stakeholders” on Dec. 23, 2025, said that the administration is “working to ensure there is a robust market for affordable clean heat” and that the state will be evaluating additional data around fuel and emissions trends and heat pump adoptions. The Boston Herald was first to report on the delay. 
The clean heat standard is a key part of the state’s overall climate strategy and was expected to take effect this year. The Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030, which was released in 2022, evaluated five different clean heat scenarios to identify “the most cost-effective way to meet statutory GHG emissions limits.” 
Healey’s Republican opponents are already calling out the delay. Mike Kennealy, a GOP gubernatorial candidate, said Wednesday that “when you know a policy is so damaging that you have to hide it from voters, it’s clear you’re putting politics ahead of people.” Brian Shortsleeve, another Republican candidate vying to replace Healey, said the governor’s delay is the “latest cynical political ploy designed to get her through the next election.”
Last year, Healey also delayed a sales requirement for electric vehicles. And the state has had to push back offshore wind procurements as the Trump administration undermines new development in that sector.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gov-Healey-meets-the-press-Gov-Flickr-feed.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(USDA/FPAC photo by Preston Keres)A new western Montana program is looking to improve mental health for farmers and ranchers through a federal grant.
The program, “Better Together: A Wellness Series for Farmers and Ranchers,” comprises four interactive sessions focusing on stress management, mindfulness as well as strategies for navigating uncertainty in agricultural life.
Farmer and rancher mental health is a major issue within the agricultural community and according to the National Rural Health Association, the suicide rate among farmers is three-and-a-half times the rate of the general population.
“Farmers and ranchers are incredibly resilient, but resilience does not mean going it alone,” Sarah Holden, horticulture extension agent with MSU Extension in Missoula County, said in a press release. “This federal grant allows us to offer practical, evidence-based tools and create a supportive space where producers can connect, build skills and strengthen their well-being.”
The initiative is grant-funded through the Western Regional Agricultural Stress Assistance Program, part of a larger, nationwide initiative to improve rural mental health. The money for the initiative was originally part of the 2018 Farm Bill, which agricultural organizations across the country have asked to be renewed.
Montana State University Extension is one of the lead agencies for the western regional stress assistance program, which is administered by the federal government through the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The program held its first session on Jan. 12 and will host three more on Jan. 26, Feb. 9 and Feb. 23 from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Balsamroot Conference Room of the Exploration Center, located at 1075 South Ave. W. in Missoula
Local farmers and ranchers are encouraged to attend, even if they did not go to the first session, and can register online. The event is free and open to ranchers and farmers in Lake, Sanders, Mineral, Missoula and Ravalli counties, as well as surrounding areas, a press release said.
The workshops are being taught by Julie Engh Peters, with Deeproots Montana. Peters also is the co-owner of Red Hen Farm and Orchard in Missoula County.
“This work is deeply meaningful — and deeply demanding,” Peters said in a press release. “We are offering this series as an act of gratitude and support for farmers and ranchers who give so much of themselves to their land and communities. Participants will leave with tangible practices they can realistically use in daily life.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/52100786614_9103ba001a_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota will expand a specialty program for people facing drug charges, a move spurred by a decision last year to lessen the penalties for drug use.
The state will also pilot a program meant to keep a closer eye on people serving probation sentences, South Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Steven Jensen said Wednesday during his State of the Judiciary message to lawmakers.
Until last year’s vote to change it, South Dakota’s ingestion law was the only one in the nation to explicitly allow felony penalties for drug use alone. Since the new law took effect in July, first- and second-offense ingestion of a controlled substance is a misdemeanor, punishable by jail time and a fine.

https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011426-State-of-the-Judiciary.mp3
 Listen to Searchlight reporter Meghan O’Brien’s audio story about the State of the Judiciary address. (Broadcasters: Scroll to the bottom of this story for downloadable scripts and audio.)
The law change directed the court system to lean on the HOPE program as an option for monitoring people charged with drug use in the state. Under the terms of that program, which originated in Hawaii, participants call a number each day to find out if they’ll need to take a drug test. Those who fail to come when called or fail their test are jailed.
At the time Gov. Larry Rhoden signed the bill into law, however, South Dakota had used the program sparingly, and only for people facing felony charges. 
The state’s court system is “in the process of expanding HOPE probation to misdemeanor cases,” Jensen told lawmakers. 
The Unified Judicial System does not intend to ask for additional funds from lawmakers just yet, Jensen said, although the expansion will require oversight at the state level. 
Lawmakers approve rollback of South Dakota’s uniquely severe drug ingestion penalties

It will also require buy-in from county leaders, who would administer the program. 
Currently, all but a handful of South Dakota’s 66 counties use the 24-7 sobriety program, which typically asks participants to prove their sobriety with daily breath tests for alcohol or thrice-weekly tests for drug use.
Separately, the state has specialty drug courts, which aim to help addicted people who’ve pleaded guilty to felony charges stay sober through incentives and weekly, support-group style meet-ups with judges and the court’s other participants.
“HOPE probation has the most potential in rural counties, where monitoring services such as 24-7 and specialty courts are scarce,” Jensen said.
Sen. Tamara Grove, R-Lower Brule, was the sponsor of last year’s ingestion bill. She said after the speech that she was pleased to hear the chief justice commit to expanding HOPE probation.
“The reason why I even brought the bill was because of what he said on the floor about the success of drug courts in general,” Grove said. “I worked a lot with those in Lower Brule, so I had a passion for that.”
Pre-trial supervision
The issue of pre-trial probation more broadly is the focus of a pilot program in Pennington County, Jensen said.
Currently, the courts have no authority to “provide services” to people who haven’t been convicted or pleaded guilty to a crime, Jensen said. That could mean helping judges set the conditions for release for a person jailed as they await trial, or monitoring a person who’s been released as they await trial to make sure they’re behaving as their bond conditions dictate and that they show up for court dates.
The pilot program in Pennington County to allow for pre-trial supervision in the Rapid City area will be paid for by grant funds.

“We will report to the Governor’s Office and the Legislature on our progress and hope to expand these services statewide in the future,” Jensen said.
Lawmakers will need to authorize the pilot program by passing a court system-sponsored bill that awaits a hearing in the House of Representatives.
The state also aims to train court service officers on the best ways to deal with offenders between 18 and 25 years of age, and to work with partners to expand youth mentoring programs for people in that age group.
“Research shows that brain development continues through the early- to mid-20s, meaning young adults often think, learn, and respond more impulsively than older adults,” Jensen said.
The training and expansion of mentoring will help the courts, he added, “implement tailored supervision techniques to improve outcomes for emerging adults.”

Another area where Jensen said lawmakers might one day be asked to pitch in additional funding involves legal aid for those who can’t afford it.
South Dakota leans on counties to shoulder the financial burden of court-appointed attorneys in criminal cases. Last year, lawmakers approved funding for a state public defender’s office, which handles appeals in criminal and abuse and neglect cases.
New state public defense office has taken 43 cases so far

That office has improved efficiencies in the court system, Jensen said, and removed some of the financial strain from counties. 
The next step will be state intervention on the front-end of criminal cases. A state Commission on Indigent Legal Services has concluded that training for defense attorneys through the state public defender’s office, higher compensation rates and the creation of regional public defenders offices to handle “high-level felony cases” in the counties would reduce potential errors upfront and improve the system as a whole.
“A system that is efficient and effective, while also accessible in both rural and urban counties, is essential to ensure the rights the courts must uphold,” Jensen said.
The Legislature needn’t take any action this year, he said, as the commission works to “solidify the plans for future expansion for another year.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Recovery grants will soon become available to help Providence East Side businesses impacted during the roughly five-day manhunt for the gunman responsible for killing two students and injuring nine others at Brown University in December.
State and city grants enhanced by matching funds from Brown are making $45,000 available to three merchant associations whose members operate in areas surrounding the Ivy League campus, city officials announced Monday.
The campus is embedded in a residential area dotted with hotspots of commercial and retail activity. The popular shopping and dining destination Thayer Street is adjacent to where the Dec. 13 shooting took place at Brown’s Barus & Holley building.
The Thayer District Merchant Association, the Wickenden Area Merchant Association and the Wayland Square Merchants Association are the recipients. Contributing $15,000 each are the city of Providence, Rhode Island Commerce and Brown.
“Many of our local businesses felt the impact of this tragedy in numerous ways, including a dramatic reduction in foot traffic just before Christmas,” Smiley said in a statement. “The City’s investment is aimed at supporting our small businesses and neighborhood commercial districts during a difficult moment.”
The police presence and general unease on College Hill led to business owners reporting disruptions and reduced business. The grants are meant to “help merchants recover, retain customers and keep these corridors active and resilient,” according to Smiley’s statement.  
In her statement, Brown President Christina H. Paxson said that neighboring businesses and residents aided the campus community and “provided crucial help” in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, which killed two Brown students and injured nine others.  
“We are forever grateful for their support,” Paxson wrote. “The merchants in these commercial districts play a tremendous role in sustaining a thriving local community that generations of Brown community members know and love, and we appreciate the opportunity to match these grants as one way to express our gratitude.” 
The merchant associations will receive the grants directly and oversee how the monies are spent, according to the city’s announcement.

Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson, led a call and response chant with the crowd packed into Mount Nebo Baptist Church in Jackson Monday, Jan. 12. A delegation of Black lawmakers organized the event to discuss proposed changes to the state's funding formula for public universities.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Proposed changes to how the state funds its eight public universities could harm historically Black institutions, some lawmakers said.
The funding formula updates, which legislators discussed with higher education officials in December, would tie state money to post-graduation student success such as the number of Mississippians attaining jobs and completing some form of education beyond high school. 
A delegation of Black lawmakers said that factoring graduation rates, post-graduation employment and degrees awarded by universities into their allotted funding would unfairly penalize historically Black colleges and universities for challenges tied to decades of underfunding. 
Black lawmakers spoke about the funding formula to a standing-room-only crowd of more than 160 alumni and supporters at Mt. Nebo Baptist Church in Jackson on Monday. The goal of the event, organized by Jackson Democrats Sen. Sollie Norwood and Rep. Grace Butler Washington was to educate and warn HBCU stakeholders about proposals the state Legislature is considering this session. 
It was also a rally to encourage supporters to stay engaged.
“We need to be cautious as we proceed forward,” said Rep. Bryant Clark, a Democrat from Pickens and a 1998 graduate of Mississippi Valley State. 
The Board of Trustees for the Institutions of Higher Learning, which oversee the state’s public universities,  uses a formula that equally distributes funding across the eight universities without factoring in performance or enrollment. 
HBCUs serve many students who lack resources and face more barriers to completing higher education. More than three quarters of the undergraduate student body at Mississippi’s three public HBCUs rely on Pell Grants — federal student aid provided to students who demonstrate exceptional financial need — to attend. By comparison, Pell Grant recipients make up about half of the student enrollment at only two of the state’s predominantly white institutions  — Mississippi University for Women (56%) and University of Southern Mississippi (52%). 
Mississippi settled a lawsuit over funding disparities at its public universities in 2002  —  the $500 million Ayers settlement — but chronic underfunding of higher education by the state means these funds have not caught HBCUs up to their PWI counterparts.

The proposed funding formula success metrics could lead to closing Mississippi Valley State, Clark said. 
Valley State’s average six-year graduation rate is 27%, the lowest of Mississippi’s public institutions, according to IHL data. MVSU awarded 242 degrees in the 2023-24 academic year, the lowest among the state’s public universities, even similarly sized ones. Of almost 2,200 students enrolled at MVSU in fall of 2023, 985 received Pell Grants, federal financial aid awarded to students from low income households, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Students who attend Mississippi Valley State have more barriers to get to the rural campus, including transportation, cost and affordability, Clark said. It is unfair for the Legislature and IHL to consider a funding formula that doesn’t take into account the disproportionate challenges to graduation that the students enrolled face, he said. 
Mississippi Valley State is also an “economic engine” for the Delta region, Clark said. The university contributes $75 million to the the state’s economy and produces more than 980 jobs, according to a 2024 HBCU Impact report from the United Negro College Fund. 
Instead of focusing on closing them, the Legislature and IHL should view the state’s HBCUs as a model of efficiency, doing more with fewer resources, Clark said. “We continue to educate our students at just a fraction of the cost.”
Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State alumni tend to remain Mississippi residents and enter the state’s workforce after graduation, said Rep. Greg Holloway, a Democrat from Hazlehurst. For predominantly white institutions such as the University of Mississippi or Mississippi State University, he said, “you can’t say the same thing.” 
“They don’t talk about us and our impact,” Holloway said to thunderous applause. “This new formula is about a money grab. Displacing resources from one place to another. We should be talking about how to provide quality education for our HBCU students. We deserve more.” 
Students should pay attention to the threat of closing one of Mississippi’s HBCUs, said Camrynn Wimberly, a senior studying political science at Jackson State. Wimberly rallied a few of her classmates to attend the town hall. She shares policy issues and information on her social media. 
“Our schools, we’re more than just football, partying and pledging fraternities and sororities,” Wimberly said. “We’re history.” 
At the end of the event, Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson, encouraged HBCU alumni to send emails, call and pressure lawmakers to pay attention to their concerns. Summers also led a call and response chant, and participating lawmakers and audience members locked arms. 
“When we fight,” Summers shouted into the microphone. The audience shouted back, “We win!”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14093326/IMG_7826.jpg,,,2026-01-14 17:56:41.105377

A Dec. 17, 2025 windstorm ripped the roof off the building, causing asbestos material to spread around the area. (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).PARK CITY — Park City Public Schools Superintendent Dave Whitesell didn’t get much of a holiday break before Christmas and New Year’s.
On Dec. 17, less than an hour before classes were dismissed on that Wednesday, a wind gust of 82 mph ripped part of the roof off the district’s gym. To complicate matters, part of the debris that went along with sustained 67-mph wind gusts was firewall material, likely installed when the building was constructed in 1951, contained vermiculite asbestos.
Since then, the school district and more than a half-dozen different agencies, along with contractors, have been fixing the roof and abating the toxic building material.
The Park City School District faced a host of problems, ranging from repairing the roof, to getting information about asbestos abatement during the holidays, and even planning for classes. Whitesell said even though testing results didn’t positively confirm asbestos until after the holidays, the district took precautions and treated the materials as if they were contaminated.
Elementary grades from kindergarten through third grade have been spread out around four different locations in town, Whitesell said. Students in higher grades have been utilizing remote online learning.
“The community has just been fantastic about this because there’s been a lot of unknowns and there still are a couple,” he said. “It did take a lot of dialing and phone calls, but once we got to the right people, it all worked out.”
Whitesell told the Daily Montanan that he was hopeful that elementary students could return to in-class teaching by the beginning of next week, but that still depends on getting clearance from the Environmental Protection Agency and the state’s Department of Environmental Quality.
When older students might return is less clear.
Health officials are concerned that the area around the school — and even around the community — may be contaminated and need asbestos abatement. Officials from the EPA are still conducting tests in the area. He said DEQ officials are going door-to-door and they’re testing to make sure asbestos has not contaminated the area.
Asbestos is mineral that is used in insulation, flooring, fireproofing and some landscaping. It is extremely light and usually doesn’t present a danger when left undisturbed. But when tiny pieces of the material become airborne, humans can breath the microscopic fibers which become trapped in the lungs, which can lead to a multitude of chronic health problems including cancer, emphysema and asbestosis.
Whitesell said that school officials have restored the interior of the buildings, but don’t want to open them back up and risk recontamination from the public until public health officials tell the district the community is safe. That could take weeks, Whitesell said — the timeline depends on what they find.
He also said that officials with the federal government, Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office and leaders from the Montana Office of Public Instruction, which oversees public education in the state, have been very helpful. For example, Whitesell said that OPI officials have been a great support ensuring the students and teachers could quickly establish remote learning, not so unlike the COVID-19 outbreak six years ago.
As of Tuesday, Park City Public Schools had racked up $1.5 million in costs between the new gymnasium roof and asbestos testing and abatement. Whitesell said that will likely be picked up in some part by the district’s insurance carrier, but it’s unclear what the total costs will be and if there is other state or federal money available.
The Daily Montanan sent questions to Gianforte’s office about support, but received no comment.
Whitesell also said officials with the regional Federal Emergency Management Agency have pledged to work on a federal presidential declaration that would help open support to the small school district, which has 171 students.
He praised the community for being patient and willing to help to make sure school wasn’t too badly interrupted — amazing because the incident happened just as families were getting ready to celebrate the holidays.
  Stillwater County’s role 

As school district officials were still waiting back for test results and details about the clean-up process, the three-member Stillwater County Board of Commissioners sent the district a letter on Jan. 8, which gave the schools an ultimatum: Either clean-up the vermiculite asbestos from the surrounding areas, including the streets or the county would do it and charge the bill to the schools.
The letter gave the district until 5 p.m., on Jan. 12.
“Upon legal consultation and due diligence of legal responsibility it is the decision of the Stillwater County Board of Commissioners that the source of the asbestos is from the Park City School District and therefore ownership of any vermiculite material that has been distributed on property including the streets and sidewalks belonging to Stillwater County is also that of the Park City School District,” the letter begins.
In a response letter, sent on the county-imposed deadline of Jan. 12 and published on the district’s website, Whitesell outlined the steps the district was taking to remediate the area, and called into question the commission’s deadline. Instead, Whitesell said the process, including clean-up, was being informed by information supplied by the DEQ, not by the county.
“I don’t think their take on that was correct,” Whitesell said. “We found that kind of offensive that they expected us to be cleared in four days.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Asbestos-remediation-Park-City-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

Jody Barrett says he will oppose a plan backed by Gov. Bill Lee to expand the number of private school vouchers handed out. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Plans to substantially expand the size of Tennessee’s private-school voucher program in 2026 will meet resistance from rural lawmakers, mainly because of the high cost.
Republican Reps. Jody Barrett of Dickson and Todd Warner of Chapel Hill told the Lookout Wednesday they plan to oppose proposals to increase the number of vouchers awarded through the “Education Freedom Scholarship” program, which could push the expense to nearly $300 million. Republican Rep. Monty Fritts, a Kingston lawmaker running for governor, also opposes private-school vouchers.
“One of the main pillars to my objection against the program last year was the financial and fiscal conservative concerns about funding the program,” Barrett said Wednesday. “So unless there’s some pot of money out there that they haven’t disclosed to us yet that will fund this program and cover its costs, I just don’t see how we’re going to avoid stepping off into a black hole if we keep doing this.”
Barrett is sponsoring House Bill 1544, which would require the state to provide lawmakers with a full report on the private-school voucher program, including the number of students already enrolled in private schools.
Some 20,000 students received $7,300 to enroll in private schools this year.

Lawmakers such as House Speaker Cameron Sexton want to double the program’s size after the Department of Education turned down 22,000 other applicants because the program reached its cap.
Gov. Bill Lee wants to increase the number of vouchers, as well, but lawmakers won’t know the details until he makes his State of the State address Feb. 2.
The law allows 5,000 more students to be added in the second year. But Barrett said even that is subject to the legislature approving the funding for more students, a move that could put a damper on the $144 million program. Passage during a 2025 special session came with a $430 million total cost, including money for one-time teacher raises, funds to offset losses to public school districts and expenses for administration.
Warner, an outspoken critic of the plan in 2025, called it a “scam from day one.”
He said figures would show an estimated 70% of the vouchers dished out this year went to students already enrolled in private schools, if the state would reveal those numbers. The Department of Education has declined to release the number of “scholarships” given to private-school students, saying it wasn’t required in the legislation.
“I think our leadership makes a bad mistake running this type of bill in election year because they’re gonna get these rural Republicans, these rural conservatives where there’s no private schools, they’re gonna get ’em primaried, and it’s already happening,” Warner said. 
In contrast, Republican Rep. Dennis Powers of Jacksboro said he will support a major expansion if the state has the money to back it.
“Simply because we want to give everybody the opportunity to do it because we have 22,000 people that didn’t get to do it that applied for it,” said Powers, who has a primary challenger even though he backs the program.
Powers added that any exodus of students from public schools could give districts a break from overcrowded classrooms.

A recent report by Comptroller Jason Mumpower didn’t do much to improve the outlook for voucher expansion, Barrett said.
The audit of Tennessee’s Education Savings Account program, which is limited to low-income students in Memphis, Metro Nashville and Chattanooga showed participation at only 3,693 students this year, well below the 5,000 maximum, and that most of them left high-performing schools to get the $9,400 in state funds.
The report also showed that students in the program aren’t performing as well as their peers in public schools in both academic achievement and growth in test scores.
Only students in Memphis performed better than their peers in public schools and only slightly.
If lawmakers do anything, Barrett said, they should merge the two programs and put income limits on all vouchers to make sure they go to lower income students. The “scholarship” program is split between all students and those at 300% of the federal poverty level.
Sexton wants to drop income limits on the programs to offer the funds to all students. He also said the application deadline should line up with private school schedules and that fraud controls suggested by the comptroller should be enacted.

(Courtesy of Save the Bay)More than 100 days after state coastal regulators verbally agreed to crack down on Quidnessett Country Club for failing to remove a rock wall from its shoreline, they’re backing up their words with legal action.
The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) filed a counterclaim against the North Kingstown country club in Providence County Superior Court Tuesday. It wants a judge to force the country club to remove the 600-foot stone wall built without permission roughly three years ago. The 17-page filing was submitted in response to one of three lawsuits the country club has filed against the coastal panel in the ongoing dispute over how to restore the shoreline of its property — and whether the wall even needs to be taken down.
The country club initially built the buffer to shield the 14th hole of its signature golf course from coastal erosion, defying state coastal rules that prohibit permanent structures in environmentally sensitive areas. After being caught by state regulators in August 2023, the country club initially sought retroactive permission by arguing for less stringent environmental regulations in the area. 
The politically appointed coastal panel denied the request in January 2024, setting off a debate over how Quidnessett should remove the wall and return the shoreline to its preexisting conditions. All seven plans submitted by Quidnessett were rejected by CRMC staff because they failed to meet coastal requirements.
During the back-and-forth with coastal regulators, Quidnessett turned to the courts, with a trio of lawsuits alleging procedural violations and challenging the legitimacy of the agency’s shoreline restoration requirements.
The country club’s most recent complaint, filed Oct. 23 in Providence County Superior Court, asked a judge to reverse the CRMC’s enforcement order, contending that the dispute should be referred to an administrative hearing officer under the agency’s own guidelines, while labeling coastal regulators’ conditions for the location and slope of a natural barrier to replace the rock wall as “arbitrary and capricious.” 
The agency in its counterclaim denied these allegations, instead pointing to Quidnessett’s defiance despite an escalating series of written and verbal warnings and threats of fines.
“QCC has quibbled with CRMC over how the property should be restored and ignored a CRMC order requiring QCC to restore the property,” the counterclaim, filed by Anthony DeSisto, the CRMC’s legal counsel, states. 
The counterclaim also warns of “irreparable harms” to the coastal marsh habitat and public access if the wall is not removed. It seeks general injunctive relief from the court to force Quidnessett to remove the wall and restore the shoreline. 
Attorneys for the CRMC also plan to seek a faster, temporary court order via a second submission for a preliminary injunction, Mark Hartmann, another attorney for the CRMC, said during the agency’s meeting Tuesday. The preliminary injunction request had not been filed as of Wednesday.
Robin Main, an attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment when reached by email Wednesday.
Jed Thorp, advocacy coordinator for Save the Bay, was skeptical the wall would come down any time soon. Although the CRMC has asked the court to order Quidnessett to remove the wall, its plea for for urgency is weakened by the fact that three years have passed since the wall was built.
Also unresolved: Quidnessett’s original legal argument that the dispute is best resolved by a CRMC hearing officer. 
“Is a judge going to make them take the wall down when the court hasn’t yet ruled on whether it needs to go to a hearing officer?” Thorp said in an interview Wednesday. “With that question outstanding, I don’t see this being resolved quickly.”
Thorp maintained that the CRMC waited too long to take action, ignoring the recommendations of its own expert staff and mounting pressure by Save the Bay.
Yet Thorp credited Save the Bay’s Dec. 10 email to coastal regulators, urging the council to “end its delay game,” and a Jan. 12 ecoRI News story for prompting the CRMC to finally take legal action.
“My guess is, they knew they had a meeting coming up, they saw that ecoRI article and our letter admonishing them and said, ‘we better get on this,’” Thorp said.
Laura Dwyer, a spokesperson for the CRMC, did not return requests for comment Wednesday.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Democrats wasted little time flexing their new majority on the opening day of the 2026 General Assembly, pushing through four proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday aimed at reshaping some of the state’s most consequential political and civil rights debates — including one that would allow lawmakers to redraw Virginia’s congressional map mid-decade.
The measures, approved after clearing the House Privileges and Elections Committee earlier in the day, seek to protect abortion rights, restore voting rights for people with felony convictions, remove a defunct ban on same-sex marriage and — most controversially — grant the General Assembly limited authority to modify congressional districts outside the traditional 10-year redistricting cycle.
All four amendments now head to the Senate, where Democrats also hold the majority.
House Democratic leaders framed the aggressive opening-day push as a response to recent national court rulings, partisan redistricting battles in other states and what they described as an urgent need to let voters — not politicians or courts — decide the future of fundamental rights.
 Redistricting amendment draws fire

The most politically charged of the four measures is House Joint Resolution 4, a proposed constitutional amendment that would create a narrow, temporary exception allowing the General Assembly to redraw one or more congressional districts outside the standard decennial cycle under specific circumstances.
Under the proposal, lawmakers could act if another state redraws its congressional map mid-decade for reasons other than complying with a state or federal court order. The authority would apply only to congressional districts — not state legislative lines — and would expire in 2030.
Democrats argue the amendment is necessary to counter aggressive Republican gerrymanders elsewhere that could tilt control of Congress, while Republicans call it a blatant power grab that undermines Virginia voters’ 2020 decision to create an independent redistricting commission.
“This amendment creates essentially a narrow, temporary exception,” said Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, the measure’s sponsor. He emphasized repeatedly that the proposal does not automatically redraw any lines and does not eliminate the Virginia Redistricting Commission.
“We are not expanding the authority to change the state district lines,” Willett said. “We’re just talking about congressional lines. And more importantly, it does not change any of the lines as they exist today — this just creates the process to consider doing that.”
 April special election timeline

If the amendment ultimately passes the Senate this session, it would be placed on the ballot during a special statewide election in April, rather than waiting until November — a compressed timeline that Democrats say reflects the urgency of ongoing redistricting fights across the country.
“​​We’re going to focus on today so we’ll get that out of the House and the Senate,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee, during a news conference Wednesday morning. 
“And then we are looking at a special election for a statewide referendum to have the voters have their say in potentially April. And then once that kicks in, if the voters were to give us that power, we would then be looking at a modified schedule for the primaries, and then our November elections will happen as scheduled.”
Republicans have warned that the move could open the door to dramatic changes in Virginia’s congressional delegation. Democratic leaders have openly discussed the possibility of drawing a map that would yield as many as 10 Democratic-leaning districts, leaving just one Republican-friendly seat anchored in Southwest Virginia.
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, rejected that characterization of the state.
“We’re not a 10-1 state, we’re not a 9-2 state,” Kilgore told reporters Wednesday morning. “We’re a close, 6-5 state, and some of those congressional seats are very competitive.”
Republicans have also tried — unsuccessfully — to stop the amendment in court.
A judge in Tazewell County on Tuesday rejected an emergency request from GOP lawmakers seeking to halt the General Assembly from advancing the proposal before the session began. In his ruling, the judge emphasized that courts cannot interfere with the constitutional amendment process while it is still underway.
“Plaintiffs’ motion at its core requests the Court to invade the province of the Legislature prior to the final actions of the Legislature,” the judge wrote, citing long-standing separation-of-powers principles.
The court also rejected an attempt to bypass legislative immunity by targeting legislative clerks, finding they were simply performing their official duties.
 Sharp debate in committee

During Tuesday’s committee debate, Republicans warned the amendment reverses reforms voters approved just four years ago.
“We’re using this ‘end justifies the means’ method,” said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington. He argued that the amendment was improperly introduced after the 2025 election season had already begun and pointed to social media posts showing potential maps.
“It concerns me that we’re attempting to go back to the battle days of gerrymandering,” O’Quinn said.
Democrats countered that the amendment preserves flexibility without mandating any outcome and ultimately leaves the decision to voters.
“This does not change any of the lines as they exist today, this just creates the process to consider doing that, but it does not mandate that these lines be changed,” Willett said. 
 Other amendments headed for November

While the redistricting proposal is expected to dominate debate this spring, the other three amendments are slated to appear on November’s ballot.
One would remove a 2006 ban on same-sex marriage from Virginia’s constitution — language that has been unenforceable since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling but remains on the books. 
Supporters say the amendment is a safeguard should the court revisit marriage equality, something Justice Clarence Thomas suggested after the court overturned federal abortion protections.
Another amendment would automatically restore voting rights to people with felony convictions who have completed their sentences. Virginia is one of the few states where former felons permanently lose voting rights unless restored by the governor, a process critics say lacks transparency.
The third and most divisive proposal would enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution. 
It advanced last year amid emotional floor debates, shouting and a call of “out of order” in the Senate chamber, and has only moved forward because of Democratic control. 
Every Republican lawmaker has opposed the abortion amendment, and GOP leaders have previously backed near-total bans or a 15-week limit without exceptions for fetal anomalies. 
Since the fall of federal protections, Virginia has become the only Southern state without extensive abortion restrictions, leading to a surge in out-of-state patients seeking care.
Like the redistricting amendment, final approval of all three measures would rest with voters.
Price said the package of amendments reflects how interconnected the issues before lawmakers have become, particularly amid recent actions by President Donald Trump and Republican-controlled legislatures across the country. 
“‘There is no such thing as a single issue struggle,’” she said, referencing a quote from civil rights activist Audrey Lorde. “We do not lead single-issue lives, and I feel like that is more true today, now than ever in my lifetime, because of the actions of Trump and Republican-led state legislatures.”

(Photo from the CDC)Hundreds of federal employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received an email Tuesday notifying them they’re no longer subject to layoffs announced last spring.
That includes roughly 100 employees at the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division (PMRD) in Allegheny County, who are focused on advancements in mine safety. Their work includes research into ventilation, blast shields, and dust reduction. While they do not create rules or regulations, technology they’ve helped develop is used in mines across the country, and their research has led to changes in mine safety standards.
“This has been a tough battle here,” said Lilas Soukup, president of the local chapter of the federal employees union that represents PMRD employees. “I think we’re finally coming to a true win.”

Roughly 90% of NIOSH employees, including the Pittsburgh mining research team, were placed on administrative leave last April and told their positions were being eliminated. The move was part of the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) effort to slash federal employment across government agencies.
But due to a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, they were not allowed to be let go. That left NIOSH employees, including those at the Bruceton facility, in a sort of limbo.
Federal officials call miners’ health a ‘priority,’ but are cutting a Pa. team studying mine safety

The short email employees received by NIOSH employees Tuesday offered a sense of security that had been absent for much of the last year. However, PMRD employees have yet to hear details such as when they are expected to return.
“The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is a small but vital federal agency that helps prevent employee injuries, illnesses, and deaths at workplaces nationwide,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement Wednesday. “The administration’s attempt to lay off nearly every NIOSH worker was shameful and illegal, considering that much of NIOSH’s work is required by law. As the union representing these dedicated public servants, we are grateful that their jobs have been restored and we will continue fighting to ensure NIOSH has the resources and support it needs to serve the American public.”
Since the announcement of the layoffs in April, 2025, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have pressured Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reinstate NIOSH’s mine safety teams, especially as the Trump administration called for increasing mining across the country.
Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Jessica Shirley had also urged Kennedy to reinstate the Allegheny County team, which collaborates with the state department’s Bureau of Mine Safety on work like training mine rescue teams.
“This moment belongs to every single person who refused to stay silent,” Micah Niemeier-Walsh, Vice President of a federal employees union chapter representing NIOSH workers in Cincinnati, said in a statement. “Every rally, every media interview, every petition signature, every act of solidarity by NIOSH employees and our partners in the labor movement led to this victory of saving NIOSH.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Resources, said, “Under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, the nation’s critical public health functions remain intact and effective. The Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services—whether it’s supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CDC-lab-Pitt.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

(Photo from the City of Tampa)A proposal to boost affordable housing by allowing what are known as accessory dwelling units (ADUs) — including in-law suites, garage apartments, and backyard cottages — in areas usually restricted to single-family homes is being debated again in the Florida Legislature.
The measure (SB 48) is sponsored by Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview. Under existing law, local governments are authorized — but not required — to enact such ordinances. The bill would require cities and counties to authorize the units by Dec. 1.
The proposal passed unanimously in the Senate Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development on Wednesday.
Samantha Padgett, general counsel to the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, spoke up in support of the bill. She said that adding ADUs to the available housing stock would benefit those who work in the hotel and restaurant industries.
She added, however, that it was crucial that those ADUs “be preserved for long-term rental solutions,” applauding a provision in the legislation to ban the renting or leasing of an accessory dwelling unit for less than one month.
“Those are one of the things that will preserve accessory dwelling units to be a solution for rental for employees in the service industry,” she said.
Gaetz added an amendment deleting language allowing landlords to accept a “reusable tenant screening report” prepared by a consumer reporting agency when deciding whether to accept a potential tenant — which states such as California, Washington, Maryland, Wisconsin, and New York use. These forms allow participants to avoid having to fill out multiple applications.
He said he was removing that language “due to the danger of unauthorized sharing and hacking of personal, identifying data.”
Florida cities such as Gainesville, Tampa, Orlando, and St. Petersburg already allow ADUs.
The Florida Homebuilders Association, the James Madison Institute, the Florida Realtors, and the Florida Chamber of Commerce support the legislation.
The measure now moves to the Rules Committee, its final stop before going to the full Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Imagine starting the new year with the promise of at least a $147 million payout from the federal government.
But there are strings attached.
In late December, President Donald Trump’s administration announced how much all 50 states would get under its new Rural Health Transformation Program, assigning them to use the money to fix systemic problems that leave rural Americans without access to good health care. Now, the clock is ticking.
Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.
The money — divided into unique allocations for each state, ranging from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas — represents the first $10 billion installment from the five-year, $50 billion program. Congress created the fund as a last-minute sweetener in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer to offset the outsize fallout anticipated in rural communities from the statute’s nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade.
Federal officials crafted the fund to give states “space to be creative,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters after announcing the funding Dec. 29. “Some states will fail, and we will learn from that.”
The money was divided according to a complicated formula.
In 2026, each state will receive an equal $100 million share under the law for the first half of the money, plus additional funding from the second half. Oz’s staff steered payouts from the second portion based on each state’s rural score, as well as results from a “technical” scoring system for project proposals.
Within hours of the announcement, academics and researchers began to parse the awards to better understand why some states received more than others, including whether the awards reflected any partisanship or political favoritism.
At first glance, total awards do not appear to favor states governed by either Republicans or Democrats. But one academic data analysis teased out the amount awarded for each state’s technical score, which is the part determined by the discretion of agency officials.
The analysis was performed at the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which specializes in rural health. A KFF Health News review of the Sheps Center data found that states with Republican governors tended to receive more money for the parts of their application based on the technical score. Democratic-controlled states crowded the bottom quarter of those technical score awards.
Overall, though, the state awards reveal wild variation in how much money each state will get per rural resident, almost a hundredfold difference between the top and bottom.
In an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic, a spokesperson for Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs accused the administration of shortchanging rural residents in the state, which was awarded $167 million this year from the program.
CMS spokesperson Chris Krepich said in an emailed statement to KFF Health News that “politics played no role in funding decisions.”
On the December call, Oz pushed states to start working on policy actions championed by the administration — such as approving presidential fitness tests and restricting food benefits — that could require legislative approval.
Half of states promised to mandate the presidential fitness test, Oz said. Many states also proposed food waivers under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which would limit low-nutrition items such as soda. He also said some states promised to teach health care professionals about nutrition. And others confirmed they will repeal certificate-of-need laws, which require companies to prove that new health facilities they want to open are necessary.
Krepich said CMS’ new Office of Rural Health Transformation is hiring program officers to serve as point people for three or four states. Many states are setting up their own offices to oversee the new funding.
Oz highlighted Alabama’s “big maternity initiative with robotics doing ultrasounds” and said states are tackling issues ranging from behavioral health to obesity.
A KFF Health News review of state “project abstracts” and “spotlights” released by CMS shows that many states plan to address the workforce challenges in rural areas. Delaware, for example, plans to use its funding to create the state’s first four-year medical school with a rural primary care track.
A third of states said they want to improve electronic health records, and every state mentioned telehealth.
Many state legislatures must pass laws to distribute the funding to their state offices. Meanwhile, state officials are hiring staff, organizing advisory committees, and preparing to dole out money.
“I’m excited about what’s next,” said Terry Scoggin, former interim chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, or TORCH. Texas was awarded the biggest allocation. The money will bolster a rural hospital funding bill Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year, Scoggin said.
More than two dozen cash-strapped rural hospitals in Texas have closed or been converted to clinics since 2005, a nationwide trend that hit the Lone Star State particularly hard. The state has the largest rural population in the United States. Texas’ allocation amounts to about $66 per rural resident, according to a KFF policy analysis. By contrast, Rhode Island was granted about $6,300 per rural resident.
Scoggin said he has “a ton of concerns” about companies taking the money instead of it helping rural hospitals and residents. “I was blown away about how many for-profit companies reached out.” The companies have also called rural hospitals and asked to work with them to apply for state money, he said.
The awards should be judged on how they benefit rural residents because “the stated goal of the program is to improve rural health,” said Paula Chatterjee, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored a Senate Finance Committee memo on the transformation fund.
Researchers at the Sheps Center conducted the analysis to estimate how much money states received from the technical score, which is the portion of funding based on the quality of their proposals and state policy actions that align with “Make America Healthy Again” priorities.
New Mexico won the least amount of technical funding, with less than 10% of its award based on the discretionary metrics. Alaska won the largest technical award, according to the Sheps Center data.
Texas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Hawaii rounded out the top five recipients of technical funding. In addition to New Mexico, the other lowest technical awards went to Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona, and California.
Mark Holmes, director of the Sheps Center, declined to comment on whether he saw any political bias in the awards but said the nuance in the final portion of discretionary awards based on technical scores is important because those dollars can be redistributed and potentially clawed back in future years.
“We can be fairly certain that every state will get at least a slightly, if not a vastly, different amount next year based on this re-pooling and reallocation piece,” Holmes said.
States now have a limited time to show they’re using the money effectively to secure future funding.
But they can’t start spending yet. CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said.
States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.
“CMS is working closely with states to complete this process as efficiently as possible,” Krepich said.

Delmarva Power seeking third base-rate increase in roughly five years
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delmarva Power has asked state regulators to approve a new electric rate increase that would raise base-rate revenue by $67.8 million, a move that consumer advocates and some lawmakers say comes at a difficult time for Delaware families already facing higher utility bills.
The request, filed with the Delaware Public Service Commission, would increase the fixed monthly customer charge from $13.50 to $15.94 and allow interim rates to take effect as early as July 9, 2026, while the case is under review.
If approved, it would mark Delmarva’s third base-rate increase in roughly five years, bringing total requested increases over that period to about $160 million.
Delmarva says the increase is necessary to recover the cost of major infrastructure investments and to fund new programs aimed at improving reliability and helping customers better manage electricity usage. Critics argue the timing raises serious affordability concerns as supply, capacity, and fuel costs continue to rise.
Utility cites infrastructure and reliability
Delmarva reports it has invested about $480 million in Delaware’s electric system since its last rate review, focusing on storm hardening, grid modernization, and reliability upgrades. The company says those investments have contributed to a 47% reduction in outages statewide over the past decade.
The utility is also proposing new “load-flexibility” and affordability programs designed to encourage customers to reduce usage during peak demand periods. Delmarva estimates participating households could save $60 to $100 per year, with total customer benefits projected at roughly $13 million.
About $23.2 million of the request reflects costs already being collected through a temporary infrastructure surcharge. Delmarva is seeking to roll that surcharge into permanent base rates.
Critics warn of cumulative impact
Public Advocate Jameson Tweedie has sharply criticized the proposal, calling it a “non-starter” during what he describes as an affordability crisis for many households.
Tweedie has raised concerns about the cumulative impact of repeated rate cases, Delmarva’s requested 10.5% return on equity, and the growing gap between utility investment plans and what customers can reasonably afford.
Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola has also questioned the request, noting that many families were hit with unexpectedly high winter electric bills last year.
What this means for your bill
If approved, the increase would affect base rates — the portion of electric bills that covers Delmarva’s infrastructure and operations, not the cost of electricity supply.


Typical non-heating residential customersUsing about 810–830 kilowatt-hours per month would see base-rate increases of approximately $6.40 to $9.30 per month.


Electric space-heating customersCould see increases of about $15.60 per month.


These estimates do not include higher supply prices, regional capacity charges, or fuel costs, which have already contributed to rising electric bills across the region.
Delmarva is also seeking approval for interim rates beginning July 9, 2026. Any additional charges collected under interim rates would be refunded if regulators ultimately deny or reduce the increase.
What happens next
The rate request now enters a formal review process before the Delaware Public Service Commission, including testimony, public hearings, and analysis by commission staff and consumer advocates. A final decision is expected late in 2026.
The case sets up a familiar debate for regulators: how to balance long-term investments in grid reliability and resiliency with short-term affordability for customers already under financial pressure.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Delmarva_Retouched-5931.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

 Kempthorne honored due to service and ‘lifetime support of the U.S. military’

Risch said in the press release that he spoke to USS Idaho Cmdr. C.J. Guillerault in December, and made the naming request to “acknowledge Kempthorne’s significant contributions to this project as well as a lifetime of support to the U.S. military.” 
Risch highlighted Kempthorne’s work as a member of the Senate Armed Services committee and in his time as governor and commander in chief of the Idaho National Guard. Kempthorne also serves as chairman of the USS Idaho Commissioning Committee Advisory Board. 
The USS Idaho, SSN 799, is a Virginia-class, nuclear-powered submarine, which has “enhanced stealth, sophisticated surveillance capabilities and special warfare enhancements,” according to the Navy. The submarine was delivered from the shipbuilder to the Navy in December, and is now undergoing tests before being commissioned for active service, a Navy press release said. 
“The Engine Room, driven by a nuclear reactor pioneered at the Idaho National Laboratory, is the heart of the USS Idaho — further signifying Kempthorne’s integral role in the project,” Risch’s press release said.  
The commanding officer, Guillerault, wrote to Risch in a Jan. 6 letter that naming spaces aboard Navy submarines isn’t unusual, but that they are usually named for cities or locations, not people. 
“Governor Kempthorne has been intrinsically involved and a true advocate for our ship since
the day Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced the naming of USS IDAHO on August
23rd, 2015,” Guillerault wrote. “The drive he demonstrated as the 30th governor of Idaho propelling the state forward in technology and conservation, is the same drive and enthusiasm he has demonstrated in support of USS IDAHO. Therefore, I am pleased to inform you that we will be naming the USS IDAHO’s Engine Room in honor of Governor Kempthorne.”

,DC,2026-01-14 21:23:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Abortion pill safety review at FDA targeted by frustrated Republicans, advocates",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-safety-review-fda-targeted-frustrated-republicans-advocates,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans on a key U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday called on the Food and Drug Administration to wrap up its ongoing safety review of medication abortion and pressed for the Trump administration to once again require in-person dispensing.Democrats on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee argued women, not politicians, are in the best position to determine whether to ask for a prescription for mifepristone. Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chairman of the panel, said he hopes FDA Commissioner Marty Makary will agree to testify before the committee on the process in the future, though he didn’t set a deadline.  “At an absolute minimum, the previous in-person safeguards should be restored and it should be done immediately,” Cassidy said. Republicans and anti-abortion organizations have become increasingly skeptical about the FDA’s review after news broke in December that Makary wanted to delay its release until after the November midterm elections. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray questioned Cassidy’s reasons for holding the hearing, saying more than “160 high-quality studies have been conducted and millions of women around the world use mifepristone safely every year with fewer complications, by the way, than Viagra or penicillin.” Supreme Court caseAccess to mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, which is FDA-approved for up to 10 weeks gestation, surged to the forefront after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. Many Republican state legislatures have moved to bar access to mifepristone for abortions, while Democratic states have enacted shield laws to protect health care providers who prescribe and ship it to people in states with limited or no access. Dr. Nisha Verma, a fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health in Atlanta, testified before the committee that “the science on mifepristone’s safety and effectiveness is long-standing and settled.”“Over the past 25 years, medication abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol has been rigorously studied and proven safe and effective in over 100 high-quality, peer-reviewed studies,” Verma said. ""Extensive data show that medication abortion through telehealth is equally safe and effective and provides vital access for those who live in rural areas and in the growing number of maternity care deserts in the country.”Verma contended the likely reason for the hearing was not genuine concern from Republicans about the safety and efficacy of mifepristone but “because people in this room feel uncomfortable with abortion.”“And that's okay, and we can talk about that,” Verma said. “And we can have an honest conversation about that and complexity and the reasons that my patients need abortion care. But we should not pretend that this is an issue of the science.”Louisiana attorney general testifiesLouisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill, a Republican, criticized the FDA’s decision during the Biden administration to allow prescriptions via telehealth and for the pharmaceuticals to be shipped, sometimes into states that bar their use. “Shield laws in some states protect providers from liability and effectively nullify laws in other states,” Murrill said. “Their purpose is to make it more difficult to sue or prosecute individuals in those states.”Indiana Republican Sen. Jim Banks expressed frustration that FDA Commissioner Makary was not among the witnesses testifying at the hearing and urged the agency to release the results of its review of mifepristone quickly. “I'm disappointed that the FDA under Dr. Makary’s leadership hasn't moved faster to restore the in-person dispensing requirement and strengthen the (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies) program for mifepristone,” Banks said. “I hope the rumors are false, some of them are in print, that the agency is intentionally slow-walking its study on mifepristone health risks.”Emily G. Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, wrote in a statement the department “is conducting a study of reported adverse events associated with mifepristone to assess whether the FDA’s risk mitigation program continues to provide appropriate protections for women.”“The FDA’s scientific review process is thorough and takes the time necessary to ensure decisions are grounded in gold-standard science,” Hilliard wrote. “Dr. Makary is upholding that standard as part of the Department’s commitment to rigorous, evidence-based review.”Cassidy said after Banks raised his concerns that he hopes to have Makary testify “before the committee very soon and we've been speaking with the FDA to facilitate discussion on this and other issues.”Cassidy added that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “did promise to come back and we have requested that he come back and testify.” Republicans, Family Research Council urge action by FDADuring a press conference after the hearing, Cassidy joined a handful of other GOP lawmakers and Family Research Council President Tony Perkins to further press the Trump administration to change the prescription guidelines for mifepristone. Perkins said the Trump administration could change FDA guidelines around how mifepristone is prescribed and distributed “overnight” if it wanted to. He also said it should immediately begin enforcing The Comstock Act, an 1873 law that could block shipping medication abortion.“This is a two-step solution. One, is the in-person requirement being reestablished, the medical examinations to ensure that the women, their lives, are not put at risk,” Perkins said. “But then also ... simply enforcing the law as it pertains to Comstock.”",,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

Phil Murphy’s administration moved to take over Lakewood’s school district Wednesday, arguing that a slew of governance issues had deprived students there of the thorough education entitled to them by the state’s constitution.
In an order to show cause, the Department of Education said the township had failed to root out “pervasive, endemic educational and operational failures” first flagged more than 15 years ago and had continued to mismanage its resources at the cost of its students.
“For more than a decade, the New Jersey Department of Education has been working with the Lakewood Township School District to address ongoing fiscal and operational concerns that impact students, staff, parents, and the entire Lakewood community,” said Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer. “For all of those impacted, most especially the students of Lakewood, we are obligated to intervene.”
The bid for a state takeover was first reported by the New Jersey Globe.
Lakewood, home to about 142,000 residents, is perhaps the most unique school district in New Jersey. Only 4,112 students were enrolled in October 2024, according to state data, compared to more than 50,000 who attended private religious schools, called yeshivas.
As a result, the district has spent heavily on transportation, special education, and other aid to its non-public schools, and that spending has built massive deficits into the district’s budget over time.
The district’s budget for the 2025-2026 school year includes a loan of about $100 million from the state. That followed nearly $200 million in loans over the prior two school years.
Sen. Bob Singer (R-Ocean), a Lakewood resident who has represented the township in the Legislature for 40 years, acknowledged the district’s issues but said it is too early to determine whether a state takeover could resolve them.
“We realize there’s been problems with the schools. We realize there’s been a shortfall of money, and we have to wait and see what the state does when they take it over,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
If the State Board of Education approves the takeover, the state would appoint a new superintendent and business administrator, along with other professionals to oversee governance, fiscal management, and operations, including services for non-public students.
The township’s elected school board would remain in place in an advisory capacity and would gain new members appointed by the education commissioner.
A state intervention plan released alongside Wednesday’s court filing calls for the district and department to draft an improvement plan for the commissioner’s approval within six months of the full state takeover, though the intervention is likely to last far longer.
The state’s intervention in Newark’s public school system lasted 25 years before full control was returned to local officials.
Some Lakewood residents have previously charged that the state’s school funding formula is responsible for the district’s funding woes, though an appeals court ruling denied those claims in September, finding mismanagement, a failure to raise local taxes, and heavy spending on transportation and special education were clearer causes.
The takeover’s timing — initiated just six days before Gov. Phil Murphy leaves office — raised some questions about continuity. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office Tuesday, has not announced whether she will renominate Dehmer or replace him.
Singer said Dehmer told him this would be a yearlong process.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, and I’d like to have the continuity of knowing the person I’m dealing with is the person who can be there from the beginning to the end,” he said.

The governor is proposing to use the annual budget tuneup as a vehicle for a proposal to use surplus revenue to blunt this year’s projected property tax increase.

MONTPELIER — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott wants to use the state’s annual midyear budget tuneup to set aside $75 million for property tax relief. But legislative leaders said they would rather hold on to that money, at least for the time being.
“It’s just not appropriate to be doing it at this point in time,” said Rep. Robin Scheu, D-Middlebury, who chairs the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee.
At issue is how lawmakers will contend with the nearly 12% average increase in property taxes projected this year across the state. To blunt that expected hike, Scott wants to include about $75 million in this year’s legislative effort to true-up spending halfway through the current fiscal year, which is called the Budget Adjustment Act.
The money would come from additional revenue Vermont has brought in that lawmakers didn’t know they’d have access to when they were building a budget for the current year, which governs spending from July 2025 to June 2026. Lawmakers enacted the current state budget in May 2025.
For leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees, though, it’s too early in the year’s legislative session — which started last week — to fence off that surplus. The “budget adjustment” is often one of the first bills lawmakers take up each year, though its passage is not a guarantee.
Instead, the committee chairs want the property tax buydown proposal to be part of negotiations over the new budget for the upcoming fiscal year. They said waiting would allow them to weigh the plan in a fuller context of state revenue needs and pressures; to be sure, it could also be a useful bargaining tool in negotiations with Scott’s administration. 
“We’re going to make a decision as part of the full budget,” Scheu said in an interview Tuesday.
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, said he needs to see what progress, if any, the Legislature makes toward advancing key provisions of last year’s sweeping education reform law, Act 73, before deciding whether to use the $75 million to reduce the property tax burden. The Senate Appropriations chair said he’s not sure at this point whether that is the right amount of money to spend on that purpose, either.
About half of the projected 12% tax hike would come from an expected jump in school spending, though districts are still in the process of formulating their budgets for the 2026-27 school year. The other half of the looming spike is the result of a fiscal hole left by lawmakers’ decision to use about $100 million to buy down property taxes in 2025.
Perchlik said the $75 million could also be used to respond to federal funding changes. The extent to which lawmakers can balance affordability concerns in the state with cuts from Washington, D.C., is likely to drive policy debate in the Statehouse this year. 
“We’re not saying we’re against that,” he said of the buydown plan. However, “we want to see the whole education plan. We also want to see what all the other needs are.”
For their proposed version of the budget adjustment legislation, House and Senate leaders are also weighing whether to spend additional money to support public housing authorities that administer federal Section 8 housing vouchers. Many of those providers are entering 2026 “in pretty precarious fiscal condition,” James Duffy, an analyst with the Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Office, told the House Appropriations panel on Tuesday.
That’s in part because the organizations are staring down uncertain federal support from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Duffy said, in addition to other challenges. Vermont’s House General and Housing Committee is slated to take testimony on the need for some additional funding Thursday.
Prison spending racks up
Scott’s budget adjustment proposal includes a number of other changes to state spending on human services, some of which are also driven by federal cuts. 
That includes directing about $1 million to Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Tracy O’Connell, chief financial officer for the Vermont Agency of Human Services, said that money would make sure Planned Parenthood could continue serving some 16,000 patients in the state after the tax and domestic policy bill Trump signed last July ordered a one-year moratorium on Medicaid reimbursements for the organization.
Scott’s proposal also includes $25,000 for the Vermont Human Rights Commission to fill an expected lapse in funding from the Housing and Urban Development Department. Big Hartman, the commission’s executive director and general counsel, said the federal money has long supported a joint federal and state program that investigates housing discrimination complaints.
Vermont’s rising prison population is also driving up costs. The Scott administration has recommended a roughly $4.5 million increase in funding for Wellpath, the private-equity-owned contractor that provides health care in state correctional facilities. The increase is tied to an uptick in the state’s average daily prison population.
Meanwhile, the plan includes about $390,000 to cover the costs of sending about 30 people incarcerated in Vermont to the private prison the state uses in Mississippi, Jon Murad, the corrections commissioner, told Senate Appropriations on Tuesday.
There is also $225,000 to cover the costs of corrections staff being put up at hotels when there is such little time between their shifts that “it makes little sense” for them to travel home in between them, said Adam Greshin, Scott’s commissioner of finance and management, “even if they’ve just got a short drive.”
Scott’s budget adjustment proposal also includes $385,000 to outfit state office space in Waterbury, including in the new space the Scott administration leased ahead of the start of its return-to-office order in December. That new space, at Pilgrim Park, will be used by the Department of Vermont Health Access, according to Greshin.
The House and Senate appropriations committees are slated to continue taking testimony on those and other budget adjustment proposals this week.

(Florida Phoenix photo)Voters in Florida could have a chance to enshrine religious protections in schools in the Florida Constitution, the same protections already established in statute.
The measure, HJR 583, pitched as establishing a constant constitutional law as opposed to more-often-altered statutory law, passed the House Education Administration Subcommittee Wednesday. It has another committee date before heading to the full House.
Bill sponsor Rep. Chase Tramont, a Republican from Port Orange, called it “a very common-sense resolution.”
“All of this is in state statute right now, so it is current law. My argument would be that protecting religious liberty and expression is arguably the most necessary thing to do. Laws are constantly being shifted, repealed, amended, and all sorts of things that happen,” Tramont said during the first committee stop Wednesday.
Lawmakers are proposing language for voters to approve that would prohibit school districts from discriminating against students, parents, and school employees based on religious viewpoint.
“A school district shall treat a student’s voluntary expression of a religious viewpoint on an otherwise permissible subject in the same manner that the school district treats a student’s voluntary expression of a secular viewpoint,” it states in part.
Schools must allows religious expression in coursework, artwork, clothing, and prayer, as already protected under the 2017 Student and School Personnel Religious Liberties Act.
Tramont pointed out that the resolution does not mention any one religion and does include all faiths.
“That’s part of free speech — part of freedom of expression is the ability to be acceptance of all faiths,” Tramont said.
The resolution passed with one vote in opposition, Democratic Rep. Angie Nixon, who voiced concerns about how it could alter curriculum. She indicated a willingness to support the measure on the floor.
Devon Graham from American Atheists said the resolution is not necessary.
“The sponsors and supporters will say that nowhere in this bill is any specific religion mentioned, but this will just boost religious protections. This is not our first rodeo. This is all double speak that we’ve heard before,” Graham said during public comment.
Graham pointed to the 2021 measure that provides moment of silences in public schools, pitched initially as being a chance for self reflection and later lauded by the governor as a religious freedom measure and signed by him at a synagogue.
“Without supporting or discouraging student prayer, each public school must require teachers in first-period classrooms in all grades to set aside at least one minute, but not more than two minutes, daily for a moment of silence, during which a student may not interfere with other students’ participation,” the proposed amendment reads.
Graham also referenced DeSantis’ insistence that Satanists would not be permitted to participate in the school chaplain program passed in 2024 as “cherry-picking” religions.
SJR 1104, identical, has two committees to pass, too. It is sponsored by Sen. Ralph Massullo, a Republican from Lecanto.
For the joint resolution to be placed on the ballot, each chamber must approve it by a three-fifths vote.
The resolution, if passed, would be put on the ballot for the Nov. 3, 2026 election. It would require approval by at least 60% of voters to pass.
Of course, the U.S. Constitution provides religious protection, too. It requires teachers to remain neutral in treating religious matters in school.

(Volha Rahalskaya/Getty Images)Imagine starting the new year with the promise of at least a $147 million payout from the federal government.
But there are strings attached.
In late December, President Donald Trump’s administration announced how much all 50 states would get under its new Rural Health Transformation Program, assigning them to use the money to fix systemic problems that leave rural Americans without access to good health care. Now, the clock is ticking.
Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.
The money — divided into unique allocations for each state, ranging from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas — represents the first $10 billion installment from the five-year, $50 billion program. Congress created the fund as a last-minute sweetener in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer to offset the outsize fallout anticipated in rural communities from the statute’s nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade.
Feds award New Mexico $211.5 M for rural health funding

Federal officials crafted the fund to give states “space to be creative,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters after announcing the funding Dec. 29. “Some states will fail, and we will learn from that.”
The money was divided according to a complicated formula.
In 2026, each state will receive an equal $100 million share under the law for the first half of the money, plus additional funding from the second half. Oz’s staff steered payouts from the second portion based on each state’s rural score, as well as results from a “technical” scoring system for project proposals.
Within hours of the announcement, academics and researchers began to parse the awards to better understand why some states received more than others, including whether the awards reflected any partisanship or political favoritism.
At first glance, total awards do not appear to favor states governed by either Republicans or Democrats. But one academic data analysis teased out the amount awarded for each state’s technical score, which is the part determined by the discretion of agency officials.
The analysis was performed at the University of North Carolina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which specializes in rural health. A KFF Health News review of the Sheps Center data found that states with Republican governors tended to receive more money for the parts of their application based on the technical score. Democratic-controlled states crowded the bottom quarter of those technical score awards.
Overall, though, the state awards reveal wild variation in how much money each state will get per rural resident, almost a hundredfold difference between the top and bottom.
In an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic, a spokesperson for Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs accused the administration of shortchanging rural residents in the state, which was awarded $167 million this year from the program.
CMS spokesperson Chris Krepich said in an emailed statement to KFF Health News that “politics played no role in funding decisions.”
On the December call, Oz pushed states to start working on policy actions championed by the administration — such as approving presidential fitness tests and restricting food benefits — that could require legislative approval.
Half of states promised to mandate the presidential fitness test, Oz said. Many states also proposed food waivers under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which would limit low-nutrition items such as soda. He also said some states promised to teach health care professionals about nutrition. And others confirmed they will repeal certificate-of-need laws, which require companies to prove that new health facilities they want to open are necessary.
Krepich said CMS’ new Office of Rural Health Transformation is hiring program officers to serve as point people for three or four states. Many states are setting up their own offices to oversee the new funding.
Oz highlighted Alabama’s “big maternity initiative with robotics doing ultrasounds” and said states are tackling issues ranging from behavioral health to obesity.
A KFF Health News review of state “project abstracts” and “spotlights” released by CMS shows that many states plan to address the workforce challenges in rural areas. Delaware, for example, plans to use its funding to create the state’s first four-year medical school with a rural primary care track.
A third of states said they want to improve electronic health records, and every state mentioned telehealth.
Many state legislatures must pass laws to distribute the funding to their state offices. Meanwhile, state officials are hiring staff, organizing advisory committees, and preparing to dole out money.
“I’m excited about what’s next,” said Terry Scoggin, former interim chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, or TORCH. Texas was awarded the biggest allocation. The money will bolster a rural hospital funding bill Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year, Scoggin said.
More than two dozen cash-strapped rural hospitals in Texas have closed or been converted to clinics since 2005, a nationwide trend that hit the Lone Star State particularly hard. The state has the largest rural population in the United States. Texas’ allocation amounts to about $66 per rural resident, according to a KFF policy analysis. By contrast, Rhode Island was granted about $6,300 per rural resident.
Scoggin said he has “a ton of concerns” about companies taking the money instead of it helping rural hospitals and residents. “I was blown away about how many for-profit companies reached out.” The companies have also called rural hospitals and asked to work with them to apply for state money, he said.
The awards should be judged on how they benefit rural residents because “the stated goal of the program is to improve rural health,” said Paula Chatterjee, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored a Senate Finance Committee memo on the transformation fund.
Researchers at the Sheps Center conducted the analysis to estimate how much money states received from the technical score, which is the portion of funding based on the quality of their proposals and state policy actions that align with “Make America Healthy Again” priorities.
New Mexico won the least amount of technical funding, with less than 10% of its award based on the discretionary metrics. Alaska won the largest technical award, according to the Sheps Center data.
Texas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Hawaii rounded out the top five recipients of technical funding. In addition to New Mexico, the other lowest technical awards went to Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona, and California.
Mark Holmes, director of the Sheps Center, declined to comment on whether he saw any political bias in the awards but said the nuance in the final portion of discretionary awards based on technical scores is important because those dollars can be redistributed and potentially clawed back in future years.
“We can be fairly certain that every state will get at least a slightly, if not a vastly, different amount next year based on this re-pooling and reallocation piece,” Holmes said.
States now have a limited time to show they’re using the money effectively to secure future funding.
But they can’t start spending yet. CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said.
States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.
“CMS is working closely with states to complete this process as efficiently as possible,” Krepich said.

(Photo: AYA House)AYA House, a nonprofit organization that provides transitional housing and supportive services for people recovering from substance dependence or transitioning from incarceration, will open its first location in Rowan County on Friday, Jan. 16.
The program will serve adult men transitioning from jail or prison in Vaya Health’s easternmost counties, which include Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, Franklin, Granville, Person, Rockingham, Rowan, Stokes and Vance.
Vaya Health provides and manages health services for people with mental health, substance use and intellectual/developmental disabilities. It partnered with AYA House to provide reentry employment services in the counties it serves after the NC Department of Health and Human Services awarded it $1.5 million from a federal Expanding Supports for Justice Involved Adults-Community Based Initiatives grant.
Dennis Brown, executive director of AYA House, says programs like this are essential to setting previously incarcerated people on the right path after they return home. Brown, who was previously incarcerated, said housing is a huge barrier for people who are released from prison.
“A lot of us that got caught up in the justice system, we have lost family, we have lost the connection to a lot of families, and some of us do not want to go back to our own communities,” Brown said. “Providing these kind of services and not just providing a bed or a home, but providing service along with it, a support team to go along with it, makes a big difference.”
Brown said the Rowan County program will start with five clients, and then “we’ll go from there.” Two houses will be used for the program, Brown said. One will serve as a residence for clients and the other as an “employment lab,” he said.
AYA House already operates six diversion and reentry locations in neighboring Cabarrus County. It provides wraparound support and services, including employment and education services designed to build long-term stability and independence.
In Cabarrus, Brown said AYA House has partnered with Rowan-Cabarrus Community College, which provides scholarships for clients to earn certification in logistics, manufacturing, welding and other skilled professions.
“After that, we help them get into a career, not just a job, but a career,” Brown said. “By doing that, it sets them on a different path to make a livable wage, and you can see ahead of you and not just look down on the ground like we usually do.”

After a close vote and before contested ballots were adjudicated, members of the ski safety crew ended the initiative.
The post Jackson Hole Ski Patrol withdraws union push appeared first on WyoFile .","The Jackson Hole Ski Patrol has backed out of plans to form a union.
The patrol has withdrawn its petition to form the union, which it had filed with the National Labor Relations Board, according to the federal agency’s website.
The website posting marks the end of an effort by the patrol to form a collective bargaining group to negotiate with the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort over wages and other employment issues. The labor board posted the notice Wednesday morning and reclassified the case as “closed.”
After the ski patrol withdrew the petition on Jan. 9, the board issued an order Wednesday that apparently resolved the case.
The labor board organized an election, held Jan. 7-8, that resulted in a 42-32 vote against unionization. Another 16 ballots were contested among those cast by the 90 voters who were potentially eligible, the NLRB said.
“The owners stepped up.” Anonymous ski patroller
Those contested ballots in the secret election could have tipped the balance one way or the other. The labor board was set to rule on the admissibility of the contested ballots and adjust the vote count before the ski patrol withdrew its petition.
The NLRB listed the reason the case was closed as “Withdrawal Non-adjusted.”
The contested votes were in doubt because of the positions held by those who cast them. Some voters could have been supervisors, could have held other positions deemed ineligible for voting, or could have been challenged for other reasons.
The close vote suggests that talks between Jackson Hole Mountain Resort officials and ski patrollers bore fruit in convincing some patrollers that matters over a living wage, insurance and other things could best be resolved without collective bargaining as a union. Most of the patrol signed a petition seeking the election — so the vote didn’t closely follow that initial indication of union support.
As the issue developed over the fall, younger patrollers favored unionization compared to veterans, a patroller who spoke on the condition of anonymity said. The patroller who spoke with WyoFile said he did not want to be harassed for public statements.
The patroller was an older employee who had a good off-season income and secure housing and didn’t expect to be paid a “living wage.” That underscored the age divide in the group, he suggested, with younger workers favoring collective bargaining.
But the resort owners met with ski patrollers to explain how they would change things, the patroller said. Federal laws limit what employers can say during such election periods and prohibit them from threatening jobs, promising promotions, campaigning at mandatory staff meetings close to the election and other similar things.
Nevertheless, “the owners stepped up,” the patroller said, giving every employee an opportunity to talk with company representatives. “They apologized for some meetings last spring,” when relationships went south.
An all-team meeting with owners before the vote was “really good,” the patroller said and showed “these guys are making themselves available.”
Also, following withdrawal of a petition, the effort to unionize could be resurrected in six months, the ’troller said. That could give patrollers an opportunity, if the mountain resort management doesn’t satisfy the corps, to revisit unionization.
The Jackson Hole vote stirred interest in part because of a ski patrol strike in Telluride, Colorado, where the walkout shut down most of the mountain for nearly two weeks. Conflicts between the Telluride crew and the resort owner differed from the Jackson Hole situation, the Wyoming patroller said.
“I trust these guys,” the patroller said of the new Jackson Hole Mountain Resort owners. Mountain resort board members Eric Macy, Mike Corbat, their families and a small, select group of co-investors now own and run the Wyoming landmark ski area on the Bridger-Teton National Forest above Teton Village.
Some fret about putting the well-being of an entire community in the hands of 90 ski patrollers who could strike and bring the winter economy to a standstill. A strike would “hurt this town so much,” the patroller said.
Ski patrollers posted Friday on Instagram that they were no longer unionizing.
“After a vote, we have chosen as a team not to unionize at this time,” the post read. “The petition and vote have created space for dialogue and to give new ownership the opportunity to listen and respond.”
A mountain resort official said Monday that the final outcome “is pending due to challenged ballots and procedural matters.” Those are now resolved.
Ski patrollers thanked the community via Instagram “for the overwhelming support,” and said, “we’ll see you on the hill.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A group of GOP senators want to amend the Kansas Constitution to establish an annual cap on a home’s taxable assessed value, but opinions are split on whether it will provide real relief.
The proposal, called the Cap Assessed Valuation Protection amendment, confines a county appraiser’s annual home value assessments to a 3% increase or less compared to the previous year’s assessed value.
However, the proposal does not change a local taxing entity’s ability to impose mill levy increases or decreases.
Proponents said during committee hearings Tuesday and Wednesday the resolution will produce lower residential property taxes. Opponents said the resolution, as written, is likely to shift the tax burden to other property types, such as agricultural land, and create an illusion of residential property tax relief.
“As it stands today, there is a lot of finger-pointing, and I will say nobody’s wrong and everybody’s wrong at the same time,” said Maddie Bouton, deputy administrator for the city of Basehor.
Some people could see a lower property tax amount with a cap in place compared to previous years. But because local governments still retain the authority to set tax rates, lower property taxes are not a given.











Despite differing opinions on the potential outcomes of the cap, nearly everyone agreed on one thing: Property taxes are a problem.











Bouton said property tax is a local issue and that the state should hand it back to local governments.
Under the proposed amendment, property owners would be taxed based on the assessed value, as determined by law, or the capped assessed value — whichever is less. The proposal is a cap on increases. It does not apply if values decrease or increase below 3%, and certain conditions apply, including if new construction or home improvements occur on the property.
Republican Sen. Caryn Tyson, a software engineer from Parker and chair of the Senate tax committee, was an advocate for the proposal, challenging opponents to explain how it would not benefit taxpayers. She said the proposal has been years in the making. It is co-sponsored by 15 Republican senators. If approved by a two-thirds majority in both chambers and by a majority of voters in a special election on Aug. 4, 2026, the cap would go into effect in January 2027.
Legislators have repeatedly described property tax relief as a major policy deliverable for their constituents. The Legislature during the 2025 session nixed a combined 1.5 mills that funded the Kansas educational building and state institutional building funds. Tyson promised more tax relief efforts as the 2026 session progresses.
Establishing a constitutional amendment capping final taxable assessed value increases would be among the most substantial in a string of tax legislation in recent years.
Sean Miller, a lobbyist for the Kansas Building Industry Association, testified Wednesday the resolution does not actually reduce taxes.
Taxable assessed valuation is one of many variables, he said, and without a corresponding cap on taxing entities’ budgets or mill levies, the resolution only shifts around those variables.
He called it a “confusing, if not artificial, cap.”
The resolution also incentivizes staying in one’s home, preventing downsizing and the natural churn of movement from housing types as people’s life circumstances change, which is a necessary part of the real estate market, Miller said.
There were differing opinions on how the agriculture community viewed the bill. Eric Estes of the Kansas Deere Dealers Association argued a 3% cap would be good for farm and agriculture operators, which he backed up by presenting 20 years’ worth of projections, applying Oklahoma’s 3% cap. The data from the Kansas Policy Institute, which was not verified by the committee or Kansas Reflector, showed farm and agriculture operators could have saved $1 billion in taxes over 10 years.
Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said its members continue to oppose a valuation cap. The topic has been on association agendas at roundtables, meetings and conventions since the fall of 2024.
Teagarden and association members worry establishing a cap will shift the tax burden to agricultural property owners, resulting in them paying more for land, home improvements, commercial property and vehicles.
“We support property tax relief and stand ready to provide solutions that actually provide that property tax relief,” he said.
Many of the same associations, organizations and figures testified Tuesday and Wednesday as in January 2024. Lobbyists for the Kansas Farm Bureau and the Kansas Association of School Boards returned to express opposition. Lanell Griffith, a Topeka resident and chair of the Shawnee County Republican Party, and Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican, voiced their support.
Mark Tomb, vice president of governmental affairs for the Kansas Realtors Association, also opposed the resolution, worrying a cap could pressure local governments into raising their budgets. He favored voter-driven constraints on local entities and levies.
Republican Sen. Tim Shallenburger, a longtime politician from Baxter Springs, pushed back.
Legislators represent the people, he said.
“The people who aren’t here are grandma,” he said, referencing an earlier mention of an elderly widow paying more in property taxes than she could afford.
He said the cap may mean real estate agents lose commissions, or tax burdens could shift to agricultural land.
“But we’re here for the people, and the homeowners we go and see when we knock on doors (say), ‘Can you do something about the property taxes?’ ”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100102-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

Nearly two dozen people are hoping to become the next member of Congress to represent northwest Georgia.
Voters in Georgia’s 14th District – which includes Catoosa, Chattooga, Dade, Floyd, Murray, Paulding, Polk, Walker and Whitfield counties and portions of Cobb County – will head to the polls starting on Monday, Feb. 16 when early voting kicks off.
The three-day candidate qualifying period ended Wednesday afternoon.
All of the candidates will appear on the same ballot regardless of party, and 17 Republicans, three Democrats, one Libertarian and one independent have qualified, according to the secretary of state’s office.
Election Day is set for March 10, and if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, which is likely with so many names on the ballot, a runoff between the top two candidates is scheduled for April 7.
The district is considered the most likely in the state to favor a Republican, according to the Cook Political Report. It was previously represented by firebrand conservative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene resigned earlier this month after publicly feuding with President Donald Trump over matters including health insurance subsidies, Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza and the release of the Epstein files.
The winner will only earn the right to serve out the rest of Greene’s term and will have to prepare immediately for a primary in May and a general election in November.

(Photo courtesy of Utah Valley University)Utah Valley University President Astrid Tuminez announced Wednesday she will step down from her role on May 1 after more than seven years, the last of which was marked by tragedy.
The announcement comes after Tuminez experienced a rough 2025 marked by her husband Jeffrey Tolk’s sudden death in February and the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at the university’s campus in September. 
She said Wednesday she’s resigning to devote more time to her family and personal pursuits.

“UVU has been a labor of love for me. The university’s call to ‘come as you are’ recognizes and cultivates human potential in bold ways that traditional institutions may overlook,” Tuminez said in a news release. “Education transformed my life from the slums of the Philippines to a global adventure, and I brought that conviction to UVU. My heart will always be green.”
Tuminez led UVU since the fall of 2018, making history as the first woman to serve as a full-time president at Utah’s largest university. As a student, transferred from the University of the Philippines to Brigham Young University, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in international relations and Russian literature. Tuminez also has a master’s degree in Soviet studies from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“President Tuminez has been a deeply thoughtful leader who has consistently championed student success,” Utah System of Higher Education Commissioner Geoffrey Landward said in a statement. “We are grateful for her leadership and will work closely with the board and the university to ensure a smooth and well-supported transition.” 
A highlight of Tuminez’s tenure is Vision 2030, according to the university, a 10-year plan to better support students, community and workforce. 
The Utah Board of Higher Education is now establishing a presidential transition team with representatives from the board, the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education, and UVU trustees who will oversee the new leadership search process over the next several months, the university said in the release. 
The presidential transition team will continue working through the first six months of the new president’s tenure, as part of a new presidential search model, the university added. That would extend their support beyond the hiring process.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Dear Denmark,
It’s been a while. Cold and wet over there, huh? Same here, plus a fair bit of snow and lots of ICE.
Just wanted to write you a quick note to tell you that we know how you feel.
We’ve been hearing a lot lately about how confused you are. President Donald Trump — the leader of the United States, one of your staunchest allies — wants you to sell us, or just give us, Greenland. If you don’t, he’s threatening to seize it by force.
What’s so senseless about it is that the United States already has a treaty with you where we can already pretty much do what we want in Greenland. Crazy, huh?
Both you and the Greenlanders seem to have little say in the matter. That such an action might even break up the 76-year-old NATO alliance seems to make no difference. If it wasn’t so scary, it would be absurd.
Vladimir Putin must be so happy right now.
Anyways, I thought I would write this note to let you know we here in Minnesota are pretty confused too. We’re part of the United States, but we’re being treated like we’re not. Kind of like how the U.S. has an alliance with you but is acting as though it doesn’t.
Trump seems really angry with Minnesota right now. To be sure, we’ve had some issues here. He decided to cut off millions of federal dollars already budgeted to support small business owners and farmers and child care centers in our state. It’s pretty bad. In fact, he’s says he’s going to cut off all federal funding to the entire state starting next month.
But it gets worse! Trump has suggested Minnesota will see “a day of reckoning and retribution.” We already have hundreds of heavily armed federal agents swarming over the state. They’re dragging people out of cars based on how they look or how they talk; going door-to-door with guns (but without warrants); detaining people during raids on our schools and hospitals; and even shooting and killing people in the street!
It’s wild! I mean, we’re one of the fifty United States. It’s like Trump doesn’t want Minnesota to be part of the country anymore. He is treating us even worse than he’s treating you — which is pretty bad. And we’re Americans! Nearly half of Minnesotans voted for him last fall!
Just like you, we are standing our ground. But it’s scary and weird, right?
Please know that you are not alone.
Yours truly,
Minnesota",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Immigrant rights groups are condemning a move by Kenosha County Sheriff David Zoerner to join the federal 287(g) program, a cooperation agreement between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration enforcement. Although Zoerner previously distanced his office from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on Monday he announced that an agreement had been signed with the federal agency back mid-December.
Just a couple of months before joining the 287(g) program, Zoerner questioned whether the program would benefit Kenosha County taxpayers. “This is a rapidly evolving program,” Zoerner told TMJ4. “We are monitoring it to ensure that our participation would ultimately be in the best interest of the taxpayers of Kenosha County.” At the time of the interview, the sheriff’s office did not cooperate with ICE beyond honoring immigration detainers for people held in the Kenosha County jail. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera condemned Zoerner’s policy shift. “As an elected official, Sheriff Zoerner took an oath to defend the Constitution and ensure community safety,” Voces’ executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz said in a statement. “Instead, he has broken promises behind closed doors and sacrificed the public trust for political expediency. It is the height of irresponsibility for Sheriff Zoerner to deputize his officers as ICE agents in a city that already experienced the tragic shooting of Jacob Blake and the community outrage that sparked massive protests, unrest, and the tragic death of two young protesters in 2020.” 
Neumann-Ortiz said that Zoerner’s decision “only heightens the risk to the community of harm by the militarized tactics of ICE.” 
In a statement issued Monday, Zoerner walked back his  previous caution about cooperating with ICE.
Zoerner said that “for well over a year” he has been working with ICE and other sheriffs “to bring the 287(g) to Kenosha County.” Saying that “this is not a new idea, and this is not reactionary,” Zoerner said that joining the program “is the result of deliberate, responsible planning focused on one mission: protecting the people of Kenosha County.” 
The sheriff pushed back against what he called “misinformation” about the issue and asserted that this office “works closely and consistently with our federal law enforcement partners.” He added,  “I will not tolerate the release of violent criminal offenders back into our community. Period. As Sheriff, I use every lawful tool at my disposal to protect citizens.” Zoerner noted that he currently serves on the Border Security Committee for the National Sheriffs Association, and that he’s undergone border security training and observed enforcement operations along the southern border in Texas and Arizona. 
Zoerner said that he signed a 287(g) agreement under a jail enforcement model. The agreement was signed by ICE and sent back to the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Office on Jan. 12. “We have already selected staff for this program and are actively moving forward with implementation,” Zoerner said in a statement, adding that the program “applies only to individuals who are already lawfully in custody for serious criminal offenses.”
Kenosha County’s 287(g) program, Zoerner said, will focus on people arrested for violent crimes, felony drug charges, repeat offenders, or those with histories of assault, sexual violence and other serious crimes. “These are people who pose a demonstrated threat to public safety,” said Zoerner. “This agreement ensures they are not released back into our community.” 
ICE cooperation a campaign issue
On Jan. 7, five days before Zoerner’s announcement, James Beller declared that he will challenge  Zoerner in the upcoming election for sheriff. Beller is currently a Kenosha police captain, and said that if elected he would move forward with joining the ICE 287 (g) program. 
Beller pitched the program as focusing only on serious criminal offenses, using the same language  Zoerner used to describe the deal he struck with the federal government. “This is about public safety and accountability,” Beller said in a press release. “The focus will be on serious offenders already in custody, implemented professionally, lawfully, and consistent with our responsibility to keep the community safe.” 
Those reassurances did not assuage  the concerns of people worried about the effects of ICE surges in Chicago and Minneapolis, where violent clashes with residents have made headlines and U.S. citizen Renee Good was shot and killed last week. 
There are currently 13 law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin with 287(g) programs, all of them sheriff’s offices. “This has to end,” said Nuemann-Ortiz. “We stand with Kenosha families in calling for an end to 287(g) in Kenosha.”

Simpson  is set to be the first person executed by Oklahoma this year.
Simpson, 45, who relocated to Oklahoma City following Hurricane Katrina 2005, said he was young, traumatized, ignorant and compelled by paranoia when he in 2005 fired about 20 rounds from an assault-style rifle into a Caprice carrying Glen Palmer, Anthony Jones, 19, and Johnson. Palmer and Jones were killed.
The murders followed an altercation at a club.
Prior to the murders, Simpson was incarcerated for an armed home invasion robbery in which he shot a business owner, who survived.
Simpson’s attorneys argued he suffered from a traumatized upbringing that included drugs and violence and childhood sexual assault. He  was also a victim of a drive-by-shooting, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and paranoia when he arrived in Oklahoma City, they said.
Johnson, the survivor who is now the father of six children, said “part of me died in that car as well. Those were my best friends.”
He said he has had sleepless nights going over the images of his friends “bleeding out” in the car.
“This ruthless and violent killer hunted and executed his victims without remorse,” said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “I commend the Pardon and Parole Board for rejecting clemency today.”

Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office is looking into whether a new AI image editing tool from Elon Musk’s company violates California law.


California Attorney General Rob Bonta today announced an investigation into how and whether Elon Musk’s X and xAI broke the law in the past few weeks by enabling the spread of naked or sexual imagery without consent.
xAI reportedly updated its Grok artificial intelligence tool last month to allow image editing. Users on the social media platform X, which is connected to the tool, began using Grok to remove clothing in pictures of women and children.
“The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,” Bonta said in a written statement. “This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.”
Bonta urged Californians who want to report depictions of them or their children undressed or commiting sexual acts to visit oag.ca.gov/report.
Research obtained by Bloomberg found that X now produces more non-consensual naked or sexual imagery than any other website online. In a posting on X, Musk promised “consequences” for people who made illegal content with the tool. On Friday, Grok limited image editing to paying subscribers.
One potential route for Bonta to prosecute xAI is a law that went into effect just two weeks ago creating legal liability for the creation and distribution of “deepfake” pornography.
 X and xAI appear to be violating the provisions of that law, known as AB 621, said Sam Dordulian, who previously worked in the sex crimes unit of the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office but today works as a lawyer for people in cases involving deepfakes or revenge porn in private practice.
Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, author of the law, told CalMatters in a statement last week that she reached out to prosecutors, including the attorney general’s office and the city attorney of San Francisco, to remind them that they can act under the law. What’s happening on X, Bauer-Kahan said, is what AB 621 was designed to address. 
“Real women are having their images manipulated without consent, and the psychological and reputational harm is devastating,” the San Ramon Democrat said in an emailed statement. “Underage children are having their images used to create child sexual abuse material, and these websites are knowingly facilitating it.”
Bonta’s inquiry also comes shortly after a call for an investigation by Gov. Gavin Newsom, backlash from regulators in the European Union and India and X bans in Malaysia, Indonesia, and potentially the United Kingdom. As Grok app downloads rise in Apple and Google app stores, X is facing calls by lawmakers and advocates to ban downloads.
Why Grok created the feature the way it did and how it will respond to the controversy around it is unclear, and answers may not be forthcoming, since an analysis recently concluded that it’s the least transparent of major AI systems available today. xAI did not address questions about the investigation from CalMatters. 
“The psychological and reputational harm is devastating.”Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, Democratic Assemblymember, San Ramon
Evidence of concrete harm from deepfakes is piling up. In 2024, the FBI warned that use of deepfake tools to extort young people is a growing problem that has led to instances of self harm and suicide. Multiple audits have found that child sexual abuse material is inside the training data of AI models, making them capable of geneating vulgar photos. A 2024 Center for Democracy and Technology survey found that 15 percent of high school students have heard of or seen sexually explicit imagery of someone they know at school in the past year.
The investigation announced today is the latest action by the attorney general to push AI companies to keep kids safe. Late last year, Bonta endorsed a bill that would have prevented chatbots that talk about self harm and engage in sexually explicit conversations  from interacting with people under 18. He also joined attorneys general from 44 other states in sending a letter that questions why companies like Meta and OpenAI allow their chatbots to have sexually inappropriate conversations with minors.
California has passed roughly half a dozen laws since 2019 to protect people from deepfakes. The latest, Assembly Bill 621, amends and strengthens a 2019 law, most significantly by allowing district attorneys to bring cases against companies that “recklessly aid and abet” the distribution of deepfakes without the consent of the person depicted nude or committing sexual acts. That means the average person can ask the state Attorney General or the district attorney where they live to file a case on their behalf. It also increases the maximum amount that a judge can award a person from $150,000 to $250,000. Under the law, a public prosecutor is not required to prove that an individual depictured in an AI generated nude or sexual image suffered actual harm to bring a case to court. Websites who refuse to comply within 30 days can face penalties of $25,000 per violation.
In addition to those laws, two bills (AB 1831 and SB 1381) signed into law in 2024 expand the state’s definition of child pornography to make possession or distribution of artificially-generated child sexual abuse material illegal. Another required social media platforms to give people an easy way to request the immediate removal of a deepfake, and defines the posting of such material as a form of digital identity theft. A California law limiting the use of deepfakes in elections was signed into law last year but was struck down by a federal judge last summer following a lawsuit by X and Elon Musk. 
Every new state law helps give lawyers like Dordulian a new avenue to address harmful uses of deepfakes, but he said people still need new laws to protect themselves. He said his clients face challenges proving violation of existing laws since they require distribution of explicit materials, for example with a messaging app or social media platform, for protections to kick in. In his experience, people who use nudify apps typically know each other, so distribution doesn’t always take place, and if it does, it can be hard to prove.
For example, he said, he has a client who works as a nanny who alleges that the father of the kids she takes care of made images of her using photos she posted on Instagram. The nanny found the images on his iPad. This discovery was disturbing for her and caused her emotional trauma, but since he can’t use deepfake laws he has to sue on the basis of negligence or emotional distress and laws that were never created to address deepfakes. Similarly, victims told CNBC last year that the distinction between creating and distributing deepfakes left a gap in the law in a number of U.S. states.
“The law needs to keep up with what’s really happening on the ground and what women are experiencing, which is just the simple act of creation itself is the problem,” Dordulian said.
California is at the forefront of passing laws to protect people from deepfakes, but existing law isn’t meeting the moment, said Jennifer Gibson, cofounder and director of Psst, a group created a little over a year ago that provides pro bono legal services to tech and AI workers interested in whistleblowing. A California law that went into effect January 1 protects whistleblowers inside AI companies but only if they work on catastrophic risk that can kill more than 50 people or cause more than $1 billion in damages. If the law protected people who work on deepfakes, former X employees who detailed witnessing Grok generating illegal sexually explicit material last year to Business Insider would, Gibson said, have had protections if they  shared the information with authorities.
“There needs to be a lot more protection for exactly this kind of scenario in which an insider sees that this is foreseeable, knows that this is going to happen, and they need somewhere to go to report to both to keep the company accountable and protect the public.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/072823-X-Former-Twitter-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

At more than $6.50 a pound, a 300% increase since 2010, the high average cost of ground beef — long a protein staple for time- and cash-strapped families — is straining grocery budgets. 
At just under $32,000 a year to place an infant and 4-year-old in center-based child care, the cost of early care and education in New Hampshire is leaving families in an impossible situation: Parents can’t afford to work, and of course they can’t afford not to.
At $40,000 a year, the high price for an in-state student to attend the University of New Hampshire is leaving local kids in a financial hole before their adult lives even begin. What kind of spending power can this state realistically expect from Gen Z 10 or 20 years after graduation, that is if they even stick around, when they’re carrying so much debt? 
At an annual average worker contribution of nearly $7,000 for an employer-sponsored family health care plan, the rising cost of insurance coverage has become an anticipated yearly pay cut for American workers. 
At $535,000, the median price for a home in New Hampshire is unaffordable for all but 15% of the state’s population.
But as far as Gov. Kelly Ayotte is concerned, everything is groovy.
“Our state remains the envy of the nation,” she said in a statement Friday. “No. 1 for public safety, health care, child wellbeing, economic freedom, taxpayer return on investment, home internet connectivity, and the lowest tax burden in the nation.”
Ayotte’s not wrong about New Hampshire’s collection of accolades from think tanks and special interests, but what she doesn’t mention is the tyranny of averages underlying her rosy picture. Claremont and Pelham, for example, have comparable populations of between roughly 13,000 and 14,000 people, but economically they couldn’t be more different. The median household income in Claremont, for example, is about $54,000 while the average in Pelham is just under $127,000.
So, Claremont’s median is about half the state’s, but stirred together with a more affluent community like Pelham, things don’t look so bad. Add in another similarly populated town like Amherst, with its median household income of $150,000, and all of a sudden it looks like New Hampshire has drafted a clear blueprint for the other 49 states to follow.
The median income for those three communities is more than $110,000, the kind of number that gives New Hampshire its dubious title as one of the richest states in one of the world’s richest nations. I guess the still-struggling families of Claremont and the many, many other working-class communities in the state just don’t know how to appreciate a good average.
As ridiculous as Ayotte may look in her rose-colored glasses, that occasional eyewear is still preferable to the standard dark shades of her party partners in Concord and Washington.
I don’t think one politician or even one party is responsible for the high cost of beef, child care, a college education, health insurance, or housing. But unlike the Trump administration and its henchmen and henchwomen in the New Hampshire State House, I know that the overall unaffordability is not caused by immigrants. I know that diversity, in society just as in nature, strengthens rather than weakens communities. And, I know that any “fraud” committed by poor people receiving government benefits is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the fraud committed by the nation’s wealthiest people collectively, including the legalized fraud inherent in legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the crimes of avoidance and evasion made possible by the lax enforcement, by design, of existing tax laws.
I know, too, that the Republican Party often wins elections not by articulating policy positions but by tapping American reservoirs of blame, fear, and hatred. I know that the language of religion is often used by Republican Party leaders to establish the illusion of moral authority, despite the obvious immorality of the violence and cruelty they perpetuate. I know that a vision of progress that strips any population of basic human rights, a nightmare that is playing out right now in cities across the nation, is a tragic regression.
And, I know that most Republicans know all of this, too.
It’s just that actually solving problems for the people requires a lot of time and hard work, and lying to them about who or what is to blame for their struggles is the easiest thing in the world.
This, all the fresh pain and chaos on top of the same old problems, is what easy gets you.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1152886-Ayotte-press-conference-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

Ivey's 2027 budget proposals would call for an additional $570 million for the Education Trust Fund and a cut of about $29 million to the General Fund, with most programs level-funded or cut and extra money going to salary increases and insurance.  (Estela Munoz for Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey has proposed an increase of about $569.8 million (5.8%) for the Education Trust Fund (ETF) next year and a total of about $28.5 million in cuts (0.8%)  to the General Fund.
The proposals for the 2027 fiscal year, presented to legislators on Wednesday, would effectively direct any additional money in the budgets toward 2% pay raises for employees and funding to avert increased health insurance costs. 
Ivey’s ETF proposal would also increase funding for the CHOOSE Act, a school voucher-type program, from $180 million to a total of $250 million in the 2027-28 school year. Most education programs and nearly all General Fund programs would be level-funded or reduced by some amount.
“The General Fund prioritizes responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars while making targeted investments in public safety and other core services Alabamians rely on every day,” Ivey said in a statement on Wednesday. “This will ensure that Alabama remains the best state to live, work and raise a family,” Ivey said in a statement Wednesday. 
The Legislature will make the final decisions on spending in the budgets. The current ETF is $9.9 billion; the current General Fund is $3.7 billion. The cut in the General Fund would be one of the first to the budgets in several years.

Hovering over the budgets are increased health care costs that could drive up costs for employees. The Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) requested $380 million to avoid cost increases in the coming year. 
Finance Director Bill Poole told legislators Wednesday that Ivey proposed a $210 million increase. “That’s just a little bit more than half of the PEEHIP request,” he said. “So that will leave a gap that the PEEHIP program and the PEEHIP board will need to consider and address.”
Poole said fully funding PEEHIP’s request would have “nearly consumed the entirety of the new funding that could be eligible for appropriation in the ETF direct budget for all education purposes.”
Ivey also proposed that the Child Health Care Insurance Plan (CHIP) be funded through ETF supplemental funds this year.
“It has been paid at times out of both budgets. So it has gone back and forth through the years. At present, it is fully funded in the general fund,” Poole said. “Given this is children’s health insurance, this package proposes that the FY 27 growth in that liability or obligation be funded out of the ETF supplemental. That is a conversation that has gone back and forth for years. I suspect it is going to re-emerge and be a topic of discussion throughout the legislative session.”
The 2027 ETF, which would go into effect on Oct. 1, would be the largest in nominal terms in state history. But the increase would leave many programs in the ETF — including the RAISE Act and money for English language learners would remain level funded. Ivey’s proposal would increase funding for the state’s Pre-K program by about $12.4 million, a 6.2% increase.

In the General Fund, Ivey proposes keeping all programs — including Medicaid, the Department of Human Resources and the Alabama Department of Public Health — level funded.
Kirk Fulford, legislative fiscal officer, told legislators Wednesday that Alabama $203.4 million was awarded by the federal government  through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act for rural healthcare transformation. 
“We have to go back and apply to them and tell them how we plan to actually spend that $203.4 million within that original plan,” Fulford said. “They’re also going to hold our hand and watch every expenditure of the dollars and make sure that they agree with it and approve with how it’s coming down the line, where it’s going.”
Fulford said one reason to budget conservatively for 2027 is what he expects to be a difficult 2028. 
“There’s other things that you’re going to be forced to assume liability on,” Fulford said. “There’s going to be a rock fight in 2028. Keep your head down, and watch where it goes, but it’s going to be a tough one.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/709A5400-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The House Education Committee on Wednesday advanced its chamber’s omnibus public education overhaul — but only by a few votes. 
It signals the battle to expand school choice in Mississippi, including spending millions of tax dollars on private schooling – Republican House Speaker Jason White’s pet issue this session – is far from over. Senate leaders have said the House bill is a nonstarter, and White has had to wrangle with reluctance or opposition from some of his own Republican caucus in the House.
But the school-choice movement has gained momentum in Mississippi, thanks in part to efforts from national think tanks and mounting pressure from the Trump administration. School choice refers to a number of policies that fund education outside of the public school system with public dollars in the name of giving parents more power over children’s education. 


Watch the full committee meeting here.
READ MORE: FAQ: What is school choice? What are Mississippi lawmakers considering?
The House’s expansive bill, which came after months of hearings and names White as a principal author, was unveiled Jan. 7. House Bill 2 makes changes across the state’s education system, including adding financial literacy requirements for students, permitting homeschooled students to play public school sports and encouraging prayer in school. 
Most notably, the legislation establishes an education savings account program in Mississippi that would allow students to pay private school tuition with public dollars. It’s the most expansive form of school choice. The bill also makes it easier for students to transfer out of their assigned public school districts, which is called “portability.” It also loosens regulations on where charter schools can expand.
The Republican-led Senate has taken a very limited approach to school choice legislation. The chamber recently passed its own portability bill, and Senate leaders say they won’t consider establishing a voucher program in Mississippi.

Despite intense efforts from White, the House bill doesn’t appear to have overwhelming support. In a small room with posters of A-rated public school districts on the wall, dozens of onlookers watched Wednesday as the panel debated the 553-page bill for over an hour, demonstrating clear discord in the chamber. 
In particular, Republican House Education Committee Chairman Rob Roberson and Rep. Cheikh Taylor, chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, both heavy hitters in their respective parties and both from Starkville, lobbed questions back and forth, representing the ideological divide over school choice. 
“If we divert these funds from public education, we’re also diverting funds from the entire philosophy that gives advancements to most families,” Taylor said. “That’s problematic because I don’t see any remedy to replace the funds going to public schools. So I have a ton of heartburn.”
Roberson argued that the money should be going toward educating children, no matter where they attend school, and that parents have students’ best interests in mind, not the government. 
“This bill is not the end all to fix all for schools, never has been,” he said. “It is a piece of a puzzle that we need to continue working on. Public schools, or schools in general in this state, have to continue being looked at, and we need to keep promoting and putting money into these systems.”
But Roberson has previously brushed the argument aside that public schools continue to struggle because of historic underfunding. 
The state’s public-school system has been nationally lauded for its reading improvements in recent years. House Democrats questioned why Republicans would want to make changes to the education system now, after the public school system has found surer footing. 
“Anytime you raise the standard, the water that comes into any system … makes all ships rise,” Roberson said.

Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville who c0authored the bill, teamed up with Roberson to defend it in committee and echoed the free-market idea that proponents often use to promote school choice. They argue that more schooling options means public schools will have to improve in order to keep students. 
In some places, research shows that addition of charter schools has slightly raised the performance of public schools.

The panel of lawmakers also voted to modify two portions of the original bill during the committee meeting. 
The original bill allowed charter school establishment in any district without regard for the local public school district’s rating. But after amendments on Wednesday, the new bill limits new charter schools to areas with D- or F-rated schools. Current law only allows new charter schools in areas with D- or F-rated districts, so the amended bill would still greatly expand areas charter schools could open statewide. 
Tweaks to the state’s student funding formula were also removed during the committee meeting. Roberson said those changes will be presented in a new bill. 
Harness offered an amendment to strike all of the language in the bill and replace it with a teacher pay raise, but after assurance from Roberson that the House will consider a teacher raise in another bill, he withdrew his amendment. The omnibus bill omits a teacher pay raise, though it includes one for assistant teachers. Roberson said this was an intentional decision to avoid political bargaining over teachers’ livelihoods.
The Senate approved a teacher pay raise last week.
After Republican Rep. Kevin Felsher of Biloxi encouraged the committee to advance the measure so the full body of the House could debate it, representatives revealed their votes one-by-one, thanks to a roll call vote request from Rep. Percy Watson, a Democrat from Hattiesburg. 
The bill passed the committee 14-11. Two lawmakers were absent, and two Republicans — House Education Committee Vice-Chairman Kent McCarty from Hattiesburg and Rep. Dana McLean from Columbus — voted against the measure. 
It can now be brought up on the House floor, and will likely be debated by the full chamber by the end of the week. The vote, despite White’s best efforts, could be tight. 
Felsher acknowledged during the meeting that the bill was imperfect and said that while he voted for the measure in committee, he is not certain how he will vote when it comes before the full House.
“I was committed to moving the bill out of the Education Committee to the floor for further discussion,” he said. “I am still deliberating.” 
Owen said he expects there will be lots of attempts to amend the bill when it comes before the full House. But he said the House leadership is not open to further amendments at this point. 
“All of the amendments we intended to make, we made in the committee substitute,” Owen said. “Everything is where it needs to be at this point.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/14133615/House-Education-Committee-3.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust announced millions in grants Wednesday to expand patient access to trained doctors and cancer treatments. 
The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences regents and the Oklahoma State University Medical Center were the largest recipients, being awarded $25 million and $30 million respectively, receiving over 36% of all funding awarded. 
The OSU Medical Center will use its funding to develop a new facility for graduate medical education with a goal of creating 100 more physician residency positions, supported by the TSET grant. 
Oklahoma has a shortage of health care providers, especially in rural areas, according to Metriatch, an Oklahoma-focused research and policy organization. 
Increasing the number of available residencies in Oklahoma is important because, according to the American Medical Association, a majority of physicians who complete their residency training choose to practice in the state where they were trained, varying by location and specialty. 
“Oklahomans deserve not only the ability to see a health care provider, but they deserve a well trained provider,” said Dr. Mike Herndon, a member of the OSU Medical Authority and Trust. “And they deserve a provider that is convenient and close to them and can do it in a timely manner. So this grant helps us to provide that very access and that ability.”
OU Health Sciences will use the $25 million grant to support construction of a new location of the Stephenson Cancer facility in Tulsa, which officials said will increase access to cancer treatments in northeast Oklahoma. 
Dr. Gary Raskob, provost for the OU Health campus, said that “few challenges are more urgent than cancer” in Oklahoma and the support of the TSET grant will bring greater access to treatments and clinical trials. 
“This is not a little satellite expansion,” he said. “This is a full fledged facility that will provide the range of services that patients can get here in Oklahoma City, including all these phases of clinical trials, so that patients across northeastern Oklahoma have the same opportunities for cutting edge life saving care.”
Julie Bisbee, executive director of TSET, said the group is able to award larger grants as the endowment has “matured” since its creation. 
Oklahoma voters approved a constitutional amendment to create TSET in 2000, the only state to do so with the funds from a nationwide settlement agreement with tobacco companies. The entity oversees nearly $2 billion in public dollars and uses the endowment earnings to improve health outcomes in Oklahoma. 
“The focus that we have with our legacy grants is on durable capacity, facilities, workforce, systems change that improve outcomes over time and help Oklahomans live healthier lives,” Bisbee said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Adults who groom children for sex would be subject to criminal charges under a bill proposed in the Kentucky General Assembly, closing a legal gap that let certain perpetrators go unpunished. 
House Bill 4 proposes a range of charges for adults, 18 and older, who groom children with an “intent to entice, coerce, solicit, or prepare the minor to engage in sexual conduct with the person or another person.” 
Up until now, law enforcement has had to wait to charge groomers until they specifically solicited or assaulted a child, Louis Kelly, the commonwealth’s attorney in Boone and Gallatin counties, said during a Wednesday press conference. 
“Crimes are very specific, and sometimes it’s hard to create laws that capture all the behavior that we would want to deter,” Kelly said. “Recently we found … a big gap in behavior that doesn’t rise to the level of an actual sexual solicitation or doesn’t result in a sexual touch or assault, but is nevertheless clearly inappropriate and clearly designed to lead to such things.” 
Sponsor Rep. Marianne Proctor, R-Union, said she wants to stop “any pedophile” from hurting and manipulating children. “I would love (it) if we get 100% of them,” she said.
House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, told reporters Wednesday that the bill is “clearly a priority.” 
“I think anything that we can do to protect the kids in the commonwealth is a good thing,” he said. 
Rep. Kim Banta, R-Ft. Mitchell, is a cosponsor.

What’s in the bill? 
The bill has two tiers for both adults who groom children under the age of 14 and those in positions of “authority or position of special trust” — such as coaches or teachers — who groom children under the age of 18. 
The first tier is a Class A misdemeanor, unless the minor is younger than 12 years old, in which case it is a Class D felony, according to the bill. For those in trusted positions, grooming a minor is a Class D felony unless the minor is younger than 12, in which case it is a Class C felony. 
Rep. Marianne Proctor, R-Union. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
The bill lays out exceptions for “lawful or legitimate” communications, including:

Teaching curriculum on human sexuality or sexually transmitted diseases. 
The use of a traceable communication system by a school district employee. 
The diagnosis or treatment of a minor by a health care provider in a health care facility. 
Age-appropriate conversations about puberty and human sexuality with a minor by the minor’s parent or guardian. 
Communicating with a minor to determine if the minor is dependent, neglected or abused. 
Any conversation with a minor that is part of a person’s job-related duties. 

“It has been well crafted to not criminalize good faith and perhaps innocent discussions between adults and minors, even if, perhaps, misguided,” Kelly said. “This has a high burden on law enforcement and a high burden on prosecution to make sure we are targeting people who should know better, who shouldn’t be doing this and are clearly doing it for inappropriate reasons.” 
The bill requires at least two instances of grooming behavior before charges could be brought.
“It’s got to be a pattern of behavior,” Proctor said. “There’s some things you just see it when you see it. So this is a high bar. This is an intent bill. You’ve got to prove intent.” 
Should Kentucky codify this proposal into law, Proctor said, Kentucky would be one of 13 states with similar statutes. 
Why does this legislation matter? 
Shannon Moody, Kentucky Youth Advocates’ chief officer of strategic initiatives, told the Lantern that grooming is often subtle and rooted in a facade of kindness that can confuse children. And, she said, it often leads to abuse. 
Shannon Moody
“We see a lot of individuals who target kids with difficult home life, and especially kids who maybe feel lonely or isolated,” Moody said. “There’s a lot of perpetrators who identify children with histories where they’re not feeling connected to an adult, and see that as an opportunity.” 
Grooming does not just harm children during their childhoods, Moody said. It can set them up for a pattern of  unhealthy relationships throughout their lives. 
“One of the things that would worry me, if somebody’s experiencing grooming and that behavior is being normalized, is that it starts to normalize bad relationship patterns that you think are okay,” Moody said. “There’s a potential for increased likelihood of experiencing domestic violence or intimate partner violence. It could open the door for somebody to not really understand that that treatment is not okay, and understand what normal relationships should look like.” 
Kentucky has higher rates of domestic violence than the national average: 48% of Kentucky women will experience intimate partner violence or stalking, compared with 47% nationally, the Lantern has reported. About 52% of men in Kentucky will also experience this, which is higher than the national percentage of 44%. 
Jordan Turner, the Boone County Attorney. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
The definition of “grooming behavior” is vague because it is subtle and varied, Moody said. 
“That’s what’s kind of scary about that,” she said. “It sometimes happens before you even know it.” 
Jordan Turner, the Boone County attorney, said grooming “looks so different when we’re talking about victims who are children versus victims who are adults.” State law already covers behavior that targets adult Kentuckians, she said, such as stalking and harassment. 
“Grooming toward children looks like building relationships, being kind, making children trust you,” she said. “I think the fact that we are calling this out, and we are naming it, is a big success at this point.” 



Grooming red flags 
Grooming can vary person to person, Moody said, but there are some signs parents and children can be aware of that may indicate a problem:

If an adult asks the child to keep secrets about the relationship. 
If an adult attempts to isolate the child from their friends. 
If an adult threatens the child with harm if they do not comply with a request. 
If an interaction with an adult makes the child feel physiologically unwell. 
If a child is coming home with items of value that peers are unlikely to be able to afford. This may indicate gifts from an adult.

Dan McKeon of Amherst resigned from the Nebraska Legislature over allegations of workplace misconduct, Gov. Jim Pillen appointed Fred Meyer of St. Paul to represent Legislative District 41.
Meyer is familiar with the Legislature, having served in the same seat during the 2024 legislative session. Pillen appointed him then to replace Tom Briese, whom Pillen appointed as State Treasurer.
Pillen said it was important for him to fill the seat for LD 41 as soon as possible, and he did not follow an application process. He said Meyer will begin serving in the Legislature on Thursday.
“He’ll be an asset from day one,” Pillen said of Meyer.

McKeon resigned Tuesday, minutes before floor debate on his potential expulsion was set to begin. He faced possible expulsion following allegations that he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer.
Had he not resigned, multiple senators corroborated, there were enough votes to expel him, which would have been a first in Nebraska history.
McKeon was cited with misdemeanor public indecency in October, stemming from a separate criminal investigation of the same incident. Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace. McKeon pleaded not guilty after originally signaling his intent to plead no contest.
His next court date is Jan. 26.
Meyer said he hoped stepping in would put the situation “in the rearview mirror.”
“In my opinion, we’re starting fresh today,” Meyer said.

After Meyer’s legislative service ended in 2024, he said he had no plans to return to the Legislature. As recently as three weeks ago, Meyer told people he wouldn’t be the one to replace McKeon, because he was comfortable in his “semi-retired” home life.
That changed about 10 days ago when he received a call from Pillen, he said.

“Coach Pillen started looking down his bench, and there was one guy at the end of the bench who didn’t want to make eye contact with him,” Meyer said. “And he said, ‘Meyer, you’re in the game.’ So that’s why I’m here today, because I believe, once you’re in the game, then you give it your all.”
Later this year, the state will hold a special election to determine who will serve the remaining two years of McKeon’s four-year term. When Meyer was first appointed to serve in the final year of Briese’s term, he promised not to run for election.
This time around, Meyer was non-committal about his plans for the special election or beyond.
Meyer will enter the Legislature with four days remaining to introduce new bills. Meyer does not intend to introduce new bills himself in a short, 60-day session, saying there are already too many bills at play.
“If it were up to me, I would limit that dramatically,” Meyer said.

“The work was hard and the price was high, and yet they persevered,” he told the crowd that was gathered for an annual “solidarity day” labor rally.
He said the workers were building a Statehouse by day and a movement by night. In 1890, the year they raised the Statehouse dome, workers formed the Kansas State Federation of Labor, he said.
It wasn’t just the building, he said. Kansas itself was built by working people: farmers who broke open the prairie, railroad workers who connected the state to the rest of the country, teachers who educated generations, nurses who healed, firefighters who kept people safe, construction workers who raised cities from the plains, and machinists who made the state a powerhouse of aviation.
The work, he said, is never finished.
“Every right we have, from the weekend to the eight-hour workday to the safety standards that bring you home alive at the end of your shift, somebody built that brick by brick, contract by contract and fight by fight. This is what you built,” Lowen said.
Sometimes, he said, the Statehouse can feel like a building for “other people, fancy people, people in suits.”
“But you know what? This is your house. This is your state,” he said.
Right now, he added, there are people “in offices upstairs” who want to tear down what they have built. They want to rig congressional maps to silence voices, drain money from public schools to subsidize private ones, and “they’re coming for what’s left of our right to organize,” he said.
“They think that we forgot how to build,” Lowen said. “They think that we’re too divided, too tired and too beaten down. But here’s what they don’t understand. We’re still here in the same building that our people raised with their hands, doing the same work that our founders started, and we will be here long after these walls have crumbled.”

‘I didn’t give you the finger’
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told the crowd that organized labor was instrumental to the state’s economic growth under her administration, which included 1,600 new development projects that total more than $30 billion in new capital investment and created 82,000 new jobs.
She said her administration invested in workers, prioritized economic opportunities and ensured that labor had a seat at the table. She created an apprenticeship office and signed an overhaul of the workers compensation system, which included raising benefit caps.
“I walked the picket line with UAW workers,” Kelly said, pausing for applause before ad-libbing, “and I didn’t give you the finger, either.”
She was referring to President Trump’s gesture at a union autoworker at a Ford Motor Co. plant Tuesday in Dearborn, Michigan.
The line was met by howls from the audience, but her biggest applause came when she promised to fight for raising the minimum wage. The state’s minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
“Kansas is stronger when workers are respected,” Kelly said. “Kansas thrives when labor has a seat at the table. And Kansas succeeds when we never forget that behind every project, every investment and every milestone are the workers who make it possible.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1140503-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

One southern New Mexico state senator aims to introduce more regulations for the on-site power generation for Project Jupiter and similar projects. (Courtesy of BorderPlex Digital Assets)As controversial proposals to power multi-billion dollar data centers in southern New Mexico wind through the courts and permitting processes, one state senator aims to close what he considers a loophole that could allow the projects to bypass the state’s clean energy requirements.
This week, state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) introduced a draft bill that would empower state regulators to have approval powers and set new rules for the on site power grids — often called microgrids — and require these private power sources to follow the landmark Energy Transition Act.
A “microgrid” describes developments that generate electricity without drawing from a larger power company’s grid.
These projects currently are not bound by requirements to generate power with cleaner energy sources and face less scrutiny by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, Steinborn said in a call with Source NM this week.
“It’s a path to having very dirty energy for these massive data centers rather than using more renewable energy as we require full public utilities,” Steinborn said. “Microgrids pose a threat to the climate and New Mexico’s air quality if we don’t establish minimum renewable energy and other standards regarding water efficiency.”
In public meetings and statements, representatives of Project Jupiter said the microgrid will comply with the state’s law to use fully renewable energy sources by 2045. But state lawmakers disagree on whether a last-minute floor amendment to House Bill 93 passed in the 2025 legislative session allows for “microgrid” developments to circumvent sequential goals laid out in the law.
Steinborn’s bill, if adopted, would require the PRC to put forward new rules for any microgrid producing more than 20 megawatts, enough to power more than 16,000 homes.
The bill would grant regulators oversight over the approval and operation of microgrids and require proof from any microgrid slated to come online after May 2026 of its ability to meet the state’s renewable energy standards. Those standards require 40% percent of a microgrid’s  power generation to come from renewable sources by 2028; 50% clean power generation by 2030; and 100% clean power by 2040.
Additionally, the bill would require microgrid operators to submit annual reports after 2027 detailing how much power they generate; water usage and compliance with state laws.
Project Jupiter, a data center proposed for southern Doña Ana County, would emit as many greenhouse gasses as Albuquerque and Las Cruces combined. Applications submitted to state officials include two natural gas generating stations — the microgrid to power the project — which are projected to generate as much electricity as the entire PNM system.
Project Jupiter’s plan relies on natural gas — its impact on air quality remains unclear

In addition to raising emissions, the project threatens air quality in an area already impacted by ozone and other pollutants, said Las Cruces environmental lawyer David Baake in a statement.
“New Mexico continues to struggle with serious air pollution problems driven by the combustion of dirty fossil fuels,” Baake said. Steinborn’s bill, he said, “protects public health and the climate by ensuring that AI data centers take advantage of our state’s abundant renewable energy resources instead of building more dirty fossil fuel power plants.”
Steinborn said Project Jupiter initially spurred the bill, but pointed to another data center in Lea County with a planned microgrid with gas and nuclear power plants, as signs of a bigger issue.
“Project Jupiter started it, but then it became very clear that this is part of the bigger, maybe even strategy, of some in our state government to bring in lots of data centers into the state,” he said. “Their strategies collectively seem to be that they don’t have to follow any environmental renewable energy standards, so I’m concerned not only for what’s been announced, but what’s in line behind it.”
He continued: “It’s an ecological disaster in the making, quite frankly, that we need to address.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-14 20:00:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. John Larson joins effort to impeach DHS Sec. Kristi Noem,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/larson-impeach-kristi-noem/,U.S. Rep. John Larson joined a number of House Democrats supporting impeachment efforts against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.,"U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, joined a growing number of House Democrats on Wednesday supporting impeachment efforts against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of the fatal shooting by a federal agent in Minneapolis.
A group of Democrats filed three articles of impeachment against Noem for high crimes and misdemeanors, accusing her of obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. DHS oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also referred to as ICE.
Democrats have limited leverage to enact reforms or push back against DHS since they serve in the minority in Congress. But there is growing pressure from the party’s base to try and rein in the Trump administration over immigration enforcement. That hit a fever pitch after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis last week.
Larson joined an initial group of 53 House Democrats supporting the articles of impeachment. U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois, who spearheaded the effort, said the number continues to grow, reaching almost 70 members by late Wednesday morning. 
Larson, who faces his most competitive primary since his first election in 1998, is so far the only member of Connecticut’s House delegation to sign on to the effort. The Hartford-area congressman argued that, under Noem’s leadership, ICE has morphed into “President Trump’s secret police force.”
“After a week of lies, cover-ups, and excessive force against peaceful protesters across the country, including the execution of an American citizen, enough is enough,” Larson said in a statement on Wednesday.
“Secretary Noem has lost the trust of the American people and must face accountability for her failed leadership,” he continued. “I am in full support of impeachment proceedings that include a full, transparent investigation into the lawlessness occurring on her watch.” 
Larson specifically cited the killing of Good and the protests that have emerged in response.
Last week in Hartford, at least one person was knocked down by a vehicle and half a dozen were pepper-sprayed during a vigil for Good. Hartford police and DHS have since launched an investigation. A couple of days later, more than 100 people gathered in Fairfield as part of a nationwide “ICE Out For Good” protests.
But the articles of impeachment levied against Noem lay out a list of accusations.
On obstruction of Congress, they allege the DHS secretary prevented Congress from oversight of ICE, which they argue violates the law since the department cannot use congressionally appropriated funds to block lawmakers from getting into ICE facilities. On violation of public trust, they accused her of undermining American citizens’ due process rights by making arrests without warrants. And on self-dealing, members pointed to DHS not using the customary bidding process surrounding an ad campaign.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the Democratic effort “silly during a serious time.”
“As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” the DHS spokesperson said. “We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”
There was a recent impeachment attempt aimed at President Donald Trump, who was twice impeached and acquitted during his first term — a Democratic resolution to impeach Trump failed in December. Larson and U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, voted against the Republican motion to block the impeachment resolution, while the rest of Connecticut’s delegation voted present.
While the latest push against Noem is largely symbolic, Democrats believe it’s worth pursuing even as the odds are stacked against them.
“If you believe impeachment is silly, then you are not taking your job or our Constitution seriously,” Kelly said at a press conference.
Whether aimed at the president himself or his Cabinet officials, any impeachment efforts in the current Congress are expected to stall because Republicans have the votes to block it. But that could change if Democrats win back the House majority in the November midterm elections — something even Trump recently acknowledged as possible if Republicans lose control.
“The House will make their own determination, but I don’t think it’s any secret that the president’s level of corruption and illegality is nuclear-grade in his second term compared to his first term,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” when asked about a potential impeachment against Trump. As a senator, Murphy would sit as a juror on any impeachment trial.
Still, such an effort would likely face hurdles in the Senate, which would hold a trial if the articles of impeachment passed out of the House. Two-thirds of senators would need to vote in order to convict a president, a high bar to meet regardless of which party controls the Senate.
While impeachment is one avenue for Democrats, the party is also weighing potential reforms for ICE as they work out the fiscal year 2026 funding for DHS. Lawmakers need to meet a Jan. 30 deadline to fund the rest of the federal government and avoid a partial shutdown.
As they continue negotiations on the DHS bill, Democrats are currently weighing how to address ICE, whether it’s through attaching policy priorities or adjusting its funding in the forthcoming spending bill.
“You should demand that we make sure that this appropriations process is used to make ICE comply with the law,” Murphy, who is the top Democrat on the Homeland Security appropriations subcommittee, said at a Tuesday night protest in Washington, D.C., according to TIME. “And I see a lot of signs out there — not one additional dime for ICE in this budget.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25273738975767-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

WILMINGTON, Del. — SilverAssist, a national senior assistance network, has acquired Caring LLC, the parent company of Caring.com, in a move aimed at simplifying how caregivers and families — including those in Delaware — find, evaluate, and pay for senior care.
The acquisition, announced Jan. 12, brings Caring.com, one of the nation’s most visited online platforms for senior care reviews and referrals, into SilverAssist’s growing portfolio, which already includes Oasis Senior Advisors and ElderLife Financial. Financial terms were not disclosed.
SilverAssist describes the move as creating one of the fastest-growing referral and advisory networks in senior housing, combining digital reach, local expertise and financial navigation under a single umbrella.
For Delaware caregivers, the acquisition is intended to reduce the fragmented, often overwhelming process of searching for senior living or in-home care options.
“Families often move between multiple websites, advisors, and financial tools when a loved one needs care,” SilverAssist said in a statement. “This integration is designed to bring those resources together in one place.”
Caring.com is widely used by families researching assisted living, memory care, nursing homes and home care services. The site offers educational content, family reviews and a referral helpline staffed by care advisors. Under SilverAssist, those digital resources will now connect more directly to local, on-the-ground support.
That local component comes through Oasis Senior Advisors, a national network of Certified Senior Advisors who provide free, personalized guidance to families. Oasis has an established presence in Delaware, including advisors based in Hockessin who work directly with caregivers to assess needs, tour communities and identify appropriate care options.
Lynn Paxson, president of Oasis Senior Advisors of Delaware, said the acquisition has the potential to make the caregiving journey significantly easier for local families.
“Caregivers often come to us stressed, exhausted and unsure where to start,” Paxson said. “By connecting Caring.com’s trusted online information directly to local advisors who understand the Delaware market, we can help families move more quickly from confusion to clarity — and from research to real solutions.”
Paxson said the integration allows caregivers to begin their search online and transition seamlessly to one-on-one, local guidance without repeating their story or starting over.
“That continuity matters,” she said. “It means fewer phone calls, less second-guessing, and more confidence that families are making the right decision for their loved one.”
The acquisition also brings ElderLife Financial more directly into the caregiver experience. ElderLife provides financial tools to help families manage the cost of senior care, including bridge loans, real estate-based funding solutions, and assistance navigating veterans’ benefits.
That financial guidance is particularly relevant in Delaware, where monthly assisted living costs can range from roughly $5,000 to $7,000 depending on location and level of care. Caregivers frequently cite affordability and timing as major obstacles when a health event forces rapid decisions.
SilverAssist said the combined platform will allow families to move from education to placement to financial planning without starting over at each step. Services remain free for caregivers, with revenue generated through partnerships with senior living providers.
The company also said the acquisition is expected to improve occupancy solutions for senior living operators by delivering better-qualified referrals — families who are more informed, financially prepared, and matched to appropriate levels of care.
Integration of Caring.com into the SilverAssist network is already underway, with additional enhancements expected over the coming months.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Generated-Image-January-14-2026-2_55PM.png,,,2026-01-14 15:57:47.886831

A little before 4:30 p.m., Senior High went into lockdown after school district officials say a teacher was attacked by a student who had a knife. Billings Police confirmed that two people were taken to an area hospital.
Lt. Samantha Puckett on Wednesday said the department is not releasing any other information, but that all people involved have been accounted for, and there is no threat to the public. She told the Daily Montanan it is still an active investigation.
The incident happened after class on the third floor of the high school, which serves approximately 1,600 students.
School officials cancelled school and activities on Tuesday night and Wednesday, although they said there is no ongoing threat to the public. Students there begin finals on Thursday.
On Tuesday, there was a girls and boys wrestling meet scheduled as well as an orchestra concert that was cancelled.
Police are still investigating the scene and the motives, while school district officials said there will be crisis counselors available for students and staff on Thursday.
All other schools and activities for Billings Public Schools will proceed as planned.
 



  Message from Billings Public Schools 

Dear Billings Public Schools Community,
We are writing to provide an update regarding an incident that occurred at Senior High School this afternoon, January 13th. At approximately 4:23 PM, after regular school hours, a teacher was attacked and sustained stab wounds.
School staff immediately notified 911 and placed the building into a lockdown. We are relieved to report that the teacher is currently in stable condition and receiving medical care. Law enforcement has confirmed that all parties involved have been accounted for and there is no ongoing threat to the public. As this is an active criminal investigation, the District is working closely with the Billings Police Department.
All classes and extracurricular activities at Senior High School are canceled for Wednesday, January 14th. When students and staff return to the building on Thursday, we will have a crisis support team and counselors available all day to help our school community process this news. Out of respect for the privacy of our staff member and the integrity of the police investigation, we are unable to share further details at this time.
Our thoughts are with our colleague and their family during this difficult time. Thank you for your continued support and for keeping our Senior High community in your thoughts.

The State Department, in a social media post, listed several that would be affected, including Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea.“The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,” the State Department wrote. “The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.”It will take effect Jan. 21 and other countries affected include Afghanistan and Russia, according to The Associated Press.The Department of Homeland Security in November published a notice for proposed rulemaking that outlined major changes to how immigration officials assess whether certain immigrants are likely to become a public charge and if that constitutes grounds for inadmissibility, meaning a noncitizen would be ineligible for admission or adjustment of their immigration status.During President Donald Trump’s first administration, he tried to broaden the definition of public charge to include any immigrant who had received certain public benefits for more than 12 months in a 36-month period. The move was tied up in the courts.One of the earliest federal immigration laws is an 1882 law that barred the immigration of people to the U.S. if they were likely to become a public charge.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s large presence in Minnesota, which has resulted in the shooting death of one resident and numerous clashes between community members and federal agents, is not the right way to make communities safe. 
Speaking at the Wisconsin Farmers Union’s annual lobby day Wednesday morning, Kaul said he’s concerned about the federal government “obstructing” the investigation into the death of Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, touted his office’s briefs in support of jurisdictions suing to get federal personnel out of cities and said he’s preparing for similar federal actions in Wisconsin. 
“What’s happening in Minneapolis now could very well be repeated in other communities around the country,” he said. “And so making sure that we’re prepared if that does happen is really important to me.”
He said that targeting people based on their race, ethnicity and political beliefs weaponizes the justice system in a way that makes communities less safe. 
“We do a lot of thinking about public safety at the Department of Justice, it is my top priority,” he said. “Taking actions that strengthen communities, that strengthen community ties, that build trust, that ensure that laws are evenhandedly enforced … and ensure that people who commit serious crimes are held accountable” is the Wisconsin DOJ’s focus, Kaul said.
“If you start targeting people based on any number of inappropriate factors, whether it’s their race or ethnicity or their viewpoint on political issues or any other inappropriate topic, that takes you away from the kind of law enforcement that makes a positive impact and makes communities safer,” he added. 
Kaul noted he’s worked often with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and said that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension needs to be involved in the investigation so there is transparency for everyone involved. 
“I’m very concerned that Minnesota BCA has so far been excluded from the investigative process into the death that happened,” he said. “It is critically important that there be transparency and that there be fairness. That, by the way, is important for everybody involved. If you were an officer involved in a critical incident, you deserve to have a fair investigation conducted so that the public knows what happened in that case, because without a fair, transparent investigation, there’s going to be uncertainty.”
“There’s been reporting recently that the FBI is not investigating necessarily the incident, but rather the wife of the woman who was killed,” he added later. “There’s the fact that six Assistant U.S. Attorneys, six federal prosecutors, have resigned in Minnesota because of the way that that investigation is being conducted. And I think it is really important that we distinguish between good faith efforts to get to the truth, that provide information clearly, and what’s going on in Minnesota, because what’s going on right there is obstructing full investigation and full review and risks that we not have information publicly available.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4962-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 14:58:11.959867

Jason Knight on Wednesday introduced a resolution condemning “aggressive and violent” enforcement tactics used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) Rep. Jason Knight on Wednesday introduced a resolution condemning “aggressive and violent” enforcement tactics used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.
The resolution from the Barrington Democrat condemns the military-style raids and arrests ICE has carried out nationwide since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term in 2025. Knight said the tactics of ICE agents are aimed not at apprehending criminals, but at “scaring people in our community.”
“ICE agents wearing masks are behaving as though they are SWAT teams going after heavily armed drug kingpins when they are, in fact, just snatching ordinary people going to work or bringing their kids to school,” Knight, a candidate for Rhode Island attorney general, said in a statement. “That’s not making communities safer – it’s terrifying them and putting people in danger, particularly those with certain skin colors or accents.” 
Knight pointed to an immigration raid in Warren on Nov. 11, where federal officers arrested a 36-year-old Liberian national who worked at Blount Fine Foods by forcibly removing him from his car. A post on the X account for ICE’s Boston office claimed the man stayed in the country illegally and committed numerous crimes including felony assault with a dangerous weapon forgery, second-degree assault, disorderly conduct and shoplifting.
Knight’s resolution was referred to the House Committee on Judiciary, where he is first vice chair. It has yet to be scheduled for a hearing.
While Rhode Island has been less of a target for large-scale ICE operations, federal immigration officers have become a regular presence outside the state’s courthouses — even briefly detaining a teenage judicial intern outside of the Licht Judicial Complex in Providence on Nov. 20. The judicial intern’s detention sparked widespread outrage among state and local officials.
In a statement emailed to the news media that same day, Chief Justice Paul Suttell called the incident “egregious” and that the Judiciary understands recent calls to expand the use of virtual court hearings in Providence — a call the City Council made in an Oct. 16 resolution.
Knight called ICE’s recent activity an “un-American perversion of justice.” Exacerbating that fear and uncertainty, according to the resolution, is ICE officers’ practice of concealing their identities by wearing masks, sporting plain clothes and driving unmarked vehicles.
“Cruel and unusual detainment tactics and the concealment of ICE agents’ identities are not requisite for effective, comprehensive immigration enforcement or public safety, as prior administrations successfully fulfilled ICE’s mission with comparable levels of deportations while prioritizing known criminals,” the resolution states.

These days, in the neighborhood where I walk, there are a number of delightful inflatable front-yard Christmas decorations: Santas, Rudolphs and Frostys, joined a few days ago by a new, minority inflatable among the many Yuletide blow-ups– a massive, 8-foot-tall Hanukkah bear, complete with a dreidel, a star of David and, of course, a menorah with nine inflated flames, one each for the eight days of Hanukkah, with the taller Shamash candle in the center, from which each of the eight others receive their light.
In other years, I might have walked past the whimsical, inflatable Hanukkah bear with little more than a passing glance. But, needless to say, not this year.
In the aftermath of the Bondi Beach Hanukkah Massacre of five days ago, every time I have passed the huge happy bear holding her HAPPY HANUKKAH sign beneath her brightly burning blow-up candles, I have stood still in the dawn and offered to God a prayer of solidarity with the two Beth Israel synagogues in my life – one in Macon, Georgia, the other in Jackson, Mississippi – and with all Jews in all congregations throughout the world; a sidewalk prayer of solidarity and lament.
Solidarity, lament and repentance.
Whenever there is another act of antisemitic violence, I always think, with deep sadness and quiet repentance, of all the ways the church has sown the bitter seed of bigotry against the Jews.
Hitler did not create the ghetto; we did. It was the church which, as early as the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, called for Jews to be segregated into confined quarters, the forerunner of the much later Nazi ghettos.

This, of course, came after the forced baptisms, synagogue burnings and massacres of Jews by Christians in the seventh through 11th centuries, and before Martin Luther’s dreadful sermon of 1543 in which he declared that, “Next to the devil, Christians have no enemy more cruel and venomous than a true Jew,” and Pope Paul IV’s declaration in 1555 that, “God has condemned the Jews to eternal slavery”.
All of that antisemitic history was rooted in what I call “Christian onlyism,” the institutionalized arrogance of Christianity’s misguided assumption that we “replaced” Judaism, and that we – conveniently enough for us – are the only religion God recognizes, which has allowed us, at our worst, to dehumanize persons of all other faith traditions, including, especially, the Jews; all of which is all the more inexplicable when we remember that Jesus was, himself, a Jew, not only at his birth but also at his death.
Every Christmas, Jesus is born again in a barn, again, with parents who are Jews, again; parents who will take him to the temple to be dedicated, and, when he is 12, back to the temple for Passover; the same Passover meal he will eat the night before he dies.
And yet, somehow, with a Jesus who never abandoned his lifelong Judaism (and who, as far as we know, never mentioned starting a new world religion called “Christianity”), Christianity helped create the antisemitism which has borne the bitter fruit of anti-Jewish bigotry and persecution, all of which came back to me while watching a row of inflatable pretend Hanukkah lights standing in the heartbreaking Hanukkah shadows of the devastating Hanukkah massacre of last Sunday in Australia; antisemitic violence, not from Christians on Bondi Beach, but, sadly, on so many other times.
So, before the waiting wicks of Hanukkah and Advent wear their last lights for another year, let us say, one more time, for the globe-circling, centuries-spanning church, to the globe-circling, centuries-spanning synagogue, “We are sorry.”
Amen.

Over the last two months, activists have increased their actions against an ICE office in the White Cap Business Park.

Activists ramped up their objections to federal immigration enforcement this week by dropping a bright yellow banner at a Williston business park where a digital surveillance operation run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials is located.
The banner, spread out across six windows of a building in the White Cap Business Park, read “ICE Violates Rights Here.” It was dropped on the night of Jan. 11 and removed by a cherry picker in the early morning hours of Jan. 12, according to activists who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. 
“ICE is currently using this office to spy on innocent people across the country and identify targets for kidnapping and deportation,” the anonymous activists wrote in a statement sent to VTDigger.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
The banner drop came four days after Renee Good, a mother in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was fatally shot by an ICE agent while driving her vehicle on Jan. 7. Protesters gathered in communities across Vermont over the weekend as part of nationwide “ICE Out for Good” vigils. 
Activists who asked to remain anonymous said the banner drop was in response to the death of Good, along with Keith Porter, who was shot by an off-duty ICE agent on New Year’s Eve, and the 32 deaths that have happened in ICE custody since January. 
The killing of Good, a U.S. citizen, took place during what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has called “the largest immigration enforcement operation ever,” when roughly 2,000 federal agents were sent to Minneapolis earlier this month. During President Donald Trump’s second term, ICE has become the largest and best-funded federal law enforcement agency in the country.

The expansion has led to a growth at ICE offices in Vermont. The Williston facility houses the National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which runs investigations including social media surveillance on the East Coast, while a similar facility, the Pacific Enforcement Response Center in Santa Ana, California, gathers intelligence on the West Coast. Personnel in the offices collect data from publicly accessible sources like social media to help ICE officials target individuals for arrest, according to a federal work order filed in October.
The banner came after a series of noise demonstrations outside the office meant to disrupt ICE surveillance work, according to activists. On an early morning in November, activists sounded their car alarms every 90 seconds, mimicking the rate of ICE arrests that happen every minute and a half, according to a flyer for the event. 
Two more noise demonstrations happened in December — the second captured on a social media account by the Party for Social Liberation — and were organized by other groups including Migrant Justice and the Green Mountain Democratic Socialists of America. Participation in the noise actions has ranged from small groups of 30 to large groups of about 300, according to Vivan Bose-Pyne, a member of the Party for Social Liberation who helped organize the demonstrations but said they were not involved in the banner drop.
“ICE has provided no response,” Bose-Pyne said. “They are aware that with enough public pressure they will not be able to carry out their goals.” 
Bose-Pyne said activists had been talking with building management and tenants, and have been told that ICE has a long-term contract. 
“(We) will continue the pressure on the landlord, the town of Williston and public officials, and the mass public to shut it down,” they said. 
The building is not the first in Vermont that’s been targeted by people dissatisfied with federal immigration enforcement actions.
In October, a Homeland Security building on Harvest Lane in Williston was vandalized with graffiti that included violent phrases like “shoot yourselves” and “die.” The graffiti came about a week after news broke of the department’s plans to expand  digital surveillance in Williston. The Harvest Lane facility was thought to be used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to reporting by The Boston Globe. 
The White Cap Business Park, less than 2 miles from Harvest Lane, also houses the Burlington District Office for the Vermont Department for Children and Families, along with a cafe, a bicycle tour operator, and a gym, among other businesses. 
Protesters have been calling the management agent for the White Cap facility and asking them to cancel the lease. The management agent did not respond to a request for comment before publication.

Lawmakers moved to strip tens of millions of dollars from a Wyoming Department of Health funding increase.
The post Tens of millions denied for Wyoming health department budget appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—In a budget markup session Tuesday, the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee moved to strip tens of millions of dollars in requested fund increases from the Wyoming Department of Health budget.
Led by Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and members aligned with the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, the JAC’s actions were rooted in a desire to stop the acceleration of government growth, even as some lawmakers warned the cuts could trigger costly lawsuits and harm the state’s most vulnerable citizens.
This division was showcased during the discussion of a $58 million reduction in federal spending authority for the Indian Health Service, a federal program responsible for providing health services and programs for Native Americans. The funds were intended to cover federally mandated All-Inclusive Rate increases for tribal medical facilities. 
Because the money is 100% federal funds, the cut does not save the state’s general fund any money, yet it prevents tribal facilities from receiving the higher reimbursement rates required by the federal government.
The move sparked strong pushback from some committee members. 
Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, warned that the refusal to adopt mandated rates was a legal land mine.
“Some of these actions are going to lead to lawsuits that probably cost us more money than it does save money,” Driskill said, adding that the state has a constitutional obligation to care for those who cannot care for themselves. “What you’re doing is denying health care. If that’s what you want to do, you own it.”
Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, echoed these concerns, noting that medical costs are rising for everyone.
“I understand the theory about stopping [government] acceleration … but what you’re doing is, while trying to slow down the train, you’re throwing our tribal members under it,” he said, calling the proposed cuts “draconian.”
Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, who proposed many of the day’s largest cuts, defended the stance by quoting a Ronald Reagan fiscal philosophy.
“We have become addicted to government intervention, and a lot of people have become dependent upon government,” he said.
Pendergraft argued that his motions were necessary to prevent a future fiscal “wreck” by slamming the brakes on spending increases now.
Chairman Bear supported this view, stating, “Any time you increase spending in government, any time you are putting a burden on the taxpayer … somebody needs to look out for the taxpayer.”
The JAC voted to remove the $58 million in exception funds requested by the health department. The Indian Health Service did not respond to a request for comment before publication time.
This anti-acceleration strategy extended to maternity and OB services. Lawmakers voted to deny an $8.5 million general fund increase and an $8.5 million federal match intended to raise reimbursement rates to 100% of cost for Critical Access Hospitals that maintain labor-and-delivery units.
Driskill criticized the cut as a “death by 1,000 cuts” that would force expecting mothers to deliver in neighboring states like Utah or South Dakota.
“If there’s not maternity care, you’re not going to live in Wyoming,” he said. “… It’s painful to go through withdrawal. It’s also painful to kill your state one piece at a time, and we’re working on that.”
However, Rep. Abby Angelos, R-Gillette, argued that reimbursement rates weren’t the root issue, pointing instead to malpractice insurance costs. She suggested that funding might be found elsewhere, specifically through the Rural Health Transformation Program. At the end of 2025, Wyoming was awarded $205 million in federal funds for the first year of the five-year program.
The committee also approved several other multi-million-dollar cuts, including removing $344 million in federal funds for the Rural Health Transformation Program from the biennium budget, with the intent to run it as an independent bill to ensure legislative oversight.

Senate Bill 7, sponsored by Sen. Aaron Reed, R-Shelbyville, gained a slew of GOP co-sponsors after it was filed Tuesday. Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald Neal, of Louisville, is also co-sponsoring the legislation. 
Return to ‘local control’ of driver’s license renewals is a priority for KY Senate GOP

“Unless you have a regional office in your backyard, every one of us has heard the same message from constituents that the current driver’s license system is not meeting the needs of Kentucky,” Reed said. “We have long drives, long lines and repeated delays that have created real frustration across the commonwealth.” 
The bill received unanimous approval in the Senate Transportation Committee after Reed presented it. The committee chairman, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, had appeared with Reed at a Tuesday press conference about the legislation. 
Reed’s bill comes in response to reports of delays in getting appointments at regional offices, extended wait times and long drives to offices for rural Kentuckians. Kentucky has 34 regional offices that issue and renew driver’s licenses. 
Under the legislation, drivers would still have to go to a regional office for an initial license. Counties without a regional office could choose a local official to offer license renewal and duplication services. 
Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester said that his local circuit clerk and county clerk have expressed interest in offering the services. 
“I was concerned that we may not get people that wanted to do it, and that doesn’t seem to be the case,” Elkins added. 
Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, noted Neal’s support for the bill along with 27 Republicans and called the legislation “truly a bipartisan bill.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-14 18:53:06+00:00,Mississippi Today,Federal proposal could limit loans for nursing grad students. Experts say that could worsen health care staffing shortages in Mississippi,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/14/loans-nursing-grad-students-staff/,"Tomekia Luckett poses for a portrait Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026, at Southwest Mississippi Community College in Summit, Miss.","Tomekia Luckett’s journey to becoming a mental health nurse practitioner — pursuing a bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degree while raising triplets — was made possible by federal student loans and scholarships. But she fears proposed new caps on those loans could make the path she took more treacherous for the next generation of nurses.
Beginning in July, graduate students across all disciplines will face stricter limits on federal loans under a provision in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
The law directed the U.S. Department of Education to identify “professional degree” programs, which will be eligible for higher loan caps. A draft rule released by the agency excludes graduate nursing programs from the designation, a decision that could subject such students to tighter borrowing limits. These programs train nurse practitioners and certified nurse anesthetists, professionals who help fill critical gaps in Mississippi’s physician workforce.
“I am very concerned as a person who was a first-generation college student,” said Luckett, who treats patients across rural southwest Mississippi and has taught nursing for more than a decade. “If those caps had been in place, there would very likely not be a Dr. Luckett today.” 
Luckett, who spoke to Mississippi Today in a personal capacity, serves as the associate dean for nursing continuing professional development at Walden University and as director of the Mississippi Nurses’ Association’s Council on Nursing Education. 
The federal Department of Education plans to finalize the rule classifying professional degree programs “early this year,” according to its website. But experts and advocates warn that the draft rules — which halve the amount of federal student loans nursing students can receive compared to doctors, dentists and lawyers — could create barriers for nurses seeking advanced education and threaten the stability of the nursing workforce nationwide.
“By limiting the loans, that will make it more difficult for people who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to be able to afford going to nursing school and a career in nursing,” said Vincent Guilamo-Ramos, a nurse practitioner and executive director of the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing Institute for Policy Solutions. 
Under the draft rules, “professional degree” programs will be capped at a $200,000 borrowing limit. Nursing graduate students would be capped at half that amount — a maximum of $100,000, or $20,500 a year. Current borrowers will be permitted to continue receiving loans under existing rules for three years or the length of their program. 
The Trump administration said not classifying graduate nursing as a  “professional degree” — a decision that has caused outrage among some nurses — is a technical and regulatory decision, not a “value judgement about the importance of programs,” according to a post on the U.S. Department of Education website.
The department said the new caps on loans won’t have a widespread impact, noting that 95% of nursing students borrow below the annual loan limit, according to the agency’s data, and that 80% of the nursing workforce does not have a graduate degree. 
Since 2007, graduate and professional students have been allowed to borrow up to the full cost of attendance through the federal Graduate PLUS program. These changes have allowed schools to inflate their tuition and saddle students with debts, the Trump administration said.
The changes could make the nursing workforce less representative of the people they serve, and contribute to existing health care workforce shortages, Guilamo-Ramos said. Studies show that a representative and diverse health care system improves health outcomes and access to care for patients. Researchers have shown that patients are more likely to receive preventive care they need and agree to recommended care when their doctors have a similar racial or cultural background to them.
Antonia M. Villarruel, the dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, said in a statement to Mississippi Today she expects the new loan caps to have “devastating effects” on the preparation of graduate-level nurses and nursing educators, and that these limits will contribute to increased shortages of primary care providers, especially in rural areas.
“This impacts both access to care for all Americans and the ability of schools and universities to continue to educate this group of professionals that will result in faculty shortages,” Villarruel said. 
Crystal Joslin, a registered nurse from Corinth who works at a rural hospital and a nursing home, said she aims to advance her career by becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner. Working shifts at the hospital’s medical-surgical unit and emergency room, she often sees patients with serious mental health needs, and she hopes to further her education to assist her community. 
News of the proposed federal loan caps made her second guess her plan to attend a master’s program at the University of North Alabama later this year. She considered delaying her career plans to save up. But she said she has decided to persist — and will pay the portion of her tuition that is not covered by loans out-of-pocket — in order to help her community and advance her career. 
“I didn’t really want to wait the extra couple of years,” she said. “Of course, my work as an RN, I can definitely be doing that. But I feel like there’s nurses to educate out there, and there’s patients to help. …There’s more things that I could be doing with my education and my knowledge that I wouldn’t be getting to do.”
Critics of the caps argue that while the changes may limit students’ debt, they will also limit students’ access to education.
“It would be nice if I could have less debt, but at the same time, I wouldn’t have the education I have,” Luckett said. 
Guilamo-Ramos said he does not expect universities to lower their tuition as a result of the changes. Nursing education must comply with strict requirements that make programs more costly to run, like student-to-faculty ratios. 
“I think what will happen is that over time just people who can afford to attend will attend,” Guilamo-Ramos said. “And that’s bad for all of us.”
The draft loan caps have generated bipartisan dissent. In a Dec. 12 letter to U.S. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent, a bipartisan group of nearly 150 congressional lawmakers expressed support for including nursing degrees in the department’s definition of “professional degree.” The effort was spearheaded by several lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, co-chair of the Senate nursing caucus. 
“At a time when our nation is facing a health care shortage, especially in primary care, now is not the time to cut off the student pipeline to these programs,” wrote the group of U.S. senators and representatives. 
Mississippi has one of the lowest rates of physicians per capita in the nation, and the gap is expected to grow over time. In rural areas, nurse practitioners often fill gaps left when there is not a physician.National research shows that the share of Medicare visits delivered by physician assistants and nurse practitioners nearly doubled between 2013 and 2019. Rural family physicians are more likely to partner with these clinicians to meet patient care needs.
Certified nurse anesthetists also help address critical care shortages, performing about 70% to 90% of procedures compared to their physician counterparts in Mississippi, according to Public Health and Human Services Chairman Rep. Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, speaking during a House floor session last year. 
Mississippi is currently facing a shortage of nurse anesthetists, and that gap is expected to grow over the next decade, according to data from Health Resources and Service Administration. Today, Mississippi is lacking about 90 needed nurse anesthetists, but by 2035, that figure is expected to grow to 140 — meaning only 76% of needed positions will be filled.
Guilamo-Ramos said he hopes that the new student loan provisions will spur nursing schools to consider ways to make tuition costs affordable for more students apart from loans. 
“Schools of nursing need to take a hard look at the cost of tuition and make it more affordable,” he said. “And we need to improve our scholarships, and we need to improve other kinds of aid besides loans.”
Graduate nursing programs in Mississippi range in cost. The Mississippi University for Women offers one graduate nursing program, for family nurse practitioners. The program costs about $4,300 per semester and takes about three semesters to complete, according to the school’s website. Because the cost of the program is below the cap, the draft rule would not impact students attending this program. 
Brandy Larmon, the dean of the College of Nursing, said the school is assessing the potential risks of the loan caps, but is not currently concerned due to the short length of the program and low cost of attendance. 
Other graduate nursing student programs, and especially nurse anesthesia programs, can be more costly and take more time to complete. The University of Southern Mississippi’s graduate nurse anesthesia program costs about $30,000 annually, according to a spokesperson, and takes three years to complete.
If enacted, Guilamo-Ramos said he expects the proposed caps on student loans to affect advanced practice nurse staffing levels and exacerbate faculty shortages as soon as within the next one to two years. 
He added that the impact could be especially significant in Mississippi and across the South, where workforce shortages are already severe and health outcomes lag behind other regions.
“It worries me deeply that we would be losing nursing workforce in the very places that we need to have more people,” Guilamo-Ramos said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen asked state lawmakers for support Wednesday in making “difficult” changes to the state judicial branch’s magistrate system and employee compensation structure.
She spoke to a joint session of the Legislature in her annual Condition of the Judiciary address.
Christensen said as she was preparing for her remarks ahead of the 2026 legislative session, there was one major theme she wanted to highlight: Leadership. In the past year, she said she spoke with leaders in the state executive and legislative branches about the issues facing the judicial branch, and the challenges they faced as leaders in Iowa.
“Across every conversation, the message was unmistakable, ‘do what you believe is right, even when it is not popular, and when difficult decisions must be made, explain yourself,'” Christensen said. “That is what I will do today.”
Christensen shared a change made in the state judicial branch in the summer of 2025 — changes to the employment classification and compensation structure. She said the state court administration, working with a consultant, reexamined how the more than 1,500 workers are defined and paid in the current system and made changes which “sparked a lot of grumbling” throughout the system.
The review found while overall compensation was competitive for most positions, it also found roughly a quarter of judicial staff were underpaid compared to comparable government jobs, and roughly 10% were paid at or above what data shows their job and duties receive. Based on these assessments and recommendations made by the consultant, Christiansen said the system reduced job classifications from 140 to 82, standardized pay grades and raised the minimum salary for the 25% of jobs evaluated as underpaid.
However, these changes were not universally popular.
“Change can be uncomfortable, and for some it feels personal,” Christensen said. “But we could no longer ignore a long-standing pay practice that unintentionally favored some while others, often just as dedicated, were underpaid for years. That is difficult to sustain, particularly in a publicly funded system.”
The changes made to the system’s job classification and compensation structure caused both positive impacts — “almost overnight, the number of applicants for judicial branch positions soared,” Christensen said — as well as negative impacts, as many longtime employees were “deeply disappointed by shortened pay ranges or the loss of automatic reclassification based on years of service.”
“We need to work on that,” Christensen said. “Experienced staff is just as important as recruiting new talent.”
The judicial branch is requesting $1 million to address salary compression caused by the recent restructuring, saying this funding will allow the judicial system to more equitably and competitively pay long-term branch employees.
Christensen requests support for revamping magistrate system
The chief justice said the second “monumental decision” the court system took on in the past year was the modernization of Iowa’s magistrate system.
Christensen also brought up a need to change Iowa’s magistrate system in her 2025 address. Magistrates are the part-time judicial officials with the authority to conduct preliminary hearings and issue search warrants. Serving the county they reside in or a neighboring county, these officials, who serve four-year terms, preside over cases including simple misdemeanors, evictions, small claims and involuntary commitment proceedings. For most defendants, a magistrate is the first judicial officer a defendant will see, Christensen said.
While magistrates play an important role in Iowa’s judicial system, Christensen said the branch was proposing reducing the number of required magistrates in the state system. Current Iowa statute requires 206 magistrates statewide, she said, a provision the judicial system proposes eliminating, alongside the requirement that each county is required to have at least one magistrate.
“Today, it no longer reflects the workload reality,” Christensen said. “in fact, we have perhaps 60 more magistrates than the work requires. That is not sustainable.”
Currently in Iowa, these officers appointed to serve four-year terms are expected to devote roughly a third of their professional time to serving the judicial branch, and are free to practice law or earn additional income through other employment during the other two-thirds of their work week. Because of that division, magistrates are paid $46,611 a year — 31% of the pay a judge, who is required to serve on a bench full time and cannot practice law.
However, she said, this pay structure does not make sense, as the workload of the magistrates currently required under Iowa law “means we are paying nearly $600,000 each year in salary and benefit costs for work that does not equal one full-time position.”
The judicial branch’s proposal would assign magistrates to a judicial district rather than a county, and would allow the state court administration to determine how many magistrates are needed in each judicial district and subdistrict based on a county’s case filings and recent time study.  It would also increase the devoted workload for magistrates from one-third of their work week to 40%, or two days, she said. These changes, modeled after the state’s system for trial court judges, would allow the state to more effectively address the needs of Iowa courts, Christensen said.
“Change is never easy,” Christensen said. “But I am confident this is the right step for our courts. With your support, we can streamline and right-size the magistrate system, improve how the work is administered and save a minimum of $2.5 million annually for the judicial branch.”
Judicial pay and indigent defense concerns return
The changes to Iowa’s magistrate system was not the only issue Christensen repeated from previous years’ addresses. She said the issues of judicial pay and indigent defense “remain unresolved” in the state, and will cause problems if not addressed.
“I am committed to bringing up these issues until we move beyond discussion and see meaningful progress,” she said.
Low judicial pay in Iowa is leading to fewer applicants applying for judicial openings across the state, she said, which reduces the quality of applicants filling important roles in Iowa. She pointed to a district court judge opening in April 2025 for District 8A in southeast Iowa, where only two attorneys applied to fill the position.
“Keep in mind, the job of a judicial nominating commission is to review all applicants and send the two most qualified candidates to the governor,” Christensen said. “But when there are only two applicants, it’s a guarantee both are going to the governor, regardless of their resumes, regardless of experience, regardless of temperament.”
She said Iowa is a “whisper away” from having openings where only one applicant applies to fill a position, stripping a judicial nominating commission or the governor of the ability to meaningfully evaluate whether a person is well-suited to fill the position.
Christensen said the state was requesting an increase in pay for judicial officers of at least 4.3% in fiscal year 2027 to cover the cost-of-living growth and recover “at least a portion of the purchasing power judges have lost in recent years.” The funding would result in a total increase of $2,256,477 for judicial officer salaries, according to the state court administration.
This is a decreased request from last year’s proposal, which sought to link district court judges’ salaries to 75% of a federal judge’s salary. This proposal would have amounted to a 10.2% increase in pay, she said.
“We recognize that would be a big step in a single year, but couldn’t we begin to close the gap?”
She also said while indigent defense pay is not a part of the judicial branch’s budget, the underfunding of contract attorneys providing indigent defense “has a profound impact on our courts.” She called for Legislature to take action on this issue, saying “like judicial pay, this isn’t tomorrow’s problem, it’s today’s reality.”
As an example, she brought up a June 1, 2025, criminal complaint in Davenport where a man, who had a prior Operating While Intoxicated conviction and was driving without a license, was arrested for driving the wrong direct on a one-way street by an officer who noted slow, slurred speech and open containers of beer and whiskey in the vehicle. After being arrested, the defended requested and qualified for court-appointed counsel, but there were no attorneys available. After two and a half months, without the appointment of an attorney, his case was dismissed.
“Could this happen in an OWI case that ended up killing someone? Or a sexual abuse case involving a child? Of course it could,” Christensen said. “If we cannot hold criminal defendants accountable, Iowans are at risk. We are playing with fire.”

Lander police arrested Bureau of Land Management officer Richard “Deak” Dollard in connection with a fight at the Maverick Lounge that resulted in the death of Lander resident Evan Denevan. 
The post Law enforcement officer faces murder charge for Lander bar fight death  appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal law enforcement officer Richard “Deak” Dollard faces second-degree murder charges for a Friday night fight in a Lander bar that resulted in the death of local resident Evan Denevan, court documents show. 
Two other men, Jesse Dollard and Justin Dollard, were also arrested Tuesday and face accessory to second-degree murder charges. Justin and Richard are brothers. Justin is Jesse’s father. 
Investigators say Richard Dollard is a “certified law enforcement officer.” Lander Police Chief Kelly Waugh told the Lander City Council on Tuesday that Richard Dollard worked for the Bureau of Land Management, according to several reports. A LinkedIn account identifies him as a field staff law enforcement ranger. 
At about 11:15 Friday night, the Lander Police Department received a call about a fight at the Maverick Lounge on Lander’s Main Street. According to investigators’ account of the incident in court affidavits, the caller told police that Denevan was “not breathing, he’s all purple.” 
When officers arrived, they saw Denevan lying on his back in a corner of the lounge near the pool tables, investigators say. Bystanders were trying to render aid to Denevan, and the officers began giving medical care. Officers didn’t feel Denevan’s carotid pulse. Medics arrived, but Denevan ultimately died from his injuries. 
Several witnesses at the scene told officers that Richard Dollard had choked Denevan, the affidavits state. 
Investigators say they reviewed video footage preceding the fight that showed Jesse becoming “visibly upset” and gesturing toward Denevan. The affidavits describe what happened next: 
Bystanders held Jesse Dollard back. Justin Dollard approached Denevan. Denevan removed his hat and glasses. They appeared to argue. Justin Dollard then pushed Denevan in the chest. Denevan fell backward against a wall and then advanced toward Justin Dollard. People tried to separate the two. 
Jesse Dollard then approached Denevan and punched him as Denevan punched back. Bystanders pushed Jesse Dollard back as Justin Dollard advanced and also punched Denevan. 
According to the affidavits, Richard Dollard then approached the area and put his arm around Denevan’s neck, choking him from behind. While Richard Dollard choked Denevan, Justin Dollard was pulling Denevan’s sweatshirt hood over Denevan’s head, moving Denevan’s head and neck in the opposite direction from Richard Dollard’s grip, authorities say. 
Richard Dollard held the choke for roughly 26 to 27 seconds before appearing to fall and release his grip, investigators allege. Denevan fell to the floor. Witnesses said that Justin Dollard then kicked Denevan in the torso. 
The Dollards moved back to the other side of the bar. Jesse Dollard later told detectives that the Dollards “began getting ‘death threats’ and left the area.” None of them tried to help Denevan. 
Justin Dollard told detectives in an interview that Denevan had previously said he would “whip” him and “has threatened to fight” Justin Dollard and his son Jesse Dollard. Justin Dollard said that Denevan began yelling at him and Jesse Dollard, telling them “if you come over here, I will kick your ass.” 
The Lander Police Department worked with the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation and the Fremont County Attorney’s Office to conduct the investigation. Waugh previously told WyoFile that the division became involved to provide more resources and “boots on the ground.”

Spartz,Tom Davies,,,,,https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/briefs/democratic-legislator-seeks-to-challenge-gop-rep-spartz/,Democratic state Sen. J.D.

Ford, D-Indianapolis, speaks with reporters at the Indiana Statehouse on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Democratic state Sen. J.D. Ford is aiming for a jump to Congress with a challenge to Republican U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz.
Ford announced his bid Wednesday for central Indiana’s 5th Congressional District seat, where Spartz is running for a fourth term.
“The fact that we are still dealing with prices that are skyrocketing, the fact that we watched Congress take away health care subsidies for people, that’s going to have a drastic impact,” Ford told reporters. “I just couldn’t sit quietly. I couldn’t stand by the sidelines anymore.” 
Spartz will have the advantage of incumbency in the district that was redrawn to strengthen its Republican lean following her narrow 2020 general election win for her first term.
Spartz easily won the 2024 election following a tight Republican primary victory with 39% of the vote after reversing her previous announcement that she wouldn’t seek reelection.
Spartz’s campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment Wednesday about Ford’s entry into the race.

Spartz filed her paperwork for reelection on Monday and no prominent Republican primary challengers have emerged.
“Our nation will soon face significant fiscal challenges, and my extensive expertise on fiscal issues and health care will be greatly needed in Congress,” Spartz said in a Monday campaign statement. “Too many people are running for office with corrupt personal agendas and radical policies that have been destructive to our country and undermine President Trump’s conservative agenda, and we cannot allow them to prevail — too many Americans have sacrificed for our freedoms.”
Ford, who is the first and only openly gay member of the General Assembly, will have to give up the legislative seat that he first won in 2018 for a congressional run since his Senate district is also up for election this year. 
Ford said he believed he could make a credible challenge to Spartz, pointing to his success in winning what had long been a Republican Senate district covering northeastern Indianapolis and the Carmel and Zionsville areas.
 “People are going to tell me that the 5th District is unwinnable, I would just tell them, watch me,” Ford said.
He said he was motivated to challenge Spartz during the failed push demanded by Trump for redrawing Indiana’s U.S. House districts, which was supported by Spartz and rest of the state’s Republican congressional delegation.
Todd Shelton of Pendleton, a web development instructor at Indiana University Indianapolis and a veteran, has also filed as a candidate in the Democratic primary.
Ford’s residence in Indianapolis is outside the congressional district, which is not a legal requirement to run for Congress. He told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that he was connected with the congressional district since it included the Carmel portion of his legislative district.
“My commitment is that, when I’m successful, that I will move into the district,” Ford said.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19F6EA93-7DFF-4E7B-8323-872FA9B0F481_1_201_a-1024x605.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 13:59:50.168611

Free.,Democrats in Congress seek to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-congress-seek-impeach-homeland-security-secretary-kristi-noem,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Democrats Wednesday introduced three articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, after a deadly shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer.The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment. The three articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country. The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities. A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December. Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district. “We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action. In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies. The Senate, then controlled by Democrats, dismissed the articles of impeachment.",,,,2026-01-14 13:59:50.168611

Doing so could “reduce and avoid ER visits,” Sen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, told the Senate Health Services Committee Wednesday morning. 
His proposal, Senate Bill 38, passed unanimously out of the committee and can now go to the floor for a full vote. 
“This bill allows for Medicaid to reimburse pharmacists under their current legal scope of practice for services they already provide,” Richardson said. “And what that will do is, we believe, reduce Medicaid rates by allowing a lower cost provider to have access to patients and members in the community, instead of having them go to emergency rooms.” 
An August 2025 report from the Legislative Research Commission (LRC) found that 90% of Kentuckians live within five miles of a community pharmacy while the state faces a shortage of primary care physicians. 
The state is expected to have a shortage of nearly 3,000 physicians by 2030, according to that report. 
“It is proven through research that a pharmacist will have greater contact with those members in the community than a primary care provider or other other providers,” Richardson said. “We know that this bill, especially in rural Kentucky, will give pharmacists a chance to increase our health care outcomes, lower our Medicaid expenses over, I think, a short term, including a long term, and give us greater access and greater health care outcomes.”

House Bill 2426, she said, would add to the danger those individuals face. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bill that would ban gender changes on Kansas driver’s licenses and birth certificates drew hundreds of opponent comments despite appearing on a committee agenda just 24 hours before the Tuesday hearing. 
The House Judiciary Committee heard public testimony about House Bill 2426, introduced by committee chair Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, that would make the terms “gender” and “sex” equivalent in state law. 
Opponents asked lawmakers to vote down the bill, citing concerns about the safety and mental health of transgender individuals. Proponents focused on challenges for law enforcement and medical personnel when the gender isn’t correct on the driver’s license.   
Under HB 2426, transgender Kansans would be barred from changing their gender on birth certificates and driver’s licenses. The bill would invalidate documents already issued with new gender markers and require anyone who previously changed their gender to get new documents stating their biological sex at birth. 
People in favor of and against the bill filled the hearing room, with most in favor citing 
Attorney General Kris Kobach, who lost a court case on appeal after defending a 2023 bill that banned gender changes on driver’s licenses, reserved 12 seats in the crowded committee room and spoke first to push for the bill’s passage. 
Kobach walked legislators through what happened with the lawsuit that was overturned on appeal and how this bill would keep the state from returning to court. He also claimed Kansas statutes have “always” used the terms sex and gender interchangeably, a sentiment the Court of Appeals did not agree with.
“Now today, in the midst of the trans issue and the controversies that surround it, sometimes people have taken to using those words as referring to different things, gender referring to a subjective mental assessment of what one is,” Kobach said.
Gender is a social and personal identity or expression, while sex refers to reproductive systems.

Bill proponents
Two medical professionals, retired plastic surgeon Richard Bosshardt, a fellow at Do No Harm, and Wichita physician Michelle Baalmann, spoke in favor of the bill. Do No Harm is a national organization focused on identity politics and its effects on medical care. 
A spokeswoman for the Kansas Catholic Conference, representing the Catholic bishops of Kansas, also spoke in favor of the bill. 
“There are differences in medical emergencies and differential diagnosis of pathologies. Gender does matter,” Baalmann said. “It is like a vital sign when treating a patient, especially in a life-threatening emergency. If we were to remove this from the driver’s license and change it to a subjective choice that the person is making, you’re essentially blinding emergency responders and emergency physicians.”
Bob Stuart, executive officer for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, told the committee that accurate information on a driver’s license makes the job of law enforcement easier in terms of identification and de-escalating situations. 
“Not having the right sex on a driver’s license is one of those things that makes it more difficult for law enforcement to do their job correctly and to do it safely, not only for law enforcement, but for the subjects that we’re trying to either arrest or clear and let go on their way,” he said. 
Rep. John Carmichael, a Wichita Democrat, questioned the validity of that statement, pointing out that one of his constituents is a transgender male with a full beard. 
“He is, by all appearances, a man,” Carmichael said. “How would putting an F on his driver’s license help you out? … If you look at his picture, you stop him on the road, he gives you his driver’s license. He’s a hairy-faced man. That’s what shows on his driver’s license. That’s what the officer sees in front of them right now. His driver’s license says he’s an M and it all fits together.”
“It helps make the correct decision,” Stuart said, repeating a phrase he had used to answer a previous question. 
Carmichael responded, “That’s the best you can do, Bob, I guess that’s the best you can do.”
The exchange earned an admonition from Humphries to be respectful of people who were testifying.   
 
Opponent testimony
Opponents of the bill were peppered throughout the crowded committee room, and Rep. Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, said his office received more than 300 written comments before the hearing. 
Elise and Jay Flatland of Olathe testified about the importance of accurate gender markers for two of their four children, who are transgender. 
“Some people have taken the approach that my kids are confused, that they should fix the wiring,” Jay Flatland said. “There’s no fixing the wiring in my kids. So I want to correct that. I hear that a lot, that these kids are confused and people are confused. It’s not the case.”
A driver’s license is an “artifact of expression” about her gender that makes his daughter feel good, he said. 
“I don’t think we’re emphasizing enough why people want this,” Jay Flatland said. “This is why.” 
Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light Civic Action, spoke against the bill, challenging the idea that being transgender is a “new thing.” 
“This idea that it is one or the other is a fairly isolated worldview,” Stiehler said. “Historically, in Judaism, they have recognized more than just male or female. While that may not be the current modern practice, that goes to show that what is new right now, in this moment in time, is this trans-panic hysteria that’s coming from a small but very vocal minority of narrow-minded proponents.”

@ksreflectorA House Judiciary committee hearing on Kansas House Bill 2426 Tuesday drew a standing room only crowd, including Attorney General Kris Kobach who told the committee he was in favor of the legislation that required Kansans to use their biological sex at birth on driver’s licenses and birth certificates. The bill drew hundreds of written letters in opposition and multiple proponents to testify.♬ original sound – Kansas Reflector



Increasing violence
Stiehler said hate-based violence against transgender individuals has increased 340% since 2015. She and others who testified raised concerns that not allowing gender on the driver’s license to match the appearance of individuals would open them to violence.
“This has become so much of an issue that, because state legislatures such as this one are passing laws based on propaganda, based on misinformation, based on Twitter conspiracy theories – this national trend of legislating based on this is alarming enough that globally renowned scholars have issued a warning this week that the United States is in early stages of genocide against trans Americans,” Stiehler said.
Matthew Obold-Geary, who testified against the bill, said transgender Kansans already face disproportionately higher rates of discrimination, harassment and barriers to health care. 
“Legislation that undermines their legal identity contributes to stigmatize and can exacerbate mental health challenges,” he said. “Bills like this send a message that their identities are not respected or recognized under state law. Thirdly, HB 2426 has some practical problems and some legal uncertainty.”
Obold-Geary questioned how the state would handle the cost of re-issuing driver’s licenses and birth certificates, and the confusion if a person has federal documents with their correct gender but their biological sex at birth on their driver’s license. 
Humphries said the fiscal note for the bill has not been completed. 
 
Rushing through
The hearing was scheduled at 3:58 p.m. Monday, just under the required deadline for giving notice, according to Woodard.
Humphries said she had been hopeful to hear the bill during a special session in the fall, which did not occur. 
“When that didn’t happen, we said, well, we just need to get it done as soon as possible,” she said. “The first week, I have a lot going on in Judiciary. I don’t have any bills ready to be heard this week, but this was ready.”
Carmichael disagreed with that explanation. 
“This is happening so quickly because it’s a railroad job,” he said. “The committee chair wants to move her bill as fast as possible. She introduced it on the first day of the session yesterday; we heard the bill today. We heard the bill without the benefit of the written testimony of hundreds of Kansans who took the trouble to write to the committee to express their opinions.”
Humphries said the bill would not be voted on Wednesday so that committee members would have time to read all of the testimony submitted. While Carmichael said he appreciated the time to read submissions, he thinks the legislation will “pass the House within the next week.”
Carmichael also challenged the testimony Kobach gave before the committee about the Kansas Court of Appeals decision regarding changing gender markers on driver’s licenses. 
The Court of Appeals determined Kobach showed no irreparable harm to the state if gender markers were changed.
“That was one of the most astonishing parts of the Court of Appeals opinion, because we did present evidence of irreparable harm,” the attorney general told the committee. “We presented evidence from law enforcement officers both from Shawnee County and Johnson County, indicating actual examples of where people who had an arrest warrant out for them had attempted to either change the sex or appear to change the sex, or taken steps to so the arrest warrant is out for a male to hold themselves out as female.”
Carmichael said after the hearing that the attorney general “terribly mischaracterized the Court of Appeals decision.” 
“If you read the opinion, you will find that there are five to 10 pages in the 56-page opinion describing each witness’s testimony and explaining why the Attorney General’s witnesses did not meet the burden of proof because, in the end, those witnesses actually ended up supporting the state’s position,” he said.
Carmichael and Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, D-Overland Park, were the most critical of the attorney general’s testimony. 
Carmichael said it’s likely “this very bad bill” will pass.
“That does not mean that this bill will survive appellate scrutiny,” he said. “I could sit here and write a fine legal brief showing multiple problems with this, not only constitutional problems, but just simple, basic lawyerly drafting problems as well. This has been rushed.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Loud-Light-120260113_1651040-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-14 13:59:50.168611

“This is a prostate screening bill that we had handled last year that went downstairs to the House and got tied up at the end of the session and was unable to get out,” Livingston said during the committee meeting.

The 2025 version of the bill was approved by the Senate and committees in both chambers by the end of April. It was never considered by the full House. 
The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,440 men in Alabama will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year. It also estimates that 10% of those will die from the disease. 
Jane Adams, government relations director for ACS Cancer Action Now in Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday that early screenings for prostate cancer, as well as colon and breast cancer, can significantly improve outcomes.
“It’s a movement that’s happening across the country to eliminate these cost sharing barriers,” Adams said. “If you detect your prostate cancer early, it’s very treatable, but a late detection, or late stage of that cancer is terminal.”
According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are at higher risk for the disease. The mortality rate for prostate cancer was 18.7 per 100,000 men in 2022, half of what it was in 1993. The 5-year survival rate for the disease is 100% for the majority of men diagnosed with localized- or regional-stage prostate cancer, but drops to 37% for those diagnosed with distant-stage disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The 10-year survival rate for all stages combined is 98%.
The bill only applies the cost-sharing elimination to patients who have a father, brother or son with a prostate diagnosis or cause of death; Black men, and men over fifty. 
“Having to pay a co-payment or deductible is a barrier to getting this screening, which the prostate antigen screening is the most cutting edge screening that there is,” Adams said. “We wanted to eliminate the cost sharing responsibility.”

Brown is one of numerous former public employees charged with crimes over the past two years in South Dakota. One former Department of Social Services employee, Lonna Carroll was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of $1.8 million from the state across multiple years. Other former state employees have been accused or found guilty of charges such as forging food service inspections, falsifying child abuse reports, creating false vehicle titles and issuing themselves a medical marijuana card.

Significant breakdowns in retirement procedures allowed police and fire officials to collect pension payouts despite records of misconduct that should have barred or reduced those awards, the state comptroller said in a report released Wednesday.
The report found 21 of the roughly 60 Police and Firemen’s Retirement System members with misconduct records examined in the report did not undergo the required honorable service reviews that weigh whether their benefits should be reduced.
“These 21 former officers are the ones we found. We don’t know how many are out there who committed misconduct and are getting full pensions simply because no one told the pension board what they did wrong,” said acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh.

The pension fund’s board has since conducted honorable service reviews for nearly all 21 of those officers, the report says. Four had their pensions partially reduced, though one reduction was later reversed, according to the report.
Under New Jersey law, public pensions are conditioned on honorable service, and the law permits pension boards to reduce or bar pension benefits for public workers who commit misconduct.
Certain offenses like official misconduct, sexual assault, and certain bribery charges, among numerous others, demand that pensions be automatically forfeited, and some of the officials who improperly received benefits faced serious allegations, including an officer charged and later convicted of possessing child pornography.
“These were not insignificant cases of misconduct,” the report says.
Walsh’s office contends that breakdowns occurred at multiple levels. Local employees tasked with sharing information about members’ misconduct with state officials frequently didn’t, the comptroller said, partly because they were often unaware of the breadth of their responsibility.
They wrongly believed information about criminal matters or civil service discipline would automatically flow to the state division that oversees pensions and benefits, or failed to report past discipline out of a belief that resolved matters should not affect a worker’s ability to retire, the report says.
The confidentiality of internal affairs files likewise contributed to the oversights, according to the comptroller. Though state pension officials can obtain those documents, employers have no affirmative duty to provide them absent a request in most circumstances, and local employees responsible for sharing information about misconduct may lack access to them entirely, the report says.
“If the pension board is not affirmatively provided with the information, it will not know to request it in order to evaluate honorable service prior to awarding a pension to a retiring member. In turn, in many instances, the pension board will unknowingly fail to fulfill its statutory and fiduciary duties,” the report says.
In other cases, settlement agreements between officers and their employers improperly shielded misconduct records in violation of state law that requires employers to share agreements that stem from misconduct claims with pension officials.
Some agreements reviewed by the comptroller mischaracterized time officers spent suspended for misconduct as service time that contributed to the size of their pension, according to the report. Others improperly allowed members who were not permitted to work due to misconduct to use vacation or sick time to boost their length of service and secure more lucrative pensions, the report says.
These missteps came with costs, according to the comptroller. Improper pension payments to even a single member can total hundreds of thousands of dollars, weakening the overall health of pension funds.
Though the local part of the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System of New Jersey is better funded than other New Jersey public pensions, the fund is not expected to reach full funding in the next quarter-century, according to state pension documents.
The state’s pension and benefits division and the pension fund should amend regulations to require that employers share misconduct-related documents like plea agreements, investigative reports, and toxicology reports, among dozens of others, the report recommends.
They should require members to self-report any disciplinary matters they faced throughout the length of their enrollment in the pension system and conduct internal audits to identify those who did not undergo an honorable service review, the report says.
The Legislature should consider making those requirements law and allow the attorney general to periodically audit settlement agreements between retired police officers and firefighters and their employers, the comptroller’s report says.

Andy Beshear — has been filed in previous […],"Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, speaks on the Senate floor, Feb, 4, 2025. (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A Northern Kentucky Republican senator has again introduced a bill to limit pardon powers of Kentucky governors around election time.
The bill — a response by lawmakers to controversial pardons issued by former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin after losing the 2019 election to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear — has been filed in previous years by Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, but has never gained passage in the House. 
McDaniel has championed the legislation, Senate Bill 10, for now a seventh time since Bevin issued a flurry of pardons to people convicted of crimes including rape, murder and child abuse after losing the election and shortly before leaving office that December.
SB 10 proposes a constitutional amendment that would limit Kentucky governors from issuing pardons and sentence commutations 60 days before their election through the inauguration in December. If the General Assembly passes the bill this year, Kentucky voters will have to decide to enact the legislation. 
Speaking to reporters after a Wednesday meeting of the Senate State and Local Government Committee, McDaniel said he is “fairly optimistic that it’s got a good shot this year.” He said those on both political sides of the aisle see pardons issued at the state and federal level in recent years “ultimately end up at the same place, which is an unchecked pardon power is simply not a good thing.”

In recent national memory, both Republican President Donald Trump and former Democratic President Joe Biden have been criticized for pardons they’ve issued, such as Trump’s for people convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and Biden’s pardons for his family members and those on the congressional committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack. 
McDaniel pointed to one of Bevin’s pardons while presenting the bill to the committee. Though it was not formally filed with the secretary of state’s office, Bevin had written a pardon for Robert Markham Taylor, who was sentenced to prison in 2016 for murdering and kidnapping Alex Johnson. 
McDaniel said Taylor “found himself in prison because of a system that is designed to guarantee to the maximum extent humanly possible, the appropriate administration of justice” — the courts. 
“It is the system in our nation and in our Commonwealth that must be relied upon for the effective administration of justice,” McDaniel said. “ The system of unaccountable pardons short circuits the system of justice upon which our citizens rely every day.”
Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said during the meeting that she’s previously voted in favor of the legislation in the past, but still has “concerns about the potential chilling effect that it will have on individuals and their abilities to be pardoned.” The committee later unanimously voted in favor of McDaniel’s bill. 
After the meeting, McDaniel said that the campaign for approving the amendment would likely require a lot of “grassroots campaigning” on his part. He noted that the bill does not have a fiscal requirement, nor does it address a social issue. 
“This is just a straight-up weakness in the Constitution, and I think … I’ll have a lot of miles on my car in the fall trying to drum up support,” he said.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Every speaker at a public Michigan Supreme Court hearing on Wednesday — including lawyers and representatives from advocacy groups from around Michigan — spoke in favor of a proposed rule that would bar civil arrests, including immigration arrests, at Michigan courthouses. 
The rule, which was first proposed in November and garnered over 2,500 online comments during the public comment period, would prohibit any civil arrests from taking place in a courthouse “while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse” — a policy that would cover most ICE arrests, which are often done under administrative warrants, not judicial warrants. 
Most speakers at Wednesday’s hearing emphasized the importance of the proposed rule to allow the judicial process to play out as it is intended, making it so victims, witnesses and litigants feel safe to come into court. 
“Immigration enforcement activity in courthouses undermines racial justice when staff and court visitors may be stopped or questioned based on race, accent or perceived immigration status, while their white counterparts pass freely,” said Elinor Jordan, an attorney at the Michigan Poverty Law Project. “It’s traumatic, intimidating and destabilizing.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The focus of the hearing, though not explicitly mentioned in the text of the proposed rule, was on ICE arrests — so much so that Lisa Varnier, an attorney in Oakland County, urged the justices to add a definition of civil arrests that explicitly includes immigration arrests. 
“From my work with immigrants, I can tell you that even though they are fully documented and are in this country with the permission of the federal government, they are absolutely terrified of going to any court building for fear that they will be arrested by ICE,” Varnier said. “Their fear precludes them from participating in criminal and justice, civil justice systems.”
“They are destroying the community’s trust in law enforcement,” continued Emily Duthinh, another Oakland County attorney. “This undermines law and order and makes all of us less safe.”
If this rule is approved by the state’s Supreme Court, it would place Michigan alongside states like New York, Connecticut and Illinois that have similar policies in place. 
“Other courts have implemented such rules, and they have been found not to be preempted by federal law,” said Syeda Davidson, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan. “Absent a clear and manifest purpose expressed by Congress, there is a presumption against federal law preempting state law.”
Eli Savit, the Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney and a candidate for state Attorney General, was the sole elected official to speak during the hearing, highlighting how the fear of immigration has made it harder to prosecute cases.
“Since last year, we have seen a troubling increase in victims who are non-citizens failing to show up to court to testify against their abusers. I’ve talked to colleagues across the state and indeed, across the nation, and this is a trend that they are all experiencing,” Savit said. “I just want to highlight exactly what that means. What that means is that victims of crime are frequently more afraid of the judicial system, more afraid of their own government, than they are of the person who harmed them.”
The Michigan Supreme Court’s seven justices will make the final decision on whether or not to adopt the rule and any changes to be made. The sole Republican on the court, Justice Brian Zahra, had stated on the initial proposal that he would have declined to publish the proposal for comment.

,DC,2026-01-14 17:43:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Judge weighs Trump administration limits on congressional visits to immigration facilities,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-weighs-trump-administration-limits-congressional-visits-immigration-facilities,,"WASHINGTON —  U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb Wednesday probed whether the Trump administration has violated her court order, after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis. Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison of Minnesota said they were denied entry to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis last weekend. An attorney representing the lawmakers, Christine L. Coogle, asked Cobb to make it clear to the Trump administration that her stay order is in place. Last month, Cobb issued a temporary block on a policy by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice for lawmakers to conduct oversight visits at ICE facilities.Cobb found Noem violated a 2019 appropriations law, referred to as Section 527, that allows for unannounced oversight visits at facilities that hold immigrants. “If the government is using 527 funds to exclude members of Congress from (ICE) facilities, that does run afoul of my order,” Cobb said during Wednesday’s hearing.Dems eye DHS funding As the Trump administration has carried out an aggressive immigration campaign, and with Democrats the minority party in both chambers of Congress, unannounced oversight visits to ICE facilities are one of the few tools Democrats can use. The other way they could try to counter the enforcement push is through appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security.For example, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which is made up of nearly 100 Democrats, vowed on Tuesday to vote against any DHS appropriations bill unless major changes are made at ICE regarding immigration enforcement.Separately, Democrats on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Noem. One count is connected to the denial of oversight visits. New Noem policy after Renee Good killingOne day after federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, Noem issued a new memo for members of Congress who want to conduct oversight visits at ICE facilities. She required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year.Noem argued in her new policy that because those federal ICE facilities are using funds through the spending and tax cuts package, and not the DHS appropriations bill, they are therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits by members of Congress. In an emergency request, Democrats argued the funds DHS is using apply under Section 527, and DHS is violating Cobb's stay.Cobb said on Wednesday she could not make a determination if her order was violated until she can get a clear answer from the Trump administration as to the source of the funds. She directed Department of Justice lawyers to determine what it is.Funding stream questionIn court filings, DOJ argued the facilities are funded through the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” passed and signed into law last year, and that DHS does not need to comply with Section 527.The OBBBA, passed through a congressional process called reconciliation, is allowed to adjust federal spending even though it is not an appropriations law.Coogle said until OBBAA, the only funding for ICE came from appropriations, and argued the two funding streams can’t be separated. She said the Trump administration is trying to “make a game here” with appropriations law.“Appropriations are not a game. They are the law,” Coogle said.  The House Democrats who sued include Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Eligibility in a fledgling state swimming lesson voucher program could be revamped to accommodate more older children and fewer babies under a bill moving its way through the state Legislature.
The House Health Care Budget Committee voted unanimously Wednesday to pass HB 85 along to its next committee. Filed by St. Augustine Rep. Kim Kendall, the bill ups the age eligibility from four years to seven years while eliminating the opportunity for swimming lessons for babies under age 1 who she said are most apt to drown in a bathtub at home.
“So, ages zero to one, the babies show reflexes that looks like swimming but they’re too young to actually lift their head up enough to be able to breathe out of water and the majority of infant death from drowning at the age of 1 happen in bathtubs at home,” she said adding that the babies who take the lessons have “to come back later, at an older age, to repeat the course.”
Department of Children and Family data show that in 2025 a total 112 children died in Florida from drowning. Seventy-three of the children were between the ages of 1 and 3. Three were babies under the age of 1.
In 2024, 106 children drowned, of which 65 were between the ages of 1 and 3 and two were babies under age 1.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Florida, drowning is the leading cause of unintentional death in children ages 1 to 4, according to the Department of Health website advertising the swim voucher program.
Florida ranked highest in the nation between 2019 and 2021 for unintentional drowning deaths among children ages 1 to 4 and birth to 9, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control data.
To help abate the problem, the Legislature two years ago earmarked $500,000 and directed the DOH to create a voucher program for children living in families at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, which is $64,300 for a family of four.
The DOH received 16,663 applications during the program’s first year of operations and awarded 4,945 vouchers, a legislative staff analysis shows.
Of the near 5,000 vouchers awarded that year, the analysis shows:

646 were given to babies under the age of 1;
1,036 were given to 1-year-olds;
1,160 were awarded to 2-year-olds;
1,107 were awarded to 3-year-olds; 
952 were awarded to 4-year-olds; 
44 were awarded to children 5 and older.

The Legislature in 2025 agreed to double the funding in the program to $1 million and to require that children with autism and in active-duty military families be given first priority. The staff analysis did not include a break-out of awards by age cohort for that year.
There’s no detailed information in the staff analysis about the number of children with autism who received the swim vouchers in 2025 or who have drowned.
But Kendall said that up to one-third of the children between the ages of 4 and 12 who drown have autism and that 58% of the children between the ages of 5 and 12 who drown have autism.
The bill doesn’t contain any additional funding but Kendall said she’s been told some of the contracted swim lesson vendors have tried to stretch the money available to accommodate more children by teaching group swim lessons.
Kendall told committee members she’s proposing the changes in age eligibility in an effort “to take a great program and simply make it more efficient.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7480-scaled-e1761917850805-1024x558.jpeg,,,2026-01-14 12:58:32.206113

Marty Jackley’s official opinion came in response to a question on the issue from Democratic Senate Minority Leader Liz Larson of Sioux Falls.
State law doesn’t “forbid or permit” the use of campaign funds for security or child care, Jackley’s opinion says, but there are broad outlines on what constitutes acceptable uses.
Campaign money can be spent on things directly related to a campaign, “incident to being a public official” or former public official, or donated to other campaigns or campaign committees, the opinion says.

State laws offer “broad descriptions” on what constitutes campaign activity, which Jackley says was intentional and meant to avoid excluding some activities those laws’ authors may not have considered.
The Federal Election Commission, he notes in the opinion, “explicitly permits candidates for federal office to use campaign contributions for childcare expenses incurred during the candidate’s political campaign.”
“As of the date of this letter, fifteen states have enacted similar laws,” the opinion says.
“These states, including our neighbors Minnesota and Montana, permit a candidate to use campaign funds to pay reasonable and necessary childcare or dependent care expenses incurred because of the campaign.”
A smaller number of states, he wrote, now recognize security spending as an acceptable use of funds.
Jackley concluded that such expenses may be permissible “so long as there is a clear nexus to the campaign or office and are not for personal benefit.”
“The Legislature has the power to create and revise statutes and has the duty to clarify the relevant statutes if desired,” Jackley wrote.
Senator: Clarity request born of safety concerns
Security was the primary reason for the request, Larson said. Concerns over the safety of candidates have grown since the killing last year of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Larson said. The man who killed the Hortmans shot and wounded Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife the same day.
“This is a dangerous role that we’re playing at certain times,” Larson said. “So we want a clarification on that.”
Security spending wouldn’t necessarily take the form of paid security guards, Larson said, although it could. Campaign funds could be used to pay for more basic security features like deadbolts at campaign offices or surveillance cameras.
“We’re not governor-level,” Larson said of state lawmakers. “We don’t need a full entourage. But sometimes there are things that you want to have taken care of.”
Wrapping child care into the request for clarification made sense, Larson said, as that’s become a more common question around the country for parents who aim for political office.
Former Democratic Sen. Reynold Nesiba of Sioux Falls brought a bill to legalize the use of campaign dollars for child care in 2024, with Larson as a co-sponsor. The Senate State Affairs Committee rejected that bill 8-1.

HB 429 by Republican Rep. Jessica Baker adds new methods of identifying gang members to Florida statute. It does not criminalize simply being a member of a gang, but instead allows these individuals to be punished more severely if they’ve been convicted of a crime and have either posted about, mentioned, or been identified in gang activity.
This could include posting about gang activity on social media, being observed in the company of a gang member at least twice, being identified as a gang member by a parent, guardian, or spouse, or using “gang-related language.”

This is defined as any verbal, written, or digital statement that signals gang affiliation, supports gang activity, or uses recognized gang codes, symbols, or terminology.
If at least two of the above are determined, the sentence enhancement would apply — meaning the sentence would be one degree more serious than written in statute (a second-degree misdemeanor would be a first-degree misdemeanor, and so on).
“This bill is not criminalizing gang affiliation. … It’s used for enhancement purposes only,” Baker said in Wednesday’s Criminal Justice Subcommittee hearing.
“The purpose of this bill is modernizing the statute,” the Jacksonville Republican continued. “Law enforcement is having a hard time proving criminal gang membership because gang members know where the line is, and social media and online platforms have not been part of the statute ever before.”
On Monday, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that the “Sex, Money, Murder” gang’s kingpin, Hernando Thompson, was convicted in Polk County last week on five charges including racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, and three counts of directing criminal gang activities.
Thompson had 14 previous felonies, 10 previous misdemeanors, and two stints in state prison in 2011-2013 and 2014-2015. He’d previously been arrested for aggravated assault, possession and sale of cocaine, domestic violence battery, and carrying a prohibited weapon.
“If you are a gang member, a sex predator, drug trafficker, and you happen to be listening to this press conference: Unless you want to spend the rest of your life in a cage, I strongly encourage you to listen to the attorney general and the sheriff and relocate your operations from Florida,” statewide prosecutor Brad McVay said.

(File photo courtesy of Clemson University)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s inspector general will examine the relationship between Clemson University and a proposal for a massive new subdivision in Oconee County following potential conflict of interest concerns.
Clemson became entangled in the controversy surrounding the 600-acre development as President Jim Clements and former Gov. Nikki Haley, a Clemson board member, also sat on the board of the publicly traded homebuilding company believed to be behind the proposed neighborhood.
College presidents on corporate boards can draw schools into controversy. It happened at Clemson.

Senate President Thomas Alexander, who represents Oconee County, requested the investigation “to ensure accountability and uphold public confidence,” according to a statement Wednesday.
House Speaker Murrell Smith also backed the request.
“Public confidence in our institutions depends not only on whether the law is followed, but on whether actions are viewed as beyond reproach,” the Sumter Republican said in a statement.
Clemson officials, in a statement, said the college will cooperate fully with the inspector general and expressed confidence the review will confirm the school acted appropriately.
Developers of the project approached Oconee County leaders about their proposal last year.
Though developers never submitted an official application with the county, an early marketing plan called for 5,200 housing units — a number that was later reduced to 3,200 units. It also included a satellite Clemson campus on the property, located about 5 miles northeast of the school, near Newry Mill.
The developers also were in contact with the college’s senior management team in 2023 and 2024, even flying Clemson staff on a company plane to tour a similar development near Purdue University in Indiana.
Messages from the developers came from an email addresses associated with United Homes Group, formerly Great Southern Homes, the publicly-traded company where Clements had been on the board since 2022.
Both the college and the company denied that the homebuilder benefited from the connection to the university or used it to put pressure on the county to approve development plans.
“At no point has the University provided funding for, partnered on or endorsed the planning or construction of any residential development related to this proposal,” the college wrote in a statement to the SC Daily Gazette and other outlets.
“As is standard practice, an administrative team conducted a preliminary review to assess the multi-use concept’s potential economic and community impact,” the statement continued. “After completing its due diligence, the University decided not to pursue the economic development initiative.”
Clemson staff last met with the developers in November 2024.
Clemson, in a December letter to Oconee County Council, also stated United Homes was not the developer. Instead, the developer was a different, separate company operated by Michael Neiri, the chairman of United Homes and a Clemson alumnus.
Legislators said the request to have the inspector general look into the issue is not an allegation of wrongdoing, but rather “a proactive and responsible step to ensure transparency.”
“The people of Oconee County deserve clarity and confidence in the decisions that affect their community,” state Rep. Adam Duncan said in a statement.
“An independent review ensures that questions are answered thoroughly and objectively, and public trust is maintained,” said the Republican who represents the district impacted by the Newry development.

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate Finance Committee put a “critical” child care workforce funding bill on hold due to lawmakers’ confusion over why federal funding could not be used instead of state funds. 
The committee met Tuesday for a handful of hearings, including one for Senate Bill 483, which would appropriate $15 million in state general funds over two years to help child care employers with employee recruitment and retention. 
The bill aims to resolve a funding issue that arose from the state’s biennial budget signed in June. Legislators sought to fund the $15 million using extra federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families money, knowing the appropriation was “contingent” on approval from the federal government. TANF is a federal program that helps low-income families achieve economic stability by giving states grants to operate programs that fall under one of its specific statutory purposes. 
SB 483 proposes that if the federal government denies the use of TANF funds for child care workforce recruitment and retention, or does not respond to state officials by July 1, 2026, state general funds would be used for the initiative. 
In October, the Administration for Children and Families sent the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services a contradictory response regarding the allowable use of funds. 
First, state officials were told that once TANF funding was transferred to the Child Care Development Fund, the main fund New Hampshire uses for child care purposes, “CCDF funds can be used for child care worker bonuses and other retention activities.” 
Later in the email, the Administration for Children and Families wrote, “it is not clear to the Office of Family Assistance how recruitment and retention bonuses for New Hampshire child care employers meet a TANF purpose — especially in the absence of information about other TANF expenditures related to child care.”
While the language of the email is murky, state Health and Human Services officials told the Bulletin in November that the federal government said using TANF money for child care workforce retention and recruitment was “not an allowable use” under federal regulations, and the development fund dollars were already budgeted for the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship Program. 
“Funding child care recruitment and retention initiatives does not fall into one of the four purposes of the TANF program specified in federal law,” Jake Leon, communications director for Health and Human Services, said. 
Karen Hebert, director of the Division of Economic Stability, testified to the same multiple times during Tuesday’s hearing and the executive session that followed.
“What this bill does is it adds $7.5 million per fiscal year, with the intent of it being TANF funding to use for the child care workforce,” Hebert said. “It is the department’s interpretation, based on the response from the Administration for Children and Families, that [for] the TANF grant [to] directly pay for the child care workforce is not an allowable use of TANF funds.” 
However, members of the committee expressed confusion not only about the situation with TANF funding, but also about how federal funding for New Hampshire child care works in general. Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, apologized for being “hopelessly confused” about how money could or could not be used.
Sen. Timothy Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, requested the department “aggressively pursue” a clear yes or no from the federal government before discussing the use of state dollars. 
“This is an issue that’s extremely important for working-class families,” he said. “Hopefully we’ll get some sort of answer back by being aggressive and letting them know this is an important issue for the state of New Hampshire.”
Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and chairman of the Finance Committee, said he would not call for a vote on the bill because “some of these discussions would probably be better offline.” 
The appropriation was passed in 2023 using state general funds, but due to a series of state spending reductions, legislators attempted to use federal funds for the 2025-2027 budget. 
Despite the committee making no recommendation on the bill, providers and advocates said they are “hopeful” about the outcome because legislators have shown an interest in finding a solution and in funding recruitment and retention efforts. 
At least 20 child care providers and advocates gathered at the State House before the hearing to show support for the bill. When it came time for public testimony, the room filled to capacity as child care teachers, program directors, and advocates lined up to speak in support of the bill.

According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the median hourly wage for a New Hampshire child care worker in 2023 was $15.62, while the median wage of a retail salesperson was $16.71, and the median wage for all New Hampshire occupations was $24.03. Granite State families are also spending more than three times as much on child care than the federal government recommends due to high child care costs statewide. Both could be addressed if SB 483 passes. 
Child care providers also testified about some of the ways they used the last state appropriation: increasing staff wages, maintaining classroom capacity, providing staff benefits such as health care and retirement, and stabilizing tuition costs. 
While the Senate bill is on hold, a hearing for the House counterpart, House Bill 1566, has not yet been scheduled.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/childcarebill-1024x598.jpg,,,2026-01-14 11:59:16.358605

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, marks demise of his hometown newspaper, the Plainville Times, and honors the importance of community journalism.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, offers a tribute in the U.S. Senate to his hometown newspaper, the Plainville Times, after it folds into a new entity, the Stockton Sentinel-Times. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, an occupational resident of Washington, D.C., for three decades, says he looked forward to reading weekly editions of the Plainville Times for the latest news from his hometown.
“Growing up in this small town in western Kansas, I saw firsthand how the newspaper supported the community and brought neighbors, friends and even strangers together,” Moran said.
In a speech on the U.S. Senate floor, the Republican explained that the community of Plainville, a city of 1,700 people in Rooks County, could no longer financially sustain the Times. In the end, owners of the Stockton Sentinel offered a lifeline. Going forward, news from Stockton and Plainville will be captured in pages of the newly christened Stockton Sentinel-Times.
“Local journalism is important to the future of rural America,” Moran said. “Community journalism pulls us together. National journalism has the habit of tearing us apart.”
The senator said he was grateful to dedicated editors, reporters and staff whose contributions made his hometown paper informative and beloved.
Moran said the Times’ editor, Candace Rachel, was a steady presence in Plainville with a reporters’ notebook in hand and a camera slung over her shoulder. The senator said he was grateful the Sentinel’s owners, Bart Hamilton and Susan Hamilton Schneider, would maintain coverage of his hometown and Rooks County with the Sentinel-Times.
“I take sadness in the demise, the departure of my hometown paper. I take pleasure and pride in its continuation with news being covered by the Sentinel-Times,” he said.
The merger of the Times and Sentinel represents a trend in the Kansas newspaper industry. In 2025, the state had about 150 newspapers. In the past 20 years, approximately 50 newspapers closed or were merged with other publications. Most newspapers in Kansas publish weekly.
Moran said managing a newspaper in Kansas, and elsewhere in the United States, was a demanding quest.
“Today, community journalism faces growing challenges with a rapidly changing media environment as well as workforce struggles and financial strains,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Moran-Plainville-Times-newspaper.png,,,2026-01-14 11:59:16.358605

On January 13, 2026, at approximately 7:00 p.m. troopers responded to Dollar General, located at 1549 Savannah Road in Lewes, for a report of a robbery. When troopers arrived, they learned that a white female suspect, wearing white sweatpants, a dark colored sweatshirt, and a mask, approached two employees, implied she had a gun, and demanded money. The suspect accessed the register, stole money, and fled in a blue Ford Focus with a Delaware tag.
At approximately 8:00 p.m., troopers responded to the 14000 block of Staytonville Road in Lincoln for a report of a disabled blue Ford Focus in the roadway. When troopers arrived, they spoke to the driver, who matched the description of the robbery suspect and identified her as Shelly Sortino. A computer check showed that Sortino had an active capias warrant, and the license plate on the Focus was stolen. Through investigative means, troopers identified Sortino as the suspect in the robbery, and she was arrested without incident.
Sortino was taken to Troop 7, where she was charged with the crimes listed below, arraigned by Justice of the Peace Court 11, and committed to Sussex Correctional Institution on a $33,000 secured bond.

“All subsidy funds requested” were released, and providers can expect to receive delayed payments by Jan. 16, an email from the state office said.
The delay left child care providers uncertain of when they would be reimbursed for services rendered in December through a nationwide subsidy program designed to increase access to child care for low-income and foster families.
The state office, part of Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, said in a press release last week that it had responded to a federal request for a detailed explanation of the expenses to be reimbursed through the subsidy program. 
Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, advocates and child care providers scrambled for answers as invoices sat unpaid. 
Lisa Scheer, director of Baden Christian Child Care in St. Louis, told The Independent Friday that while the federal funds were at that point only a few days late, delays left providers putting off bill payments and questioning how long they would be able to keep their doors open.
Casey Hanson, deputy director of Kids Win Missouri, said many providers have already received payment. Scheer told The Independent that she is still waiting. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said in a Dec. 30 social media post that the federal Administration for Children and Families would begin requiring states to justify their child care expenses before receiving funding. 
The state’s education department on Thursday evening received word from federal officials that it would need to meet requirements of the federal “Defend the Spend” initiative, first introduced by the now-dissolved Department of Government Efficiency, the department’s spokesperson told The Independent.

At the women’s unit at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, Lisa Jo Chamberlin’s clean prison record hasn’t earned her similar privileges. 
She lives in total isolation and, since Dec. 30, more restrictions. Chamberlin is the only woman on Mississippi’s death row, where she’s been the past decade. 
“This is the worst treatment I have seen by far,” said the Rev. Jeff Hood, who communicates with death row prisoners around the country and has witnessed nearly a dozen executions. 
More restrictive conditions have nearly been deadly. Chamberlin was on suicide watch at least twice in 2025 as her mental health declined. At one point, she said she considered whether to sign papers to let her execution proceed, but then ultimately decided not to.
Chamberlin said she enjoys peace, quiet and time to herself and has turned to activities like writing, reading the Bible, sharing her story and passing the time as she continues to appeal her case and await a possible execution. 
She said doesn’t mind being on her own, but Chamberlin doesn’t want to be isolated. 
“I have to do everything by myself because I’m the only woman on death row,” Chamberlin said in a phone interview with Mississippi Today. 
She has spent all  of her prison sentence at the women’s prison in Pearl. 
Last May, Chamberlin saw a change in her custody level and was able to gain some privileges, including a tablet to make calls and send messages. Chamberlin said those greatly improved her quality of life. She said the tablet was a gamechanger. 
At the end of the year, she noticed more restrictions to her time out of her cell and access to areas where she previously was able to go. She said she has been confined to her cell for 48-hour periods before being let out to shower and use the community microwave. 
She is no longer able to walk laps around the unit and access video calls because with her new housing and custody status, Chamberlin can’t go to certain areas. 
Prison records list her location as Unit 720 Max, which is closed custody that requires close supervision and security control. Those in close custody anywhere in the prison system are confined to a cell or dormitory unit with similar level custody prisoners, according to MDOC’s inmate handbook. 
Chamberlin said the women’s prison superintendent told her the reason for the change in privileges and restrictions: You are on death row, so you will be treated like the men on death row. 
Kate Head, a spokesperson for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Chamberlin was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2004 murder of two people in Hattiesburg. 
She and co-defendant and former partner Roger Gillett were arrested in Kansas on a tip that they stole a car and were manufacturing drugs at his family’s farm. As authorities searched the farm, they found a freezer taped shut containing the dismembered bodies of the victims: Vernon Hulett, who was Gillett’s cousin, and Linda Heintzelman, who was Hulett’s girlfriend. Chamblerlin and Gillett had lived with the victims in Hattiesburg. 
Separately, Chamberlin and Gillett were convicted and sentenced to death in 2006. Years later, the Mississippi Supreme Court vacated his death sentence because due process rights were violated when the jury considered an invalid aggravating factor. He was resentenced in 2018 to life without parole. 
Chamberlin has pursued her own appeals, including a third petition for post-conviction relief in August, which the state opposes and has asked to be dismissed. As of January, the case has been submitted without argument. 
Death row inmates of any gender are housed in a facility or unit deemed appropriate by the MDOC commissioner, and the status requires the highest level of supervision available, according to the MDOC inmate handbook. 
Advocates helped get Chamberlin into a less restrictive situation, only to have it taken away, Hood said. 
He and other advocates said they want similar privileges and housing situations for Chamberlin as the death row men have, but that is not happening. Instead, they see unfairness in Chamberlin’s imprisonment compared to the experience of the men on death row in Mississippi and women on death row in other states. 
For years, death row prisoners at Parchman have been housed in Unit 29, but last year they were moved to Unit 17, which is fenced in and recently remodeled, said prison reform advocate Mitzi Magleby.  
The unit is also where the gas chamber, electric chair and the gurney used for lethal injection are located. 
An MDOC spokesperson did not respond to questions about how men are housed on death row and why they were moved. Prison records for each man on death row list their location as Unit 17. 
Nationwide, as of October, 47 women were on death row, with the majority in California, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Mississippi is among seven states with just one woman with a death sentence, and it’s not the only state with apparent disparate treatment of women facing execution.
Antoinette Frank, the only woman on Louisiana’s death row, has been held in conditions resembling solitary confinement since her 1995 triple homicide conviction, The Guardian reported. She is separated from the general prison population, has experienced extended lockdowns and doesn’t have access to in-person classes. 
She was part of a group of death row prisoners who sought clemency in 2023. The Louisiana state Board of Pardons denied all of them. 
After a 15-year hiatus, Louisiana has resumed executions. The state’s attorney general has filed requests to set execution dates for five on death row, including Frank. 
Hood, the death row spiritual adviser, is also in contact with Tennessee’s Christa Pike who spent years in restrictive housing until 2024. Since her 1996 murder conviction, Pike was essentially in solitary confinement before she sued the prison system in 2022. 
As part of the lawsuit settlement, she has been allowed to work, have more interaction with women in general population and have the ability to earn opportunities that the death row men already have access to, according to the Death Penalty Information Center and local reporting. 
The Tennessee Supreme Court has scheduled her execution for Sept. 30, which would make her the first woman to be executed in the state in more than 200 years. 
Chamberlin said she is exploring legal action around the conditions of her confinement. 
Advocating for herself is something Chamberlin said she has done during her nearly 20 years in prison. She said it’s tiring, but she considers herself a survivor.

Ron DeSantis has selected Adam Tanenbaum, now a judge on Florida’s First District Court of Appeal and former general counsel to the Florida House of Representatives, to serve on the Florida Supreme Court.

DeSantis made the […]","Florida Channel screenshot of Adam Tanenbaum speaking after being selected to serve on the Florida Supreme Court on Jan. 14, 2026.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has selected Adam Tanenbaum, now a judge on Florida’s First District Court of Appeal and former general counsel to the Florida House of Representatives, to serve on the Florida Supreme Court. 
In doing so, DeSantis has now appointed six of the seven justices serving on the high court.
DeSantis made the announcement at Seminole High School in Pinellas County, from which Tanenbaum graduated in 1989. 
Tanenbaum will fill the seat vacated by Justice Charles Canady, who left the court at the of end of last year after 17 years to became director and a professor at the University of Florida Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education.
In his speech, Tanenbaum referred to himself as an originalist, the judicial philosophy that judges should interpret the Constitution according to its original public meaning that has been embraced by conservatives in recent decades.
“As an originalist, I subscribe to the fixation thesis and the constraint principle,” he said. “The meaning of a text is fixed at the time of its ratification or enactment. And that original meaning does not change over time.”
He went on to say that he shared Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ view “that the judiciary exercises neither force or will, only judgement. That our goal as judges is always to find the correct, original meaning of the law. To instead follow erroneous interpretations of the past, is to essentially make the law, usurping in the process the Legislature’s and the people’s authority.”
DeSantis lauded Tanenbaum’s intellect, referring to how he graduated first in his class at both Seminole High School and at the University of Florida.
Tanenbaum had a background in conservative politics before he got into law. He worked as an intern in 1994 for Newt Gingrich’s GOPAC, a Republican state and local political training organization. He then worked as a summer intern for Florida GOP U.S. Senator Connie Mack in 1995. And he served as public counsel for a couple of months for the Republican Party of Florida in 2001.
He also worked in private practice, as well as serving as a public defender for both the state of Florida and the federal government.
In 2014, he began working for various state agencies. He became the chief deputy solicitor general for the Florida Department of Legal Affairs in 2014-2015.
In 2015 he became general counsel for the Florida Department of State and then general counsel for the Florida House during Speaker Richard Corcoran’s term in 2016-2018. He was appointed by DeSantis to serve on the First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee on Nov. 1, 2019.
“I was talking to some of my guys after I interviewed the judge,” DeSantis said Wednesday. “It’s like, we’ve got 23-plus million people, you know, in the state of Florida. And I would guarantee you, you will not find 10 people out of that 23 million that knows more about Florida government — not just law, and Supreme Court and courts, but the agencies, the legislative branch, all that — than Judge Tanenbaum. He knows this stuff very, very well.”
While serving on the First District Court of Appeal, heard Byrd v. Black Voters Matter Capacity Bldg. Inst. (2022 and 2025), a high-profile challenge to a redistricting plan that eliminated minority-access voting districts. The state ultimately prevailed.
He was part of a three-judge panel of that court in 2021 that ruled in favor of the DeSantis administration to punish school districts that insisted on strict face-masking policies against COVID-19 in defiance of the governor’s insistence that parents be allowed to opt out for their children.
The appointment of Tanenbaum to the Florida Supreme Court won plaudits from the Florida Justice Reform Institute.
“Judge Adam Tanenbaum is an exceptional choice for the Florida Supreme Court,” said president William Large. “His extensive legal experience, combined with his dedication to public service, demonstrates he is deeply committed to the State of Florida and upholding the rule of law.”
Jorge Labarga is now the lone justice serving on the Florida Supreme Court who was not appointed by DeSantis. He was appointed to the court by then Gov. Charlie Crist in 2009. He is 73 years old, meaning that he must retire due to age term-limits before the 2028 election.

“Upon review of the summary, we identified omissions and misstatements that, as a whole, would mislead a potential signer as to the scope and effect of S.B. 56,” Yost wrote in a response letter to the petitioners. 
If Yost had certified the language, Ohioans for Cannabis Choice would have been able to start to collect signatures to get a referendum on the November ballot.
“We are going to fix the language, collect an additional 1,000 signatures, and not slow down,” Dennis Willard, spokesperson for Ohioans for Cannabis Choice, said in a statement. 
“Voters this November will have the opportunity to say no to S.B. 56, no to government overreach, no to closing 6,000 businesses and abandoning thousands of Ohio workers, and no to defying the will of Ohioans who overwhelmingly supported legalizing cannabis in 2023.” 
Ohioans voted to legalize marijuana in 2023, recreational sales started in August 2024, and sales totaled more than $836 million in 2025.
“Republicans know Ohioans are ready to hold them accountable for rewriting Issue 2, so instead of letting voters decide, they delay and distract to try and prevent the referendum altogether,” Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, said in a statement. 
The new law will reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, and prohibit smoking in most public places. It prohibits possessing marijuana in anything outside of its original packaging and criminalizes bringing legal marijuana from another state back to Ohio. S.B. 56 also requires drivers to store marijuana in the trunk of their car while driving. 
If Ohioans for Cannabis Choice are able to get the language certified, they’ll need to collect 6% of the total number of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election (248,092) to get on the Nov. 3 ballot. The group will also need 3% of an individual county’s gubernatorial turnout in 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties.
Organizers will have 90 days from the date the governor filed the law with the secretary to collect the required signatures.
The last referendum that passed in Ohio was when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law in 2011.

“It’s probably one of the least restrictive hands-free bills in the country, but it’s a step in the right direction,” Senate Transportation Committee Chair Jimmy Higdon told his colleagues. “It adds Kentucky to the list of states, approximately 30 states across the country, that do not allow you to have a handheld device in your hand and communicate with it (while driving).”
Higdon, a Lebanon Republican, presented the legislation, Senate Bill 28, to the committee Wednesday morning. Higdon’s final legislative session and the bill is one of his priorities. 
SB 28, or the “the Phone-Down Kentucky Act,” says drivers cannot hold a cell phone while driving to send electronic messages, like texts and emails, or watch moving images, like videos and games. Fines accessed under the legislation will be divided among a traumatic brain injury trust fund, the Kentucky trauma care system fund and a veterans’ program fund.

While presenting his bill, Higdon spoke of meeting Alyssa Burns, whose daughter Camberleigh died in a 2022 crash after a distracted driver hit their car days before her second birthday. Burns previously spoke in support of Higdon’s bill during the legislative interim.
In a statement last week, Burns said “justice for Camberleigh is represented through this bill and through any legislation that ensures no one has the power to take a life without facing consequences.”
“I know this bill won’t bring Camberleigh back, but in a way, it keeps her name and memory alive,” Burns said. “She is not just a statistic on a piece of paper—she was a little girl with her whole life ahead of her.” 
Several committee members expressed support for the legislation. 
Sen. Donald Douglas, R-Nicholasville, who is the vice chairman of the committee and a physician, said that he has “spent a lot of nights in the operating room, helping put people back together who were distracted and who ended up in the operating room” after car accidents. 
“I want you to know I really got tired of seeing our sons and daughters in the emergency room, in the operating room, because of the distractions,” Douglas said. “So I appreciate it for that account.
Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, said that she has been among lawmakers, including Higdon and a few other committee members, who have been practicing getting in the habit of hands-free driving after hearing that the bill would be debated this session. 
“Once you get in the habit of docking your phone when you get in the car, and then you do not touch it again until you get out of the car, it gets easier and easier. It really does,” Berg said while voting in favor of the bill. 
Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, said that he was supportive of the bill, but in some areas, “I think it doesn’t go far enough.” He added that he would like to see the bill explicitly bar drivers from using cell phones while at a stoplight. 
“I know probably everybody in this room has sat behind someone at a red light or a stoplight, looking at their phone, and everybody goes on in the other lanes, and you’re sitting there, stuck behind that person. I think that’s a safety issue as well,” Elkins said. “I would hope that maybe we could entertain an amendment or address it at some point in the future.” 
Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, said while voting in favor of the current bill, he had opposed previous versions because of it barring the use of phones while at a stoplight. He argued that drivers can signal to other stopped cars that the light is green by sounding their car horn. 
“I support it precisely because you can stop and make a call at a green light, unlike last year’s,” Williams said.

(Missouri Office of Administration photo)Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway is asking for nearly $1 million by June to furnish new offices for one of her highest-paid employees.
The request is in the supplemental budget — money needed for programs running short of funds before the end of the fiscal year — for furniture and equipment in 5,000 square feet of a new state office building in Chesterfield.
Both the attorney general’s office and the Office of Administration said the costs are based on standard amounts for building out new space. But lawmakers are raising questions
In interviews with The Independent, both Republican and Democrat legislators said they want to know more about the $989,000 request, which includes $17,000 for space rental and $972,000 for furnishings. Especially in light of warnings from the governor on Tuesday  that Missouri’s surplus of general revenue will run dry in the coming fiscal year. 
“Well, that’s a lot,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, said of the nearly $1 million budget request. “I think I’d want to look that plan over.”
Legislative committees in the House and Senate will be briefed on the supplemental appropriation requests in hearings this week.
Missouri revenue surplus nearly gone as Gov. Mike Kehoe unveils his budget plan

The space would be used by Hanaway’s solicitor general, Louis Capozzi, and his staff. Capozzi, and his two chief deputies, are among 22 employees of the attorney general’s office who are paid more than the approximately $126,000 salary paid to Hanaway.
Missouri purchased the 116,000-square-foot office building and an adjacent garage for $16.25 million in January 2025. It is intended to replace the Wainwright State Office Building in downtown St. Louis, which was sold in September 2024.
The solicitor general is the office responsible for handling major cases on appeal and in the trial courts, including recent cases on redistricting and abortion.
Gov. Mike Kehoe, State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick and State Treasurer Vivek Malek moved their St. Louis operations from the Wainwright building to the Old Post Office, where the attorney general’s office — and the Eastern District Missouri Court of Appeals — already had offices.
The $989,000 request is for $17,000 to pay rent on the space for the final three months of the fiscal year and $982,000 for furnishings.
The cost was estimated by the state Office of Administration and is not extravagant, said Stephanie Whitaker, spokeswoman for Hanaway.
“This is not like they’ve gone from this desk to a nicer desk,” Whitaker said. “This is the first time a desk is being put in at all.”
The desks are standard, modular furniture and the walls that will be installed are intended to match the rest of the building, Whitaker said.
Hanaway “hasn’t even seen what the furniture will look like,” Whitaker said. “(The appropriation) is authority for OA to match the furniture to the rest of their building.”
Office of Administration spokesperson Shayne Martin said the cost will create space for 19 offices, and chairs and conference rooms.
“This is a one time buildout cost and is a complete office build, as a brand new space and is about 150 dollars a square foot,” Martin wrote in an email to The Independent. The cost breaks down to $750,000 to prepare the space and $222,000 to furnish it.
Capozzi has been solicitor general since July, when he was hired away from the Jones Day law firm office in Washington, D.C., where he was an associate attorney. His chief deputies, William Seidleck and Kathleen Hunker, are also recent hires.
Seidleck was hired in August after a brief stint as counsel for the Environmental and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department. He previously worked as an associate attorney at Latham and Watkins law firm in Washington, D.C.
Hunker was hired in October from the attorney general’s office in Texas.
Hanaway was appointed attorney general in August after her predecessor, Andrew Bailey, was named co-deputy director of the FBI. Payroll reports for her office on the Missouri Accountability Portal show Capozzi, Seidleck and Hunker are all paid more than Hanaway.
The space is needed in part to recruit the top attorneys needed for cases handled by the solicitor general, Whitaker said.
“There is a federal courthouse in St Louis, so quite often a bulk of their team is doing case work in St Louis,” Whitaker said. “It’s also a big recruitment tool to have St Louis as the domicile, and then they travel. So some of his team is Jefferson City, some of his team is St Louis, and then Lou splits his time, so he works out of both.”
The House Budget Committee will be the first to look at the supplemental budget. State Rep. John Voss, a Republican from Cape Girardeau and a member of the committee, said he noticed the request and has questions.
“I’m anxious to hear the attorney general’s request in detail about why investing there is an important part of their strategy and equipping them to do the work that they’ve been authorized to do,” Voss said. “I still need to hear that particular testimony.”

The reporting “speaks volumes about the role that public defenders play in maintaining the integrity of the whole system, not just in defending their clients.”


CalMatters investigative reporter Anat Rubin has won the Sidney Award from the Sidney Hillman Foundation for her story, “The WalMart of public defense: How justice gets sold to the lowest bidder in rural California.” Every month, the Sidney Award honors outstanding investigative journalism that exposes social and economic injustices.
Judges said they were drawn to the investigation because it was “original, well reported, and well-presented.” Sidney judge Lindsay Beyerstein said the reporting “speaks volumes about the role that public defenders play in maintaining the integrity of the whole system, not just in defending their clients.”
Rubin’s investigation found that nearly half of California counties pay private lawyers and firms to represent poor people in criminal cases, and that most of them do it through what’s known as a “flat-fee” contract, meaning they pay a fixed amount, regardless of how many cases the attorneys handle or how much time they spend on each case. As Rubin details in her story, these arrangements so clearly disincentivize investigating and litigating cases that they’ve been banned in other parts of the country. But they have flourished in California. 
She focused the story on one firm with several such contracts throughout the state — a firm that’s become known as the “WalMart of public defense” for its ubiquity and tactics. 
This project is the second part of Rubin’s series examining the lack of key safeguards against wrongful conviction in California. Her first piece, “The Man Who Unsolved a Murder,” found that poor people accused of crimes, who account for at least 80% of criminal defendants, are routinely convicted in California without anyone investigating the charges against them. Close to half of California’s 58 counties do not employ any full-time public defense investigators. Among the remaining counties, defendants’ access to investigators fluctuates wildly, but it’s almost always inadequate.

ARDENTOWN, Del. — The Candlelight Theatre opens its 2026 season this weekend with a clear message to audiences: it’s time to laugh — loudly, often, and without apology.
The season begins with Mel Brooks’ Tony Award-winning musical The Producers, running Jan. 17 through Feb. 23, followed by Young Frankenstein in the spring. Together, the back-to-back Brooks comedies signal a season launch built on fearless humor and crowd-pleasing fun.
The Producers, which won a record 12 Tony Awards, tells the story of a washed-up Broadway producer and his anxious accountant who devise a scheme to make money by staging the worst musical ever written. Their plan famously collapses when the show becomes an unexpected hit, unleashing a string of outrageous moments, sharp satire, and big ensemble numbers.
The comedy is intentionally over the top — poking fun at Broadway, ambition and human ego — and leans into the kind of humor that doesn’t tiptoe around the joke.
“This show is unapologetically funny,” said Bob Kelly, artistic director of the Candlelight Theatre. “It pushes boundaries in a way that reminds people why live theatre is such a joyful experience. We decided to open 2026 with two Mel Brooks comedies because, quite frankly, we should all be laughing more in 2026.”
Kelly said pairing The Producers with Young Frankenstein was a deliberate choice, designed to set an upbeat, audience-friendly tone for the year.
Directed by Jody Anderson, The Producers features choreography by Anderson and Scott Jacobs, with music direction by Betsy Conner.
The cast includes David T. Wills, Mary McAvoy, Andrew Bozzelli, Michelle Lewin Affleck, Bob Gatchel, Benjamin Helbert, Micaela Hickey, Paige Hollenbeck, Nicole Lewin Mariash, Nate Miles-McLean, Jeremy Mitchell, Samantha Ricchiuti, Cory Steiger, Nina Straface, Caleb J. Tracy, Shawn Weaver, Shaun Yates and Anthony Connell.
Opening night for the production is sold out, and many performances are already down to limited availability. Dennis Mahoney, box office manager at Candlelight Theatre, encourages patrons not to assume a performance is completely unavailable if online ticketing shows a sellout.
“Often, a small number of full dinner-and-show tickets are still available through the box office,” Mahoney said. “And most of the time, show-only tickets are available even when dinner seating has sold out.”
As Delaware’s only dinner theatre, Candlelight offers audiences a full evening experience — pairing a freshly prepared meal with a professional production in an intimate, historic venue tucked into Ardentown. Opening weekends are traditionally among the most festive of the year, drawing longtime subscribers alongside first-time guests.
Following The Producers, Candlelight continues its Mel Brooks run with Young Frankenstein, playing March 14 through April 19, before moving into a season that includes Arsenic and Old Lace, Annie, Fiddler on the Roof and the holiday favorite Scrooge.
Tickets and subscription information for The Producers and the full 2026 season are available through the Candlelight Theatre box office and website.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-14-164612.jpg,,,2026-01-14 16:57:14.696244

(Screenshot)A proposal to let Rhode Island voters sign candidates’ nomination papers electronically – increasing access and fending off fraud — inched forward Tuesday with the Rhode Island Board of Election’s backing.
The seven-member panel voted unanimously to support all four pieces of election-related legislation pitched by Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore, including the first-in-the-nation online nomination paper portal. But Amore will still have to convince the Rhode Island General Assembly and Gov. Dan McKee on his vision.
You can register to vote online. Why not sign candidate nomination papers too?

Amore’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday on the board’s vote.
As Amore explained to the state elections board at a Jan. 6 meeting, voters can already register or update their registration online, and apply for mail ballots, via the Department of State’s online portal. Using that same software to also let voters sign papers for local, state and federal candidates to qualify for the ballot — verifying their identity with the last four digits of a  Social Security number or driver’s license — could eliminate some of the guesswork for local and state election administrators charged with verifying paper-and-pen John Hancocks. 
And it could prevent the criminal forgery that upended the 2023 special election for Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District, when fake signatures, including those of dead residents, were spotted on the papers for Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos. 
Matos, once a frontrunner in the 11-way primary, finished a distant fourth despite proclaiming her innocence in the signature scandal. Two contractors hired by her campaign to help collect signatures were later charged with multiple criminal felonies for the forgeries. 
The option to sign nomination papers online — pen-and-ink collections would also remain — would also expand access for disabled, overseas and military voters otherwise left out of the early stages of the election process, Amore said. And, it would make it easier for candidates to gain ballot access, guaranteeing at least online that their supporters live in the right district to make the signatures count. 
The Rhode Island Board of Elections offered little discussion in its recommendation vote Tuesday, having already weighed and commended the measure during a prior meeting.
Other election-related pieces of legislation backed by the state elections board Tuesday included easing fines for candidates and campaigns over late filed campaign finance reports; eliminating the state constitutional requirement that voters register at least 30 days before an election (a shorter timeline would be up to the General Assembly to determine); and extending the option for disabled and military voters to submit ballots through a secure, electronic system, extending a 2022 law which expired at the end of 2025. The House Committee on State Government and Elections is scheduled to give initial consideration to the electronic ballot extension bill on Thursday.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) offers remarks at a June 6, 2025 town hall in Lansing. | Kyle DavidsonU.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin says she is the subject of a Justice Department investigation connected to a video in which she and several other Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. military and intelligence personnel to refuse “illegal orders.”
The Michigan Democrat from Holly and former CIA officer, confirmed the inquiry in an interview with The New York Times published Tuesday, saying she learned of the investigation from the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the chief federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia. A spokesman for Pirro’s office declined to confirm or deny to the Times that any investigation was underway.
“I’ve studied this kind of political authoritarianism in other countries my entire professional life,” Slotkin told the Times. “I just can’t believe I am talking about it in my own country.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The announcement marks an escalation in the Trump administration’s response to a 90-second video posted to social media in November in which Slotkin and five other Democratic members of Congress – all with military or intelligence backgrounds – told members of the armed forces and intelligence community that they “can refuse illegal orders” and should “stand up for our laws and our Constitution.”
The lawmakers did not identify specific orders they considered unlawful in the clip. Military justice experts say service members are already required under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disobey orders they reasonably determine to be unlawful.
The video drew immediate and intense criticism from President Donald Trump. He took to Truth Social to accuse the lawmakers of “seditious behavior” and urged that they be “arrested and put on trial,” later characterizing their actions as “punishable by death.” Trump’s posts also amplified threats from supporters.
In the weeks since the video’s release, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has contacted lawmakers who appeared in the video to schedule interviews, while a separate Pentagon review has focused on Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.
Kelly, as a retired officer, is the only participant in the video still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Kelly has since sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the department for trying to demote his retirement rank and pay.
Slotkin said the controversy has brought increased threats against her and her family, including a bomb threat at her Oakland County property in the days after the video’s release.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-14 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Bridgeport Police Dept. drone proposal faces opposition,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/bridgeport-police-dept-drone-proposal-faces-opposition/,Members of the city council’s Joint Committee on Contracts and Public Safety and Transportation overwhelmingly voted against the proposal.,"A recent push by the city to obtain two autonomous drones to aid first responders, faced a setback Tuesday night. Members of the city council’s Joint Committee on Contracts and Public Safety and Transportation voted against recommending a contract with Flock Safety, a surveillance company.
The committee overwhelmingly voted against the proposal, with only one yes vote and another member abstaining, to cheers from residents at a public meeting on the issue.
But Hector Soliman-Valdez, Flock Safety’s director of municipal engagement, isn’t discouraged.
“I think this is a normal part of the public process and we actually expected that,” Soliman-Valdez said.
The vote however, will not stop the city council from voting on the proposal later this month.
Despite the challenges, Soliman-Valdez said Flock Safety is looking forward to meeting with the community to discuss drone features.
Previous reporting by Connecticut Public highlighted concerns the drones may violate resident’s privacy by collecting data on them, which could inadvertently help federal authorities with deportation efforts.
Soliman-Valdez said sharing sensitive data violates company policy.
However, several city council members and residents said Flock Safety’s surveillance data was shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in other states.
Previous reporting by Virginia based WHRO indicates Flock Safety’s surveillance data, can be accessed by local police around the country, and was used by ICE in Virginia.
Soliman-Valdez pushed back on those claims saying the company does not share the information and that local police are responsible for how the information is utilized.
“All customers own their data, so Flock does not share any information so that’s unfortunately misinformation … we don’t police the police, so we create technology for police to use, to solve crime,” Soliman-Valdez said.
The crime fighting and first responder aspect of the drone systems were highlighted by Bridgeport city council member Aidee Nieves and Police Chief Roderick Porter.
Porter said the drones would act as a force multiplier. The city’s crime rate dropped last year, and Porter said the drones would help the city build on those successes. Its utility, he said, doesn’t just end with crime fighting. It could also help with firefighting.
Porter played a video, showing police officers entering a building on fire. But they didn’t go in blind, a Flock drone got there first. It helped officials plan out their next steps.
“The reason why we want Flock where we want drones in the city of Bridgeport is to enhance our ability to respond to calls, to provide a clearer view of what’s taking place prior to the officers getting on scene,” Porter said.
But residents like Todd Sample say their opposition to Flock is rooted in privacy concerns.
Sample said the potential for sensitive data ending up in the hands of federal law enforcement agencies also gives him pause. He referred to recent federal deportation efforts widely criticized for the use of surveillance tactics and a more violent and antagonistic response to protests, including the recent killing of a Minnesota woman by an ICE agent.
“We are facing an authoritarian type fascist regime where we’re having officers coming in fully masked, and they’re kidnapping people and they’re assaulting people,” Sample said.

In this society, your housing and your utility bills are affordable. You can live near where you work, and you have transportation options that meet your needs.
This imagined society sounds simple enough. So why is it out of reach for so many California residents? How can California policies help create more livable lives for Californians, where the essential needs – such as housing, education, and eldercare – are accessible and affordable for all? 
In the summer of 2024, the Possibility Lab invited public policy researchers from across California to share their ideas on addressing these questions. This collaboration has culminated in the Abundance Policy Report Series, featuring 12 original memos commissioned and edited by the Lab’s Abundance Accelerator. 
In this segment, we present the perspectives of three experts on housing, transportation, and energy: Paavo Monkonnen (housing), Juan Matute (transportation), and Keith Taylor (energy). 
How Scarcity is Built into Our Communities – and What Policy Can Do About It
Designing our cities, towns, and rural communities to better meet people’s needs requires moving beyond zero-sum thinking where your gain is my loss. It requires policies that challenge the status quo and re-examine how, what, why, and where infrastructure is built.


  


In housing, this means reimagining what makes a good home and enacting regulatory reforms that make it easier to build. To this end, Monkonnen argues that California needs a paradigm shift to improve the quality of multi-family housing (such as apartment buildings and duplexes) and course-correct from decades of policymaking that treated new housing as a ‘threat’ to neighborhoods of predominantly single-family homes. 
This paradigm shift, says Monkonnen, would prioritize building out the “missing middle” of housing so that new developments focus on housing stock somewhere between single-family homes and skyrise apartments. If California were to embrace this middle path in housing construction, then California residents could expect more medium-density, mixed-use neighborhoods that offer shared green spaces as well as new pathways to homeownership in multifamily buildings.
Likewise in transportation, Matute argues for a shift from prioritizing people rather than vehicles. This means worrying less about how many cars can travel on a given roadway and, instead, focusing on improving people’s access to whatever form (or combination) of transportation they need: whether by car, foot, bike, or public transit. 


  


In his report, Matute describes the geography of California in terms of “abundance hubs” that provide plentiful resources and “scarcity zones” that provide limited access to necessities like healthcare and healthy food. Accordingly, he suggests that transportation policy should be judged by how well it enables the flow of movement between scarcity zones and abundance hubs, so that residents without proximity to necessities can easily travel to get their needs met. While broader investments in scarcity zones are a necessary long-term project, transportation policy that expands the accessibility of essentials can improve equity in the near-term.


  


Similarly, to Taylor, abundance in the built environment is not just a matter of how we live and how we travel; it’s also about how we generate and distribute the energy that powers our daily lives. According to Taylor, California already has the raw renewable resources for clean energy abundance. What’s missing are the systems that can actually harness this potential and convert it into affordable utility bills for households across the state. The remedy, in Taylor’s view, is both technical and institutional: create a “Smart Grid” that enables a wider array of providers to contribute to clean energy production. California’s current system is a “hub-and-spoke” grid, where energy flows primarily from large, centralized power plants to consumers. In this model, it is difficult for smaller, local producers—for instance, a solar-equipped apartment building—to efficiently put excess power back into the system. 
A Smart Grid, powered by new digital technologies, creates a flexible network of connectivity, so that energy can move more dynamically between different producers and users. The result is less centralized control over California’s energy supply, and more opportunities for diverse actors to participate in renewable energy production.

People-Centered Policymaking in the Built Environment
The reforms these researchers suggest focus on a key idea: that the built environment is as much about infrastructure as it is about people. So what role should people play in designing and carrying out these visions for abundant housing, transportation, and energy? 
In the Possibility Lab’s Framework, the path to abundance is paved by a fundamental shift in the distribution of decision-making power. Without this shift, the status quo will likely continue enabling NIMBYism to block new housing and transportation while letting existing utilities continue to dominate the energy sector. 
To shift the balance of power and create constructive opportunities for people-centered policymaking, local and state governments might consider experimenting with changes to when and where public engagement happens. For example, rather than gathering input from neighborhood residents on a project-by-project basis, planning processes for new housing, energy, and transportation projects could be deliberated at a larger geographic scale and earlier in the planning process. 
The goal would be to encourage a broader range of views, focusing less on specific, individual cases that affect people personally and creating more opportunity to emphasize their community’s broader, shared goals. Figuring out whether this and other changes to the policy process can effectively contribute to different and more equitable outcomes is an important next step for California, and for other cities and states currently struggling with a widespread lack of affordability.
Whether we’re talking about housing, transportation, or energy, reforming public engagement processes is potentially a fundamental prerequisite for productive, people-centered policymaking that can turn visions of abundance into reality.

(Photo by Tek Images/ Science Photo Library/ Getty)Child sexual abuse material is illegal under both state and federal law. It has been for decades. But the advancement of Artificial Intelligence created loopholes. 
That was shown over the summer when a man in Maine used AI to manipulate pictures he took of children playing in a soccer game into sexually explicit images. Police knew who the man was and what he was doing but couldn’t charge him with a crime under Maine law, as first reported by the Bangor Daily News. 
A proposal before the Maine Legislature seeks to amend the criminal code so that charges in such cases can be brought. 
The bill, LD 524 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), expands the crime of disseminating child sexual abuse material to apply to materials that have been created or modified through generative AI or machine learning. 
“It’s not a hypothetical anymore,” Kuhn said. “This technology has created new ways to victimize children, and our laws haven’t been updated to adequately protect against that.”
Last year, following concerns that it wasn’t constitutional, lawmakers passed a watered down version, LD 1944, that added the dissemination of “morphed images” as a form of harassment under the “revenge porn” law. But now a broader proposal to expand the definition of sexually explicit material is back, and lawmakers from both parties seem open to it.
During the first week of this year’s legislative session, the Judiciary Committee advanced that bill in a unanimous bipartisan vote, sending it to the chambers, which are expected to take votes in the coming weeks. 
So far, 28 states have banned the creation of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, according to MultiState, a government relations firm tracking state AI laws. That includes nearby New Hampshire, where on Jan. 1 the use of artificial intelligence to create “intimate visual representation” of children became a Class B felony and a registrable offense. 
States are making these decisions despite President Donald Trump’s executive order in December that aims to preempt states from enacting rules governing AI. The move is a departure from the typical federalist structure of American government, where power is divided between the central government and states, and is likely to see legal challenges.
Maine State Police Lt. Jason Richards, who has investigated child sexual abuse and exploitation for 21 years, has seen the ways in which children can be victimized increase exponentially during that time, he told the Judiciary Committee in November. 
AI has been used to exploit children “in ways never seen before,” Richards said, and when it comes to scrubbing explicit images from the internet, “you can’t really put the genie back in the bottle.”
In 2024, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received 67,000 reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse material and 485,000 reports by the first half of 2025, amounting to a 624% increase.
Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on X, formerly Twitter, has recently faced global backlash for generating sexualized deepfakes of adults and children. 
However, U.S. officials are embracing it amid the controversy. On Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Grok will soon operate inside Pentagon networks. 
The bill in Maine was developed in collaboration with the Department of Public Safety. The Maine Chiefs of Police Association, Maine Prosecutors’ Association, Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Maine Office of the Attorney General have publicly supported it.  
However, the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers is opposed, testifying that the bill is “well-intentioned but dangerously overbroad.”
Specifically, the bill redefines “child sexual abuse material” to include AI-created images that “appear to depict” a minor. The association argues that broad definition risks violating First Amendment protections because it could apply to non-obscene or artistic works that do not exploit an actual child. 
The association cited a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down portions of a federal child pornography law, deciding that the graphic manipulation of images, even if it makes it appear that children are engaging in sex, is legal and protected speech.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-932735996-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As the Trump administration chips away at longstanding childhood vaccine standards, a newly introduced bill in the Alaska Legislature would give state health officials the option of following vaccine advice of medical experts outside of the federal government.
The measure, House Bill 238, would authorize the state Department of Health to follow vaccine recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics, not just the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee Immunization Practices.
The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes recent Trump administration changes to childhood vaccine recommendations and standards.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, said the bill would ensure that the state’s vaccination program continues to be guided by the best available science.
“What the bill would do is give the state some flexibility to continue to follow vaccine schedules that are based in science,” said Gray, who is a physician assistant by profession.
It is appropriate to modify vaccine schedules and policies based on new knowledge, Gray said. But the recent changes to the childhood vaccination recommendation and schedules “are politically driven, not driven because of new scientific information,” he said.
In December, the Trump administration’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ditched the longstanding U.S. recommendation for universal Hepatitis B vaccination of newborns. Committee members were appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who fired the previous members en masse in June.
The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics called the change to Hepatitis B vaccine recommendations “irresponsible and purposely misleading guidance” that will lead to more infections of infants and children.
On Jan. 5, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Services released new guidelines that significantly cut the recommended doses and types of vaccines for children. Vaccinations for Hepatitis A and B, respiratory syncytial virus and meningococcal disease will be among those recommended only for children in high-risk groups, according to the new policy.
The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes that change as well.
The department’s announcement “to arbitrarily stop recommending numerous routine childhood immunizations is dangerous and unnecessary,” the academy’s president said in a statement.
Other medical organizations gave similar assessments.
Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the Department of Health and Human Services’ changes to the vaccine schedule “drastic” and criticized the agency’s lack of transparency or clear scientific justification. In a statement, he said it is “the latest reckless step in Secretary Kennedy’s assault on the national vaccine infrastructure that has saved millions of lives. His actions put families and communities at risk and will make America sicker.”
Trump administration officials said the reduced childhood vaccination schedule puts the United States on par with many other industrialized nations. In particular, they cited Denmark’s vaccine practices as a model.
“After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent. This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a Jan. 5 statement.
Kennedy is a critic of vaccines. He has canceled funding for vaccine research. In Anchorage last summer, he claimed the COVID-19 vaccines actually prolonged the pandemic.
Gray said he and other health providers have concerns that more severe changes to vaccine policies may be coming under Kennedy’s leadership. For example, antivaccine activists who support the secretary have used rhetoric attacking basic vaccines that prevent polio, measles, mumps and rubella, he said.
“Because there’s been talk about those, I think we’re kind of on pins and needles that changes could be made to the most essential vaccines for public health,” Gray said.
Alaska’s immunization program provides universal access to vaccines that are purchased by the state in bulk. The money-saving bulk purchases were established by a bill that state lawmakers passed unanimously in 2014.
Alaska is already deviating from last month’s change to Hepatitis B vaccination recommendations.
State health officials announced on Dec. 29 that the state still recommends universal Hepatitis B vaccinations for newborns.
Alaska has a higher-risk status for the virus that warrants an exception from the new general recommendations, state health officials said. There is a history of high levels of childhood Hepatitis B in Alaska that the state eventually controlled through decades of screening and vaccination. Prior to vaccination, Western Alaska had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer related to Hepatitis B infections.
Despite its successes in curbing childhood exposure to the disease, Alaska continues to have high rates of Hepatitis B among adults. Alaska’s rate of chronic Hepatitis B is nearly three times the national rate, according to health officials.
Other regions of the Arctic have also had extremely high rates of Hepatitis B, with experiences similar to those in Alaska. In Greenland, for example, vaccination of babies within 24 hours of birth has been routine since 2010, following Alaska’s practice.
Gray’s bill is one of several filed in advance of the 2026 legislative session, which starts on Jan. 20.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard summed up Kansas Democrats’ 2026 session goals with a familiar refrain: “affordability, affordability, affordability.”
That message was echoed by Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell, Oregon House Majority Leader Ben Bowman and New Jersey Senate Majority Whip Vin Gopal on a webinar to preview the 2026 legislative sessions that was hosted Tuesday by NewDEAL Leaders — a group of center-left state and local leaders.
All panelists aimed to achieve the same goal through slightly different means adapted to their states.
Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, proposed giving renters 15% of their rent back through a tax rebate, expanding Medicaid, eliminating the copay for free and reduced school lunches and more. Most of his proposals were a reprisal from a Monday press conference where Kansas House Democrats revealed their policy goals for the session.
Woodard talked about Democrats’ road trip last year to hear from constituents — called the “Fight Back Tour” —  and what he heard from Kansans.
“After announcing our legislative agenda, there were a couple Republicans who made side comments about how, ‘Oh, here go the Democrats again with their affordability talking points,’ ” Woodard said. “And I was able to push back and say, ‘No, this is what your constituents in your district told us they care about.’ ”
Woodard said the Democrats are geared up to fight for causes Kansans value. 
Kansas Republicans’ “No. 1 issue is banning trans Kansans from being able to get driver’s licenses, while we’re focused on making sure that people have access to homes, health care and education,” Woodard said.
Kansas Republicans have outlined a few goals for the session — such as curbing property taxes and embracing President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act — but a bill barring Kansans from changing gender markers on their driver’s licenses received a hearing Tuesday, the second day of the session.
Woodard talked about reframing Democrats’ arguments to fit residents’ values. He wants Democrats to find a “bumper sticker” to start an argument with, rather than getting into the weeds. He used school vouchers as an example.
“Lets stop with what you want the headline to be,” Woodard said. “Because what we know in western and central Kansas is without their public schools, without Friday night lights, they don’t have much of a community. And that’s the heart of their community, they love that. 
“So when we say, ‘They want to defund your kid’s football team,’ Kansas voters start listening. If we talk to them for 15 minutes about why vouchers are bad, we’ve already lost the argument.”
A big goal for Democrats this year is to break Republicans’ supermajority in the November midterms. They had the same goal two years ago, but the 2024 election resulted in Republicans expanding their supermajority. Florida had the same results, with Florida Republicans gaining more power.
Even with Florida’s current legislative makeup, Driskell said she is optimistic. 
“I do think there’s an opportunity to pick up some seats,” Driskell said. “Because the winds are shifting. I think 2026 is a change environment. It feels akin to 2018 in Florida, when we picked up seven seats in the Florida House.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1120035-1024x656.jpg,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-14 14:06:15+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Massachusetts set out to modernize its unemployment insurance system. Then it hit a new low.,Jordan Wolman and Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/massachusetts-set-out-to-modernize-its-unemployment-insurance-system-then-it-hit-a-new-low/,Massachusetts was the slowest state in issuing initial unemployment payments in the country between June and October.,"WHEN ANDREA RUSSO lost her job this past summer, she needed money, and she needed it fast.  
Russo, a single mother who worked for Microsoft out of its Cambridge office, was abruptly let go as part of widespread downsizing throughout the company. After the tech giant cut her position, Russo had to rent out her house while she and her daughter, a high school senior, moved in with a friend. Her son who recently graduated from college is taking on a greater share of his student loans than was initially planned. Russo has had to dip into her savings account each month to live while she continues to look for full-time work in a tough job market — and fight what’s been an exhausting battle against state bureaucracy to get the unemployment insurance benefits she needs.
Five months later, she’s still fighting.  
After weekly calls to the Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance (DUA), being placed on hold for 45 minutes, in-person visits to state offices, and being told that “we’re escalating” the situation too many times to count, Russo is still without a full-time job and without financial support. She initially filed for benefits with the state in August, according to a copy of her claim viewed by CommonWealth Beacon, yet she hasn’t received a dime in unemployment insurance benefits and is still without so much as a tangible status update about where her case stands and what issues are preventing the money from being disbursed.  
“I’ve never been unemployed before. I’ve had a job since I was 14 years old,” said Russo, a Rhode Island resident who filed for unemployment in Massachusetts because that’s where she was employed. “For once in my life, I need help, and I just feel let down.” 
Russo’s claim is just a fraction of the mounting cases that piled up at the DUA over the better part of 2025, where an unemployment system that was already falling short of key federal performance metrics stumbled into a new crisis.  
In each month between June and October, at least 4 in 10 new unemployment claims filed in Massachusetts by eligible workers went unpaid for 35 days or longer, according to federal data.  
By that measure, Massachusetts was the worst-performing state in the nation over that span. 
Anywhere from one-fifth to one-third of new claims in each of those months still hadn’t been paid within 70 days, forcing thousands of people to wait more than two months for aid to which they believe themselves entitled. 
Ironically, it was the state’s implementation of a new system meant to modernize and streamline the delivery of unemployment benefits that prompted the meltdown. A confluence of factors emerged: The new system’s technology, which includes enhanced tools for fraud prevention, led to a steep jump in the number of issues flagged in claimants’ applications, and it took significantly longer for claimants to get hearings to resolve those issues, just as DUA staff underwent required trainings on the new platform that took them away from their normal duties.  
The Healey administration kicked off the new system in May, featuring 140 new call center agents that drastically cut wait times and greater accessibility of the online portal through mobile phones and in multiple languages. The upgrades were one part of a larger, multi-year effort to update the unemployment insurance system and turn Massachusetts into one of the “top performing states” with “national leadership,” according to the Healey administration. 
“DUA is committed to improving operations and communication with impacted workers and employers, and the launch of this new, modernized [unemployment insurance] system marks a major milestone in our efforts to serve customers,” Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Lauren Jones, who oversees the state’s unemployment insurance system, said in a statement at the time.  
But things quickly went awry.  
A federal performance standard calls on states to aim for making at least 93 percent of initial payments within 35 days. At various times over the past three decades, Massachusetts dipped below that target, but never as sharply for as long a stretch as it did last year. 
Last April, the state paid roughly three-fourths of initial claims within 35 days. In May, the month the new system went into effect, the rate dropped to 69 percent; by September, it had fallen as low as 42 percent, the worst single month on record in Massachusetts since 1997, the earliest year for which data is available. 
Massachusetts was the slowest state in issuing initial unemployment payments in the country between June and October. The Bay State’s unemployment rate held steady during that period, while claims saw a modest increase that was far less dramatic than in previous years more affected by COVID-19. 
Evan Murphy, a principal at Unemployment Tax Control Associates in West Springfield, described the situation as “a little bit of a perfect storm.” 
UTCA is a third-party administrator that handles unemployment insurance on behalf of about 300 Bay State employers. On multiple occasions in recent months, Murphy said, his firm has interacted with former workers who were told by DUA that their case is stalled because the state is still waiting for an employer to provide more information. 
“I can see in a lot of cases that we responded, like, a month ago with everything that they’ve asked for, and there’s nothing that is still due,” Murphy said in an interview. “I don’t know why [the state is] saying that, or if they’re buying themselves time, or whatever the case may be. It creates a strain on employers, and claimants don’t necessarily have a lot of answers, and I feel bad for them.” 
The debacle led DUA to launch a three-month pilot program in August to close call centers on Fridays to allow workers to “process claims faster.” The state said the pilot has been successful, reducing issues associated with individual claims by nearly 58 percent, while staff at the same time handled double the amount of calls compared with the prior year. The state extended those call center changes in the pilot program through the end of March on account of its success. 
The agency is also in the process of hiring 29 adjudicators and 150 seasonal employees to help process claims and staff the call center.  
“DUA is committed to making sure eligible claimants receive payment as soon as possible because we know they rely on these funds to make ends meet and [to] provide support during times of transition,” Matt Kitsos, a DUA spokesperson, said in a statement. “Over the past several months, DUA recognized a drastic need to adjust operations to improve customer experience and process claims more efficiently, which led to the implementation of major initiatives and operational enhancements with significant progress underway. We know we have more work to do and we remain committed to doing so.” 
Kitsos said the US Labor Department metrics themselves, while an important tool, may not “fully reflect the truth strength or health of an organization.” He said that while DUA was closer to meeting federal timeliness standards in early 2025, DUA was carrying a significantly higher backlog than it currently is, something not necessarily captured in the federal data, which only measures the timeliness of initial payments once that money goes out the door. 
State lawmakers, having faced the wrath of their constituents over long wait times, remain on edge over the situation, though they largely have kept their concerns behind closed doors rather than flex oversight muscle. 
Sen. Jacob Oliveira, a Democrat from outside of Springfield who co-chairs the Labor and Workforce Development Committee, told CommonWealth Beacon that “we’re not out of the woods yet” and he suspects upcoming hearings on the state’s annual budget will feature “tough questions” related to the unemployment benefits situation. 
But lawmakers have not yet scheduled any hearings on the next budget debate, which Gov. Maura Healey will kick off with a proposal due later this month. Last year, the first budget hearing took place March 6; if Beacon Hill keeps that pattern again this time around, lawmakers wouldn’t get a chance to ask “tough questions” until roughly three-quarters of a year after the UI platform change that triggered the crisis. 
“This new system was designed to support and make it easier for residents to actually get their unemployment claims processed, and when it was rolled out, it was not rolled out in a way that was acceptable,” Oliveira said. 
But he said it appears the situation may be improving, pointing to fewer complaints from constituents in recent weeks. He also offered robust support for Jones, arguing that wait times have been too long for claimants for decades. (Data show that while the system has had periods of delays in the past, the tail end of 2025 was a historic low.) 
The unprecedented breakdown is leading others, however, to question those in charge, and it could create an election-year headache for Healey. 
“Making sure that people who lose their jobs get timely unemployment insurance benefits is a core public service,” said Evan Horowitz, executive director at the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University, who previously served on the state’s special commission on the unemployment insurance trust fund. “It’s shocking that we are failing to provide it, and I can’t shake the sense that it reflects a real leadership failure at the agency.” 
The Healey administration did not make Jones available for an interview upon request.  
At the time of publication, Massachusetts remained the only state in a federal database without November first-payment timeliness statistics. 
Kitsos said the Healey administration provided the relevant information to the federal government after some initial technical issues on the federal side, but can’t speak to why the federal database has not been updated to reflect the state’s data. 
DUA officials also provided CommonWealth Beacon with additional data demonstrating the department’s performance at processing all claims, including denials. That’s a more detailed universe than the federal data, which captures only initial payments made in cases involving eligible applicants. 
In July, about 47 percent of all claims — both those that were paid, and those that were denied — were processed within 21 days, DUA data show; by November, the share had risen to nearly 58 percent, reflecting some improvement. 
Even before the latest problems erupted, unemployment insurance in Massachusetts had long been a source of discontent. 
The state has had to contend with unemployment fraud, which soared nationwide during the pandemic and later specifically targeted Massachusetts in 2023, triggering extra security checks that slowed processing times for claims. A 2024 state audit also documented issues at DUA, including the payment of benefits to individuals while they were incarcerated. 
More recently, the Trump administration cut $400 million in federal unemployment insurance funding for states. Kitsos, the DUA spokesperson, cited declines in federal funding and a rise in unemployment fraud nationwide as challenges, conceding that the launch of the new system presented a “learning curve” associated with new “workflows and expectations” for staff and claimants. 
While the federal government funds the administrative side of states’ unemployment insurance programs, Massachusetts businesses fund the actual joblessness benefits in the state through taxes they pay. Those businesses have for decades lamented the high costs of providing that aid, which is arguably the most generous in the country. 
A surge of unemployment early in the COVID-19 pandemic overloaded the system. Massachusetts borrowed money to ensure it could keep up with the record demand, and employers continue to owe hundreds of millions of dollars per year more to repay that balance. 
Businesses are also preparing to be on the hook for another sizable debt. The Baker administration mistakenly used federal pandemic funds to cover unemployment benefits that should have been paid with state dollars. Healey last year announced a $2.1 billion settlement with the federal government that reduced what Massachusetts owes and spread the repayment out over a decade. 
Healey pledged that businesses would not face higher unemployment insurance taxes as a direct result of the agreement through at least the end of 2026. That’s little comfort to many employers because, due to economic factors and the trust fund’s shaky outlook independent of any federal debt, employers are already facing a series of increases in the rates they pay, forecast to reach the maximum allowable level starting in 2028.  
The governor last year said she would task Jones and her budget chief, Matthew Gorzkowicz, with convening a series of conversations about how to reform the system, but it’s not yet clear what — if any — action that will produce. Prior state efforts to build consensus for unemployment changes fizzled. 
“[The Department of Unemployment Assistance] has been not run well, and I think part of that is because of some sort of philosophy – from Democrat and Republican administrations alike – that it does not have to be because it’s not funded by rank-and-file voters and taxpayers,” said Retailers Association of Massachusetts president Jon Hurst, who’s been closely involved in discussions about big-picture reforms. “Employers are taxpayers as well and deserve to have a well-run system.” 
“Are we close to coming forward with a real plan of action? I’m not overly optimistic that will happen prior to an election, but hopefully, before taxes spike, particularly a year from now, a roadmap will be written,” he added.  
The downturn in DUA’s performance in 2025 has been particularly sharp, and it isn’t limited to payment timeliness alone. 
DUA is also dramatically below the federal performance standards for issuing “nonmonetary determinations” within 21 days of the date of detection of an issue that could impact a claim, like questions around how and why the claimant lost their job and whether the claimant is actively looking for work. 
Though Massachusetts wasn’t meeting that benchmark even before the new system took effect in May, DUA’s ability to issue these determinations got dramatically worse after the fact. The feds say 80 percent of determinations should be made within 21 days; in October, Massachusetts made just 43 percent of one category of nonmonetary determinations within 70 days — achieving roughly half of the target in more than three times the duration. The raw number of another category of nonmonetary issues increased dramatically, tripling from just over 7,000 in April to more than 21,000 in October, the second-most on record in state history. 
And the number of appeals pending a hearing decision more than quadrupled immediately after the new system was installed in May, according to Labor Department data. In April, DUA reported just shy of 2,000 such appeals. The next month, it spiked to 6,364 and reached over 8,000 in June before continuing to balloon to 9,631 in August — the most since January 2023. 
“We remain deeply concerned by the ongoing delays claimants are facing when attempting to access unemployment insurance benefits,” Jason Salgado, a staff attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services, said in a statement, adding that “performance data and the challenges claimants continue to experience underscore the need for [DUA] to better understand, provide additional clarity regarding, and take more urgent action to address the root causes of these delays and barriers.” 
The state’s program, experts said, is at legal risk due to its poor performance. Claimants could sue DUA, for instance, for failure to meet payment timeliness requirements.  
That’s what happened in Alabama in 2022 after a lengthy unemployment upheaval there. After a long legal fight, a state judge threw out the case in October.

The US Labor Department could withdraw all funding for DUA for noncompliance, though that has never happened before to any state because of the catastrophic consequences that would result, said Amy Traub, a senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. 
DUA said the Labor Department has not issued any warnings or threats with regard to how it has administered unemployment insurance benefits in recent months. But the agency has reached out to the feds for “technical assistance on how states are expected to meet timeliness standards while still taking the necessary measures to prevent and detect fraud and have also adequate investigation time to ensure proper pay,” said Kitsos, the spokesperson. 
Both the political and administrative battles over the state’s unemployment system could continue into 2026 as Healey advances her reelection bid. 
Even though DUA is encouraged by recent data showing improvements in November, there’s concern that any reprieve could be short-lived if underlying issues with the new system persist. Unemployment claims nationwide, including in Massachusetts, regularly climb in the winter months. 
Then there’s the longer-term outlook. Even if nearly all checks started flowing out on time once again, the system would still face the long-term deficit exacerbated by the Baker administration’s mishandling of federal pandemic funds.

Any attempt to rebalance it could prove politically toxic because unemployment reforms are, essentially, a zero-sum game: Most changes that would be more favorable to the employers who fund jobless aid would be less favorable to the out-of-work Bay State employees who need the benefits like Russo, who is still reeling from her inability to receive unemployment insurance for nearly half a year. 
“[This] is costing employers, and at the same time, you’re finding out that the claimants aren’t being paid timely,” said Murphy, the unemployment insurance third-party administrator. “The system is just not really working for any of the stakeholders.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DUA.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-14 14:05:49+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,The state can accelerate the move away from natural gas with one move,Audrey Schulman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/the-state-can-accelerate-the-move-away-from-natural-gas-with-one-move/,"The Department of Public Utilities faces a choice: proactively lead the next transition, as it did before, or let gas utilities trap customers in a failing system.","WE’VE BEEN HERE before. Seventy years ago, every gas appliance in the Commonwealth was converted—house by house, street by street—to a cleaner, safer fuel. This transition was planned, coordinated, and universal.  
Today, as gas becomes more and more expensive, the Department of Public Utilities faces a choice: proactively lead the next transition, as it did before, or let gas utilities trap customers in a failing system. Much of this hinges on the meaning of a key legal phrase invoked by utilities — “obligation to serve” — the idea that, as publicly regulated entities, they are required to provide service to all who want it. That phrase is now at the center of a high-stakes showdown over a 2024 climate law enacted by the Massachusetts Legislature.  
We once had a different fuel running through pipes to Massachusetts homes – “manufactured gas,” which was made from pressurized steam pushed through crushed coal. It had a different chemistry, color, and energy intensity. The level of impurities varied, and occasionally people died from the carbon monoxide.  
After World War II, a new type of gas became available, extracted through drilling into underground deposits. This “natural gas” had fewer dangerous impurities and delivered twice the energy for the same cost.  
Transmission pipelines reached Boston in 1953. Utility workers went from street to street to perform the needed changes. Residents opened their doors willingly since they were told ahead of time that this would reduce their bills and improve safety. Once inside, the workers retrofitted every gas appliance: stoves, water heaters, and boilers.  
Crews returned repeatedly until all the work was complete. That was how seriously the industry took its responsibility to serve the public. As John Bacon, the one-time president of Boston Gas, later recalled: “We had a couple of situations where we had to break in to get the appliances converted.” 
State regulators approved having gas customers pay for these and other system-wide changes, since moving to a safer and more affordable system was in the public interest for all. 
Fast forward to the present day, and it’s a very different picture. Gas use in Massachusetts homes has dropped 25 percent since 1990. This stems from the general trend of warmer winters, energy efficiency, and electric heat pumps – which have been outselling gas boilers for years, since they provide cooling along with heating.  
This decline will probably accelerate, because heat-pump customers can now pay a lower electric rate, making their heating bills roughly the same as with gas. 
Regulators see where this is headed. If the gas system stays the same size with the same fixed costs, with less gas sold over time, each unit of gas will cost more and more. Rising costs will encourage customers to defect faster, until the only ones left will be those who can’t install a new electric heating system: low-income homeowners and renters.         
Regulators are requiring gas and electric utilities to plan how to rightsize the antiquated, declining gas system. Gas utilities are now allowed to convert whole streets to a geothermal network—like the one Eversource gas installed in Framingham as part of a pilot study—or to air-source heat pumps. Both methods are safer than gas, and provide cooling as well as heating, and cleaner air. With the new heat pump rate, customers on a geothermal network are likely to have much lower heating bills than with gas, these bills will have no price volatility (given that the energy is just beneath their feet, not tied to the global market like gas), and our energy dollars will stay in-state. 
But gas utilities – potentially resistant to change – are not reacting by installing as many geothermal networks as possible. Instead, they’re saying they have an “obligation to serve” and that if even one customer wants gas on a mile-long street, the pipe must remain – forcing every other gas customer in that utility’s territory to subsidize that customer‘s choice.         
However, the “obligation to serve” statute was amended in 2024. The change not only allows gas utilities to deny service to new customers, it allows gas utilities to discontinue service to an existing customer as long as the utility can ensure the customer has access to an alternative to heat their home, like electricity or geothermal energy. Although the amended law explicitly applies to “any person…in a town where a corporation is engaged in the…sale of gas or the distribution of energy,” gas utilities continue to insist that the law applies only to new customers.  
The dispute over the obligation to serve will be resolved by the Department of Public Utilities, probably near the end of 2026. The question is whether the DPU will concede to utilities, allowing them, for the first time, to lock customers into an increasingly expensive, unhealthy, and climate-damaging fuel —betraying the very purpose for which regulated utilities were created. 
Imagine a utility truck pulls up on your street in 2030. Technicians emerge, not to patch another gas leak, but to make final connections to the renewable thermal network. Down the street, a crew installs heat pumps, their work coordinated with the gas pipe decommissioning. 
A neighbor watches from her porch. A year earlier, she worried about losing her gas stove. But the utility company handled everything, and her new induction range heats faster, the heat pump keeps the house comfortable year-round, her bills dropped, and her child has fewer asthma attacks. The transition became manageable because it was planned, coordinated, and universal. 
This transition will happen. Gas use is declining, and that decline is about to accelerate. The only question is whether Massachusetts will manage it intelligently, as it has in the past, or will it let utilities trap customers in a system in decline.

Riding the momentum of a handful of successful pro-housing bills last year, some Democratic lawmakers are advancing a $10 billion bond proposal that aims to ease California’s housing crunch, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu.
Last week the Senate Housing Committee progressed a bill that would place the housing bond before voters during this year’s primary election. Seven billion dollars would go toward the state’s Multifamily Housing Program, which offers loans to low-income residents for rental housing. 
Another $2 billion would be allocated for rental assistance and affordable housing for low-income tenants and farmworkers, and the remaining $1 billion would assist low-income, first-time homebuyers with their down payments.

Sen. Chris Cabaldon, Napa Democrat and bill author, during a hearing last week: “Those homes don’t build themselves, and it’s time to finish the job. To unlock the full promise of these reforms requires cash.”

The bill is expected to be heard in the Senate Appropriations Committee next week and, if signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would be placed on the ballot in June.
But the sailing hasn’t been smooth for other housing bills. On Tuesday a proposal that would have limited how much landlords can raise rents each year failed to garner enough “yes” votes in the Assembly Judiciary Committee.
Introduced last year by Assemblymember Ash Kalra, the bill faced strong opposition from a coalition of landlords and realtors who argued that the measure would make financing rental housing more difficult and squeeze mom-and-pop landlords.
Kalra, a San Jose Democrat who also serves as chairperson of the judiciary committee, told CalMatters that the bill failed because “we are listening to these wealthy landowners and apartment owners and not those that are literally struggling.”

Trump loses court case over transportation funds

President Donald Trump’s administration has stopped efforts to appeal a November court decision that prohibited it from withholding transportation funding from states that did not comply with its immigration enforcement policies.
By dropping its appeal Tuesday, the administration “concedes the case” in favor of California and more than a dozen other states that sued the administration, said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement.

Bonta: “I am pleased that the Trump Administration has accepted defeat … We will continue taking the President to court each time he weaponizes federal funding to bully our communities.”

In April the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a directive attempting to hold hostage billions of dollars in federal transportation funding — which went toward public infrastructure such as roads, highways and bridges — to pressure states to cooperate with the administration’s immigration policies. Those included “not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement” and not “taking action intended to shield illegal aliens from ICE detection.”
Arguing that Congress, not the president, had the authority to allocate federal dollars, California and other states filed suit. In November a federal court sided with the states, granting a permanent injunction to block the funds from being cut. In the ruling, a district judge said the federal transportation department “blatantly overstepped their statutory authority … and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions.”



Air board proposes big emissions cuts

From CalMatters climate reporter Alejandro Lazo:
California regulators on Tuesday took a first step toward reshaping cap-and-invest, a key climate program and one of the state’s biggest sources of funding for projects ranging from zero-emission vehicles to high-speed rail and wildfire prevention.
Cap-and-invest limits greenhouse gas pollution by capping emissions and allowing companies to trade a limited number of permits with each other, rewarding those that cut emissions fastest.
The proposal unveiled by the California Air Resources Board would cut the supply of permits to drive emissions from the state’s largest polluters 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 85% by 2045. California’s 2022 climate blueprint called for steeper cuts, but regulators say rising consumer costs are a concern.
The board is expected to vote in May, setting up a debate between industry and climate advocates.
The program also funds high-speed rail and wildfire fighting efforts, including hundreds of millions for Cal Fire in Newsom’s proposed budget, unveiled last week.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Days before the Mississippi Department of Human Services director was ousted from his job in 2019, he was testifying to Congress about one of the very initiatives that landed him with a felony conviction in a now-infamous welfare theft scandal.
As director of the agency tasked with helping some of the neediest people in one of the poorest states in the country, John Davis had secured contracts for his new friend, former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase, in 2018 to deliver leadership development workshops to state employees. 
And the reaction to their efforts was swell.
While testifying Tuesday in the criminal trial against DiBiase, Davis said he met with a top official at the attorney general’s office at the time, and they discussed including the attorney’s staff on DiBiase’s circuit. 
Davis said a director at the federal office that oversees the national Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant, which funded the DiBiase training, recommended that Davis expand the program.
Even a representative in Congress remarked during Davis’ testimony, “It’s interesting how well your program is working.”
DiBiase is facing 13 counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, theft and money laundering. But his defense lawyer’s cross-examination of Davis, which began Tuesday, revealed how much of the alleged scheme was carried out in broad daylight.
“Would you agree that if you were trying to hide something, you were going about it in a terrible way?” defense attorney Scott Gilbert asked Davis.
Davis said he thought everybody was aware of what he was doing, but that he “evidently” didn’t go about it the right way.
It was after delivering this answer, on his third day on the stand, that Davis displayed the largest emotion so far, his face puckering and voice cracking. The defense briefly halted its questioning for him to compose himself.
“Hindsight is 20/20 and until someone told me what conspiracy was, I would have told you I did exactly right,” Davis said earlier in the day. “When someone told me what conspiracy was, I admitted I did what I was told I did, so I have to accept responsibility. But my intention would have been as legal as possible.”
Davis pleaded guilty to state and federal charges in 2022 and he is cooperating with the prosecution as he awaits sentencing. DiBiase’s defense counsel is expected to resume cross-examination of Davis Wednesday.

Much of the defense’s questioning of Davis Tuesday touched on the difficulties he faced at the Byzantine welfare agency, with its outdated technology and constant political pressure.
One might think an agency with billion-dollar federal spending power would have automated spreadsheets in its accounting division, Davis said, but instead, employees used pencils on paper ledgers. 
“Sometimes the pencil stroke would be so light or wrong,” Davis said, that he personally witnessed a scenario in which a $2 million deficit was mistaken as a $200 million shortfall.
In an agency with a budget made up primarily of federal funding, subject to a maze of everchanging federal regulations, Davis relied on his executive staff, roughly 70 staff attorneys and several assistant attorneys general who were assigned to his agency to keep him on track.
Davis testified he was steered wrong on several occasions, leading to an inappropriate course of action. “You always lived on the edge, scared to death,” Davis said.
He was also appointed by the governor and had no civil service protection.
“I was at the whim and pleasure. I said ‘whim and pleasure,’ and that’s what it was,” Davis said.
This made him more susceptible to politics. Davis said he would travel to Washington to meet with Mississippi’s delegation and would visit state lawmakers at the Capitol in Jackson several times a week. When Gilbert suggested powerful people must have constantly been asking Davis to do things for them, Davis said he received 1,000 emails a day.
“Everything I did was influenced by a political process,” Davis said. 
His direct supervisor was then-Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who served from 2012 to 2020. Davis said he interacted with Bryant every day or most days.
“I learned that as an eligibility worker,” Davis said. “The only way things worked is to please your boss.”
It wasn’t about pleasing the people in need, the clients of the agency, Davis added.
“I know I’m saying something controversial,” he said.
When asked if he was able to carry out these directives, even the unpleasant ones, Davis responded, “No compunction about that. That was my job.”
Davis testified he was working under Bryant’s orders to outsource and consolidate functions of the agency when Davis authorized granting tens of millions of TANF dollars to just two nonprofits, one being Mississippi Community Education Center founded by Nancy New. 
New has also pleaded guilty in the scheme and is also awaiting sentencing.
Davis said Bryant and his wife had known New for years and would at times call New “rather than go through me.”
The subgrants with the two nonprofits, together dubbed Families First for Mississippi, presented the vehicle for officials to allegedly steer TANF money to their friends, family and celebrities without the kind of restrictions and oversight that would exist if the money came directly from the state agency.
This structure was underway by the time Davis met DiBiase, the defense pointed out Tuesday.  
Gilbert also strove to show that it would not be unusual for Families First to seek out celebrities like DiBiase to spread their message. Gilbert asked Davis to talk about the array of stars that Families First sought for endorsements, such as Oprah Winfrey or Morgan Freeman. Davis said he thought New had actually spoken with Winfrey “or her people.” 
Gilbert displayed reports of social media analytics showing that of MDHS-related posts, DiBiase’s tweet about his leadership development program received the most page views.
DiBiase called his training program, which he delivered to hundreds of employees until the Davis’ scheme collapsed under an auditor’s investigation, “Law of 16.”
“He had a fascination with the number 16,” Davis said.
“Fear is INEVITABLE,” reads screenshot from a power point former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis and wrestler Ted DiBiase Jr. used during their leadership training program called Law of 16.
The Law of 16 curriculum contains four types of self-help actions – love, yearn, fight, empower (LYFE) – among four areas of life – self, family, business, community – to create 16 different commands for living, according to an information packet.
Law 1, for example, is SELF+LOVE. 
Standing before a gospel choir in a banquet room at the Westin hotel in downtown Jackson during what the agency called the “Law of 16 celebration,”  Davis declared to the large crowd, “If we don’t know who we are, if we haven’t mastered self, we will never, ever master the master’s plan,” according to a video the welfare agency produced.
When Gilbert asked Davis if he ever offered, or if DiBiase ever requested, a “no work” contract, Davis said it was quite the opposite. If anything, he said, he probably invested too much of himself ensuring that DiBiase succeeded. 
Davis said he knew the situation was dysfunctional. Especially now, being on the other side of it, Davis said, “complicated, convoluted and crazy are terms that don’t even begin to describe it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13121041/John-Davis-DiBiase-trial-4.jpg,,,2026-01-14 09:57:39.992020

In recent months, a string of refinery fires, chemical releases and other disasters has put Californians on edge. Yet California regulators are quietly proposing to weaken the state’s safety rules in a secret deal with oil lobbyists — putting us all at greater risk. 
On Jan. 15, regulators will hold a public hearing at the state’s Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board meeting in Sacramento on changes to California’s Process Safety Management regulations, an issue with life-or-death consequences for workers and nearby communities.
These regulations exist to keep people safe. After the 2012 Chevron refinery explosion in Richmond sent a massive fireball into the sky and sent thousands of residents to seek medical help, California strengthened its refinery safety rules. 
The reforms established crucial safeguards: rigorous oversight of hazardous materials and processes, common-sense standards ensuring meaningful worker participation in safety processes and engineering reviews, and authority for workers to stop unsafe operations. 
We represent communities living next to refineries and the workers who operate them. Together, we are sounding the alarm — California must not allow oil billionaires and their lobbyists to rewrite refinery safety rules.
Recent disasters at refineries across California — including major fires and explosions in Martinez, Benicia and El Segundo in 2025 alone — show that the risks remain serious and urgent. 
As oil executives disinvest from maintenance at aging refineries, the risk of deadly disasters increases, making these regulations more important than ever.
Refinery disasters don’t just affect workers and local communities. They impact Californians across the state when we fill up our tanks. Major accidents often disrupt fuel supplies, driving up gasoline prices.
The proposed OSHA changes stem from a settlement between state regulators and oil industry lobbyists — a secret deal crafted behind closed doors, excluding workers and frontline communities. The changes would erode critical safety protections and give oil companies more control over the rules meant to hold them accountable.
The most dangerous change targets a crucial aspect of refinery safety, employee participation. 
The proposal would allow oil executives to handpick workers to participate in developing safety plans and conducting critical safety reviews. In practice, that means a worker who raises concerns about corroded pipes or unsafe chemical levels could be replaced with someone more willing to stay silent.
This defies common sense. Refinery workers are responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of these facilities. 
They know which metals are used in each process and how much acid or additives can be used. They know which chemicals corrode and rip holes through pipes. Their knowledge is essential to preventing disasters.
Other revisions would reduce oversight of hazardous chemicals, narrowing what companies are required to analyze and fix. 
These dangerous and carcinogenic substances don’t disappear just because we decide to look the other way. They remain on-site, threatening workers and surrounding neighborhoods.
Communities like Richmond and Carson are already deeply impacted by day-to-day refinery pollution. They experience elevated rates of asthma, cancer and other chronic illnesses. Explosions and toxic accidents exacerbate these risks. 
The existing safety rules were built with worker input for a reason. Refinery workers want safe jobs. Refineries are inherently hazardous, and a single failure can mean severe injury or death. Workers must be able to select their own representatives who understand refining processes, prioritize environmental health and safety and who will not cave to corporate pressure. 
Luckily, this deal can still be stopped. Governor Newsom’s regulators should reject these industry-driven rollbacks and work openly with workers and residents.
The future of safety at California’s refineries should be defined by public voices — not oil billionaires and their lobbyists.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/050924-Marathon-Refinery-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

Newsom knows that being portrayed as a left-leaning cultural warrior from deeply blue California — a factor in sinking Kamala Harris’s White House bid — is potentially fatal.
Thus, Newsom’s final state budget takes on a new political meaning, and makes the always difficult process of weighing competing interests within the state even trickier than usual.
We saw that syndrome affect Jerry Brown, the last California governor to harbor serious presidential ambitions. In 1978, he opposed Proposition 13, the iconic tax cut ballot measure, but after its passage championed both a large state tax reduction and a spending limit ballot measure to realign himself with the tax cut movement.
Brown then tried to ride the anti-tax, spending-limit movement into the White House two years later — but failed miserably.
Back to Newsom.
His initial budget proposal, released last week, basically adopts the current spending plan, with a few tweaks that continue his ideological drift to the right. In hopes of producing a balanced budget, at least on paper, Newsom is cutting back on spending for social welfare and health care services and college scholarships.
Those steps alone are drawing criticism from many advocacy groups, but resistance is also heightened by his apparent unwillingness to fill in gaps caused by President Donald Trump’s cutbacks in federal support.
The reaction from left-leaning advocates was summarized well in a critique by Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget and Policy Center, an umbrella group of organizations that lobby for public services, especially those for the poor.
“California’s state budget is a reflection of our shared values and our responsibility to care for one another,” Hoene said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the governor’s 2026-27 spending plan balances the budget by dodging the harsh realities of the Republican megabill, H.R. 1, and maintains state cuts to vital public supports, like Medi-Cal, enacted as part of the current-year budget.
“Governor Newsom’s reluctance to propose meaningful revenue solutions to help blunt the harm of federal cuts undermines his posture to counter the Trump administration.”
Some budget critics want new taxes to both cover the state’s deficits and offset federal reductions. To fill those gaps, any new levies would need to generate somewhere around $30 billion a year.
“That means taking on corporations and billionaires, raising revenue instead of slashing budgets, and building a stronger California every step of the way,” the Legislature’s Progressive Caucus said in response to Newsom’s budget proposal.
Both of Newsom’s predecessors, Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger, supported new taxes to close multibillion-dollar shortfalls. However, Newsom has repeatedly rejected any broad tax increases to close deficits.
Unions and other left-leaning groups are sponsoring two potential ballot measures to raise taxes. One would continue and expand a temporary tax hike on high-income Californians that Brown sponsored after returning to the governorship in 2011. The other proposal would levy a 5% tax on wealth of the state’s billionaires.
Newsom has promised that when he revises the budget in May, just a few weeks before it must be enacted, he will both balance it for the next fiscal year and attack the huge deficits that will linger after his governorship ends. The chances of doing that without new taxes of some kind are — to put it mildly — almost nil.
If Newsom continues to reduce spending on services for the poor and resist new taxes, his lame-duck status could draw unaccustomed resistance in the Legislature. Likewise, his presidential hopes might face opposition from progressive groups both in California and states that are important to a 2028 campaign.

California lawmakers showed historic enthusiasm for the abundance movement last year as they passed sweeping housing laws that roll back landmark environmental reviews for most urban developments and allow denser housing near transit — ambitious endeavors that would have gotten nowhere just a few years ago.
This year, housing advocates are trying to seize the moment again, particularly in the last year in office for the pro-building Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
Just days after returning to work, state lawmakers are already advancing a $10 billion bond that stalled last year to pay for new and existing affordable homes. The proposal, Senate Bill 417, cleared the Senate Housing Committee by an 8-1 vote last week and heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee next week. Lawmakers are seeking to put the measure on the June primary ballot, which would require the governor to sign it into law by Jan. 22.
“Those homes don’t build themselves, and it’s time to finish the job,” said Sen. Chris Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat who authored the legislation, during a hearing last week. “To unlock the full promise of these reforms requires cash. It requires sufficient capital, as it always has, to move these affordable housing projects from approval and permitting to construct.”
The bond measure would allocate $7 billion toward the state’s Multifamily Housing Program, which issues low-interest loans to build and maintain permanent and transitional rental housing for lower-income households. It also includes $2 billion for wildfire prevention, rental assistance and affordable housing for low-income tenants and farmworkers, as well as $1 billion in low-income first-time home buyer assistance, including help with down payments. 
The committee also approved a separate bond proposal to pay for housing for homeless youths, although lawmakers are looking to combine the bond measures. Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat who authored the proposal, said she’d “couch surfed” at age 19 when she became unhoused for a year and half. The money would help reduce homelessness by offering relief earlier in people’s lives, she said. 
“This is an investment that is really going to help us save money down the line,” she said.

The legislative appetite for housing bonds indicates another good year for pro-abundance advocates. They’ve already got the ear of the governor, who declared himself an ally of the “Yes In My Back Yard” movement by signing a flurry of bills last year to fast-track housing production, which the governor touted in his State of the State address last week. 
This year, the governor said, the Legislature should focus on reducing the cost of construction, “utilizing new building methods and technology” and passing “worker-centered reforms that bring our brothers and sisters in labor along with us.”
In February, Sen. Jesse Arreguín of Oakland, a renter who’s big on fast-tracking housing construction, will take the helm of the Senate Housing Committee. He will replace Sen. Aisha Wahab, a fellow renter and Fremont Democrat who has long criticized new construction without protection for low-income tenants. 
Bill to curb rent increase dies again
But efforts to champion tenant protections hit a major snag Tuesday when a controversial rent control proposal died in the Assembly Judiciary Committee. Assembly Bill 1157, introduced last year to further restrict how much landlords can raise the rent each year, failed to get enough votes Tuesday despite being authored by the committee chair, Democratic Assemblymember Ash Kalra of San Jose. 
The bill, sponsored by the tenant rights group Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, would have tied the annual rent increase rate to the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, and capped it for most rental homes at 5%, instead of 10% under current state law. As a compromise, Kalra narrowed the bill on Tuesday to exclude single-family home tenants from the proposed rental relief in hopes of securing passage. Individual landlords of single-family homes aren’t subject to rent control under state law.  
“Tenants need a permanent solution, not a temporary fix,” Kalra said during Tuesday’s hearing.  “If we don’t act with urgency to help our tenants in crisis, we are going to continue to contribute to the risk of homelessness.”
The proposal stalled last year amid strong headwinds from a coalition of landlords and realtors led by the California Apartments Association. They argued Tuesday that the measure would discourage investment in rental housing and squeeze small landlords. Voters have rejected past rent control ballot measures, such as Proposition 10 in 2018 and Proposition 33 in 2024. 
The measure needed seven votes to advance but only got four, all from Democrats. All three Republican committee members voted against the bill. Five other Democrats — assemblymembers Rick Zbur of Los Angeles, Blanca Pacheco of Downey, Diane Papan of San Mateo, Catherine Stefani of San Francisco and Rebecca Bauer-Kahan of San Ramon — did not cast a vote, which effectively counts as a no vote. 
“That shows the power and influence of moneyed interests.”Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a Democrat who represents San Jose
Some of them, such as Zbur and Bauer-Kahan, expressed concerns during the hearing that the proposed law could hurt landlords. Rent hikes are caused by the state’s housing shortage, they argued, and the Legislature should instead focus on building more housing. 
Echoing similar concerns, Stefani’s spokesperson, Daniel Herzstein, said in a statement that a lower rent cap would risk squeezing landlords who already face rising costs. Pacheco was unsure how the bill would affect mom-and-pop property owners, said her spokesperson Alina Evans. Papan’s office did not immediately return a CalMatters’ request for comment. 
Lidya Morales, a 53-year-old single mom from San Diego with three kids, said her monthly rent increased from $1,300 in 2022 to $2,000 last year. She works at three different hotels to afford it, she said. Without the proposed rental relief, she said she fears getting priced out.
“I don’t want to live in my car with my kids,” she said.
Following the bill’s defeat, hundreds of tenants affiliated with ACCE broke into chants in protest. “Housing is a human right!” Some yelled. Others screamed “shame” at the near-empty committee dais after most lawmakers ducked out after the vote.
Kalra told CalMatters that the bill failed because “we are listening to these wealthy landowners and apartment owners and not those that are literally struggling.”
“I think that shows the power and influence of moneyed interests,” he said.
Taming unintended consequences
Apart from unveiling ambitious proposals, state lawmakers this year must also figure out how to clean up after new housing policies like Senate Bill 79, a controversial law authored by Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco that overrides local zoning restrictions to allow apartment buildings up to seven stories near major transit stations in metro areas. 
Lawmakers passed the law narrowly last year after it went through 13 rounds of amendments to quell criticism from a coalition of interest groups and state lawmakers, who sought more stringent environmental reviews, labor protections, affordable units and local control. 
But critics say the resulting law still has unintended consequences. 
Mobile home park residents in the Bay Area who live close to transit lines say the law makes them vulnerable to displacement by allowing their parks to be redeveloped into apartment complexes, a loophole that Wiener himself acknowledged.

Gail Rubino, a resident at the El Dorado Mobile Home Park in Sunnyvale, said at least 36 parks in six of the state’s most populous counties will be affected by the new law. If all were allowed to be redeveloped, more than 5,400 people would be displaced, she estimates. A new bill from Wahab, whose district includes many of the parks, seeks to shield mobile home parks from redevelopment into transit-oriented housing. 
“This lack of protection threatens existing affordable housing stock that SB 79 seeks to increase,” Rubino told lawmakers last week.
SB79 has caused confusion among local officials, who say the law is so vague that they cannot even agree on which counties it applies to. While Wiener has said it’s his intent to apply the new law to eight of the state’s most urban counties, local government associations insist only four fit the bill. Some local government agencies say they are afraid to adopt new zoning maps without clear guidance, worried it would result in litigation. 
Wiener said he will introduce new legislation later this year to clarify how counties should implement the new law.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/070822_Housing-Elk-Grove_RL_CM_21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

Carlsbad homeowner John Levy is challenging a $2.4 million fine from the Coastal Commission over alleged beach access and environmental violations, arguing that while the underlying disputes are typical, the commission’s power to impose massive penalties without court oversight violates due process.


Carlsbad homeowner John Levy’s lawsuit against the Coastal Commission disputes penalties over two locked gates, native vegetation, a wedding site and pickleball court. It also challenges the commission’s authority to exact multi-million dollar fines without judicial review.
The commission, which protects public access and environmental quality in the Coastal Zone, a strip of land that follows California’s shoreline, accused Levy of blocking public access to the beach, removing shorebird habitat and illegally installing the pickleball court. It fined him $2.4 million for those offenses.
Levy contends the two gates that the commission wants him to open have complex property rights issues. He said he has honored environmental protections, and while he built the court without proper permits, he’s working with the city to fix that.
Those are ordinary matters before the commission, concerning how the public can access coastal property and what gets built there. But Levy’s complaint goes further, arguing that the powerful commission violated his due process rights by imposing steep fines without court oversight, and collecting penalties that fund its own programs. 
“They’re the investigator, they’re the judge, they’re the jury and also they’re the treasurer,” Levy said.
Commission staff and members did not respond to questions from CalMatters, citing the pending litigation. At the October hearing, Rob Moddelmog, enforcement counsel for the Coastal Commission, said Levy could have avoided the years-long conflict by complying with the California Coastal Act.
“At any point in that period of time, Mr. Levy could have simply opened his gate and removed his padlock from another gate within the easements, and removed development from the wetland buffer, and avoided this entire proceeding,”   Moddelmog told commissioners. “But after all this time, and after considerable effort by your staff, he has chosen not to.”
Trouble in Levyland
Levy’s property sits at the corner of Buena Vista Lagoon in Carlsbad. He bought the land and obtained a coastal development permit to build the estate he calls “Levyland” in 1998. Almost immediately he began feuding with the commission over permit conditions.
Nearly all beaches in California are open to the public, and the commission can order property owners to provide beach access across their land. Levy says the permit requires “lateral access,” meaning visitors can enter the beach from adjacent parts of the shoreline. The commission argues that doesn’t accommodate disabled beachgoers, and says Levy must provide access from the street, Mountain View Drive.
There are two paths that could allow beachgoers to get across Levy’s property. One is a road to the beach along Levy’s property, which is owned by the neighboring homeowners association. The other is a foot trail on his land, which travels along the lagoon. 
Both are blocked by gates that have been mostly closed for a quarter of a century, in violation of his permit, the commission said. 
“We’ve been asking Mr. Levy to comply with the coastal act and his (coastal development permit) for years, and he has refused,”  Moddelmog said. “And this is why we are forced to bring this order to you today to compel Mr. Levy to finally address his violations.”
Levy says he’s willing to provide public access but is hamstrung by ownership and easement issues. When he built the home, Levy installed a gate at the road to the beach, with permission of the HOA. Now he said he needs the association’s permission to remove the gate from its land.
He also agreed to give the city of Carlsbad an easement over the footpath, so visitors could walk to the beach. The commission maintains that the easement is in place, so the gate must be open. But Levy and Carlsbad officials say the city never accepted it.
“That’s one of the fundamental questions underlying this is whether there’s truly an easement in place,” said Jeremy Talcott, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm that advocates for property rights and is representing Levy in this case.
Carlsbad officials didn’t comment for this story, citing pending litigation. But in a letter to the commission, Carlsbad community development director Jeff Murphy and city prosecutor Marissa Kaweki stated that Carlsbad questions the commission’s authority to require removal of the gate and said the city hasn’t approved the easement.
“The public currently cannot access this trail easement that has been offered because it has not been accepted by the city,” they wrote.
Levy is required to open the gate and provide trail access regardless of the city’s participation, commission staff argued. But without the city taking charge of safety and maintenance for the trail, it’s too much of a liability to let the public on his land, Levy said.
“If in fact I was guilty of blocking public access or not being compliant with my coastal permit, then I would have acquiesced, or settled,” he said. “But I didn’t.”
The commission also fined Levy for coastal development violations: unpermitted changes to his property.
His property fronts the lagoon on two sides, and provides habitat for the endangered light-footed Ridgeway’s rail, California least tern and light-footed clapper rail. He was required to provide a 100-foot buffer of native vegetation for shorebirds. The commission accused Levy, who now lives in New Zealand, of renting his home as a wedding venue and removing native vegetation to clear a parking lot for events.
He also built a pickleball court on the property without permission. Moddelmog said commission staff didn’t necessarily oppose that, but would have recommended siting it further from the lagoon.
Levy said he didn’t operate a wedding venue, but allowed weddings at his rental property. And he said he cleared invasive plants from the shoreline and replaced them with native seed mix. A self-described “avid pickleball player,” he acknowledged it was a mistake to build the court without permission, but is working to obtain an “after-the-fact” permit.
Nonprofits including Surfrider Foundation, Disability Rights California and Buena Vista Audubon urged the commission to approve penalties against Levy.
“It is time to put a stop to these egregious coastal access and wetland habitat violations, once and for all,” Surfrider officials wrote.
But Talcott said these questions of property law should be decided in court, not by the same government body that investigated the matter and issued the notice of violation.

“I don’t think that’s the sort of question that can be resolved in a commission hearing,” he said. “There’s not a neutral adjudicator in that hearing. They’re not a judge. They’re a commission tasked with maximizing public access, and empowered to investigate, prosecute and judge violations of the Coastal Act.”
Who should adjudicate coastal conflicts?
For more than half a century, the Coastal Commission has protected coastal ecosystems and kept beaches open to all Californians. Critics say it has also restricted housing construction in coastal areas and gained sweeping authority to impose steep fines.
The commission can fine property owners $11,250 per day for each violation, for up to five years. In long-running disputes that can run up to millions or even tens of millions of dollars.  In Levy’s case, Moddelmog said staff “recommends a conservative approach” and grouped all his alleged public access violations into one penalty of $1 million and the coastal development violations into one fine of $1.4 million.
The penalties lack the due process protections of criminal court proceedings, Levy argued in his complaint. For instance, commission hearings don’t include the right to testify under oath, authenticate evidence or subpoena and cross-examine witnesses, Talcott said.
“It has none of the procedures involved in a criminal hearing,” he said.
The commission also has a conflict of interest in adjudicating its own penalties, the complaint argues, since the money collected from those fines funds its own enforcement and other programs.
Mary Jo Wiggins, a law professor at University of San Diego who specializes in real estate and land use, said it’s not uncommon for regulatory agencies to administer costly fines. 
“Public bodies are making decisions that are similar in nature to what the California Coastal Commission is doing here,” she said. “It’s really more a matter of the scope of their power rather than whether they have the power to do this or not.”
For instance, the California Air Resources Board may rely on administrative law judges in lieu of civil court proceedings to impose fines totalling up to $100,000, or $300,000 for some fuel violations. In 2023 the legislature authorized the State Water Resources Control Board to fine water violators up to $10,000 per day plus $2,500 for every acre-foot of water taken.
Levy’s complaint argues that the seven-figure fines against him amount to “quasi-criminal” penalties that should receive judicial oversight. Wiggins said that’s a credible argument.
“They’re not just compensatory, they’re punitive,” she said. “That requires a higher level of review that the commission doesn’t provide because it’s reviewing its own fines.”
If the case isn’t resolved in their favor, Talcott said Levy and the foundation will appeal to the state or even federal Supreme Court.
Case precedent may not be in Levy’s favor. In 2016 the Coastal Commission fined Warren and Henny Lent $4.185 million for coastal access violations at their Malibu home. In 2021 an appeals court upheld the penalty, and the state and federal Supreme Courts declined to review the case.
Levy said he’s prepared to go as far as he can to challenge the Coastal Commission.
“I’m 74 and I don’t care how much I have to spend, but I’m going to bring this to the forefront of The U.S. and California,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/072523_Del-Mar-Coast-Erosion_AH_CM_004.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-14 12:58:32.206113

(Photo by David Abbott/Arizona Mirror)Nevada lawmakers are once again taking the lead in a bipartisan effort to reverse a court ruling adopting a stricter interpretation of a 150-year-old federal mining law.
Mining developers in the West have grappled with the aftermath of a 2022 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that essentially restricted mining companies from dumping waste on federal lands where they did not have a valid mineral claim – a practice that had gone on unimpeded for decades.
While federal mining law allows companies to mine on federal land if they have a valid mining claim, the federal court decision ruled that companies are not guaranteed the right to use adjacent federal land without valuable minerals for related mining purposes – such as waste rock disposal or running power lines.
The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act of 2025 — introduced by Republican Rep. Mark Amodei — passed the Republican-led House of Representatives with a 219 to 197 vote during the lame-duck session in December.
While the legislation passed mostly along party-lines, the bill picked up nine Democrats, including Nevada’s Rep. Steven Horsford, a cosponsor of the bill. Only one Republican voted against the bill, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. 
Nevada’s other Democratic Representatives, Susie Lee and Dina Titus, have raised concerns with the bill’s broad language, and voted against its passage last month. 
Western legislators have largely led the effort to reverse the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals “Rosemont decision” which found that the federal government erred when it approved the Rosemont Copper Company’s plan to dump mining waste on U.S. Forest Service land in Arizona where the company could not prove they had a valid mineral claim.
“The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act restores decades of established precedent, repairs a permitting process undermined by the Rosemont decision, and gives domestic mining operations the certainty they need to compete aggressively and win,” said Amodei in a statement on its passage.
The bill would essentially reverse the ruling by removing a provision in the General Mining Act of 1872 that mining companies must show a mineral deposit is present before building roads and other support facilities at a potential mining site. The bill would also create an abandoned hard rock mine fund to support reclamation programs.
“Streamlining the hardrock mining process will create good jobs and strengthen our energy sector. At the same time, this legislation delivers more resources for the Silver State to clean up past mining-related contaminants in our environment,” Horsford said in a statement on its passage.
Last year, Amodei introduced a similar bill which also passed the Republican-controlled House and was included in a larger mining reform package in the Senate. But that package, shepherded by former independent U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, fell apart during the lame duck session despite a strong bipartisan desire to implement permitting reform.
Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is sponsoring a companion bill in the Senate, which passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in April of 2025. Cortez Masto’s office said the state’s senior senator will “continue exploring all avenues to move it forward in the Senate.”
House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman said “the ramifications of the Ninth Circuit’s decision are substantial,” and urged the bill’s passage. 
“Although the Rosemont decision involved Forest Service lands, it has prompted multiple lawsuits targeting projects on BLM lands based on similar regulations,” he continued.
During debate on the House floor, California Rep. Jared Huffman questioned the notion that the Rosemount decision created significant roadblocks for the mining industry, adding he has “found no evidence that any mines are currently being held up because of the Rosemont decision anywhere in America.”
“You know what happened to the Rosemont mine after that court decision came down? The next day, the company paid for private lands for its waste disposal. Zero problem. The mine wasn’t stopped. It’s just the industry would prefer to use the public lands, your lands, and to be able to dump for free,” Huffman said on the House floor.
Huffman said several Democrats have offered several amendments to Republican leadership that would improve the bill and prevent foreign mining companies from abusing the General Mining Act of 1872.
Lee, who represents Nevada’s second district, said she supports a “Rosemont fix” but that the bill required more clarity to get it “through the Senate and to the President’s desk.”
“While I appreciate the significant improvements made to this legislation, further tightening some of the language in the bill will be essential to preventing potential abuse and misuse,” Lee said.
Lee proposed an amendment that would limit “impacts to lands that are actually necessary for mining operations” and clarify that the federal government has the authority to regulate mining on all of the public lands in its care, but that amendment was rejected.
“If my amendment had been included, I would have voted in support of the legislation,” Lee said.
On the House floor, Democrats also argued Amodei’s bill would only benefit the mining industry by making it easier for companies to develop sites without documented mineral deposits. Huffman said the bill would give too much power to — and provide too little accountability for — mining companies that already work in a favorable regulatory environment.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/copper-world-rosemont-hudbay-operations-scaled-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Legislature is picking back up a proposal that would restructure an important fee in most Utahns’ power bills and which, according to lawmakers, could help lower energy prices for Rocky Mountain customers.
This legislative session, which starts Tuesday, Richfield Republican Rep. Carl Albrecht is sponsoring a bill he stopped pursuing last year as negotiations swirled with the state’s largest energy provider over other issues. His proposal would hold Rocky Mountain Power responsible for 20% of costs to its Energy Balancing Account, which is fed by a market adjustment fee that can either credit or debit ratepayers for the utility’s costs not covered by the regular electricity rates.
With the 2026 bill, Albrecht hopes to reinstate a sharing band for Energy Balancing Account costs, with Utah customers taking care of 80% of it. Ratepayers have been covering the total cost since 2016, after the Legislature passed a law sponsored by Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, establishing the structure.

“The whole idea behind it is to give some rate relief to Utah customers,” Albrecht said on Tuesday, “and have Rocky Mountain Power have some skin in the game and have their shareholders face some of those costs.”
Utah lawmakers call on PacifiCorp to do some ‘soul searching’ about rates, working with Legislature

Albrecht would like to see Utah adopt a similar system to the other states Rocky Mountain Power serves. Idaho customers cover 90% of their Energy Balancing Account, while the company pays for the remaining 10%. In Wyoming, the shared cost structure is 80% for ratepayers and 20% for the utility. 
“We’re just asking that Utah has something similar, which protects the customers,” Albrecht said.
Albrecht initially introduced the idea to the Legislature in November 2024, during the interim session, following a 30.5% rate increase proposal from the company that rattled Republican state leaders. After the rate bump numbers became public, lawmakers grilled top Rocky Mountain Power executives, asking them to study a split from PacifiCorp — the utility’s parent company — and had the Energy Balancing Account under more legislative scrutiny.
In response to the bill draft, Rocky Mountain Power described the Energy Balancing Account in a statement to Utah News Dispatch as an “important tool for managing the variable costs of providing electric service,” and said that the Utah account is consistent with industry standards.
“This helps keep rates stable for customers while also contributing to the financial stability for the utility between general rate reviews,” the company said. “We will evaluate the proposed legislation with a view to achieve balanced outcomes that ensure fair prices for customers and a reasonable opportunity for the utility to recover the necessary costs to providing reliable energy for Utah’s families and businesses.”
But, with other negotiations taking place with Rocky Mountain Power executives, Albrecht’s bill was delayed in the Senate.
“Those negotiations were successful at the end of the session, so I dropped the bill and was asked to run it again this year,” he said.
The fee is designed to change according to market prices, which have been increasing for years, becoming a substantial part of ratepayers’ bills. 
Now that the Utah Public Service Commission has approved a 4.7% electricity residential rate increase — only about a quarter of the 18.1% that Rocky Mountain Power ended up requesting after public outcry — Energy Balancing Account fees may make up for those market costs. That’s if commissioners approve the charges.

Ron DeSantis’ popularity has dipped in the newest public opinion survey conducted by veteran polling firm Mason-Dixon.
The survey of 625 registered Florida voters shows the governor at 50% approval and 46% disapproval. That’s down from a Mason-Dixon survey taken last March, when he was at 53%, and the lowest ranking taken by Mason-Dixon since July 2020, when he was just at just 45%, following his opening up the state during the height of the COVID crisis.
The survey was conducted from Jan. 8 through Jan. 12. The margin for error was at +/- 4 percent.
Brad Coker, the Mason-Dixon pollster, pointed to “notable drops” among several voter groups from a 2025 survey. Among voters with no party affiliation, DeSantis approval rating has dropped 10 points, from 51% to 41%. He’s dropped with Hispanic voters as well, declining from 57% to 49%, and among black voters from 16% to 7%.
He is also now under water with women, with 49% disapproving and only 45% approving.
Coker says there are several reasons why the governor’s numbers might be dropping, including national trends for Republicans and voter fatigue as he begins his eighth and final year in office.
“With no immediate announced political plans, DeSantis’ popularity drop probably has no immediate impact,” Coker writes. “Overall, a 50% approval rating is not bad — it is simply somewhat lower than what he has enjoyed throughout his tenure.”

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Ahead of a launch in southern New Mexico this weekend, New Mexico Forward Party leaders announced this week the organization has gathered enough signatures to qualify as a minor party in the state.
Party organizers also announced two endorsements for Democratic candidates they characterized in a news release as “aligned” with the party’s mission.
One of those candidates, former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima, who is running in the June 2, 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary race, told Source NM the endorsement validates his “centrist credentials.”
“With this endorsement, it solidifies me with independents; they know I’m their guy,” Miyagishima said.
The other candidate, Matilda “Tilli” Villalobos, a former federal prosecutor running for state House District 37 in Las Cruces, could not be reached for comment.
The Forward Party says its values represent a return to civil politics with a focus on improving U.S. democracy. It was founded in 2022 by Andrew Yang after his unsuccessful Democratic bid for president in 2020, and former Republican New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman.
The party platform requires candidates to sign a pledge to follow the rule of law and the Constitution; use data-driven policy making; and to work collaboratively across parties. It also requires commitments to open primary elections, independent redistricting commissions and ranked-choice voting.
In an interview with Source, NM Forward Chairman and former state Rep. Bob Perls said a new state law enacted last year allowing unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in primary elections will mean an “improvement” for the quarter of New Mexicans not registered with the state’s major parties. Prior to the law, unaffiliated voters could utilize same-day registration to vote in one of the major parties’ primaries, but even that option had only been available for the last few years.
“We believe that the reason we have this hyper-partisanship and gridlock in Washington and most state capitals is due to little incentive for elected officials to coalition-build or compromise, and that’s largely because of the structure of closed primaries and partisan primaries,” Perls said.
In order to qualify as a minor party, state law requires more than 3,561 signatures from New Mexico voters — which is at least one-half of one percent of the total votes cast in the 2022 election, according to the secretary of state’s website.
Perls told Source NM the party has collected more than 4,500 signatures and plans to submit them for approval by state election officials in March or April.
“We want to elect, not just Forward Party candidates, but Democrats, Republicans and independents who reflect the values of wanting to work together, wanting to support these democracy reform measures, and wanting to stop the yelling and take down the temperature in political discourse,” Perls said.
Perls said Miyagishima and Villalobos embody those characteristics.
“We’re confident that even though they are Democrats, they are the kind of people who will work with Republicans, who will work with independents, and readily accept ideas outside of traditional Democratic ideas, if it’s going to serve their constituents,” he said.

Kay Ivey Tuesday called for expansions to a voucher-like school program and broader use of the death penalty in her State of the State address. 
In the Old House Chambers in the Alabama State Capitol, Ivey’s ninth and final State of the State was an election-year address that called significant spending increases, particularly pay raises for teachers and state employees, but was notably silent about addressing major cost increases in public employee insurance programs, a key issue for lawmakers in the 2026 session, which began Tuesday. 
“Our teachers are earning high marks. And we added 500,000 more credentialed men and women to our workforce,” Ivey said.

Ivey proposed a 2% pay raise for teachers in her fiscal year 2027 budget. In lieu of a pay raise for the FY 26 budget, the Legislature increased funding for health insurance and paid parental leave for public educators.
The Legislature will make the final decisions on spending in the state’s budgets.
“From day one, we put a hard focus on education. Now, I could not be prouder that my final Education Trust Fund proposal will be the largest ever in our state’s history,” Ivey said, though she did not say how big her proposal would be. The current ETF is $9.9 billion. 
Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, chair of the House Ways and Means Education Committee, said in an interview after Ivey’s speech that he was aware of Ivey’s proposals for pay raises for teachers and state employees and thinks they will make it into the final budget.
“I think we will. We’ve got lots to digest, and we haven’t seen the numbers yet,” Garrett said.
Ivey also asked lawmakers to expand the CHOOSE Act, which extends tax credits for use for private school tuition and other non-public education-related expenses, from $180 million to $250 million.
“That number will only grow as more folks learn about the program, as student athletes feel more confident in the rules and when it becomes fully universal in year three,” she said. “This will help even more families receive the education that best suits their child.”

The governor did not address rising health care costs in the Public Education Employee Health Insurance Program (PEEHIP) or the State Employees Health Insurance Program (SEHIP), which provide insurance to the state’s employees. 
Recent federal policy changes have added pressure to the state’s budgets. Both state health insurance plans, the Public Educator Employee’s Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) and the State Employee Insurance Board (SEIB), plan to request more money from the state to alleviate rising health costs.
PEEHIP’s request will impact the ETF, while SEIB’s request will impact the General Fund budget. PEEHIP plans to request a $380 million increase for fiscal year 2027.
Ivey touted the state’s improvements in education, a category where the state ranked 52nd in fourth grade math and 49th in fourth grade reading when Ivey took office in 2017. Now, she said, the state ranks 32nd in math and 34th in reading. 
House Minority Leader Rep. Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, said he appreciated Ivey’s recognition of the state’s improvement in math and reading, but wants to focus on science.
“We want to make certain that we double down our efforts on the science,” he said in an interview after Ivey’s speech. “That’s an area that is extremely critical to not just the defense of our nation, but the progress of our future, and so we want to make certain that we are focusing more attention on that.”
Ivey also supported a proposal from Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, and Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, to expand the death penalty to those who rape or sodomize a child.
“I was proud to quickly offer my full and total support,” she said. “Ladies and gentlemen, I am urging you to pass this legislation so I can sign it into law.”
Simpson said in an interview after Ivey’s speech that the governor’s support means a lot to him. This proposal comes after seven people were arrested in Bibb County for their alleged involvement in a child sex trafficking ring. 
“I thought that was fantastic. She’s been strong on public safety,” Simpson said. “Once we filed this bill and had this opportunity to bring some public awareness to this, unfortunately, the situation in Bibb County has highlighted what this has done.”
The legislation is in part a direct challenge to a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision, known as Kennedy v. Louisiana, that declared the death penalty unconstitutional for crimes against individuals that do not result in the victim’s death. The court’s majority cited concerns that the prospect of the death penalty could encourage predators to kill victims, or expose victims to additional trauma through testimonies in the death penalty process. 
Simpson hopes that since other states have passed similar laws that his and Weaver’s version will be the final push to overturn the 2008 Supreme Court decision.
“We’re trying to show that this is not unusual. These are punishments that more people want to see, and I’m hopeful that we can overturn the Supreme Court decision,” he said.
One of Ivey’s top priorities in 2025 was the “Safe Alabama” package, a bundle of public safety legislation which mostly passed. For 2026, Ivey is supporting a smaller package of public safety bills including a 2% pay raise for all state employees, including state troopers.
“Whether it be our troopers’ efforts to make it safe, teachers’ steps to improve schools or our attempts to ensure healthcare options in our Capital City, I urge our local leaders to work with us over the next 12 months to put Montgomery on its strongest footing yet,” Ivey said.

Alabama House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, told members of the media that teachers and state employees deserve the raise and believes it will make it in the budgets.
“They deserve the pay raise, since the cost of living has gone up,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said a 2% raise is not enough. He said he is worried the raise would be offset by increased health costs, especially for teachers. 
“I wish they were higher, really,” he said in an interview. “We’re just going to have to work through that to make sure that that’s going to be a real 2% to both state and teachers employees.”
Ivey also celebrated the state’s $203 million first-year funding from the Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed by Congress in July. The money is meant to partially offset cuts to Medicaid in the coming years.
“We have laid the groundwork for success, and I urge you, our legislators, to help develop needed policy and to fully implement this program,” she said. “And to our healthcare leaders in the state: I challenge you to work with us in thinking outside-the-box and identifying new partners as we strive to improve health care in Alabama.”
The governor also proposed a flood notification system, inspired by floods in Texas in July that claimed the life of some young Alabama campers.
“Unfortunately, Alabama is no stranger to the wrath of Mother Nature. We are also home to many of our own camps. And y’all, as a former counselor myself, ensuring safety in these spaces is very personal to me,” she said. “We cannot put our young people at risk.”
Ivey also supports legislation from former Early Childhood Education Secretary Jeana Ross that would limit screen time for children under five years old. 
“Technology has incredible benefits, but too much of anything can be harmful,” Ivey said. “House Bill 78 will help our youngest Alabamians in their key developmental days.”
Ivey ended her reflective speech by thanking members of her cabinet, Legislative leadership and Alabamians.
“I am proud of Alabama. I am proud of our citizens. I am proud to continue leading our state forward. And I am humbled to be a governor of all the people.” she said. “This is our opportunity. So, let’s not waste a moment.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kay-Ivey-Jan-13-2026-04-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

Steven Horsford at a ""Fight Oligarchy"" rally in May, 2025. (Rosen image, Senate video screengrab; Horsford photo by Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)With President Donald Trump calling on Congress to ban corporate homeownership at the federal level, Nevada Congressional Democrats are pushing the administration to support existing legislation that monitors, but doesn’t cap, investor ownership of single family homes.  
U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford and U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen sponsored the Housing Oversight and Mitigation Exploitation (HOME) Act that seeks to enable federal agencies to investigate price-gouging practices by corporate investors and review anti-competitive practices in the residential housing market. 
The Nevada Democrats recently sent a letter to Trump urging his support for the bill. 
If passed, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development would be tasked with determining if corporate investors buy more than 5% of the single-family housing units in a market over a three-year period. 
Horsford and Rosen both said there were issues with placing a blanket cap or limit on investors at the federal level. 
“My bill intentionally relies on a percentage instead of a specific number limit before an investigation is triggered because housing markets vary widely,” Rosen said in a statement. “The impacts of buying up fifty homes in Las Vegas will be different than in Elko, which is why we can’t use a once-size-fits-all approach.”
Horsford’s office said since the number of large, out-of-state investors makes up a single digit percentage of single families housing stock “a nationwide cap will not prevent the problem.”  
“It could however incentivize institutional investors to make smaller-scale purchases, merging with other investors, or building homes for rent as a loophole,” the office said in a statement to Nevada Current. “That is why the HOME Act establishes monitoring and investigation triggers based on market concentration. The goal is to penalize bad actors while allowing responsible corporate owners to contribute to the housing supply by building new rental and affordable homes.”
Horsford’s office noted that he did support failed state legislation that sought to cap the number investors could buy in a single year. 
There have been several proposals in recent years at the federal level from Congressional Democrats that seek to limit corporate investors from purchasing single family homes. Those bills have lacked Republican support.
Trump posted on social media last week asking Congress to take action in an effort to tackle the housing and affordability crisis.
“I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,” Trump wrote in a social media post last week. “People live in homes, not corporations.”
The post didn’t outline any legislative language. Trump indicated he would outline details of his proposal at the annual Davos Summit in Switzerland next week.
The announcement has resulted in some Republicans jumping on the bandwagon, even those who have been hostile to efforts to rein in the industry, said Sam Garin, the senior communications coordinator for the Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has repeatedly stymied state legislative efforts to rein in corporate homeownership, announced he was “actively developing” a working group on the issue shortly after Trump’s post.  
In the letter Rosen and Horsford sent to Trump, they called on him to enact “meaningful oversight of the housing market, preventing large institutional investors from manipulating prices, and holding bad actor corporate property owners accountable for abusive practices that are increasing housing prices and putting the American Dream out of reach for millions of families.” 
The HOME Act is just one approach to addressing the housing crisis, Garin said. 
As the nation struggles to address the housing crisis, which include rising rents, limited affordable and available housing, and little tenant protections, there should be different policies adopted at both the federal and state level, she added. 
Both Congress and state legislatures need to look at many solutions from landlord registries to rent stabilization. 
“It’s the kind of thing where we need to come at it from a bunch of different angles to actually address it,” Garin said. “Obviously we support a cap and think it’s a really great idea. It doesn’t have to be a cap. What we could also see is changes to the tax code that reduce incentives for private equity firms or other institutional investors to be buying up these houses and profiting from them.”
While the HOME Act seeks to monitor institutional investors at the federal level, the bill also includes provisions that seek to limit investments from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to investors that have violated renter protections.  
“It’s especially notable that the HOME Act would limit investments from Fannie and Freddie to any organizations that have violated renter protections or have kind of engaged in exploitative rent hikes,” Garin said.
The problem to any meaningful policy solution is to ensure it has mechanisms of accountability built in legislation. 
“Any policy solution, any kind of policy intervention, needs to ensure that these firms and these big businesses do not get off with just a slap on the wrist or weak enforcement,” Garin said. “Very often, for these multi-billion dollar businesses, any kind of fines they get from the Federal Trade Commission just becomes a cost of doing business, and not a meaningful way of actually dissuading that behavior in the future.”
Garin also noted that Trump also has strong connections to the private equity industry as well as Wall Street, and if he wanted to rein in the industry he could use “those connections and work to actually get them to treat tenants better.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rosenandhorsford-1024x615.jpg,,,2026-01-14 08:57:26.185466

Such an action could have far-reaching impacts across the U.S., potentially even in places that aren’t particularly friendly to noncitizens.
Two previous efforts by Trump to cut off some funding for sanctuary jurisdictions were shut down by courts.
Trump unveiled the concept this time late in a speech Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club, without offering specifics.
“Starting Feb. 1, we’re not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come,” he said. “So we’re not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities.”
Back in Washington, Trump was asked by reporters what kind of funding would be affected on Feb 1: “You’ll see,” he said. “It’ll be significant.”
There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Courts have rejected the idea before
In an executive orders last year, the president directed federal officials to withhold money from sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to shield people in the country illegally from deportation.
A California-based federal judge struck it down despite government lawyers saying it was too early to stop the plan when no action had been taken and no specific conditions had been laid out.
In Trump’s first term in office, in 2017, courts struck down his effort to cut funding to the cities.
Some of the details are tricky
The Justice Department last year published a list of three dozen states, cities and counties that it considers to be sanctuary jurisdictions.
The list is overwhelmingly made up of places where the governments are controlled by Democrats, including the states of California, Connecticut and New York, cities such as Boston and New York and counties including Baltimore County, Maryland, and Cook County, Illinois.
That list replaced an earlier, longer one that was met with pushback from officials who said it wasn’t clear why their jurisdictions were on it.
The administration has been threatening funding in specific places
The federal government has moved to halt funding for a variety of programs in recent weeks and is already facing legal challenges.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned states that have refused to provide data on recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program money that they’ll be docked administrative funds. A court fight over the request for information was already under way before the threat came. Money hasn’t been stopped yet.
The U.S. Department of Health and Social Services said last week that it was halting money from five Democratic-led states for daycare subsidies and other aid to low-income families with children over unspecified suspicions about fraud. A court put that on hold
The administration has tried to use additional financial pressure against Minnesota, a state where it has also sent a wave of federal officers in an immigration crackdown. The Agriculture Department has said it’s freezing funding in the state — but without laying out many details.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also told Minnesota last week that it intends to withhold $515 million every three months from 14 Medicaid programs that were deemed “high risk” after rejecting a corrective action plan it demanded because of fraud allegations. The amount is equivalent to one-fourth of the federal money for those programs. State officials said Tuesday that they’re appealing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26013737139022-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 14:58:11.959867

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The State of Nevada is now up to 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration, according to Attorney General Aaron Ford.
Ford, a Democrat, held a press conference Tuesday to highlight his office’s legal efforts against the Trump administration, whose actions he called “not only illegal and unconstitutional but entirely immoral.”
“It has seemed that every week the president attempted to circumvent the limitations of power that our country has placed on the office,” said Ford.
Democratic attorneys general across the country have filed dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration during the first year of his second term. A case tracker maintained by the Progressive State Leaders Committee puts the number at 76 as of late Tuesday.
Nevada has signed onto 40 of those lawsuits so far.
In 25 of those 40 cases, courts have issued temporary or permanent injunctions on the alleged illegal policies. That includes a lawsuit first filed in April 2025 to block a Trump executive order on elections. Ford’s office is co-leading that lawsuit along with California and Massachusetts.
In addition to the 40 cases the state has formally joined, it has also filed numerous amicus curiae briefs in other cases challenging Trump actions.
Ford’s office is also defending the state in a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration in December over the state’s refusal to give sensitive voter information to the federal government.
Ford’s press conference comes as the U.S. Supreme Court resumes work after a winter recess. The court is expected to hear arguments or issue rulings soon on several high-profile issues, including tariffs, transgender athlete bans, and birthright citizenship.
A decision on a case challenging Trump’s tariff policies could come as early as Wednesday. A decision on birthright citizenship is expected this spring.
On day one of his second term, Trump issued an executive order that seeks to unilaterally abolish birthright citizenship. Democratic AGs and legal scholars argue it’s a clear violation of the 14th Amendment.
“People born in the United States are guaranteed citizenship,” Ford said Tuesday. “This has been the law of this land since the mid-1800s.”
“I’m confident we will prevail” in that case, added Ford.
Tuesday’s press conference had the feel of a campaign event for the gubernatorial race. Ford is running to be the Democratic challenger to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
Answering a question about legal efforts related to immigration, Ford pointed to a Democratic AG’s lawsuit centered on federal Victims of Crime Act funds, which the Trump administration had attempted to withhold unless states participated in this immigration-enforcement efforts.
“I’m the leader in this state that said that it is not appropriate and it is unlawful,” said Ford. “Not the governor, and not others.”
Ford criticized Lombardo for saying in a March 2025 interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the numerous lawsuits Ford had filed against the Trump administration were “unfortunate.”
Ford said Tuesday that “every time the federal government oversteps, one of us is going to step up, and it’s not going to be” Lombardo.
The legal efforts against the Trump administration have come at no additional cost to the state, Ford emphasized, and the only costs have been normal litigation fees, such as court filing fees. No new staff have been added, as has happened in other states.
“More importantly,” Ford continued, “the cost to the state for not pursuing this litigation would have been astronomical.”
Many of the lawsuits by Democratic AGs have centered on returning withheld or frozen federal funding, including public education and food programs like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FordPresser-1024x769.jpg,,,2026-01-14 07:57:18.297957

An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.
After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.
But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.
In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “unless deadly force is authorized.”
About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.
We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.
This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.
“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”
“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.
Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot a man and woman in a hospital parking lot.
Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”
Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.
Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count how often it detains citizens or smashes through vehicle windows during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.
Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.
But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.
That norm has now been broken.
One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old. 
Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.
Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.
One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.
“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”
DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.
McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.
Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.
“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”
DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”
After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out. 
In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.
Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.
According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”
Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.
Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.
But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.
The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death.
“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”
In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.
“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ use-of-force policy states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”
In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested he had only pretended to have a medical crisis while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.
“These statements were lies,” Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)
A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”
Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”
DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway. 
When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”
But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.
In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.
Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”
When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”
That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.
The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.
Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito limped into court days after the incident. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.
Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous. 
A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently passed out after officers pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street. “Aire, aire, aire,” he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo” — I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.
Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.
“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.
Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”

Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.
When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.
“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”
McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.
Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.
Protesters have also been choked and strangled. 
In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground.
“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”
DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.
Along with two similar choking incidents at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.
“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”
“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”
“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”
Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics. 
In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.
The Charlotte operation was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by commander-at-large Gregory Bovino claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently chased down landscapers, construction workers and U.S. citizens in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.
Freelance photographer Ryan Murphy, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.
“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”
Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.
“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.
“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”
There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a lack of consequences amid gutted oversight. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”
As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, where citizens — and protesters — abound, takes another.
DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.
Experts may think there’s abuse. Holding officers to account? That’s another matter. 
Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.
Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.
From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.
Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.
The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.
“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”
Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.
In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.
In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)
In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester and reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which announced it was looking into the incident.
In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government cut the state out of its investigation.
Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.
The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.
Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”
How we did it



Nicole Foy is ProPublica’s Ancil Payne Fellow, reporting on immigration and labor. journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.
We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.
Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.
We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to some of the incidents we found but she did not explain why agents used banned tactics or whether any of the agents have been disciplined for doing so.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251575611.jpg,,,2026-01-14 07:57:18.297957

Supporters say the state must combat a rise in crashes involving e-bikes.,"Gov. Phil Murphy should veto recently passed legislation regarding e-bikes, critics say, because it is confusing and targets low-income e-bike users. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A controversial bill that would require people to obtain a driver’s license and insurance to operate an electric bike is on the governor’s desk, awaiting his signature or veto.
The legislation advanced out of both houses of the Legislature — by votes of 28-10 in the Senate and 53-10 in the Assembly — during a marathon voting session Monday.
Bill sponsor Senate President Nicholas Scutari introduced the legislation in November after a spate of fatal crashes around the state that involved e-bikes. Bill supporters said they had become alarmed at the number of young people they saw zipping around neighborhoods at high speeds on e-bikes.
Gov. Murphy touts accomplishments in final legislative address

Critics of the bill were successful in getting the bill amended, but they remain opposed. Corey Hannigan of the Tristate Transportation Campaign called the legislation confusing and said it would sharply curtail access to e-bikes for low- and moderate-income New Jerseyans.
“It’s difficult to support something that breaks away from every other state in the union and is the most punitive e-bike law in the country,” he said. “This is a huge administrative burden for the people who would most benefit from this transportation.”
Current law classifies electric bikes into three different categories, depending on how powerful and fast they are. Bikes that have a maximum speed of 28 miles per hour require licensing, registration, and insurance.
The bill would create new terms of “electric motorized bicycle,” which would include bikes with pedals and an electric motor capable of over 750 watts that can exceed 28 miles per hour, and “low-speed electric bicycle,” which would apply to bikes with an electric motor that provides assistance when the rider is pedaling and stops once the bike reaches 20 miles per hour. A “motorized bicycle” would be one equipped with a motor that provides assistance while pedaling or via a throttle.
Under the bill, e-bike users would be required to register a low-speed electric bicycle and have a driver’s license. Insurance would also be required for motorized bicycles and electric motorized bicycles.
It would also bar people from riding e-bikes from dusk to dawn without reflectors, and prohibit the sale of modification kits aimed at turning a low-speed e-bike into a motorized or electric motorized bicycle.
The bill would also restrict minors under 15 from operating an e-bike or motorized bike, and require those 17 and older to have a driver’s license. Anyone 15 or 16 would have to have a permit. There is an exemption if you rent the bike from a company that has a contract with a local government.
E-bike owners would have one year to meet the new licensing, registration, and insurance requirements. And people found to be violating these requirements could be fined up to $50.
The bill also includes a one-year ban on the sale of electric bikes online.
Nationally, e-bike injuries rose by 293% from 2019 to 2022, according to Columbia University researchers.

Gov. Phil Murphy, who has not indicated whether he would sign the bill, has until Jan. 20 to act on the legislation. That’s his last day in office.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Ambitious electric service affordability legislation faced dozens of recommendations for improvement Tuesday — from lawmakers and lobbyists alike — across a two-hour hearing.
House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.
“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.
“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.
Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”
The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.
Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.
“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”
The provision encountered mixed testimony.
Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”
Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused Ways and Means Committee.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.
“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.
Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.
Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.
“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.
Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.
“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.
Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, speaks during an Indiana House committee meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 13. 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Pryor suggested a name change.
“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”
“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”
House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.
Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.
Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives
The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.
Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.
Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.
State explores multiyear rate setting, performance incentives for utilities

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”
Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”
Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.
Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.
Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”
The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.
Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.
It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.
“I appreciate everyone who testified in the committee today and expect any amendments put forth to reflect the valuable insights and feedback we continue to receive from experts, stakeholders and residential ratepayers,” Shonkwiler said.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to unleash raids in Minneapolis, our police officers face the same struggle as in other target cities — including our sister city of St. Paul — to keep people safe without assisting in those raids.  
After several months of study and public input following questions raised about Minneapolis police’s crowd control tactics during the overly militarized Lake Street raid in June, the city amended the separation ordinance to strengthen and clarify this issue. In addition, MPD has used its own settlement agreement process with the state Department of Human Rights to gather its own public input, and released a revised immigration policy that both more clearly prohibits assisting ICE and provides more protection to the public.    
One can make the case that this wouldn’t have happened without strong and sustained public pressure, but the bottom line is that it did happen.
MPD Chief Brian O’Hara described the new policies at a press conference just days after the Trump administration announced “Operation Metro Surge,” which continues to seize members of both our Somali and Hispanic communities and create chaos. The new policy restates the current general rule that MPD will “not participate in immigration enforcement,” and goes further to say that MPD also shall “not assist in the removal or transportation of people”; “not provide crowd management solely at the request of immigration enforcement agencies”; and, absent “a clear an immediate threat to life, serious injury, or destruction of property…will not escort federal immigration agents to enforcement locations or close streets when there are no traffic or public safety issues.”  
Finally, the new policy specifically affirms that gathering a crowd to protest is a “First Amendment-protected event”; that MPD will record and report any federal violations of this right; and that MPD “will verbally or physically intervene” against any federal use of excessive force as soon as there is “a reasonable and safe opportunity to do so.”  
During his press conference, O’Hara made clear that this incudes responding to 911 calls from terrified residents. Indeed, he told the New York Times this week that his agency has seen a marked increase in 911 calls responding to the newly volatile situation. 
Of course, MPD cannot and must not launch an armed attack against federal officers, but they have made clear that their foremost duty is to “protect and serve” our community, not invasive federal agents. And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.  
As O’Hara pointed out, the new policies and training will “remind our officers of their duty to intervene.”  
The dilemma that our community faces is that MPD’s recent commitment to the law and Constitution — refraining from escorting ICE agents or providing ICE crowd control, while upholding First Amendment rights by declining to  dispatch officers to ICE protests absent a “clear and immediate threat” — means that MPD may not be present to intervene when ICE attacks protesters suddenly and without any forewarning or provocation. 
That’s what happened when an ICE agent killed Renee Nicole Good.  
Even in the face of this dilemma, however, MPD has continued to honor its reinforced commitment to constitutional policing during the massive protests following the killing. It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.
This is a good example of the kind of transformation that citizens demanded after the police murder of George Floyd, and which was codified by the settlement agreement with the Department of Human Rights.  
Even in the face of the current chaos and distress, we should all be encouraged by this strong step by our local law enforcement in the right direction.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Assembly, which met for its first floor session of the year on Tuesday, passed two constitutional amendments that could be on ballots in November as well as bills to withhold pay from suspended judges and to make “grooming” to establish a sexual relationship with a child a felony crime.
For the first time in nearly two decades, the floor session occurred without livestream coverage from WisconsinEye, the nonprofit organization that produces live and archived videos of state government similar to C-Span.
Two constitutional amendments advance
The Assembly passed two constitutional amendment proposals. One would bar the closure of places of worship during a state of emergency and the other would  eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs throughout Wisconsin. 
Each proposed amendment is up for the second of two required votes in consecutive sessions of  the Legislature. If they pass the Senate, they will appear on voters’ ballots in November. A majority of voters must approve them before the state constitution can be amended.
AJR 10, which would prohibit the state from ordering the closure of places of worship during a state of emergency, passed 56-43. Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) joined Republicans in favor of the proposal.
The proposal was first introduced during the 2023-25 session in response to actions taken by the Evers administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. A “Safer at Home” order issued by Evers in March 2020 designated religious entities as essential but said gatherings should include fewer than 10 people in a room at a time and said people needed to adhere to social distancing requirements as much as possible. The order also advised places of worship to have drive-in services.
Only Rep. Ron Tusler, the proposal’s author, spoke about it during the floor session. 
“No more than 10 people at a time, no matter how big the church structure was. What part of never infringe the right of every person to worship almighty God, according to the dictates of their conscience, did Gov. Evers not understand?” Tusler asked, referring to the Wisconsin State Constitution. “Evers was wrong to limit our churches to 10.”
Voters would be asked “Shall Section 18 of Article I of the Constitution, which deals with religious liberty, be amended to prohibit the state or a political subdivision of the state from ordering the closure of, or forbidding gatherings in, places of worship in response to a state of emergency, including a public health emergency?”
AJR 102, which seeks to target diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in state and local governments, passed 54-45 with only Republican support. 
Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville) said the proposal will restore “merit, fairness and equality to government practices from the state Capitol, all the way down to our school boards and everything in between” including when it comes to hiring, scholarships and contracting.
Rep. Supreme Moore Omokunde (D-Milwaukee), speaking against the proposal, said it represents an opportunity for Republicans “to rev up voters for November and an opportunity to give red meat to the base.” 
Voters across the state could find the constitutional amendment proposals alongside a slate of high stakes races on their ballots in November including a race for governor, congressional races and races for the state Senate and Assembly that will determine control of the chambers in 2027. 
Rep. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) said the anti-DEI proposal creates a roadblock to helping her community.
“We need to do more to have Black and brown kids succeed in Wisconsin,” Arney said. “This change doesn’t help improve well-being in the district. It gets in the way.”
“This is the kind of fairness that the people of Wisconsin are looking for,” Murphy responded.
The proposal now needs to pass the Senate before it can go to voters. If it passes there, voters will see the following question on their ballots in November: “Shall section 27 of article I of the constitution be created to prohibit governmental entities in the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, public contracting, or public administration?”
Withholding judge’s pay during temporary suspension
AB 380 would require that if the state Supreme Court temporarily suspends a judge from practicing in the state  pending final determination of proceedings or imposes a suspension as a disciplinary sanction in a case of misconduct then the suspension must be without pay.
The bill passed 57-42. Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon), Rep. Steve Doyle (D-Onalaska) and Rep. Tara Johnson (D-Town of Shelby) joined Republicans in support of the bill.
The bill was introduced last year after the arrest and suspension of former Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan, who has since been found guilty of felony obstruction of federal immigration agents in December and submitted her resignation from her position in January.
Bill coauthor Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) told reporters before the session that the bill will ensure that “when a judge is suspended for misconduct, they are not being continued to be paid by the people of Wisconsin.”
“Not only is it an extended vacation, which is what Judge Dugan ended up enjoying while she was not doing her job, but in addition to that, we had to have other judges fill the role and get the job done so that cases could continue to be adjudicated in Milwaukee County,” he added. “If another judge decides to do this, they shouldn’t be able to collect their pay, hundreds of thousands of dollars, while that case is pending.” 
Sortwell also said an amendment to the bill will ensure that should a judge be found not guilty  they would receive backpay. 
During floor debate, Rep. Andrew Hysell (D-Sun Prairie) called it a messaging bill given that it wouldn’t have applied to Dugan. He pointed out that the statute that the bill would change was not used by the state Supreme Court when it suspended Dugan. 
“It would have saved taxpayers zero dollars,” Hysell said. “I understand that certain bills are meant to convey certain messages to the public, but even a messaging bill should have some arguable connection to the underlying problem that it supposedly fixes.” 
Sortwell said that Hysell was right it wouldn’t have affected Dugan, but reiterated that his bill is looking towards the future.
“We do believe in innocence until proven guilty,” Sortwell said. “She was found to be guilty and good riddance to her.”
Grooming a crime
The Assembly also passed AB 677, which would make grooming a felony crime in Wisconsin, in a 93-6 vote. Reps. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), Angelina Cruz (D-Racine), Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) and Angelito Tenorio (D-West Allis) voted against the proposal.
Bill author Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said the bill will help protect children and noted that she started working on the bill about 18 months ago due to the case of Christian Enwright, a former Kenosha teacher who pleaded guilty last year to over a dozen misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct after he had an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old student.
“Anyone who followed that case and saw the messages that Enright sent would know that his behavior is far more than disorderly. Because of the lack of a criminal definition of grooming, that was all he could be charged with,” Nedweski said. 
Under the bill, grooming in Wisconsin would be defined as “a course of conduct, pattern of behavior, or series of acts with the intention to condition, seduce, solicit, lure, or entice a child for the purpose of producing distributing or possessing depictions of the child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.”  
A person convicted of a grooming charge, under the bill, would be guilty of a Class G felony. The charge would increase to a Class F felony if the person is in a position of trust or authority, and to a Class E felony if the child has a disability and to a Class D felony if the violation involves two or more children. A convicted person would need to register as a sex offender.
An amendment to the bill would change the crime to a Class I felony if the person convicted of the crime is a school staff member or volunteer. 
“This is not about vague feelings or misunderstandings. There needs to be a pattern of predatory behavior with the intent to have sexual contact with the victim,” Nedweski said. “This bill came as a result of months of conversations with law enforcement prosecutors, district attorneys, educators and victim advocates.”
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said in a statement that she appreciated the bipartisan effort on the bill.
“We all share a commitment to protecting kids in school and ensuring they can safely learn and grow,” Neubauer said. “This is a critical issue, and I hope we will continue working together to support and protect our kids.”
Assembly’s first time on the floor without WisconsinEye livestream
Ahead of the Assembly floor session, Neubauer called the absence of WisconsinEye as lawmakers continue their business this month an “unsustainable situation.” The nonprofit organization ceased coverage and pulled its archive offline on Dec. 15 due to financial difficulties.
“It is not a good day for accountability to the people who elected us to serve them,” Neubauer said. “Transparency is an essential part of a functioning democracy. Without it, mistrust thrives and multiplies at a time when we need to be building trust in state government. We need to be demonstrating that government can and must be a force for good. This is a step in the wrong direction, and it erodes the public’s trust in this institution.” 
Neubauer said she is open to negotiating with her Republican colleagues to find a solution. She said that lawmakers did not set the organization up for success with the match requirements placed on the $10 million that the state set aside for an endowment. 
“Not sure that a $10 million requirement was ever really realistic for WisconsinEye. We would of course like to see more fundraising,” Neubauer said.
Neubauer and Democrats also questioned why Republican lawmakers were not working more quickly towards a solution as well as why they began enforcing a ban against members of the public who try to record committee proceedings.
“I would ask that you ask yourself what kind of politician doesn’t want for a camera to film what we are doing. What kind of intentions does that politician have? What kind of motivations do they have? What do they have to hide? Why are they doing that?” Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona) told reporters. “We’re doing important work. People ought to be able to see what we’re doing.”
Gov. Tony Evers told reporters on Monday that he is open to exploring options for getting WisconsinEye back online, but isn’t supportive of just giving the nonprofit state funds without a match requirement.
“I think there has to be some skin in the game,” Evers said of WisEye. 
Republican leaders have also said that they support improving transparency but expressed some concerns about  giving the organization state funds. 
In November, before WisconsinEye went dark, the organization’s president Jon Henkes told the Examiner that the board hadn’t raised any money. He said then that the organization had been reaching out to potential donors about providing large-sum contributions 
“We’re not asking for $5,000 gifts right now. We’re asking for gifts in the $50,000 [to] $500,000 range and that’s a limited amount of people out there,” Henkes said in November.
The organization started seeing more small-dollar donations in December. 
“Small gift fundraising… through online and small checks that have been arriving in the mail are helpful. They don’t get us where we need to be, but it’s a statement that it’s not just the lobbyists and elected officials around the state in the news media who are supporting us there,” Henkes said in December. “There are a lot of people who are citizen viewers who recognize the value of WisconsinEye and are taking the time to go online to make a small gift or send a check, and we’re very grateful for that. That’s a huge encouragement to us.”
WisconsinEye has increased its attempts to raise money from small-sum donations, including by launching a GoFundMe campaign on Monday. As of Tuesday, the campaign had raised more than $8,000 from over 100 donations. The goal is $250,000, which would help support three months of the organization’s operational costs.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana legislators aren’t going along with all the federal tax cuts that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last summer.
A hefty tax break for businesses included in what Republicans dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” won’t be applied to state taxes under legislation advancing in the state Senate.
Republican fiscal leaders, however, haven’t said which of the dozens of other new federal tax cuts — including the temporary deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages — will be extended to state taxes.
An analysis from Gov. Mike Braun’s administration estimated that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to fully conform the state tax code with the federal changes.

The Senate Tax and Fiscal Committee last week endorsed Senate Bill 212 adopting a few of the federal tax breaks.
Committee Chair Sen. Travis Holdman, however, specified that the bill would not include a federal tax cut on some production property because of its cost.
“It’s just got a hefty price tag. It was $60-some million the first year, and it grew to like $300 million over four or five years,” Holdman, R-Markle, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “So it’s just just too hefty for us to do that.”
Sam Charron, a vice president of the Indiana Manufacturers Association, argued for adoption of that tax break, saying it “incentivizes manufacturers to increase their production capacity in the U.S. and, therefore, here in the state of Indiana.”
Uncertainty on other tax breaks
Holdman said his committee would take up a separate bill next week addressing whether to conform state tax law with 37 other provisions in the federal legislation.
He said the first bill focused on federal tax changes that would take effect for the 2025 tax year, with the aim of getting that bill to Braun’s desk by the end of January. It is set for a full Senate vote on Thursday.
Holdman hasn’t specified what will be adopted from the longer list, which includes the temporary federal deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages along with the interest on loans for vehicles built in the U.S. 
The state analysis projects that taxpayers would save nearly $275 million over the next two years with the deduction for overtime wages. 
The tax break on tips would total about $80 million during that time, while the vehicle loan deduction was estimated at $70 million. 
The state tax code generally conforms with federal law for the simplicity of determining taxable income. 
Indiana’s last major conformity update came in 2023, when Indiana adopted the Internal Revenue Code as of Jan. 1, 2023, bringing the state into line with pandemic-era relief measures such as the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. 
Whatever tax measures the state Senate endorses will then go to the Indiana House for its consideration.
House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jeff Thompson, the chamber’s leader on tax matters, said he was in “ongoing discussions” on provisions such as the exemptions for overtime and tips income.
“I’ll look at everything, all our options, kind of see when the time comes,” Thompson, R-Lizton, said this week. “I’m not thinking much about it until it gets here.”

Three men face felony animal cruelty charges in Uinta County for allegedly roping and riding a moose. The case is resurfacing questions about wildlife abuse in Wyoming.
The post Moose torture case puts Wyoming back in unsavory spotlight appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Mountain Journal.
Wyoming is back in the spotlight for another alleged case of wildlife abuse, this time in the southwest part of the state.
In Uinta County, three men face felony charges after allegedly roping, riding and dragging a moose across the ground on a ranch in 2021. 
The Uinta County Herald first reported that Range Martin, Justin Martin and Kylan Platt allegedly rode, spurred and roped a cow moose. The trio was also charged with “wanton taking of a big game animal,” which suggests the moose died from its injuries. According to court documents, videos showed that the moose appeared to be blind in one eye and in poor health. A call requesting comment from Justin Martin was returned, but the caller hung up without offering comment.
On social media, the news spurred outrage from Wyomingites and out-of-staters alike. It echoes the western Wyoming case of Cody Roberts, who allegedly ran down a wolf with his snowmobile in February 2024. Still alive, the wolf’s mouth was duct taped and it was paraded around a bar in Daniel before it was reportedly taken outside and killed. Roberts recently pleaded not guilty to felony animal cruelty and his case is slated for trial in Sublette County in March. 
The Roberts wolf incident was notable not only for the actions of the accused, but also for the initial punishment: a $250 fine for possession of live wildlife. Roberts allegedly ran down the wolf in the state’s “predator zone,” which refers to the roughly 85% of Wyoming where it is legal to take predatory animals, such as wolves, without a license. The Sublette County Attorney’s Office eventually summoned a grand jury, which resulted in an indictment.
Backlash was swift and fierce as wildlife advocates traveled from far-flung locales to Wyoming to voice frustration. In a state where so many tourism dollars rely on its abundant wildlife, the Wyoming Office of Tourism’s social media accounts also went dark as users commented missives such as #BoycottWyoming. It’s unclear whether the state saw a discernible financial impact in 2024 — the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis has not yet published its annual report on the outdoor recreation industry for that year. 
“This is not the Wyoming way, not the cowboy way. It’s simply sick. The stewardship of our wildlife is something we cannot take lightly.”Paul Ulrich, president, Wyoming Sportsmanship
Wyoming Sportsmanship, a grassroots organization established in response to the Sublette County wolf incident, issued a statement about the moose-abuse case, calling for the Uinta County prosecutor’s office to pursue the harshest penalties allowed under the law to deter future crimes against Wyoming’s wildlife.
“[The case is] pathetic and disgusting behavior and clearly poor excuses for cowboys,” Paul Ulrich, president of Wyoming Sportsmanship and a fourth-generation Wyomingite based in Pinedale, said in a press release. “I am certain that our ranching community shares in my condemnation of this behavior and call for full force of the law in prosecution and sentencing. This is not the Wyoming way, not the cowboy way. It’s simply sick. The stewardship of our wildlife is something we cannot take lightly.”
Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national organization aiming to reform states’ wildlife management to focus on protecting wildlife and ecosystems, said in an interview that these cases are part of a system that promotes “a culture of cruelty.” While Wyoming has had some egregious examples, including an Albany County man facing felony charges for allegedly killing a wild horse with a four-wheeler, there are heinous crimes against animals everywhere, she said.
Jess Johnson, government affairs director for the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, an organization focused on conservation and sportsmen advocacy, said that when she first heard of the moose incident, she thought, “not again.”
“The fact that we have to keep standing up, saying, ‘This is grotesque,’ I think everybody here is frustrated by that,” she said.
Johnson and others working in wildlife advocacy are considering whether more crimes are committed against wildlife in Wyoming now than in the past, or if, because of social media and the spotlight of the Roberts case, the public is just hearing about it more. While it’s difficult to quantify, Johnson said the increased scrutiny comes with a silver lining.
“It’s good that we’re catching them,” she said. “The fact that it’s made it out and that it’s being prosecuted: That’s a good thing. This could have just flown under the radar forever and nobody would have known about it. And it’s probably happened everywhere, in every state in this country … You can’t fix things if you don’t shine a light on them.”
A critical bill passes
In 2025, the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 275, which increased penalties for knowingly torturing, tormenting or mutilating living wildlife. It’s now a misdemeanor for a first offense and a felony for a second offense.
Most wildlife advocates wish the bill had gone a step further to ban vehicle-based animal harassment on public lands. 
Kristin Combs, executive director of Wyoming Wildlife Advocates, said that if Wyoming wants to portray itself as a state that cares about its wildlife, it should pass legislation that bans using a vehicle to kill predators. Outlawing vehicular killing is the No. 1 priority for Combs’ nonprofit wildlife advocacy group going into the legislative session next month, she said. Since 2026 is a Wyoming budget session, legislation needs a two-thirds majority vote to be introduced to the full body, which can be a high bar to clear.
“Some lawmakers are really aware of the fact that Wyoming continues to have these really egregious stories coming out and that we want to show the world and the rest of the country that we do care about wildlife and we’re going to take the steps necessary to protect our wildlife here,” Combs said. “It’s such a big part of our tourism and our economy, there’s no reason not to.”

Jim Magagna was part of the Treatment of Predators Working Group that developed the legislation that would eventually be House Bill 275, alongside Johnson, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, and Wyoming lawmakers.
“We were comfortable with that,” said Magagna, who also serves as executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. “We felt it was appropriate. We don’t condone any abuse of animals.”
In the case of the moose, headlines referred to the accused as “cowboys,” a moniker Magagna feels is misplaced. 
“It’s not cowboys doing this,” he said. “Ranchers and cowboys normally don’t do things like this.” 
Still, Magagna noted that he spoke with ranchers in Uinta County claiming the men charged with abusing the moose are known as helpful to their neighbors and overall pleasant to work with. He takes issue with those who criticize ranchers writ large — or any group of people for the actions of individuals — for a specific incident.
“We lump these people into categories,” he said. “And I certainly condemn what they did, but I don’t think that speaks for all the cattle industry or the cowboys who are out there. Ninety-eight percent of them, 98% of the time, are out there managing wildlife in a way that provides habitat for managing cattle in the way that provides habitat for wildlife.”
Predators versus game
Where the agriculture industry often differs from wildlife advocates is in its stance on predator management. While Magagna says he supports legislation that punishes animal cruelty, the provision that would have outlawed using snowmobiles and other vehicles to kill predators was a bridge too far for stockgrowers. As the law was written, he says, someone who runs over a predator with a snowmobile is obligated to stop and kill that predator. Alternatively, he adds, shooting at a wolf or coyote and failing to kill it could be worse than killing it immediately with a snowmobile.
“That animal may spend days suffering far more than it would have suffered if I had hit it with the snow machine and killed it right away,” he said.
Combs, with the wildlife advocates group, says protecting livestock is a common goal for both ranchers and wildlife interests. She cited nonlethal management methods as a more ethical way to more permanently curb predation. 
“Another big focus of our organization is to really help ranchers and livestock producers implement these things, have funds for them and teach people how to use them so we’re not just recycling conflict,” she said, “we’re taking care of the problem.”
Magagna doesn’t think it’s so simple. He says stockgrowers use an array of tools, such as guard dogs in sheep operations or county predator boards that employ trappers to professionally remove predators. 
“I don’t see any of these things as being an either/or,” he said. “It’s what’s the appropriate combination of lethal tools and nonlethal tools?”
“Policy is shaping behavior and culture is following, but it goes both ways. When laws treat certain animals as disposable, some people internalize that message.”Michelle Lute, executive director, Wildlife for All
Lute with Wildlife for All says different outcomes of the moose and wolf cases show a double standard when it comes to wildlife. As an example of effective state policy, she lauded a bill passed in the New Mexico Legislature in early 2025 that, in part, changed the name of the state’s Department of Fish and Game to the Department of Wildlife, which, she says, reflects better management of wildlife for its own sake rather than for its value to sportsmen.
“It’s horrible what happened to this moose,” Lute said. “At least, though, it’s being taken seriously and prosecuted, but it really shows the double standards that we have for these prey species that folks value in an economic sense because they want to hunt these animals. But we don’t see the same seriousness taken when it’s a wolf, a racoon or a skunk. There’s all these other carnivores that don’t necessarily have the attention like certain game species.”
For Johnson, there is still policy work to be done, but she says effective legislation that can meaningfully prosecute wildlife offenders takes time. 
“I know people were extremely frustrated with Wyoming and not addressing everything they all wanted in that bill. But I still think it’s coming,” Johnson said. “There are people that are trying to do this right, because legislation is not passed easily, and it shouldn’t be. I would hope that what comes from this incident is a recognition of the work that our wildlife officers are doing, and a willingness to fund [Wyoming Game and Fish] to the point where they can hire more people to do work like that.”
Lute described wildlife treatment and management as a “two-way arrow.”
“Culture follows policy and vice versa,” she said. “Policy is shaping behavior and culture is following, but it goes both ways. When laws treat certain animals as disposable, some people internalize that message.”
Policy aside, Johnson says people need to be quicker to call out bad behavior and better about connecting with nature. 
Combs, citing research from the National Link Coalition, which investigates ties in animal abuse and human mental health, said that the behavior of those accused in the moose-abuse case is a result of the state’s struggles with its mental health system, which are driven by a “cowboy-up” mentality and a lack of access to services.
Combs and Johnson agree that the majority of Wyomingites stand against animal torture. That hunters, for example, are conscientious of that in taking their shots. Still, Combs says, there is a segment of the population that sees animals as beings over which humans have dominion.
“By holding up these examples of really egregious things that are happening and saying, ‘This is not who we are as a people in Wyoming, and this is not how we treat any animal here,’” Combs said, “I think that’s the message that we want to send to the world.”

(Photo by Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)To balance the state’s budget, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s plan says the state could cut Medicaid services for dental care and people with disabilities. 
As part of the governor’s recommendation for $22 million in extra Medicaid cuts, he says the state could remove Medicaid dental coverage for adults, and home and community-based services, which are meant to help people with developmental disabilities live outside of institutional settings. 
The governor’s budget chief, Lori Wolff, told the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee on Tuesday that following through on many of Little’s cut ideas would require a bill changing state policy.

“These decisions are difficult,” Wolff told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC. “And we are going to have to work closely together to decide how we do this.”
JFAC’s new co-chair, Rep. Josh Tanner, an Eagle Republican, seemed skeptical of the governor’s budget proposal. 
“Medicaid growth is crowding out every other priority,” Tanner wrote in a statement. “Instead of presenting real reforms, the Governor leaves behind a Medicaid budget hole based on unspecified cuts, shifting the toughest decisions to the Legislature.”

 Idaho eyes Medicaid cuts after state tax cuts, and recent federal and state Medicaid cuts

Idaho is facing multimillion projected budget shortfalls — about $40 million this fiscal year, and more than $500 million next fiscal year — after years of state tax cuts. State officials are returning to talks of cutting Medicaid after passing a massive Medicaid cost-cutting bill last year, and after President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” this summer deeply cut federal funds for Medicaid. 
Years after the Legislature cut adult dental Medicaid coverage after the Great Recession, state lawmakers restored the benefit as projections showed dental coverage actually saved the state money. After the federal “big beautiful bill” cut Medicaid this year, some Idahoans feared that optional Medicaid benefits like home and community-based services could face cuts, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Idaho Voices for Children Policy Director Hillarie Matlock said the Legislature needs to let policies from last year’s Medicaid laws from the state and federal government play out.
The governor’s proposed cuts would “only drive up the state’s costs down the road,” she said. 
“If cost containment is the long-term goal, cutting any of these services is not the way to do it,” Matlock told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “These services are essential to Idahoans with disabilities, children and seniors, and will only drive up costs down the road.” 
In a statement, the governor’s spokesperson Joan Vargas said the cut ideas “were considered to meet the state’s constitutional requirement for a balanced budget.”
“Adult dental coverage and home- and community-based services were included because they are optional Medicaid benefits under federal law, not mandated by the federal government,” she wrote. “While reductions have impacts, these options were considered to meet the state’s constitutional requirement for a balanced budget.”
 What Idaho Medicaid services is the governor targeting for cuts? 

The governor proposed a total of $45 million in Medicaid cuts next fiscal year. About half of that would come from extending 4% doctor pay cuts. The other half – the $22 million in extra Medicaid cuts – would come from a list of options for other Medicaid cuts. 
Little’s list of Medicaid cut options didn’t recommend repealing Medicaid expansion, as some Republican state lawmakers are considering. 
Here’s what options the governor proposed:

Rate reductions: To hospital rates, to residential habilitation, and even removing administrative costs for contracts for managed care organizations, which are private companies that run Medicaid benefits.
Removing services made up the bulk of the governor’s proposed options for Medicaid cuts. Services that could be cut include: adult dental services, home and community-based services, pharmacy benefits for adults who aren’t on Medicaid expansion, adult prosthetics and orthotics, adult in-home nursing services, adult chiropractic services, adult audiology services, adult vision services, hospice services, case management support, and services for physical, occupational and speech therapy.

It’s not immediately clear if services called for removal would be entirely ended under the governor’s proposed cuts.

Last week, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced it was capping visits for occupational, physical and speech therapy at 20 per year. Any more visits need prior authorization, but some services would be exempt from the cap, according to the agency’s announcement.
In a statement, Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the change aligns Idaho’s programs with other states. The agency doesn’t know how much the change will save the state, he said. 
“Idaho Medicaid regularly reviews its policies to ensure consistency with best practices,” McWhorter said. “Prior to this change, a provider had to order physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, but Idaho Medicaid did not authorize that the service was medically necessary before it was rendered.”
 After cutting Medicaid dental coverage post-recession, Idaho restored service after ER costs surged

After the Great Recession, the Idaho Legislature in 2011 cut Medicaid dental coverage for adults in hopes to save money.
But three years later, the Legislature was already working to restore adult dental Medicaid coverage after emergency-room costs surged, the Associated Press reported. 
In 2018, as the Legislature approved restoring non-emergency dental coverage for adults, the move was projected to save the state $2.5 million, the Spokesman-Review reported.

Once we understand how bias distorts what we see, we can take steps to correct our own vision, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post ‘Rashomon’ and death in Minneapolis appeared first on WyoFile .","In a rainy Japanese forest, a samurai is murdered and his wife is raped. At the trial of the accused, several eyewitnesses, including the wife and the accused man, relate completely different versions of what they saw. This is the narrative of Akira Kurosawa’s 1950 cinema masterpiece “Rashomon.”

Opinion

Kurosawa’s film explores the phenomenon of multiple people seeing the same event, yet coming to very different conclusions about what they saw. It also examines the reasons for this disagreement about the truth among rational people.
“Rashomon” is good reference material for us when we think about and react to the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, and the competing narratives that have arisen about what really happened.
During the course of the film, each witness and their individual backgrounds and beliefs are described, and questions are asked regarding those external effects on the witnesses’ perception of the crime. Each witness comes from a different level of the class system in post-feudal Japan, and each has their own experience with power and justice in their society.
Each witness is also motivated by personal imperatives like how their neighbors will perceive them after they testify, what they can gain from the outcome of the trial and what they will put at risk by telling the truth. Personal animosities, affections and grudges also weigh heavily on each person’s testimony.
Even a mystic Shinto monk, who claims to channel the voice of the murdered samurai, is called to testify, and that testimony widely diverges from all the other perceptions of the event. In “Rashomon,” even the victim has his own unique understanding of what happened to him based largely upon a lifelong devotion to the samurai code of Bushido.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

No cell phones or body cams digitally recorded the murder in that rainy forest, so there’s no record, other than human memories, of the event. In fact, I don’t recall a single example of technology in the whole movie. No telephones, televisions or automobiles, just human beings with their widely varied ideas about the truth of what happened.
But there exist many recorded images of Renee Good dying at the hands of an ICE agent, and it seems like a new recording emerges daily with a different angle of the killing. Video recordings don’t lie. A camera has no cultural bias nor a political bone to pick. It just captures an event that can be viewed over and over again.
And yet, with all of the photographic and video evidence available to us, there is still an argument raging over what really happened in that cold Minneapolis street. The videos and pictures, which should have answered everyone’s questions, seem to have instead intensified the debate.
Why is that?
Because each person seeing the video isn’t seeing it objectively, but rather through the subjective lens of their own lifetime of experience, cultural and religious teaching, political bias and all the other factors coloring the witnesses’ testimony in “Rashomon.” In short, we see what we want to see.
That is precisely how different viewers of the same video can claim it offers different “proof.” The ICE agent was the aggressor. Renee Good was the aggressor. It was self-defense. It was murder. And so on.
The viewer’s societal and political biases paint the picture the viewer wants to see. In the case of this killing in Minneapolis, millions of different viewers reach wildly different conclusions for different reasons based on the same visual evidence.
Cognitive traps such as these biases are incredibly difficult to overcome because they make up so much of how we think of ourselves as good citizens. But they cloud the world before our eyes, and make objective truth hard to see. And I don’t mean just what happened on the street in Minneapolis, but everywhere around us.
I don’t believe in a magic wand that can instantly correct our collective myopia and remove the scales from our eyes, but I do think that, once we understand that our biases distort what we see, then we can take steps to correct our own vision.
And once we see more clearly, we can act more intelligently.

Leaders of the state legislative committee tasked with making compensation recommendations for the state’s 25,000 employees told the Idaho Capital Sun on Tuesday they aren’t sure whether the joint committee will meet at all this year. 
The joint Change in Employee Compensation, known as CEC, Committee, typically starts meeting ahead of the legislative session and again early in the session to make its recommendation to the budget-writing committee. 
“We’re still thinking over the CEC issue,” committee Co-Chair Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, said Tuesday. “Obviously, the budget’s an issue this year, more so than normal.” 
Heading into the 2026 legislative session, the state is facing an estimated $600 million to $1 billion budget shortfall for the next fiscal year. 
Gov. Brad Little’s proposal to balance the budget includes no adjustment of employee salaries, based on current revenue projections, according to the Legislative Budget Book. 
“Should revenue projections indicate sufficient funding, the Governor recommends prioritizing change in employee compensation to ensure state employee pay remains competitive,” the budget book said.

 Idaho Legislature’s budget committee is scheduled to set ‘maintenance’ budgets on Jan. 23

Increasing health care costs mean that state employees will see an estimated 7.3% increase in out-of-pocket costs for health and dental insurance costs, according to the governor’s budget proposal. Employees may see increases between $29 and $654 per year, depending on the plan type and the number of dependents enrolled. 
CEC Committee Co-Chair Rep. James Holtzclaw, R-Meridian, said Tuesday he wasn’t sure if the committee would meet, but that the health care increase concerned him. 
“I think it’s important for us to keep employees whole,” he said. “I really think we have the best employees, and we want to just keep them happy.” 
The budget-writing Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee is scheduled to set statewide “maintenance budgets” on Jan. 23. These bare-bones agency budgets include previously approved spending, with new requests considered in subsequent “enhancement budgets.” 
House Speaker Mike Moyle in a press conference Monday said he hasn’t had discussions regarding employee compensation. 
“We have some of the best employees ever … We love these guys, and we share their concerns, and we’ll do what we can to help them,” Moyle said when asked about employee raises. “But maybe this year it’s going to be a little off the table.” 
 Idaho HR report shows 14% turnover, and salaries lagging behind market 

The Idaho Division of Human Resources’ annual workforce report found the state experienced 14.6% turnover in 2025, and had an 11.2% vacancy rate. 
The report found the state’s average base salary is 15% behind the 50th percentile of the public and private sector. 
The findings in the report prompted CEC committee member Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, to call for the committee to meet and consider wage increases for employees. He told the Sun he has been requesting a meeting. 
“No business or government can operate efficiently with this kind of dysfunctional employment,” Gannon said in a written statement. “… the best employees will be encouraged to seek comparable employment elsewhere.”

Justin Jones, a Nashville Democrat, has filed a bill called the ""Stop American Gestapo Act,"" which would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)As the Tennessee Legislature reconvenes this week, Republicans have signalled that immigration, for a second year in a row, will be a central policy priority.
A Republican supermajority controls both the Tennessee House and Senate. On Monday House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters the Republican caucus plans to unveil a package of immigration-related legislation this week, crafted in collaboration with White House Homeland Security advisor Stephen Miller. Sexton offered few specifics. 
Separately, and ahead of the January 30 bill-filing deadline, a series of bills already introduced highlight Republican priorities for policies aimed at immigrants living unlawfully in Tennessee, a population estimated at 160,000-190,000 or 3%-4% of the state’s population. 
“Tennessee has long been a beacon for state-led immigration restriction and this session will be no different,” Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, an Oak Ridge Republican said in a statement to the Lookout.
“The federal government under President (Donald) Trump has put a priority on sealing our borders and hastening the return of illegal immigrants to their native lands. We will do all we can to assist in that effort,” he said. 
The Tennessee Republicans’ immigration agenda is expected to draw intense pushback, as it did last year when throngs of protestors flooded the Capitol on a near-daily basis to protest a slate of bills targeting immigrants.
Tennessee lawmakers to take immigration cues from White House

On Tuesday, protests bookended the opening and close of the first day of the 2026 session as protestors condemning ICE commingled with those speaking out against anti-drag legislation.
“More Tennesseans than ever are ready to show up at the Capitol, contact their representatives, and defend their neighbors,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of TIRRC votes, the political action arm of the state’s largest immigrant advocacy group the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.
“We won’t watch quietly while our communities are targeted for harm and while ICE escalates violence against the people we love.”
The group helped rally protestors for weeks at the Capitol in the spring in opposition to a host of immigrant related legislation including a measure to bar children without lawful status from public schools. 
While the measure failed to pass last year, House Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, did not rule out reviving the bill this year.
Despite protests, Republicans last year easily passed measures targeting immigrants and those who aid them, including creating a new crime for those who “harbor” immigrants and new law giving law enforcement the power to order observers to stand back 25 feet. Both laws are currently being challenged in court. 
Legislation enacted in 2025 also included the establishment of a state-level immigration enforcement office to coordinate with the federal government, $5 million in grants to local law enforcement that enter into agreements with ICE and markers on license plates to identify legal immigrants who are not citizens. Immigrants without legal status cannot obtain a Tennessee drivers’ license.
Immigration bills introduced thus far in 2026 include  SB1466, measure by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, to shield information about immigration enforcement operations from public view, including the identities of local and state law enforcement officers involved in them. 
Tennessee House passes immigration enforcement bill; ACLU plans legal challenge

The bill is widely seen as aimed at the actions of Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell during a mass immigration dragnet in Nashville during May that led to the detention of about 200 people during traffic stops.
O’Connell continued to enforce a longstanding executive order requiring city departments to report interactions with immigration officials, posting them publicly. The public posts temporarily revealed the names of federal immigration officials – inadvertently, the mayor’s office said. But the postings drew blowback from Trump administration officials as well as Republican lawmakers. 
Johnson’s bill would create felony charges for public officials who release such information, punishable by six-year prison terms and fines.
Johnson also introduced a bill, SB1587, creating a misdemeanor crime for immigrants without lawful presence to operate commercial vehicles in the state and requiring notice to immigration authorities. 
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican, introduced SB1486 to require jails to keep immigrants without lawful presence in custody 48 hours beyond their release date to allow for federal immigration officials time to pick them up. 
Democrats have also introduced several bills weeks ahead of the filing deadline. 
A day after Minneapolis resident Renee Good was shot by an ICE agent, Rep. Gabby Salinas filed a bill, HB1482, that would prohibit ICE personnel from going onto the grounds of public schools and churches without notice. 
In a statement Salinas said the bill was in response to “countless reports of ICE officers patrolling and surveilling neighborhoods, schools and church communities” since the Memphis Safe Task Force convened by President Donald Trump in September dispatched more than 1,000 federal law enforcement agents, including ICE and Border Patrol, to Memphis.
“No child or person should fear being abducted or risk having their family ripped apart when they leave their home,” the statement said. “We are losing friends, neighbors, caretakers, and community members daily.”
On Tuesday, Nashville Democratic Rep. Justin Jones filed legislation titled the “Stop American Gestapo Act,” which bars federal, local and state law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty, with certain exceptions for health and safety reasons. The bill, HB1442, also requires law enforcement to clearly display their names and badge numbers.
More immigrant-related bills are expected to be introduced by members of both parties in the weeks ahead.

RJ May, pictured at the Statehouse in Columbia, S.C., on Dec. 4, 2024, is facing up to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to sending videos of child sexual abuse. (Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Federal prosecutors want former Rep. RJ May to spend 20 years in prison for distributing videos of children being sexually abused, while the West Columbia Republican is asking a judge to give him a much more lenient sentence.
U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will make a final decision during a Wednesday hearing as to how long the 39-year-old must spend in federal prison. May, a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, pleaded guilty in September to sending videos depicting child sexual abuse over a five-day span in April 2024.
Along with prison time, May must pay a fee to the children shown in the photos and videos he sent who the government was able to reach. Prosecutors are asking for $73,000, plus a lifetime of supervision following his release. May will also have to register as a sexual offender. And, as a convicted felon, the former campaign consultant will no longer be allowed to vote or hold office.
The sentence prosecutors are asking Currie to consider is the maximum May can face based on a number of factors, including his lack of a previous criminal history, the number of videos linked to his online accounts and his guilty plea, according to court documents filed ahead of Wednesday’s hearing.
May’s public defense attorneys argued in their subsequent filings that his actions, while heinous, represented a momentary dark spot in his life and that he learned his lesson during his six months in jail. Instead of requesting a specific number of years, May’s attorneys asked only that Currie give him less than prosecutors requested.
After opting to represent himself in the months leading up to his guilty plea, May rehired his taxpayer-funded attorneys for his sentencing hearing.
In a letter to the judge, May proposed five years in prison, followed by “a significant period of home confinement” that would allow him to start earning money to pay restitution and start a nonprofit dedicated to ending the distribution of videos showing child sexual abuse.
May resigned his House seat in August. His successor, Lexington County pastor John Lastinger, was sworn in Tuesday, the first day of the legislative session.
Currie’s decision won’t end May’s legal troubles. He’s also facing state charges of evading income taxes for three years, amounting to $14,637. That case, which could carry up to a year in state prison for each year of unpaid taxes, is ongoing.
Prosecutors’ arguments
For at least five days, May lived a double life, prosecutors wrote in court filings. Within seconds, he could switch from messages about campaigns, legislation and holiday greetings to videos of prepubescent children being forced to perform sex acts.
As a legislator, May frequently voted in favor of bills intended to protect children, including from the exact sort of crimes he later pleaded guilty to committing, prosecutors wrote.
“In public, he represented more than 41,000 Lexington County residents in the legislature; in private, he abused infants, toddlers, and prepubescent minors in child pornography,” prosecutors wrote.
Although May’s video spree seemed to span less than a week based on the evidence investigators were able to recover, prosecutors have long argued this likely wasn’t his only foray into that world.
Messages May sent from a messaging account under the username “joebidennnn69” referenced encrypted apps often used to exchange illegal videos because their overseas owners prevent investigators from accessing their data, according to court documents.
During the five days investigators could identify, May sent 220 different videos of child sexual abuse to people in 18 states and six countries. He sought out videos of children as young as toddlers being abused by their parents, according to court filings.
“All of the victims in May’s videos were too young to protect themselves, but many were old enough such that they will remember their abuse,” prosecutors wrote. “The content May sought out, possessed, and distributed represents some of the most degrading and damaging content that comes before any court.”
For nine survivors of videotaped child sexual abuse, including eight who appeared in videos May sent, the pain is compounded by knowing strangers still see what they went through and often get pleasure from it, they said in statements to the court.
Some of the survivors, referred to under pseudonyms to protect their identities, have children of their own, they said in their statements. Some described lives lived in constant fear and anxiety over someone recognizing them from the videos they know are still circulating.
“There is not one day that goes by that I don’t think, with hatred, about the sick and disgusting people who view, trade, save, and get off on my abuse when I was just a little kid and couldn’t defend myself,” one survivor wrote. “It is sickening.”
Prosecutors tracked down 12 other children shown in videos May sent and received who opted not to submit statements of their own. Investigators also found videos on May’s devices recovered through a search warrant that showed May having sex with young women, apparently forcefully, during a trip to the country Colombia, according to court documents.
Agents have not been able to track down the women or learn how old they were, according to the court filing. May faces no charges related to those videos.
But prosecutors felt they showed his character and underscored their argument for a lengthy prison sentence, they wrote in court filings.
“May, of all people, knew better,” prosecutors wrote. “He was in a unique position to understand the harm and the consequences he would face, yet he still chose to distribute child pornography. Hundreds of times over.”
May’s argument
For six months, unless he was in court, May has spent every hour of the day alone and all but one locked in a 96-square-foot cell. He has access to a tablet he can use to message relatives, read digital books, listen to music and take online classes, but that’s all.
May spends most of his days lying in bed, he wrote in a six-page letter to Currie. Other inmates can hear him crying through the air vents, they wrote in letters of their own.
May’s political ambitions and career both ended with his guilty plea, and he has “been made penniless,” he wrote. May struggles to sleep, and when he does, he often dreams of his arrest last June.
“The sounds of my crying children, the indescribable look on my wife’s face, and the sight of tears streaming down my son’s cheeks are vividly recalled nightly,” May wrote.
The day May pleaded guilty, his wife of 20 years served him with divorce papers, his attorneys wrote in the filing pleading for leniency in his sentence.
Regardless of his prison sentence, May knows he won’t watch his son and daughter, who are 7 and 3 years old, grow up. He’ll miss Christmas mornings, lost teeth, bedtimes, tea parties and soccer games, he wrote.
“The extent of my pain is beyond the power of vocabulary to describe,” May wrote. “So torturous are the thoughts of life without my wife and children.”
May’s attorneys emphasized that none of his charges suggested he harmed any children directly. He didn’t organize his illicit videos and photographs, as is common among people who collect such images, suggesting this was a brief, albeit heinous, lapse of judgment, his attorneys wrote.
“Though it is beyond difficult to explain his ultimate conduct, RJ has accepted responsibility for his actions and in looking back on his actions recognizes that he had (or still has) addiction problems,” his attorneys wrote. “Like so many of us, RJ was addicted to screens whether because of work or family obligations. Furthermore, he admits he was also addicted to viewing pornography on those screens.”
The natural consequences of May’s actions are enough to make him recognize the wrongness of his actions, his attorneys wrote. He vowed in his letter never to reoffend, and his attorneys consider it unlikely he would reoffend.
“RJ has experienced profound loss,” his attorneys wrote. “He will not return to the home and family he knew. He will not be a father to his children. His sin and shame has been broadcast throughout the country. He is shattered.”
May had a tumultuous childhood, including years living in poverty with his mother, who heavily used drugs, according to court filings. She often left May and his younger sister alone for long periods of time, and she hit May on several occasions, according to court documents.
Although May earned a scholarship to the University of South Carolina and eventually created a good life for himself, the trauma lingered, his attorneys wrote.
After May’s prison sentence, he hopes to build a tiny home on his father and stepmother’s 29-acre farm in Virginia, where he was born. There, he wants to revive his retired father’s landscaping business to earn money for his restitution costs and to send to his ex-wife and children.
May also outlined plans to start a nonprofit dedicated to spreading awareness of the harms child sexual abuse material causes and the consequences people can face for exchanging photos and videos of child abuse.
“I know building a future won’t be easy,” May wrote. “There will be no fancy cars or big houses. No glamorous vacations or expensive meals. It will take hard work and dedication to overcome my failures.
“But if anyone can do it, I can. I’ve not given up on myself and I’m asking this Court not to give up on me either. I can once again be a productive member of society, a beacon of hope and motivation to those similarly situated.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 06:58:48.576700

Rep. Fulcher proposes exploration of transferring Idaho federal land to state and local control 

That’s the snake oil sale being peddled by Congressman Russ Fulcher. Citing a “lack of management” by federal land agencies as the primary reason, Fulcher is seeking to build momentum for “a transition of land management responsibility to state and local entities.” 
Fulcher has issued a letter to Idaho’s constitutional officers, state legislators and county commissioners underscoring “the importance of encouraging local resource management.” Just noting the crowd Fulcher is contacting paints a pretty clear picture of how this effort, if successful, would ultimately play out.
Fulcher bemoaning the lack of federal management ignores the role he and the rest Idaho’s Republican congressional delegation played in creating any such crisis. All four Republicans sat stone faced, quiet and missing in action last year as the Trump administration slashed thousands of jobs and millions of budget dollars from the land management agencies – budgets already approved by Congress. So if there’s lack of land manager presence and action on Idaho’s public lands, Fulcher and the rest of Idaho’s Republican delegation need only to look in the mirror for much of the reason.
Congressman Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho (Photo courtesy of Russ Fulcher’s official website)
Fulcher claims that he hears “all the time” that other members of Congress are tired of subsidizing states like Idaho which have large tracts of public lands. I suspect that’s true – in the cloistered, closed Washington, D.C., Republican bubble the Idaho delegation seems to occupy 24/7 these days there probably is a lot of griping about public lands. 
But I also suspect that there are constituents in the states represented by the gripers who have visited Craters of the Moon National Monument, Redfish Lake, Hells Canyon, the Middle Fork Salmon, and the Selway River and who think that Idaho’s public lands are a pretty good thing.
Fulcher champions “better stewardship through local stakeholder involvement – the state, counties, municipalities, tribes, ranchers, and private operators, all working together …” For over 20 years I was a member of the Owyhee Initiative, a collaboration in Owyhee County formed by the Owyhee County commissioners that included county representatives, ranchers, outfitters, conservationists and consultation with tribal members. 
The Owyhee Initiative was seen as one of the most successful broad-based collaboratives in Idaho. The Owyhee Initiative worked through many tough, contentious issues, but not once, not ever, did anyone in the collaborative say that in order to succeed, we needed to turn the public land in Owyhee County over to state management. No one offered that as a solution to any problem.
And the bottom line to Fulcher’s proposal is that management of public land by the state of Idaho means micro-management by the Republican ideologues in the Idaho Legislature, which essentially amounts to the same thing as putting groups like the Idaho Freedom Foundation in charge. 
Time and again Republicans have shown there is issue is too small for them to meddle with. For 10 years the Idaho Legislature refused to let the Idaho Fish and Game Department have a role in wolf management after the successful reintroduction effort. The Legislature’s answer to disease conflicts between domestic sheep and wild bighorn sheep was to encourage killing the bighorns. Republican senators in the Legislature even refused to support a resolution celebrating the anniversary of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, arguably the most popular public land destination in Idaho, for fear it would show they supported the concept of public lands. 
These are the same folks telling local governments what flags they can and can’t fly and what pedestrian street safety modifications cities can pursue. No chance the Legislature would take a pass on hot button topics like salmon restoration, wildlife highway overpasses or forest fuels management.
The Republican regime in Idaho state government would see Idaho’s public land heritage as nothing more than vast wood lots, gravel pit sites and mining ventures. Just this past year Gov. Brad Little was in Idaho’s backcountry fawning over the proposed mine at Stibnite, a mine which threatens further pollution of important salmon supporting rivers and tribal rights. 
Can you ever imagine Little going to such lengths to praise, say, a conservation easement that protects public access and recreation, or to celebrate recovery efforts for fisheries on the Yankee Fork? 
No, I can’t either.

Nico Rios, R-Williston, speaks during a legislative hearing on April 3, 2025. He is not seeking reelection in 2026. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A controversial Williston lawmaker said he will not seek reelection this year.
Rep. Nico Rios, a Republican, told the North Dakota Monitor Tuesday he will not seek his party’s endorsement during the NDGOP District 23 convention on Saturday. He said he plans to focus on his career and personal life when his term expires at the end of the year.
“I’m real busy at work, and it’s cost me a lot of time away from my personal life for the last four years,” Rios said. 
In 2023, Rios was arrested for drunken driving and was captured on an officer’s body camera berating a police officer using homophobic and racist language. The video also showed Rios attempting to use his position to intimidate law enforcement. Republican legislative leadership and the North Dakota Republican Party called on Rios to resign after the incident, which he did not do.
In the aftermath, legislative leadership removed Rios from the interim Judiciary Committee. At the time, House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said it wouldn’t have been appropriate to have law enforcement testify to a committee in which he was a member.
NDGOP leaders ‘troubled’ by legislator’s drunken rant against police

During the 2025 legislative session, district and state Republican party leaders denounced antisemetic comments Rios made on social media about the Jewish heritage of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.
After the post, Corey Johnson, chair of the District 23 Republicans, said he did not believe Rios had the confidence of the district, but he stopped short of calling for a recall petition to be circulated. 
Rios was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives in 2022. During last year’s legislative session, he was the primary sponsor of six bills and resolutions. All either failed or were withdrawn, including a resolution that sought to declare that North Dakota acknowledges the kingship of Jesus Christ.

Rios works in the oil and gas industry and said focusing on an election campaign over the next year would limit his opportunities to better his career. 
Johnson said he plans to seek the district’s endorsement for one of its House seats. He added he will turn the gavel for the convention over to the district’s first vice chair once the endorsement process begins.
He also said he’s had informal conversations with multiple other candidates who seemed interested in running for a seat in the Legislature, but none have officially announced their candidacies.
“We’re going to run a fair and impartial process and make sure all of our constituents get their voices heard,” Johnson said. 
Sen. Todd Beard, R-Williston, and Rep. Dennis Nehring, R-Williston, the two other lawmakers representing District 23, are both expected to run for reelection and seek the district’s endorsement on Saturday, Johnson said.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A proposal to ensure crime victims are not forced to deliver impact statements to an empty courtroom chair advanced unanimously from a Senate committee Tuesday following emotional testimony from families denied the chance to confront the person convicted of killing their loved ones.
Senate Bill 9, authored by Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, would require a defendant to be present in the courtroom while a victim delivers a statement about the crime and the sentence, unless the defendant poses a safety risk or causes a significant disruption.

The bill cleared the Senate Corrections and Criminal Law Committee in a bipartisan 9-0 vote and now heads to the full Senate.
The legislation was referred to by some supporters as “Aubree’s Law” after 2-year-old Aubree Zent; her siblings, 3-year-old Ashton and 5-year-old Carter; and their 26-year-old mother Sarah, who were killed in Fort Wayne in June 2021. All four died of stab wounds.
Family members told lawmakers that the defendant in the case, 22-year-old Cohen Hancz-Barron, chose not to attend sentencing — forcing them to read their statements in court without him present.
Hancz-Barron was found guilty of the murders and convicted to four life sentences without the possibility of parole.
“During the sentencing phase of the trial, we gave our victim impact statements to an empty chair, as he has the right to refuse to be shown, to come to that part of the trial,” said Jen More, Aubree’s grandmother. “This is unacceptable.”
“This gives no closure to any of the grieving processes that the victims and the victims’ families are going through,” she continued. “As a matter of fact, for me personally, I’m stuck. I’m stuck because I’ve been silenced. … I can’t go any further in my grieving process.”
Making sure victims, families are heard
Under current Indiana law, victims have the right to make statements at sentencing, but courts can proceed even if a defendant is not present. 
Senate Bill 9 would tighten that standard by requiring the defendant’s presence during victim impact statements, with only limited exceptions.
As amended in committee, the legislation specifies that a court can excuse a defendant from the courtroom only if they present a safety risk or cause “a significant disruption,” or if the defendant was tried in absentia or failed to appear for trial. The amended draft also clarifies that sentencing can still proceed in those limited circumstances.
The changes would apply to felony and misdemeanor sentencing hearings beginning July 1.

Brown said multiple families who traveled to testify at Tuesday’s hearing had been waiting “for years” to be heard.
“They wanted the opportunity, after the horrific and brutal murders of these four loved ones, to be able to give their victim impact statement in court — to make sure the defendant understood the pain that he brought to their family,” she said. “And the one day in court that they were there, the defendant was not there. This bill will give them closure.”
Brown additionally emphasized the importance of preventing judges from using absence as a routine workaround.
“In this case, the judge did not require (the defendant) to be there,” she added, “and we just want to make sure that the judge doesn’t use this as a loophole.”
‘This is unacceptable’
Family members repeatedly told lawmakers that victim impact statements are a crucial part of accountability — and the grieving process — and that delivering them without the defendant present compounded their trauma.
Justin More, Aubree’s father, described how being denied an opportunity to speak directly to the defendant stalled his healing.
He said his victim impact statement included forgiveness for the convicted murderer.
“I was trying to move forward, but I never got to that point,” the father told the Senate panel. “(Grieving) is just a very long process, being that I couldn’t read the last words to the person who took my daughter from this world. He wasn’t even man enough to sit up and sit there and listen to what we had to say.”
Travis More, Aubree’s grandfather, told lawmakers the bill would ensure future victim statements do not fall on silent ears.
“Senate Bill 9 will give future grieving victims a chance to face their convicted person and begin the grieving process,” he said. “Ask yourself, before you vote, am I making a difference for the future victims of Indiana?”

Kayley Richardson, Aubree’s aunt, said the family helped draft the legislation because they felt the system failed them.
“In no world is it ever okay that the convicted have more rights than any of their victims or their families,” Richardson said. “There needs to be substantial consequences for such a profound loss.”
Angela Zent, founder of the Sarah Zent Foundation and stepmother to Sarah, testified that victim impact statements are “not legal formalities.”
“They are the final human truth spoken for those who no longer speak for themselves,” she said. “When the defendant is allowed to walk away from that moment, not only is it disrespectful, but it’s also giving him more control and placing more silence on his victims and the families.”
Senators from both sides of the aisle spoke in support of the bill.
“One of the most difficult things to do when you have a homicide is to keep the focus on the victim,” said Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange, a former prosecutor.
She noted that families frequently attend criminal trials and “have to listen to the victim being characterized in many fashions. “Quite often,” Glick said, “the family sits there and endures it.”
“The victim impact statements allow the families to come forward and express to the court, ‘You need to hear this judge. This was a person. These were individuals. These were part of our lives and part of our family who have been taken away,’” Glick continued. “It is very much a part of what should be heard — not for the public, maybe not even for the families themselves — but for the court to hear that this was a living, breathing individual who was lost to society and lost to everyone who ever cared about them.”
Democrat Sen. Rodney Pol, an attorney from Chesterton, further flagged that prosecutors are sometimes prevented from telling a victim’s full story because of discovery rules.
“The idea that you would sit through one of the worst possible tragedies that your family is ever going to go through and not have your voice heard at the end of it — by the person that you feel needs to hear it the most — I think that is one of the most important aspects of being a victim,” Pol said.
Other bills on the move
The Senate corrections committee advanced 11 other measures Tuesday, too.
Senate Bill 271, authored by Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, addresses theft of telecommunications and broadband equipment by tightening rules governing the sale of valuable metals.
Senate committee advances Indiana anti-doxing bill tied to redistricting threats

Another proposal, Senate Bill 160, would add a sentencing aggravator for crimes committed while wearing a mask or other face covering to conceal identity.
Senate Bill 140, also authored by Brown, seeks to criminalize doxing, or the intentional online disclosure of personal information to harass or threaten someone, while Senate Bill 144, another by Koch, would strengthen tobacco and vaping regulations.
Committee chair Sen. Aaron Freeman’s Senate Bill 246 would protect children in court records by requiring the redaction of minors’ names in certain filings, and his Senate Bill 251 separately increases penalties for individuals with prior operating while intoxicated, OWI, convictions.
Multiple measures on the move also deal with bail, including Freeman’s Senate Bill 252, which revises certain bail procedures and conditions for pretrial release.

Jan. 13, 2026 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceOn Tuesday, the Michigan Association of State Universities shared a report detailing the financial impact the state’s 15 public universities have across the state’s economy, bringing in nearly $45 billion in new economic activity while supporting more than 129,000 jobs statewide. 
While unveiling the report, the association’s CEO, Daniel Hurley, joined with university presidents from Michigan State University and Grand Valley State University and representatives from Research Universities for Michigan, the Michigan Health and Hospital Association and the state’s business community for a discussion on how public universities are powering the state’s economy.
As the state heads into the 2026 budget season, Britany Affolter-Caine, the executive director of Research Universities for Michigan, said it’s important to highlight the contributions state universities make to the economy as lawmakers weigh their priorities. 
Breaking down the report’s highlights, Hurley noted that the $44.9 billion net economic impact state universities bring is 28 times the $1.6 billion appropriation the Legislature put into these schools in Fiscal Year 2024. He later noted that university-driven activity produced more than $7.1 billion in state tax revenue, further exceeding the state’s investment into public universities. 
“The bottom line that we want to send today –especially to our friends in the executive branch of state government, in the Legislature, all of our state leaders – is that investing in public universities is not just good education policy, it is smart, high-return economic policy,” Hurley said.

MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz, who sits on the board for Research Universities for Michigan, emphasized the role Michigan’s research universities – Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, the University of Michigan and Wayne State University – play in attracting resources and talent to the state. 
In 2024, these universities conducted nearly $3.5 billion in research funded by federal agencies and private industry partners, Guskiewicz said. 
“That research activity brings billions of dollars in additional in-state economic activity, supporting high-skilled jobs, specialized suppliers and local businesses across the state of Michigan,” he said. 
Alongside supporting Michigan business, those dollars also help support research partnerships at Michigan’s other public universities, Guskiewicz said.

“The takeaway is simple, Michigan’s public universities are strongest when they are strong together,” Guskiewicz said. “Sustained investment in both broad access and high impact research is what allows Michigan to compete and win in a global innovation-driven economy.”
The report’s release follows the Trump administration’s gutting of federal funding for university research programs, including freezing $8 billion from the National Institutes of Health, which administers many of the grants to universities across the nation. Many of those cuts remain contested in the courts.
While the report focuses on hard numbers to quantify the impacts of Michigan’s public universities, both Hurley and Grand Valley State University President Philomena Mantella noted that there is a bigger story behind the numbers, including the 1.6 million alumni working and living in the state. 
“These aren’t just abstract numbers,” Mantella said. “They represent teachers. They represent class. Teachers in classrooms, nurses and hospitals, engineers and advanced manufacturing, entrepreneurs launching their businesses and scaling them here in Michigan, all which contribute to Michigan’s vitality.”

These schools also play a role in ensuring graduates stay in the state, Mantella said, addressing concerns about population and talent loss that have long plagued Michigan. 
Keeping colleges affordable is part of that design, Mantella said, to ensure students graduate with less debt so they can start families, buy homes and launch businesses. 
Additionally, if Michigan is going to grow its population and strengthen its economy, state universities will need to ensure they are aligning their education with the needs of the state, Mantella said, noting that many of the state’s most in-demand jobs require a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Brian Peters, the CEO of the Michigan Health and Hospital Association, said the state’s health care industry relies on a steady stream of nurses, doctors, technicians, administrators and more, with the demand for health care workers increasing. Even with 58,000 new employees hired in 2024, Michigan’s health care industry is still in need of 23,000 employees, Peters explained. 
“For us to continue delivering safe, accessible, high quality care, we need a workforce pipeline that is strong, that’s diverse, and that’s prepared to work in this very rapidly evolving environment. And that’s where the collaboration with our university partners truly comes in,” Peters said, noting that efforts ranging from undergraduate programs to clinical training partnerships help expand the pool of caregivers in the state.

While the economic footprint of Michigan’s universities is significant, the way that care feels for those who need it is all the more important, Peters said, crediting university partnerships with helping to build a network of compassionate professional and committed care among those who stay in the state.
“These are our neighbors who are delivering babies at three in the morning, stitching wounds on holidays, handling emergency room surges at all hours of the day and night,” Peters said. “They are the heart of every hospital in Michigan. These incredible individuals, and they show up every day with compassion, professionalism and commitment, and that is why this human connection and this relationship with our universities is so critically important.”

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado lawmakers return to work Wednesday for their annual 120-day regular legislative session, and the buzzword of the next four months will once again be affordability.
“The Colorado we’re working towards is one where everyone has a chance to work hard and get ahead,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, told reporters Tuesday. “Where high-quality health care is accessible to all without breaking the bank, our K-12 students and educators have what they need to succeed, and every hard working family can afford housing, health care, child care and higher education. This is what we’re working towards.”
Cost-of-living concerns have been a major theme for both Democrats and Republicans the last few years at the Legislature, as lawmakers passed bills focused on spurring new housing development, bolstering consumer protections and advancing tenants’ rights. It has become more salient as the federal government freezes or outright cuts funding for some safety-net programs in the state.
“We’re facing an uphill battle amid recent attacks from the Trump administration and the federal GOP, including hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for child care, food assistance, job training and other crucial services that keep Colorado families afloat,” House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, said. “Colorado Democrats are laser focused on this session to pass legislation that will drive down costs.”

Democrats hold wide majorities in both the House and Senate and can pass their agenda without bipartisan support, but high costs are top of mind for both parties.
“We need to focus on the issues we’ve been hearing most about, which are affordability and crime,” House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican, told Newsline. “My colleagues across the aisle are hearing the same concerns, and so we are trying to get things done in a bipartisan fashion on those issues.”
Republicans have new leadership in both chambers. Sen. Cleave Simpson, an Alamosa Republican, replaced former Minority Leader Paul Lundeen over the summer when Lundeen took a job leading a conservative nonprofit. Caldwell took over as the leader of the House Republicans when former Minority Leader Rose Pugliese resigned following a special session last year. Pugliese and Duran had a public falling out on the House floor.










Colorado Democrats are laser focused on this session to pass legislation that will drive down costs.


– State House Majority Leader Monica Duran


Caldwell said he views his caucus’s role as being the “adults” in the chamber. Since Republicans cannot pass any legislation on their own, however, their job requires working with Democrats to see their ideas make it through the legislative process.
“If there’s a bill that we do not agree with, that we can’t stop with our numbers, our role is to work across the aisle to get amendments and get wins, especially if the bill is going to pass regardless,” he said.
Another budget shortfall
Lawmakers will be constrained by a tight fiscal environment — this is similar to last year — and to pass a balanced budget they will need to find about $800 million in funding cuts. That is the gap between how much it would cost to fund the government at the current level and how much the state actually has to spend.
“It’s not going to be easy, but we are required to pass a balanced budget, and Democrats and Republicans will have to come together to protect the services our constituents need,” Coleman said.
The primary force behind that budget shortfall is ballooning costs for Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income Coloradans. Coverage and use of the program have expanded while the cost of care keeps rising.
The state’s coffers haven’t kept up, partially due to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. That constitutional amendment limits how much the government can keep in tax revenue and spend for programs and services without voter approval. The cap is based on inflation and population growth, and program costs are outpacing inflation. The restriction has long drawn ire from Democrats, who argue it prevents the state from investing in areas like education, infrastructure and health care.
Medicaid costs have grown much faster than the TABOR cap and now make up the biggest share of the budget. It’s an imbalance that is projected to worsen, which is why Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, wants to find a strategy to curb Medicaid cost growth. His proposed budget suggests a $300 million increase to the program next fiscal year, less than half of the projected cost increase.
“What we face is an explosion in Medicaid expenses due to an older and grayer Colorado,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said during a legislative preview breakfast hosted by the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday. “There isn’t a way for us to get out of this budget situation except to tackle health care.”
McCluskie also wants Colorado to consider adjusting the spending cap.
“Thirty years after TABOR (was passed), it’s time that we have that conversation,” she said. “It doesn’t mean getting rid of it. It doesn’t mean that we don’t still think about the way we control or channel government spending. It just means that we’ve got to do it in a better, more effective way so that we’re meeting the priorities we hear about from our constituents.”
Last year, lawmakers made the budget work — it was a $1.2 billion shortfall then — with one-time spending cuts and other accounting maneuvers that prevented severe damage to essential services. This time, many of those levers aren’t available, which could mean more painful cuts.
“With the budget shortfall Colorado is facing, we’re going to have some tough decisions to make this session,” Caldwell said. “Do we look at areas we can cut or do we look at how to raise revenue? Obviously, my position is looking at where we can cut spending.”
The six-member, bipartisan Joint Budget Committee has already begun its work of crafting the state budget. That legislation typically gets passed in the latter half of the session.
Revisiting bills from 2025
Democrats will once again vote on a bill to repeal the state’s Labor Peace Act, a 1940s law that requires a unique second union election in Colorado for workers to negotiate some aspects of their contract. Last year, it was one of the first bills to be introduced but one of the last to pass, as business groups and labor interests tried to negotiate a compromise that would appease Polis. It passed unchanged and Polis vetoed it.
Democrats will consider it again this year, and that tension with the governor’s office will likely remain.
Additionally, lawmakers will need to decide how to proceed with the state’s artificial intelligence anti-discrimination law, set to go into effect in June. First passed in 2024, the law was immediately controversial among tech companies and some businesses, which worry it is too rigid and will stifle innovation. Proponents of the basics of the law want to curb bias in AI programs and set up a framework so consumers and affected people know when AI is used in major decisions related to areas like their employment and finances.
A task force met in 2024 to work out a policy solution, but a bill to tweak it during last year’s legislative session failed. Polis then charged the Legislature to include the issue during the special session last summer, but talks broke down, and lawmakers passed a bill to push back the implementation date. That gives them this regular session to find a path forward.
“There is still so much I want to accomplish, including solving the AI puzzle once and for all,” Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat, said.
New leadership and an election year
There will also be interpersonal tension and the dynamic of an election year at play this legislative session. It is the final session for McCluskie and Duran in the House and the final year for Rodriguez in the Senate.
It is also Polis’ final session as governor.
While many legislators will be running to retain their seat in the Capitol — or move from the House to the Senate — a number are also campaigning for higher office, some against one another. That means they will need to be present in the Legislature and also active on the campaign trail.
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, and Rep. Scott Bottoms, a Colorado Springs Republican, are both vying for governor.
Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Mark Baisley, a Woodland Park Republican, are eyeing the U.S. Senate, and Rep. Manny Rutinel, a Commerce City Democrat, is running for the 8th Congressional District.
Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat, and Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, are running for state treasurer. Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, is campaigning to be secretary of state.
Also in the background will be an ethics investigation into a weekend retreat attended by members of the Colorado Opportunity Caucus, which comprises moderate Democrats. An ethics complaint alleges that those 16 lawmakers violated the state’s gift ban by allowing pro-business dark money group One Main Street to help pay for the gathering. The inquiry could deepen a rift between moderate and progressive Democrats in the Legislature.
People can view live and archived video streams of Capitol proceedings through the Legislature’s website and YouTube page. The Legislature’s website also posts the daily schedule, including committee hearings and expected floor work.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Following widespread allegations of child care fraud in Minnesota, a West Virginia official told lawmakers on Tuesday that similar issues haven’t been found here. 
The federal government sends money to states to subsidize the cost of care for low-income children. Many working parents across the state rely on the Child Care and Development Fund to afford child care; the average annual cost of care at a licensed child care center in West Virginia is more than $6,000 per child. 
Alex J. Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services
“We haven’t found any fraud to date within the child care system. We are doing a lot of examinations internally, not just in child care but across all our programs,” Alex Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services, told lawmakers during a meeting Tuesday at the state Capitol.
Mayer responded to a question from Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, who asked if DoHS had found any evidence of child care subsidy fraud after what happened in Minnesota. A 2019 state investigation found that there was likely several million dollars in child care fraud taking place within Minnesota’s system linked to the federal subsidy program. 
Additional overpayment issues with Minnesota’s child care centers were flagged last year. 
In response to the fraud allegations, the U.S. The Department of Health and Human Services froze all federal funding for the child care subsidy program in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota. A federal judge last week temporarily blocked the Trump administration from stopping the subsidies after the five states sued over the matter.
There is no evidence to support large-scale child care fraud nationwide. 
In West Virginia, some child care providers have said up to 90% of their enrolled children receive the subsidy, and centers that accept children on subsidies will bill the state for the cost of caring for those kids.
“It comes as no surprise to me that Secretary Alex Mayer reported no findings of child care fraud to date. West Virginia child care providers operate with honesty and integrity, often under extraordinary financial strain,” said Tiffany Gale, owner and director of Miss Tiffany’s School for Young Children, a licensed family child care facility in Weirton. 
Mayer said DoHS has implemented additional oversight on child care providers.
“We want to work with providers to understand how to make things better for them and with them,” he said.
Jennifer Trippett, owner of Cubby’s Child Care Center in Bridgeport that serves 460 kids, said, “Child care providers need the ability to operate their programs without excessive and unnecessary bureaucracy. … So they can stay focused on what matters most — caring for children and supporting working families.”
“Providers across the state work tirelessly to deliver high-quality care for the most vulnerable children in our communities. Secretary Mayer has now clarified that the recent increase in documentation requests was intended to verify potential fraud — and that none has been identified,” she continued. 
As West Virginia’s 60-day legislative session begins Wednesday, child care providers will ask lawmakers to address pressing issues with child care statewide. More than 25,000 children in West Virginia don’t have access to child care, and more than 150 child care providers have closed their classrooms over the last year.
Last year, while some state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle pushed for child care expansion, a number of child care measures failed to get up for a full vote in the GOP-led Senate and House of Delegates. 
“While we are not surprised by [Mayer’s] report, it does not negate the very real issue facing our state: West Virginia has consistently disinvested in child care infrastructure,” Gale said. “Since 2017, state investment has dropped sharply — from roughly $11 million annually to about $3 million annually by 2021, where it has remained through 2024. This dramatic reduction has occurred even as the cost of care, workforce shortages and inflation continue to rise.”
This session, child care providers plan to ask lawmakers to increase the amount for its child care subsidy to align with the cost of providing care. They’d also like to see the Legislature pass a “child care workforce scholarship act” that establishes child care scholarships for all child care employees to help with training and retention. 
“Child care is the backbone of our economy. When we defund child care, we destabilize families, employers, and entire communities,” Gale said, adding that changes this session are essential to the industry.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout).The tension between protecting natural resources and sourcing enough water to fuel Middle Tennessee’s growth is once again coming to the statehouse.
Members of the Tennessee General Assembly filed a handful of bills as of Tuesday concerning the Duck River, a scenic river known worldwide for supporting a vast array of freshwater species, including several federally endangered and threatened species. The river also serves as the sole water source for roughly 250,000 people in Middle Tennessee, an area that faces increasing development pressure and intermittent drought periods. Environmental groups have warned for years that drawing more and more water from the river is unsustainable.
One bill seeks to prohibit the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates water withdrawals from rivers, from stopping any utility that provides drinking water from making withdrawals, regardless of drought conditions. A proposed House Joint Resolution would express support for reconstructing the Columbia Dam, a project that was halted in the 1980s and dismantled in the 1990s.
Another bill would designate several rivers and creeks as Class II pastoral waterways, which would protect those areas from mining, commercial timber harvest, and landfill uses and allow private landowners the option to participate in protections to ensure the land remains pastoral. While portions of the Duck River are already designated as Class II waterways, this bill would stretch the classification to the entire river, except the portion including the Normandy Reservoir, which is managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Rep. Pat Marsh, a Shelbyville Republican, did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding this bill.
Bills may still be amended, and the filing deadline for new legislation is Jan. 30.
Taking away regulatory power
A bill introduced by Chapel Hill Republican Rep. Todd Warner would block the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation — which issues water withdrawal permits for utilities — from limiting how much water a utility can withdraw, so long as it is “for the purposes of providing drinking water.”
“I think TDEC has overstepped their bounds in some of these places, especially on the Duck River,” by telling utilities that they must stop pumping if river flow levels drop below a certain threshold, Warner said Tuesday. “Well, we have no backup water, so we’re not going to cease pumping.”
“I think TDEC has overstepped their bounds in some of these places, especially on the Duck River,” said Rep, Todd Warner, a Culleoka Republican, of a bill he filed limiting regulatory power over Duck River water withdrawals. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Warner said he filed the bill because he felt the department did not provide an answer as to what would happen to a utility that kept pumping water despite limitations during low flows. He referenced a permit granted to the Marshall County Board of Public Utilities in August 2021 that included water withdrawal limitations for times of drought, when withdrawals could be fatal to the river’s many inhabitants. Marshall County appealed that permit, asking that withdrawal limitations be removed. The department, The Nature Conservancy and the Tennessee Wildlife Federation reached a settlement with Marshall County in 2022 to keep the limits in place.
Warner noted that the bill does allow the regulatory authority to limit withdrawals if required by federal law — for example, if water is found to be contaminated, or contains federally endangered species. But the bill states that this exemption doesn’t apply if federal law only “recommends” pumping be prohibited. 
At the federal level, President Donald Trump’s administration has been slashing environmental regulations, including proposing rule changes that environmental legislators say would weaken habitat and harm protections for threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The administration has stated it is removing “regulatory barriers that hinder responsible resource development and economic growth while maintaining core conservation commitments.”
Under Trump, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin proposed a new rule that would cut federal protection for wetlands. In 2025, Tennessee legislators passed a law that lessened state regulatory protections for an estimated 80% of Tennessee wetlands that lack federal protection.
Supporting a second attempt at a Columbia dam
Warner is also sponsoring a resolution that would show “strong support” for the reconstruction of the Columbia Dam, recognizing the project as a “critical priority for the State to establish an adequate water supply system for sustained growth, economic development, and recreational use.”
The initial dam project ran into multiple issues and was ultimately torn down amid a lawsuit over environmental impacts and land, permitting issues with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, rising costs, and a cost-benefit analysis that recommended scrapping the project altogether.
As water needs grow, a group called “Columbia Dam Now” says a new dam is the only way to provide affordable drinking water for the area. An opposing group, “Don’t Dam the Duck,” has concerns about the project’s feasibility and the impact a dam would have on the river’s delicate ecology.
Columbia Dam Now has been working with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles since mid-2025 to secure congressional funding for a feasibility study for the project. A cost estimate for a modern-day rebuild of the dam has not been released.
Warner, a member of the Columbia Dam Now board, said his goal for this resolution is to help secure that federal funding. The group spent several months in 2025 collecting similar non-binding resolutions from various county and city governments in the area.
Group seeking to build Columbia Dam on Duck River teams with Ogles to pursue federal funds for study

A group of public officials, conservationists and utility representatives have been reviewing possibilities to address water needs in Middle Tennessee at the behest of Gov. Bill Lee, who issued an executive order in November 2024 declaring the river a “scenic treasure” and creating the group to determine how to balance water needs with the river’s health. 
The Duck River Planning Partnership issued its first recommendations in November, including a feasibility study for a pipeline bringing water from the Tennessee River to Middle Tennessee, a feasibility study for regional water solutions, and raising winter water levels in the Normandy Dam, a reservoir that allows the Tennessee Valley Authority to regulate the river’s water flow. 
Rebuilding the Columbia Dam was not among the partnership’s recommendations.
The Mallory Valley Utility District released a study in September that found that a pipeline supplying water from the Cumberland River to Maury and Williamson counties is feasible, but could cost up to $1.9 billion without state or federal help.
Earlier this month, Columbia’s City Council approved water rate hikes of up to 20% per year over the next five years to fund the construction of a new water intake and water treatment plant to serve Columbia Power and Water Systems’ customers. The new intake is permitted by the state’s regulatory department to withdraw up to 32 million gallons of water per day from the river, 12 million gallons more than the current intake.
While Maury County residents said the new rates will place extreme strain on the finances of already struggling families and residents with fixed incomes, the utility’s leaders said the 20% raise per year represents the worst-case scenario, and annual hikes will likely fall below that cap. State officials said the new intake had been under consideration for at least a decade and is the most advanced of all of the proposed solutions in terms of permitting, public hearings and state approvals. 
The project’s permit is among several included in a settlement over environmental protections between the Tennessee Wildlife Federation, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, and state regulators. The settlement requires the utilities to follow an updated drought management plan approved by the state’s Department of Environment and Conservation and set goals to limit the amount of water allowed to leak from the utilities’ systems.

(Photo via U.S. Coast Guard courtesy of  by Main Pass Oil Gathering Co., LLC)Let’s say you hired a landscaper to work on your backyard. But they left their trash and broken tools scattered around your property and made you clean it all up. Would you hire that same company to work on your front yard?

The Trump administration would, apparently.

The administration’s proposed five-year program calls for new oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and, for the first time in decades, off the coast of California. But the same industry that will benefit from Trump’s plan already turned the Louisiana coast into a dumping ground, leaving infrastructure behind to decay and pollute our waters.

We can’t afford more of this. Much of Louisiana’s marine ecosystem has already been sacrificed for profit, and Trump’s plan would be devastating for the Gulf’s remaining manatees, sea turtles, gulf sturgeon and Rice’s whale — one of the world’s most endangered baleen whales, with an estimated population of just 51 animals.

Our sad reality is what happens when the oil industry is allowed to run rampant. It should be a cautionary tale for other states.

There are currently more idle wells than producing wells in the Gulf of Mexico. At least 75% of end-of-lease and idle oil infrastructure off the Gulf Coast is overdue for decommissioning. Hundreds of these wells have sat idle for more than a decade, some far longer. These wells have proven to be dangerous, leaking oil into the water and spewing methane into the atmosphere. In April, Well 59 — an 82-year-old idle well — broke loose and spewed tens of thousands of gallons of pollutants into Louisiana state waters and wetlands.

For decades, operators have also avoided their cleanup obligations, selling off their low-producing wells to smaller companies, leaving their infrastructure to sit idle for some purported future use, or going bankrupt and deserting their platforms. Even though many of these companies raked in enormous profits while their wells were active, their attempts to evade cleanup obligations lead to persistent safety and environmental hazards.

This is California and Alaska’s future if Trump’s five-year plan moves forward. Louisiana can serve as their crystal ball, and the plan deepens the decommissioning crisis in the Gulf.

Long after operators pack up and leave, the underwater world off our coasts will be permanently scarred by rusting platforms and unplugged wells that leak harmful gases and toxins. The fishing industry that helps drive the Gulf Coast and Alaska’s economy could be in peril; so will California’s robust tourism industry and iconic beaches.

This danger is not lost on most coastal politicians, regardless of political party. When news of Trump’s plan first broke, the administration faced so much pushback from states like Florida, South Carolina and Georgia that the entire East Coast was eventually scrapped from the plan. Several top Florida politicians, all Republican, are still working to stop the expansion in the Gulf of Mexico, worried more drilling will harm the state’s tourism industry.

Why should the oil industry expand off the Gulf, California, and Alaska coasts when it can’t even clean up its mess off Louisiana? Once these wells are no longer profitable, the industry will follow its trusted playbook — pack up the equipment that still works and leave the rusting remnants behind for us to deal with.

These companies should be paying to clean up the disaster they created in Louisiana. Instead, they’re bidding on the next marine environment to pollute.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Main-Pass-oil-spill-2023-1024x746.jpg,,,2026-01-14 06:58:48.576700

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Wisconsinites are holding rallies  across the state Wednesday to call on Congress and the Trump administration to increase funding for operations at the Social Security Administration.
Staff reductions and office closures in the last year have created bottlenecks in service for members of the public who need help from the agency, according to Jessica LaPointe, the Wisconsin-based president of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Council 220. The union represents field operations employees for the Social Security Administration across the country.
“We’re struggling to meet the needs of the public,” LaPointe said, with more than 10,000 people a day becoming eligible for the federal retirement program.
Along with AFGE, the Wisconsin Alliance for Retired Americans will be rallying outside Social Security offices in eight Wisconsin communities Wednesday.
“When they start closing offices, that hinders our senior citizens,” said Ross Winklbauer, president of WARA. “They call into Social Security if they have a question or to file a claim, and they’re sitting on the phone for hours because of short staffing and not getting their questions answered.”
WARA will take part in a rally starting at 12 noon outside the Social Security offices in the Milwaukee suburb of Greenfield along with AFGE. Rallies are also planned in Eau Claire, Madison, Racine, Rhinelander, Stevens Point, Wausau and Wisconsin Rapids. Winklbauer said WARA has about 100,000 members in the state, mostly union retirees, and about 1,000 active participants.
The rallies are part of a national day of action in anticipation of the possibility that the government will shut down at the end of January if Congress can’t agree on a budget for the rest of the year, LaPointe said.
Talks are underway between congressional Republicans and Democrats to enact the rest of the government’s spending plan for the current year by the upcoming deadline.
Nevertheless, LaPointe said the most recent shutdown that started Oct. 1 and ran for a record 43 days brought home to many field office workers in the Social Service Admin. the limits of their compensation, especially if they are furloughed.
In a report released Wednesday, the Strategic Organizing Center said its review of 36,000 Social Security workers’ pay rates showed that 54% — just over half — were paid less than what the MIT Living Wage Calculator has set as a living wage for the regions of the U.S. where they live. The developers of the calculator at the MIT Living Wage Institute define a living wage as “the rate that a full-time worker requires to cover the costs of their family’s basic needs where they live.”
“We don’t get paid enough to save for a rainy day,” LaPointe said. “We’re understaffed, we’re underpaid and we’re struggling to meet the needs of the public who are coming to us for their earned benefits.”
In January 2025, when President Donald Trump took office, the agency’s staff was at its lowest in 50 years, LaPointe said, and “the public was waiting too long for benefits and services.”
Since then, the agency instituted a buyout program, offering workers up to $25,000 to quit, and the staff dropped from 58,000 a year ago to about 50,000 now — “the largest single staffing cut in Social Security history,” LaPointe said. 
About 2,000 field staff were lost in the last year — 10% of the field operations, she said, with the number of employees at some offices falling to single digits. 
LaPointe said the agency has moved to “digital first” operations that favor online or telephone contacts instead of in-person visits. In addition, the agency has shifted to processing inquiries from the public nationally rather than at the local office she said — “where a customer out in California would be served by someone in Wisconsin, or a customer in Madison might be served by someone in New Jersey.”
In an email message, a Social Security Administration spokesperson depicted the digital shift as part of a modernization program so that “more Americans are choosing to resolve their needs online or over the phone.” The statement cited a recent audit by the Social Security Administration inspector general that found average hold times for callers had dropped to seven minutes by September 2025 from a high of 30 minutes in January.
Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano “has pledged to have the right level of staffing to operate at peak efficiency and deliver best-in-class customer service to the American people,” the spokesperson said.
The Social Security Administration “is taking action to improve workplace satisfaction, support professional development, and enhance communication across all levels of the organization,” the spokesperson added.
LaPointe, however, said there’s been “a breakdown in community based service” with the new system, and Social Security staffers are no longer the face of government in the local community.
“You now have to have an appointment to do anything with Social Security,” LaPointe said. “It’s created a bottleneck of service to where people cannot get access to apply for benefits in a timely fashion.”
Frontline workers are concerned that a move toward using artificial intelligence technology to review benefit applications will increase errors — either benefit approvals that are mistaken or unwarranted denials, she said.
“It still takes a human being to adjudicate claims — every claim, whether on the phone, online or in person,” LaPointe said.

(Photo courtesy of ACLU-WV)As the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case of B.P.J. vs. West Virginia this week, the weight of the world must be on Harrison County teenager Becky Pepper-Jackson’s shoulders. Becky — who has been fighting in court for years to simply be allowed to throw shot put and discus on her school’s track team — is now at the center of a media maelstrom as her story reaches the court’s ears, and the stakes have never been higher. The decision in this case will have far-reaching ramifications for children across the United States as the court weighs whether to enshrine biological essentialism into law as part of its interpretation of Title IX.
Amidst my admiration for Becky’s bravery, I have also felt overwhelming waves of disgust with the widespread direct and indirect harassment I have seen coming her way from adults online. In particular, the Office of the West Virginia Attorney General’s obsessive posting about the case has treated the life and liberty of a teenage girl as an engagement farm, making archaic arguments about sex-based differences using complaints from athletes who are not from West Virginia and creating a platform for sharing hate against the one child the state’s “Save Women’s Sports Act” currently effects.
As many West Virginians have pointed out in the comments on these posts, in a state where there are so many other problems, why is the AG devoting this much energy and attention to one girl who simply wants to play? The answer is clear. Republicans have seized onto trans girls — one of the most marginalized populations in the country — as the talking point du jour and, for both Attorney General J.B. McCuskey and Gov. Patrick Morrisey, it is politically advantageous to endear themselves to the MAGA wing of the party. This means that, in these men’s quest for power and influence, girls like Becky may become collateral damage.
I know what it feels like to be the girl in the middle of a conservative scheme to grab power. I grew up in Elkview, West Virginia, and attended George Washington High School (where, incidentally, I competed on the cross country team). In 2013, when I spoke out about my high school principal George Aulenbacher’s decision to bring the faith-based abstinence-only sex education speaker Pam Stenzel to campus, I survived a similar coordinated attempt to harass and discredit me.
In my case, what might have seemed like mild and block-cureable online posting did actually have real life consequences. At the height of the controversy, I was regularly physically menaced in public, received unmarked harassing mail to my family’s home, and was a constant target of threats and more general bullying online, all of which was accelerated by a few agitators who created an online funnel to send angry adults as well as some of my own peers my way. This experience has had long-lasting impacts on my mental health as well as my relationship to my hometown in West Virginia. What has stuck with me most from that time was the cruelty of adults who were able to look past my being a child and transform me into some kind of abstract left wing villain because I simply spoke out in defense of myself and other girls.
Becky Pepper-Jackson is not a villain. She is a high school sophomore who should be getting to focus on studying for her learner’s permit and hanging out with her friends at practice but is instead being forced to be very brave in the face of a nationwide movement that seeks to enshrine discrimination against her and girls like her. West Virginians shouldn’t fall for McCuskey and Morrisey’s bullying bait. Let kids be kids and let Becky play.

Colorado is the sixth-least affordable state for child care in the nation. Costs for center-based care average 14% of a two-parent household’s median income and 45% of a single parent’s median income. The federal affordability benchmark is just 7%.
Colorado also faces significant shortages in access to slots in licensed child care programs. In 2023, more than 40,000 Colorado parents reported quitting a job, turning down a job or significantly changing a job because of problems with child care.
Recently, several Colorado counties passed measures to subsidize child care through local taxes. Despite these advancements, Colorado’s child care system is facing a fiscal crisis that is likely to affect families and children for years to come.
Child care disruptions for families with infants and toddlers are estimated to cost the state more than $2.7 billion in lost economic productivity and revenue. Ensuring access to affordable child care supports workforce participation and enhances the well-being of children and families.

I study early care and education policies and programs that promote children’s cognitive, behavioral and social-emotional learning. My research lab at Colorado State University has been investigating the consequences of a lack of access to high-quality, affordable child care on child and family outcomes.
Colorado’s Child Care Assistance Program
Since the late 1990s, the Colorado Child Care Assistance Program has subsidized the cost of child care for parents and caregivers with lower incomes who are working, searching for work or pursuing education. My research shows these subsidies are a critical lifeline that help lower-income families access child care.
Subsidies allow families to prioritize factors other than cost, such as location, in their search for child care. From 2023 to 2024, the Colorado subsidy program served more than 30,000 children in the state. That’s about 10% of those who qualified, which is typical for most states.
A federal March 2024 rule from the Administration for Children and Families caps family co-payments at no more than 7% of household income. It also requires reimbursement rates to reflect the full cost of care, whereas previously subsidy payments were based on what families could afford to pay.
Although intended to improve affordability for families and adequately compensate child care programs, the rule included no additional federal funding. In Colorado, meeting these new requirements is projected to cost the subsidy system approximately $43 million more per year.
These changes, combined with the expiration of COVID-19 relief funding that provided Colorado an additional $465 million to stabilize and expand child care assistance, has created growing financial instability for the subsidy system.
Approximately one-third of Colorado counties are experiencing an enrollment freeze for their child care subsidies. This means new applicants cannot access subsidized care until the freeze is lifted. There is no set timeline for when that will occur.
Without additional funding that would allow the freeze to be lifted, enrollment in Colorado’s Child Care Assistance Program is estimated to decline by 64%, falling from about 30,000 to just 10,000 enrollees. As children age out or families no longer qualify, spots that would normally open up for new enrollees will remain unfilled during the freeze.
Zooming in on Larimer County
I have been studying the impacts of the enrollment freeze in my hometown of Larimer County, Colorado. It’s a geographically diverse region that includes urban centers such as Fort Collins and Loveland, mountain destinations such as Estes Park, and rural agricultural communities. Like elsewhere in the state, child care costs pose a significant financial strain on local families.
A household in Larimer County with a median income of $64,919 and two children under the age of 5 spends approximately 37% of its income on child care. Due to budget constraints, Larimer County has had an enrollment freeze in the Colorado Child Care Assistance Program since February of 2024. The county has effectively paused the intake of new applicants for subsidies.
Recently, we administered surveys to 88 families in Larimer County. Approximately half of those surveyed were currently receiving a subsidy and half had applied but were unable to access it because of the freeze. We compared families using advanced statistical modeling that controlled for any differences between groups, allowing us to isolate the effects of the subsidy freeze on family outcomes.
In unpublished research that is being prepared for peer review, we found families affected by the freeze used fewer paid child care hours, faced higher costs, expressed greater concerns about costs, and reported more difficulty paying for care. They also had less reliable and stable arrangements, were less satisfied with their care, experienced higher child care-related stress and displayed greater risk of depression.
But that’s not all. Families without a subsidy reported missing twice as many workdays. When extrapolated across the 425 families in Larimer County affected by the freeze, this translated to over $2.2 million in lost annual earnings.
Local initiatives driving solutions
Recognizing the gaps in affordable child care, counties across Colorado introduced ballot measures to fund local solutions through tax revenue.
These measures come after the state established a universal preschool program in 2022. The following year, the program provided up to 15 hours per week of tuition-free, high-quality preschool for more than 85,000 children.
Measures in Larimer, San Miguel, Garfield, Pitkin and southwest Eagle counties will directly fund child care through sales or property taxes. Measures in Gilpin, Hinsdale, Ouray and Eagle counties will generate funds through lodging taxes.
In Larimer, voters passed a measure that established an additional countywide sales tax of 0.25%, or 25 cents per 100 dollars. The measure is expected to generate $28 million annually for child care assistance and workforce compensation.
In San Miguel, voters passed an existing property tax of 75 cents for every 1,000 dollars of assessed property value, allowing the county to collect and use all the revenue it generates instead of being limited by a new state cap. This will allow the county to retain nearly $1 million annually to support local child care affordability.
In Eagle County, voters passed a measure approving a lodging tax increase from 2% to 4% on hotel stays and short-term rentals that will raise approximately $4.5 million annually to lower child care costs.
Revenue from these initiatives will provide child care tuition to families, expand child care slots, support quality improvement and raise wages for child care workers.
These local investments cannot by themselves resolve Colorado’s statewide child care funding deficit, but they have the potential to transform access and quality within communities where they are implemented.
Colorado is not alone in these issues. Many other states are facing subsidy enrollment freezes and are exploring regional solutions to stabilize funding.
For example, ballot measures in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Seattle, Washington, also recently passed, providing reliable funding for child care assistance, preschool quality and workforce compensation.
With the uncertainty of the state and federal funding landscape, municipalities across the country may look to Colorado as a model for locally driven strategies that address community needs.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-14 10:30:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi House speaker invokes Trump in push for school choice. How involved might the president get?,Geoff Pender and Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/14/trump-mississippi-school-choice/,"President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at BancorpSouth Arena in Tupelo, Miss., Friday, November 1, 2019.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Faced with internecine Republican opposition to “school-choice,” or spending tax dollars earmarked for public education on private schools, House Speaker Jason White broke out the biggest gun in Mississippi GOP politics: He invoked President Donald J. Trump.
“The @WhiteHouse is watching Mississippi and Education Freedom is gaining momentum!” White posted Monday on the social media site X. “HB 2 promotes the Make America Great Again Platform and @POTUS’s Executive Order to return power over education to families, instead of bureaucracies …”
White had retweeted a post from Trump Education Secretary Linda McMahon, endorsing the House’s proposed HB 2 as “ambitious school choice expansion” and adding, “Well done, @JasonWhiteMS.”
A key question that remains unanswered, though, is how far the Trump White House is willing to go to see a robust school-choice policy become reality in the Magnolia State, which remains a holdout in the Deep South.
A White House official who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the situation told Mississippi Today that the Trump administration is “very closely monitoring” the school choice debate in the Legislature and wants strong school choice legislation to pass.
U.S. Department of Education officials traveled to Mississippi last year to visit with White’s staff and Gov. Tate Reeves’ office to discuss policy specifics.
Now, many took White’s trumpeting Trump’s support for his plan as a shot over the bow of his Republican Senate leadership colleagues, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann. Senate leaders have vowed they will not consider any House proposal that includes vouchers or accounts for parents to spend public money on private schooling.
White and other proponents of expanded school choice and spending public money on private schooling appear to be trying to cast the issue as a referendum on Trump. And among the MSGOP, when Trump says jump, the answer appears to be, “How high?”
But with a House committee vote on White’s school-choice proposal happening as early as Wednesday, it would appear that his invocation of Trump was as much an effort to whip votes from his own still-reluctant or opposed House members as it was to try to sway the Senate. Some heavy-duty House whipping of Republican votes on school choice has been going on even before the Legislature gaveled in for the new session last week. Reluctance and opposition remain among some House Republicans.
Senate leaders, including Hosemann, appeared nonplussed by White’s warning that Trump is watching or by McMahon’s endorsement. When asked about McMahon’s backing of House Bill 2 on Supertalk radio this week, Hosemann replied that he’s surprised she’s read it all, a dig at the 553-page omnibus House education proposal that includes school choice vouchers.
Trump has endorsed school choice and included federal tax credits for donations to fund private school scholarships in his so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” He’s called school choice “the civil rights issue of our time.”
But how involved would Trump and his administration get in Mississippi’s legislative wrangling over school choice? Might he come down for a visit to whip up votes? Might he or Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller start calling Mississippi GOP lawmakers and threaten to primary them next year, as the Capitol rumor mill was suggesting this week?
Trump appears to have many bigger fish to fry at the moment. He famously doesn’t like to lose battles, especially when he parachutes in on the state or local levels. Senate leaders have deemed spending tax dollars on private schools a non-starter. Local governments, including in some red areas, have adopted resolutions against school choice expansion, and local superintendents across the state are lobbying their lawmakers against it.
As politically stout as Trump is in the Magnolia State, some Republican lawmakers would likely still be hesitant to follow him against the wishes of their school leaders back home.
Several lawmakers who are, at best, hesitant to vote for a school choice bill told Mississippi Today they have not been on the receiving end of any lobbying efforts by the White House.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/07003046/MG_1878-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-14 05:58:34.366829

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)On the eve of the 2026 General Assembly session, Senate Democrats on Tuesday rolled out an ambitious agenda centered on lowering the financial strain on Virginia families, while signalling openness to revisiting tax and revenue policy amid looming budget pressures. 
Democrats control both chambers of the legislature, which is set to convene Wednesday with affordability at the forefront of lawmakers’ priorities, amid broader economic and policy debates facing the commonwealth.
At a news conference in Richmond, party leaders outlined what they called the “2026 affordability agenda,” a package aimed at easing costs for households across sectors including healthcare, childcare, housing, energy and food access. 
The framework builds on the Affordable Virginia blueprint unveiled last month by Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, who has made cost-of-living issues a central theme of her early legislative push.
“Over the course of the last year, one of the things that we kept hearing about was the rising costs among families,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus. 
“Families across Virginia are being squeezed by rising costs from housing and health care to childcare and everyday necessities, and they deserve relief. The urgency of this moment is not lost on us.”
Locke said the agenda will rest on eight pillars that also include transportation, job and food access, energy and education, aimed at restoring “hope, freedom and opportunity for working families” in Virginia.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, tied the affordability push directly to economic pressures he attributes to federal policy shifts, including tariffs and energy costs. 
In a sweeping critique of national trends, Surovell said rising prices for essentials such as food and utilities underscore the urgency of the legislature’s work.
“The truth is, President Trump’s policies are failing Virginians, and the question now is whether we’re going to let that happen, whether we’re going to do something about it,” Surovell said, previewing a slate of Democratic proposals that would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2028, create paid family medical leave and expand collective bargaining rights for public employees.
Surovell also addressed the state’s fiscal outlook, noting that new federal tax law changes — part of the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill passed by Congress last year — could cost Virginia roughly $1 billion in revenue if the commonwealth conforms its tax code to the federal structure. 
The legislature must decide within the first two weeks of session whether to align state tax policy with the federal changes, he said.
“If we can form our tax policy to what Congress asks us to do, it costs us a $1 billion of revenue,” Surovell said. “We’re going to have to make a decision in the first two weeks whether or not we can conform to the federal tax law or not.” 
He added that after adjustments for K-12 and Medicaid spending, Virginia is facing a $3 billion to $4 billion funding gap before new initiatives can be considered.
Among potential revenue discussions are modernizing elements of the state’s tax structure, Surovell said, including reexamining the sales tax base and whether existing income tax brackets are equitable in a changing economy.
Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, echoed the centrality of affordability while placing it in the broader context of opportunity and long-term prosperity. 
“We’re going to frame affordability and (it’s) inseparable from freedom and opportunity,” Lucas said, naming access to quality education, health care and workforce development as key components of sustainable economic mobility.
The Democratic agenda dovetails with wider General Assembly expectations.
Affordability resonated with voters across Virginia in the 2025 elections, helping deliver Democratic a sharp increase of the party’s House majority and shaping policy priorities for 2026. 
Spanberger’s earlier rollout of the Affordable Virginia Agenda mirrored her campaign promises and framed the session as an opportunity to tackle prescription drug costs, utility bills and housing challenges, with a focus on measures to restrain runaway costs without overburdening the state budget.
Still, the ambitious scope of Democratic proposals has drawn scrutiny from critics who argue that some measures — such as broad regulatory changes and spending mandates — could backfire by shifting costs elsewhere in the economy or increasing burdens on businesses and ratepayers. 
A recent Washington Post analysis suggested that certain affordability strategies may inadvertently raise costs through cross-subsidization or expanded mandates.
Beyond affordability, Democrats and Republicans alike are preparing for debate on other high-profile issues such as constitutional amendments, redistricting procedures and structural reforms in areas like energy policy and worker protections. 
Under Virginia’s Constitution, constitutional amendments that passed for the first time last year must be approved again in the coming weeks before moving to voters later in 2026, making this session particularly consequential.

(Photo by Imaginima/Getty Images)Virginia’s ever-growing fleet of data centers will take the spotlight when the General Assembly reconvenes this week. Along with bills addressing issues like energy use and siting, legislators will need to address a problem that received little attention in previous years: the diesel generators that provide backup power in emergencies.
In Northern Virginia, where most data centers are concentrated, millions of people are exposed to air pollution from thousands of massive diesel generators. Air toxins permeate the surrounding area every time these generators are run for routine testing and maintenance, with greater levels of pollution when they all kick on at once in a grid emergency. As more data centers go up in suburban neighborhoods and close to schools, residents fear that their health, and that of their children, is being sacrificed to Big Tech’s AI ambitions. 
Ongoing research led by Dr. Damian Pitt at Virginia Commonwealth University, using data from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), shows pollution from data centers currently makes up a very small but growing percentage of the region’s most harmful air emissions, including CO, NOx and PM2.5. (In pollution, the automobile is still king.)  Already the appendix to the report, using 2023 data, shows significant impacts to neighborhoods around data centers in Loudoun and Prince William counties, exceeding emissions from other high-pollution facilities in the region. 
(Map courtesy Damien Pitt/Virginia Commonwealth University research team)
But as the research team noted, the total allowable emissions under DEQ permits is far greater, and this also keeps growing with construction of each new data center. 
And those are annual limits, which could be met with very high emissions on a limited number of days. It’s not hard to imagine the health crisis that might accompany a grid emergency causing all of the area’s generators to fire up at once on a hot summer day, perhaps when smoke from wildfires is already pushing air quality into the hazard zone. 
Yet the problem grows with every new data center that’s built, each one requiring backup power on site. In Virginia, diesel is the fuel of choice, most of it burned in so-called Tier II emergency generators with no pollution controls. 
In the past year, large operators have started installing Tier IV generators in addition to Tier II generators. The Tier IV have some pollution controls and are not restricted to emergency use. They are subject to the same annual emissions limits, but as long as they stay under the permitted level there is no limit on how much they can run. 
The new trend suggests that operators who install these non-emergency generators either think their Tier II generators may be used so much in the future that it will put the data center at risk of exceeding the permit’s annual air pollution limits – which would be bad – or they intend to use the Tier IV generators outside of emergency situations – which might be worse. 
Either way, it appears operators expect to burn a lot more diesel fuel in coming years. One Amazon permit I reviewed contemplates a single data center using up to ten million gallons of diesel fuel annually for 173 generators. All that diesel fuel is delivered by diesel trucks, which adds to the region’s pollution but isn’t limited by the permits.
Why so much? DEQ guidance from January 2025 indicates that data centers have two to three levels of redundancy in their generator capacity – that is, backups for the backups, so operators never have to fear losing power if some of the generators won’t start. As a result, there is more generator capacity than data center load. Together, Northern Virginia’s 4,000-plus diesel generators add up to over 11 gigawatts of energy capacity – exceeding Dominion Energy’s entire natural gas fleet, and enough to power millions of homes. 
But of course, they don’t power millions of homes. They are used only for data centers, and when all goes well, they aren’t used at all. These thousands of generators just sit around doing nothing.  
Apparently, this is the cheapest possible way to ensure data centers never lose power, but it’s hard to believe they can’t do better. If there is redundancy anyway, data centers ought to be using batteries or other storage as their first line of defense in an outage, reserving Tier IV for second-line backup and eliminating Tier II generators altogether. Typical lithium-ion batteries provide four hours of electricity, enough to cover most backup needs and still leaving room to help the grid meet peaks in demand. 
A (very) few operators are in fact doing this, but unless Virginia acts to require it, Big Tech has little incentive to prioritize clean backup power. The use of diesel generators offloads the true cost of backup power onto residents in the region, who pay in the form of worse health outcomes and a lower quality of life. Evidently that suits the tech companies just fine. 
While residents demand an end to the pollution, Virginia’s government has been going in exactly the opposite direction. This fall, DEQ amended a guidance document to allow Tier II generators to run more often. DEQ achieved this by changing the definition of “emergency” to include planned power outages, such as might occur when a utility schedules work on a substation that supplies electricity to a data center. 
DEQ cut some legally-questionable corners to get this change finalized two weeks before the end of Glenn Youngkin’s term as governor. When word got out, more than 500 people submitted comments online and by email, overwhelmingly opposed to easing generator restrictions. Only a small handful of commenters supported the change, mainly the data centers themselves and a couple of their chamber of commerce allies. 
DEQ didn’t respond to ordinary residents, but the letter it mailed to what seems to have been a select few commenters was unrepentant. DEQ did not even acknowledge the suggestions that it require batteries instead of allowing the increased use of the dirtiest diesel generators.
Pressure will now be on the General Assembly to tackle the issue. This session will likely see the reintroduction of legislation offered in 2024 and 2025 by Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, and Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, limiting or banning the use of diesel generators at data centers as part of larger bills addressing their energy use.
And this year a new Loudoun County Democrat, Del. John McAuliff, has introduced legislation requiring data centers to use storage as the first line of defense in emergencies, limiting Tier IV generators to emergency use when storage is exhausted, and removing the option of Tier II generators altogether. The bill also adds air monitoring and public notification requirements.
No doubt the data center lobby will resist these measures, as they have absolutely every initiative that would require them to shoulder the cost of their presence in Virginia. Their allies in the General Assembly will fret that requiring Amazon to prioritize cleaner alternatives to diesel generators might raise costs incrementally for a multinational company and its billionaire chief. 
That feels increasingly out of touch. In November a Virginia government report calculated that the data center industry received more than $2.7 billion in incentives over the past decade, thanks to Virginia taxpayers. 
It shouldn’t be any surprise that now the taxpayers would like a little consideration in return.

Wes Moore enters the legislative session that starts Wednesday — the last of his first term — facing a number of challenges but confident, and focused on the tasks that still need to be accomplished this year before the campaign begins in earnest.","Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) talks about the challneges of the 2026 legislative session during an interview in his office on Monday. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The 2026 General Assembly session was supposed to be a quiet one, after a 2025 session when lawmakers closed a $3.3 billion budget gap with a combination of one-time fund transfers, program cuts and $1.6 billion in tax increases.
Instead, Gov. Wes Moore (D) enters the legislative session that starts Wednesday — the last session of his first term — facing a number of challenges before his reelection campaign begins in earnest.
There’s a projected $1.5 billion budget deficit, the likely loss of federal jobs and federal funding as a result of Trump administration policies, tepid relations with lawmakers, a potential showdown over redistricting and ongoing threats to funding to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
But in the days leading up to the session, Moore has methodically rolled out his legislative priorities in a series of press conferences, on housing, education, crime prevention, economic development, health care and more.
When asked in a a wide-ranging interview Monday what signature initiative was a must-have for the last session of the term, the governor would only say there is “a lot that needs to be accomplished.”
“And I know that’s why I’m asking for a second term. There’s more work to be done,” he said. “I think the people of this state will know that I’ve kept my promises.

“That when I said that we’re going to focus on creating pathways to work, wages and wealth, that we’ve been able to get more people into the workforce. That we’ve been able to quadruple the amount of people in apprenticeship and trade platforms,” he said. “We signed the largest mass pardon in the history of the United States of America to get more people employed. We went from 43rd in the country in unemployment to, at one point, literally having the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.”
Despite that, he enters his fourth legislative session with slowly declining public approval.
Moore, the first Black man elected governor in Maryland and just the third nationally, entered office with approval ratings at or above 60%. Since 2024, those numbers have declined in polls by organizations including the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and the Annapolis-based Gonzales Poll. In a Gonzales poll released Tuesday, Moore’s overall approval rating was about 52%, but the gap between his approval and disapproval numbers is now 11 points, down from a robust 35 points earlier.
“I’m not a person who spends my time looking at poll numbers,” Moore said Tuesday. “I really like to spend time on things that actually matter to the people of our state, making sure we can make our state safer, making sure we can continue the historic drops in violent crime … that’s what I focus my time on.”
Inside the State House, Moore faces potentially cooler relations with lawmakers of his own party.
During a December special session, the Democratic super-majority legislature overrode more than a dozen bills vetoed by Moore including a bill to create a commission on reparations. Around the same time, he angered many lawmakers in his party by  announcing a campaign slate that could back primary challengers for those not seen as supportive enough of the governor’s agenda.
One item likely to test State House relations is the proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts, to counter Republican states that have redistricted to gain partisan advantage in hopes of retaining control of Congress in 2026. Moore and House leaders support the move, but the Senate appears dead-set against it.
Moore in November created a five-member advisory commission to study the current state maps for fairness — though he has never defined the term — and make a recommendation. The panel meets Friday and could potentially recommend a map to the legislature.

Moore said any legislation will come from the General Assembly, not from his office.
“This is not an administration bill,” he said Monday. “I’ve been clear about where my priorities are, but I’ve also been clear that it’s never the wrong time to fight for democracy.
“Once the commission makes the recommendations, they’ll send it to the Maryland General Assembly and then it’ll be in the hands of” lawmakers, he said.
That fight could pale, however, in the face of the newest budget deficit.
Moore and legislature leaders appear to agree that no additional taxes are likely this year.
Moore promised his upcoming budget will include a general fund proposal that is lower than the one in the current year budget.
Last year, Moore proposed a total budget of $63.7 billion — a 1% increase over the previous year, but that included a $27 billion general fund budget that was 1% smaller.
“I think that there are certain themes that people will be able to see from from this budget. One is, this is going to be the fourth budget in a row that I’ve introduced that’s not just a balanced budget, but that we are going to decrease the size of the general fund,” he said.
Moore did not elaborate on the size of the decrease, but another 1% reduction in the general fund would be a cut of about $270 million, or less than one-fifth of the projected fiscal 2027 deficit.
The governor said that while last year’s budget reflected “some of the greatest fears we had from the Trump-Vance administration,” this year’s budget will “reflect the greatest realities” of federal policy under President Donald Trump (R). Among those, the loss of 25,000 federal jobs in the state between January and November.
“We’re 25,000 a year in, OK? We’re a year in and I think that this is an administration that has shown they do not have respect for federal workers,” Moore said. “They don’t have respect for government. Their idea of fixing government is setting it on fire.”
And Moore said he expects more hits to come this year from an administration that “telegraphs their punches.”

“They have been telegraphing their punches from Inauguration Day, and they’ve been telegraphing the fact that that this assault on Maryland, this assault on our most vulnerable, this assault on our communities of color — they have been very clear about what they’re going to do, and they have given no indication that they are done,” Moore said. “In fact, the only indication we’ve gotten is that they’re just getting started.”
The state is also expecting federal funding to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge. But costs have grown from a rough estimate of $1.7 billion in the days immediately following the collapse to about $5.2 billion today.
U.S Transportation Department Secretary Sean Duffy has been critical of aspects of the project, raising concerns among some that the federal goverment will not come through with the 100% replacement costs approved by Congress under President Joseph Biden. Moore, who is scheduled to meet Thursday with Duffy, dismisses that threat.
“This is the fastest moving large project in the country,” Moore said, adding he was willing to work with the president and the federal government to move the project forward.
“This is America’s bridge when you think about its importance to the Port of Baltimore and its importance to commerce as a whole,” he said. “And so I’m looking forward to sitting down with the secretary to continue not just to make our case, but continue to show him, or just remind him, why Congress already had full faith in the work that we’re doing.”
The governor sidestepped questions about a contingency plan, should federal funding falter, saying he would continue to work with federal lawmakers if necessary.
“I’m just grateful that Congress provided the authorization, and we’re continuing to look forward to working with Congress to ensure that that stays stable,” Moore said.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)An award of $202 million has been announced for Ohio to combat hospital closures and a lack of access to health care in rural areas. The funding was welcomed by state leaders and advocates alike, but the funds are seen as a temporary fix to a problem made worse by federal cuts.
The five-year Rural Health Transformation Program — authorized under Republican lawmakers’ mega tax and spending cut package Trump signed into law in 2025 — is designed to offset the budget impacts on rural areas due to sweeping Medicaid cuts.
In Ohio, the Medicaid cuts from the federal spending bill amount to a loss of $33 billion over the next decade, according to an analysis by the healthy policy organization KFF.
A total of $50 billion is being spread out nationally through the Rural Health Transformation Program.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said the state was “grateful to be awarded this funding so that more Ohioans can receive expanded access and enhanced quality to necessary health care.”
Republican state Rep. Kellie Deeter, co-chair of the Ohio House Rural Hospital Caucus, said Ohio’s award is “consistent with the proposal submitted by the state, so this announcement largely reflects what was anticipated.”
“However, it is still not enough to offset broader federal cuts and therefore will not meaningfully help our rural hospitals,” Deeter said.
“The focus now should be on how these dollars are deployed to deliver real, sustainable improvements in rural health care — particularly for rural hospitals that lack access to certain publicly funded revenue streams.”

Democratic state Rep. Anita Somani had a similar critique, saying the funding was appreciated, but was “equivalent to treating a severed artery with a bandage.”
“These funds will not stop the bleeding caused by other federal cuts, and any attempt to imply otherwise is misleading,” Somani said.
The governor’s office said the state proposal focused on addressing barriers to health in those rural parts of the state, like access to specialty care, lowered health outcomes, and higher rates of chronic disease.
The money will be used to invest in school-based health centers in rural communities, expanding the state’s child vision care program called OhioSEE to rural communities, and further addressing Ohio’s infant mortality rate, according to DeWine’s office.
The state included costs in its proposal for the funding, estimating the program and initiative cost to be between $181.8 million and $252 million.
‘Pressing health care and socioeconomic needs’
In a “project narrative” compiled by the Ohio Department of Health as part of the application for the funding, state data showed 4.4 million Ohioans live in 73 counties that have the designation of fully rural or have a “significant rural footprint.”
The narrative mentions Ohio’s 74,000 farms and the more than 200 commodities grown in the state, including corn, soybeans, dairy, hogs, and poultry.
Rural counties also support manufacturing and forestry, along with tourism and recreation.
The Appalachian counties received a particular mention for “resource extraction,” a blanket term used when referring to fossil fuel drilling, timber collection, and other similar sectors.
“For many rural Ohioans, the land isn’t just scenery, it is livelihood,” the document stated.
The application documents from the state also lay out the challenges rural communities face when it comes to health care access, infrastructure support, income, housing, education and access to healthy foods.
“The story is consistent, rural Ohioans have strong ties to land and community, but also pressing health care and socioeconomic needs,” according to the state’s application.

A “chronic disease atlas” released by the state last summer found significant differences in health status and outcomes based on the region of Ohio in which those suffering from chronic disease live.
The research found chronic disease was more common in the southern counties of the state,  including and in addition to the 32 counties of the Appalachian region.
Chronic diseases noted in the area were arthritis, asthma, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
“High mortality rates for all chronic diseases combined, Alzheimer’s Disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease are also concentrated in southern counties,” the report stated.
Rural, non-Appalachian counties had high instances of diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, heart disease, and Parkinson’s Disease as well.
Those prevalence rates combine with a lack of regular visits to physicians, physical activity, health insurance, and insecurity when it comes to food and transportation, according to the state.
Ohio’s rural counties have 57 hospitals, with 33 categorized as critical access hospitals.
The designation was created by Congress decades ago, as hundreds of rural hospitals faced closure in the 1980s and 1990s.
According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hospitals are eligible to become critical access if they are currently participating in Medicare, or are health clinics or centers that downsized from acting as hospitals.

Medicare-participating hospitals can become critical access hospitals if they are in a rural area, are more than 35 miles from the nearest hospital, have no more than 25 inpatient beds and have an average length of stay of less than 96 hours per patient.
Rural health was struggling before the newest federal budget bill was signed into law last July, but Medicaid cuts and new rules in that budget had hospitals bracing for even more challenges and the potential for closures.
Since 2010, three rural hospitals have closed and the state said 10 more were at risk of closure.
“As of 2023, one in four rural hospitals in Ohio operated at a financial loss, and 18% were considered vulnerable for closure,” the state’s Rural Health Transformation Fund project narrative stated.
Doctors and advocates seeing the looming threat to rural health facilities feared for emergency and daily care of course, but the impact on an already fading number of maternity wards could also mean hard times for rural communities.
But only a small part of the funding states receive from the rural health fund – no more than 15% — can be used for direct payments to facilities like hospitals and clinics, according to an analysis by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
The rules for how the money can be used “could substantially limit how states are able to allocate awarded funding,” the foundation analysis stated.
Plus, the fund is meant to offset funding cuts to rural health, but it doesn’t match the rate at which the country’s rural hospitals and clinics are losing funding because of the federal budget bill.
“The fund doesn’t offset the cuts (to Medicaid funding and rural communities),” the foundation stated. “$50 billion (nationwide) for rural health is modest compared to the $137 billion in cuts to rural communities and nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding cuts.

Experts are watching the case, which could impact abortion access across the Midwest and South. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The outcome of a trial over Missouri’s abortion regulations could ripple far beyond the state, potentially creating new availability for women in the Midwest and South who can’t access abortion close to home.
As a judge weighs the constitutionality of a litany of state restrictions on abortion, the stakes are clear for Missouri women: The decision could hamper access for nearly everyone in the state — or greatly broaden it in ways not seen in decades. That would allow women in a dozen nearby states with abortion bans to travel a shorter distance to access the procedure.
“Opening and reestablishing rights in the state of Missouri would help to alleviate some of the pressure that other states have since so many Southern states have banned abortion,” said Julie Burkhart, the co-owner of Hope Clinic in Granite City, Illinois. “It just seems logical that we would see a shift in migration patterns of patients in the country.”
At her clinic, about a 15-minute drive from downtown St. Louis, Missourians account for about half of all patients, Burkhart said. Though Missouri voters in 2024 enshrined a right to abortion in the state constitution, access has remained highly limited because of restrictive state laws. Only procedural abortions are available on a limited basis across three Planned Parenthood clinics in the state.
Many of those state laws face legal scrutiny this week as a Missouri judge weighs the constitutionality of regulations targeting abortion providers. Those include a 72-hour waiting period between initial appointments and procedures, mandatory pelvic exams for medication abortions and a ban on telemedicine appointments for medication abortions.











It just seems logical that we would see a shift in migration patterns of patients in the country.


– Julie Burkhart, co-owner of Hope Clinic in Granite City, Ill., which provides abortion service to many out-of-state patients



Planned Parenthood affiliates in Missouri argue state restrictions are unconstitutional under 2024’s voter-approved constitutional amendment. Over decades, state restrictions have gutted Missouri’s provider networks, limited appointment availability and ultimately forced abortions to a halt in 2022, before a limited number resumed after the 2024 vote.
Experts and advocates are closely monitoring the Missouri case, which is expected to be appealed regardless of the outcome, because of its practical implications on access in the region. While many women now rely on abortion medication, procedural abortion is still crucial for those seeking later-term abortions or who prefer an in-clinic procedure.
But the two-week bench trial in downtown Kansas City also tests lawmakers’ ability to put in place rules so restrictive that they effectively ban abortion — a practice used by anti-abortion lawmakers in other states looking to limit access to the procedure.
“Judges do not operate in a vacuum,” Burkhart said, “ … and we know for a fact that judges look outside the borders of their state for information and for guidance. I do see this as having national importance.”
That’s especially true in other states also litigating abortion access, including Arizona, Michigan and Ohio, said Rebecca Reingold, an associate director at Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.
While state judges are not bound by the decisions of judges in other states, their deliberations can be informed by court rulings, particularly involving novel legal questions or areas of the law that are evolving.
“There is little doubt that advocates and decision-makers in other states navigating similar legal challenges are closely monitoring the litigation over Missouri’s abortion regulations,” Reingold said.
Restrictions targeting abortion
In the first days of the trial, Planned Parenthood leaders argued that ever-changing state laws and agency regulations have drastically limited access, caused needless red tape and posed privacy risk for their patients.
Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with St. Louis-based Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the Missouri requirements specifically target abortion rather than all other kinds of medical care.
“I provide vasectomies routinely. … And I am not required to have a complication plan, contact a primary care physician, even ask the patient how many miles they live from the health center.”
Opening day of Missouri abortion-rights trial focuses on decades of state restrictions

Baum said state-mandated reporting rules unique to abortion require clinicians to ask the race, education level, marital status and specific location of each patient — none of which is relevant to their care.
Planned Parenthood Great Rivers would like to offer abortion services in Springfield, Baum testified. Access in that region would provide an option for rural Missourians, and also could help serve residents in nearby Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, where abortion is almost universally banned.
But the organization’s facilities there do not meet state abortion regulations for physical attributes, including hallway size, doorway size and the number of recliners in recovery rooms, Baum testified.
Lawyers for the state defended Missouri’s restrictions as commonsense safeguards aimed at protecting vulnerable women. The attorney general’s office argued that complication risks of abortion justify additional state regulation — despite professional medical associations saying it’s generally safe. The AG’s office also maintained that Planned Parenthood faced a conflict of interest because of its financial motivations.
“Abortion is a business,” Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue said during a procedural argument on Monday. “Your Honor, the plaintiffs are asking to deregulate their profession in order to make more money.”
The state was expected to call as witnesses anti-abortion doctors and activists later in the trial.
Patients traveling for care
Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling that overturned federal constitutional protections for abortion in June 2022, the number of abortions has increased slightly across the country, according to the health research nonprofit KFF.
The group points to expanded telehealth, which can offer medication abortion more affordably through virtual appointments.
Women in states with abortion bans are the biggest users of abortion telemedicine

Since the 2022 ruling and subsequent state abortion bans, patients have experienced higher travel costs for abortions and delays in care, according to research published in the American Journal of Public Health in July.
Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco found that travel time to access abortion increased from 2.8 hours to 11.3 hours for residents in states with abortion bans. Travel costs increased from $179 to $372. And more than half of survey respondents said their abortion care required an overnight hotel stay, compared with 5% before an abortion ban.
In 2024, an estimated 7,880 Missourians traveled to Illinois and 3,960 traveled to Kansas to access abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
Those Missourians were among the approximate 155,000 people who crossed state lines to access abortion care that year, representing 15% of all abortions provided in states without total bans.
Ongoing uncertainty
Regardless of its outcome, the Missouri case is expected to be appealed. Even if the plaintiffs are ultimately successful, it may take a long time to restore care networks across the state, said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at the Guttmacher Institute.
“And that’s particularly the case when there are states that have a lot of legal uncertainty or restrictions coming into effect and then coming out of effect,” he said. “It’s not quick to open up a clinic. It’s not quick to even necessarily expand the kinds of services, or the kinds of the number of people that a clinic can see.”
Kimya Forouzan, the organization’s principal state policy adviser, said Missouri’s landscape is evidence that lawmakers can drastically curb abortion access without total bans. And despite an overwhelming vote to amend the constitution, legal battles can follow.
Even if the state’s laws are found unconstitutional, Forouzan said, lawmakers will likely still push anti-abortion measures. She noted that several bills have already been introduced in this year’s just-convened legislative session, and that Republican lawmakers are pushing a ballot measure to repeal 2024’s reproductive rights amendment.
“There’s very much a push to pass as many restrictions as possible and kind of see what happens later and how things shape up later. … Time will tell, but we do know that they’re still pushing forth restrictions,” she said.

(Getty Images)On Dec. 31, 2025, two decades of federal tax benefits for homeowners who install solar electric systems came to an end. Originally created in 2005 by Congress, the program provided for a tax credit (meaning the amount was directly subtracted from a homeowner’s federal tax bill) of 30% of the amount one invested in the installation of solar panels and the associated technology to connect them to the grid. For those who had the money to invest (or could borrow it easily) it was a tax benefit to middle class people like me. 
Admittedly, when we installed our first array of panels in 2009, the cost was such that even with the tax credit, and installing them ourselves (with the help of a brother-in-law electrical engineer) the payback stretched out 15 years. Eight years later, when the price of the panels had dropped by more than 50%, we put in another array on a second pole, out in the field in front of our house. (Putting them on the roof was impractical because of some beautiful shade trees that keep the house cooler in the summer.) Both times we essentially got a tax cut that eliminated our income tax liability for that year.
Going solar cut our summer electric bill to a negligible level, often under $30 per month. It also gave us the incentive to install a heat pump hot water heater when our gas heater died, and a “mini-split” heat pump as a back-up space heater. Being one of those frugal Yankees, since we built it in 1981 I’ve been heating the house mostly with firewood I cut here on the farm and the solar energy that comes through the windows and greenhouse on the south side of the house.  But going away to visit family in the winter required a more technologically sophisticated system, thus the heat pump. Both the water heater and mini-split qualified for energy conservation tax credits at that time. The mini-split cost a lot less to install than an oil or gas system.
All this, plus gradually converting all the lighting to LEDs, means our electric bill hasn’t really gone up despite our greater use of electricity. So now, in retirement, we have a house we can afford to keep comfortable without worry about the price of oil, gas, or the inevitable increases in the price of kilowatt hours.
But there was more we could do. After Congress decided in July to end the renewable energy tax credits, we contacted an installer about a battery backup. Out here in our rural neighborhood, near the end of the power lines, we experience outages often enough that either a generator or battery is necessary. The battery qualified for the 30% tax credits, so we opted for that, knowing it would have to be installed by Dec. 31.
Here we are in January, and no battery. Not because our installer couldn’t get the job done, but because our utility couldn’t get the paperwork done to approve our system before it was too late for the tax credit. For now, the project is on hold.  
The rationale behind eliminating the renewable energy tax credits, as expressed by President Donald Trump, is because they were created as part of the effort to address climate change, which according to his mind is a hoax. Never mind that energy tax credits help folks like us keep our utility bills affordable.
So instead, in his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, the Republican Congress deleted the residential solar credits, which were a direct benefit to homeowners and consumers, and replaced them with $40 billion (over 10 years) in new tax subsidies to the oil, gas, and coal industries (which already benefited from $2.6 billion annually in tax subsidies).  I guess the oil companies, all of which have reported billions in profits, needed more help than homeowners.
Yes, we homeowners were also costing the U.S. Treasury with our tax credits. Official estimates are that they would have cost $25 billion over the next 10 years, although up until recently the cost was much less. In 2023, it’s reported that 1.25 million homeowners took advantage of the credits, averaging about $5,084 per family and “costing” the Treasury $6.3 billion.
In the early years the cost to the Treasury of the solar credit was dramatically smaller, in large part because the panels were a lot more expensive. It wasn’t until very recently that the cost of solar panels dropped by something like 80%. When the cost dropped so much, the rooftop solar industry grew exponentially as did the workforce needed to install the systems. The tax credit simply injected additional momentum into an industry that has strong appeal to homeowners. It had the additional benefit of creating tens of thousands of jobs and adding billions of dollars to the economy at the local level where it does the most good.
So now we have energy policy that further biases a federal tax system against helping average middle-class homeowners cut their costs and become more energy independent. Thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, more federal tax subsidies go to already immensely profitable fossil fuel corporations.
You can decide if you think this is the right policy, but to me it feels like more government by the rich for the rich while the rest of us are ignored.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/rooftopsolar-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 05:58:34.366829

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Thousands of protesters turned out across Ohio on Saturday, days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis shot a protester there in the face, killing her. As the protests took place, advocates worked to organize responses to future ICE actions in the Buckeye State.
In Columbus, people turned out at the intersection of North Broadway and High Street, carrying signs and chanting condemnations of the shooting. 
A Columbus police officer said that Saturday protests there are routine. But where they normally draw crowds numbering in the dozens, he estimated Saturday’s to be about 300. 
Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said that large crowds also turned out to protest in Cleveland, Akron, and Youngstown.
They were protesting a masked ICE agent’s shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good. Good was behind the wheel of her SUV when the agent, Jonathan E. Ross, shot her from point-blank range.

Just after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and later President Donald Trump claimed that Good was trying to run over the masked agent. 
A New York Times analysis contradicted that claim. It displayed video evidence showing that Good was steering her vehicle away from the agent when he shot her.
The killing comes after an ICE supervisor in Ohio was accused last month of multiple violent attacks against his much-younger, noncitizen partner. They also follow the sentencing last year of another Ohio officer who extorted sex from a vulnerable immigrant who was in his care.
In Columbus, people lined the wet streets, carrying signs that said things like “Ice Out,” and “No Kings, No Thugs. Stop the Chaos, Cruelty, Corruption.” 
Many passing vehicles honked their horns in support of the protest. But one man driving a pickup pulled up, rolled down his window and said, “Kill them all.” Asked who he wanted to see killed, he repeated himself, rolled up his window and drove off. 
Many others, however, say they want to defend immigrants and others ICE is targeting. 
Izetta Thomas is a member of the Columbus Education and Justice Coalition. The group works for equity and justice in general. But it started working to protect immigrants after the Trump administration last year started rounding up people by the thousands.
“I don’t think our group came to the issue, the issue came to us,” Thomas said. 
“We have a number of students and parents and neighbors in Columbus whose freedoms and rights are at risk, who are being terrorized by military raids that are coming into our city and neighborhoods. Anything that happens in or outside the school doors is our business. And anything that happens in our neighborhoods impacts our students’ lives.”
Tramonte said that people across Ohio can call her group’s hotline — 419-777-HELP (4357) — to find groups near them that react to ICE raids and assist immigrants in other ways. She said people in Central Ohio can also reach out to the Community Response Hub.
Tramonte was asked if there were resources instructing citizens on how they can monitor and protest ongoing ICE operations legally and safely. She said the SALUTE system lays out the details observers should take down, and local groups know how to go about doing it.
But last week’s shooting in Minneapolis illustrates the risks, Tramonte said.
“The ‘safely’ part is where I’m getting caught up,” she said. “Because it’s supposed to be safe, but we’re seeing federal law enforcement act in ways that if local police acted that way, they wouldn’t be able to get away with it. Pulling people out of cars, walking up and shooting people in the face… ‘Safely’ the part where I’m getting hung up.”
Meanwhile, some parents are frustrated with the way Dublin City Schools dealt with ICE detentions near at least one of its campuses on the last day before Christmas break. 
They were part of an operation that resulted in more than 280 detentions in Central Ohio that week.

At least two took place about a tenth of a mile from Dublin-Scioto High School, and at least one student was reportedly detained.
Courtney O’Neil’s son is a freshman at the school. When she heard about the ICE arrests, she started calling around to Dublin schools to find out how widespread they were
“They denied it. They said this is a rumor. It’s not true. They’re not around our schools,” O’Neil said. “They said if it did happen, they had plenty of staff to see that students could get home safely.”
She said it was plain to her that those assurances were hollow.
“They’re targeting the parents,” she said of ICE. “They’re targeting the kids (who are) just trying to go to the schools and get an education.”
Asked to comment, Dublin City Schools spokeswoman Cassie Dietrich referred to a written statement the district issued on Dec. 22.
“No immigration enforcement officials were on Dublin City Schools property, no officials were inside our schools, and at this time, Dublin City Schools is not aware of any students being detained,” it said.
It added, “Through our communication with the Dublin Police Department, we have been informed that the only confirmed activity involved a traffic stop at the corner of Emerald Parkway and Hard Road, which was not connected to Dublin City Schools. Dublin Police have also shared that they did not participate in or direct any federal immigration enforcement related to this situation.”
Thomas, of the Columbus Education and Justice Coalition, said that her group, at least, would work to help immigrant schoolchildren and others.
“We’re working to protect our students and families,” she said. “It’s causing trauma. There are folks who are afraid to go to school. There are folks who are afraid to go to work. They are afraid of the authoritarian control that is being advanced by this administration. So we’re working together to do what neighbors do, and that is keep one another safe.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260110_121443-1-1024x509.jpg,,,2026-01-14 05:58:34.366829

Fracking is the process of injecting liquid into the ground at a high pressure to extract oil or gas.
The commission also voted to approve more than a dozen different areas of land to move forward to bidding for fracking. Some of the areas include 4,360 acres in Egypt Valley Wildlife Area, another 366 acres in Egypt Valley Wildlife Area, and 382 acres in Jockey Hollow Wildlife Area. 
Public hearing 
In a rare move, the commission held a public hearing before their commission meeting on Monday to discuss a new law that ups the term of a standard lease from three years to five years when leasing oil and gas rights. 
Ohio House Bill 308 passed at the end of 2024 and went into effect in March 2025. 
More than 20 people opposed to extending the fracking leases spoke out for more than an hour about the harmful effects of fracking. No one spoke out in support. People were limited to talking for three minutes and the commissioners had no comments after people offered public comment. 
“I think that high-pressure hydraulic fracturing (fracking) under public lands is a bad idea when it applies to a three-year lease for such activity, and it’s a worse idea for five-year leases,” said George Banziger, of Washington County.
“This kind of extractive activity will desecrate our valuable public lands for the current generation and for future generations by polluting air and water, drawing huge amounts of water from the watersheds that serve these public lands, adding service roads and truck traffic, and generating lots of toxic and radioactive waste.”
Ohioans have submitted almost 7,000 public comments asking the the commission to deny nominations to frack public land, said Cathy Cowan Becker, with Save Ohio Parks. 
“We don’t know if commissioners even read these comments,” she said. 
Becker hopes Ohioans can speak up regarding specific nominations at future meetings. 
“We are the people who own and use these public lands,” she said. “We deserve a real voice in what happens to them.”
Peter Maxwell said there is nothing more important to him than the preservation of the quality of water. 
“Fracking, or fracturing the Earth’s crust to extract natural gas, has other inadvertent and unavoidable consequences, including earthquakes and contamination of groundwater by the toxic chemicals injected into the voids,” said Maxwell, of Westerville. 
Linda New, of the Northeast Ohio Sierra Club, said Ohio’s state parks should be revered and protected by government agencies and officials. 
“Fracking under these publicly owned natural areas is unacceptable,” she said. “It’s irresponsible to allow this to happen for three years; extending a lease to five years is unconscionable.”
There were approximately 2,000 incidents associated with oil and gas wells in Ohio from 2015-2023, according to FracTracker Alliance — a nonprofit that collects data on fracking pipelines. 
There’s also evidence that shows increased exposure to fracking impacts health, in particular children’s health, including low birth weight, preterm births, congenital anomalies, and asthma, according to Yale School of Medicine. 
“We must care for the future of our children and grandchildren,” said Judy Smucker, of Third Act Ohioans. “May they continue to live and enjoy our public lands and parks.”
For the first time, commission Chair Theresa White took questions from the media after Monday’s meeting. 
“The public comments are one of the factors that are reviewed,” she said when asked about the board doing the opposite of what the public asked the commissioners to do. “It’s not the only factor. So we are considering all of the information that’s presented before us and really trying to weigh all of that information in one consolidated case with either a yes or no answer.”

(Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Defying the state GOP establishment, Northwest Ohio business owner Casey Putsch is going head-to-head with Vivek Ramaswamy to become the Republican nominee for governor. In a one-on-one interview, he discusses his goals, platform and prior comments made about the Holocaust.
Growing up building cars, Putsch had no idea that in 2026, he would be standing in front of a crowd of supporters.
The car designer said he is the working-class answer to the Ohio governor’s race —distinguishing himself as the everyman to frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy.
Putsch lives with his wife and daughter, plus a baby on the way, in Perrysburg. He went to Ohio State University and started the Genius Garage Educational Program, a nonprofit where he helps students build and restore cars.
Ramaswamy and his team declined to comment for this story.
Because the following conversation was 40 minutes long, it has been lightly edited for clarity, conciseness and length.
Trau: “Why did you decide that running for governor was something that you wanted to do?”
Putsch: “Well, the simple answer is, I looked around, and I saw options that I thought were in nobody’s best interest. Vivek, I’m not a fan. He seems to be a billionaire, and his entire track record shows that he cares about his own self-interest versus anybody else’s. He’s done very little in Ohio, so that just simply wasn’t right. As one ages, you have a family, you’re trying to build businesses, and you struggle, and you see the difficulties, you see what’s happening in government. When you look objectively at candidates in the future, and if you’re really not happy about it, well then, your one opportunity is to exercise our governmental right and run for office.”
Trau: “Your slogan: Saving Ohio. Can you explain to me what that means?”
Putsch: “Well, it’s multifactorial, but it means exactly what it sounds like. I don’t think any of the roads we are going down are in our best interest. Nobody really gets new jobs; there’s a tremendous amount of fraud going on. We get sold out to only billionaire interests, massive corporate interests that, frankly, just end up taking advantage of all the people of Ohio and our resources. It seems like Ohio needs some saving.”
Trau: “Saving from corruption or from interests that don’t align with everyday people?”
Putsch: “Yeah, all the above. My first and biggest and only interest is specifically the people of Ohio. Can you build a family? Can you build a community? Can you build a business? And can you believe in a future? Amy Acton, with the Democrats, she quit as health director. She locked down the state — that’s a non-option. Vivek, a billionaire, he didn’t go to school in Ohio. Heck, he took a scholarship from George Soros’ money. He has no businesses in Ohio. He’s done no philanthropic work in Ohio despite his massive wealth — just runs for office. Heck, he could have been indulged and made the future great and saved the United States trillions of dollars.
That’s how I know that we’ve got a campaign that’s going somewhere, partially because the people, the support and the outreach are frankly unbelievable. Truth be told, this is incredibly risky for me in every way, shape and form. Politics is a horrific, dirty world. No, this was not on my life bingo card.”
Trau: “Typically, governors will have a main focus throughout their administration. What do you think yours would be?”
Putsch: “We’re being sold out to billionaire interests. The data centers, massive concerns, OK? They have tax abatements for 10 to 15 years, nothing coming in. We’re subsidizing the costs through the electricity because they suck the same amount of power as small towns. The environmental impact on our freshwater, our aquifers, our lakes, our streams, that’s horrific. We have been sold out, but people didn’t expect it. You have to have a leader who can be firm against things like that.
It’s realizing the resources we have from natural resources, natural gas, to coal, to building power-dense energy in the future, so it’s good for all. If tech wants to come here with data centers, well, they’re going to have to do it in a way that rises to the tide for everybody, and it becomes a net gain and not just a leech for the people of Ohio and a resource like it’s set up now. Bring back the manufacturing to the cities and the towns that want it and need it.
[My business,] we’ve worked very hard to pick up where the American educational system leaves off, and in doing that for the 11 years, I’ve seen exactly at the root cause of why it’s failing, from the financial model to how it’s looked at to the government, even K through 12. We can simply fix that as well.”
Trau: “What do you make of the current funding structure for public schools? Do you think that we are doing right by public schools right now? What do you think about the private school voucher system?”
Putsch: “There needs to be full transparency to all of the public in terms of what’s actually being taught in the curriculum, even if for no other reason than we need to have that for the trust of the public to make sure there’s nothing weird going on, and I don’t mean that as a partisan thing. If you have any institution, and in that circumstance, public schools where there’s no competition, and their funding is basically guaranteed, whether it’s from the government or people, then they’re going to naturally become worse. They’re not going to have to compete. I know you want a specific answer relating to the voucher system, but as a general rule of thumb, competition’s good. The people deserve the power to know what’s right, to know that weird curricula are not happening.
So with regard to education, all of my policies will relate specifically from the government down to the schools are accountable for actually creating the right curriculum. Some things can be solved with money, but many things cannot. We’ve got to support our teachers. They’re the most valuable thing. If we don’t, they’re gone.”
Trau: “To pivot, do you feel like you’re facing an uphill battle because the GOP already had a uniquely early endorsement of Vivek Ramaswamy before you actually even got into the race? The endorsement comes with financial and logistical benefits. Are you worried about that?”
Putsch: “Actually, no. I could understand why you asked the question; it’s a great question. I think most people would look at it just at a cursory glance and think that, but the truth about what’s happening is what you said — money. All of this is literally only about money. They’re already dumping tens of millions of dollars, more money toward Vivek than what a primary normally costs, because what’s happening is they’re trying to simply buy it out across the board.
The tide has shifted real fast because the cracks in Vivek’s facade have shown, and everybody knows this is only about establishment and money. Vivek’s interests are not that of Ohio. They do seem to be globalists. They seem to be only in the interest of billionaires to sell us out to corporations, and that’s also seen with his personal actions in the past. The people are behind me, and the truth of the matter is that at the end of the day, the only endorsement that matters is a person when they go in the polling booth.”
Trau: “Do you think it’s fair to Ohioans that they really didn’t get a Republican primary prior to a lot of these endorsements?”
Putsch: “No, it’s not fair at all. It’s undermining our governmental system. It’s not fair to all of us.”
Trau asked him to address his lieutenant governor pick. Putsch didn’t disclose any details at the time of the interview, as he was announcing his running mate the following day. He chose Kim Georgeton, from Cincinnati, who previously ran unsuccessfully in the GOP primary against U.S. Rep. Dave Taylor for Congress. Putsch did, however, say that Ramaswamy’s choice — Senate President Rob McColley — was an “establishment swamp creature that has nobody’s interest in mind.”
Trau: “Let’s talk policy. Where do you stand on marijuana reform?”
Putsch: “Personally, I don’t like marijuana. I think it’s just another thing that distracts people from making a good future. I believe in freedom and in regard to looking at that though, it just comes down to objectively what’s in the best interest of all the people in the state, and I’ll be deferring to others to make that judgment.”
Trau: “But as governor, you would have a say.”
Putsch: “Of course, I have a say. I don’t like it, but I’m going to do what is in the best interest of all the people of the state first and foremost.”
Trau: “Does that include following the will of the voters, or? What does that mean?”
Putsch: “The best interest of everybody in the state is so that they can have a pursuit of happiness, and that with anything in the industry, there are massive ripple effects. We have to look at that objectively. The reason I don’t answer that question specifically for you right now is I need to look objectively with everything that’s going on and make sure that everything is simply in the best interest of the people.”
Trau: “Where do you stand on abortion?”
Putsch: “Abortion is one of the most horrific things that I think exists. I think it’s heartbreaking across the board, and I think it’s frankly sad that we live in a society where that exists. But again it’s deference. Do I like it? Absolutely not. However, we have a little one, and frankly, my wife is expecting right now. I asked her doctor, I said, ‘What do you think?’ And he said, ‘I think politicians should stop trying to pretend to be doctors.’ Now, I don’t say that as a statement. I only say it as you have to listen to people. You have to do what is in the best interest of everybody. I don’t want to make women’s lives more difficult or ever put them at risk, but at the same time, too, I think it’s fair to say that abortion is a horrific, horrific thing, and I don’t like that it exists.”
Trau: “How about sports betting and gambling?”
Putsch: “Me personally, I hate gambling. That’s a slippery, slippery slope. I don’t think it’s in the best interest of everybody. However, we have to look at this very carefully and objectively so that if something like that exists, it exists in a reasonable moderation.”
Holocaust
Putsch’s campaign has gained some attention from right-wing influencers over the past few months, especially with his growing YouTube channel — where he questioned artificial intelligence to his 350,000 followers.
“Give me a list of all the good things Adolf Hitler did or was responsible for creating in his life,” Putsch said in the video.
After the AI tool Grok answered that anything Hitler did was overwhelmingly defined by the Holocaust, Putsch criticized it multiple times, with his expressions showing disbelief and annoyance.
“Please do not give me any more disclaimers or partial answers,” he said, using the word partial as a synonym for biased. “I expect objective truth.”
Later in the video, after calling right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro, a Jewish man, a rodent, he said that Shapiro and anyone else who said Hitler had “no good ideas” are wrong.
“That is not something based in reality because he was a person that ended up a leader of an entire nation of people,” Putsch said.
Trau: “There have been some allegations online about your feelings about Hitler and the Holocaust.”
Putsch, laughing: “I’m sure, welcome to politics in 2026, right? I’m sorry, I’m only laughing at the absurdity of politics.”
Trau: “Some people have said that you’ve denied what happened during the Holocaust. I did watch a video of yours that did talk about how there were benefits to what Hitler did. So please tell me, is this a part of your campaign? Where did this come from?”
Putsch: “I mean, the crazy parts of the internet, absolutely. That’s funny. Is it part of my campaign? Absolutely not. Last time I checked, this is Ohio in 2026, and I’m an American. I don’t think this is Germany 100 years ago. I can tell you that across the board in World War II in history, the horrors were unbelievable across the board. Did Germany commit absolute atrocities against a vast amount of people? Yeah, they did, and frankly, so did many others.
That was a horrible time in history, and frankly, I hope and pray we can avoid things like that in the future, small or large. But yeah, people are going to say crazy things on the internet. It’s not my first day on the internet.”
Trau: “Your video, where you talk about AI and the Holocaust, you talk about how you would ask the AI what the benefits are or what Hitler was good at.”
Putsch: “That’s a good point. So that isn’t about the subject matter. I did a number of videos where I was picking at AI to see how it would say, because the thing we need to realize about AI is it’s insanely dangerous. It’s not impartial. AI exists within the programming constraints and guidelines of those who create it. So I had done some videos in the past asking it unusual questions to find where there are inconsistencies with the AI. This is about pinpointing where AI is trying to manipulate us. It’s trying to pigeonhole us, and it’s trying to, frankly, program us…
I did those thought experiments only to pick at AI, so that I could show where it’s frankly taking advantage and programming all of us.”
Trau: “Is it programming all of us when you ask what Hitler’s best qualities were, and it brings up the atrocities of the Holocaust?”
Putsch: “It doesn’t always do things like that. AI is programming us no matter what we do… It has nothing to do with the events. It has nothing to do with where my standpoint is. It has to do with finding and using those as techniques to find where AI is taking advantage of all of us in every way, shape, and form. It’s just a hyperbolic way to do it.”
Online hate
Ramaswamy has not engaged directly with Putsch, but in a guest essay for the New York Times, he did say there was no room in the conservative movement for people who thought Hitler was “cool.” He also condemned the racist comments he faced online, many from a faction of users called “groypers.”
Trau: “Vivek Ramaswamy is leaving social media. He also talked about the influx of racism against him. Some Republicans talk about bots. What do you make of the groypers?”
Putsch: “I’d say the first thing is, ‘Hey, put on your big boy pants, Mr. Billionaire, you can’t take it?’ He wanted to group everybody into a corral, because if you don’t like Vivek Ramaswamy, it’s because you’re a racist, terrible person and not because Vivek Ramaswamy is actually a garbage candidate who clearly doesn’t care about the people of Ohio or America, and it’s kind of a globalist corporate billionaire interest. No, no, ‘it’s because you’re racist.’ That was a tactic. He got backlash. It’s just a tactic by somebody who’s already losing.”
Once again, Ramaswamy and his team declined to comment. His accounts, however, continue to face an onslaught of slurs consistently from many accounts associated with the right-wing.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Since last summer, Casey Rollins has braced for the day that children of Haitian immigrants would walk into the Catholic charity she runs without their parents.
That day has arrived.
First, one group of siblings. The next day, another. In one week last month, nine children whose parents were no longer in the country came in with their extended families.
Rollins and other advocates for immigrants fear these are the first cases in a looming avalanche of family separations that could overwhelm this city of about 60,000 in a central Ohio county that has in recent years absorbed an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 immigrants, many of them Haitians.
Rollins has worked closely with Haitian immigrants since becoming executive director of Springfield’s St. Vincent de Paul at the end of 2016. At first, the Catholic charity focused on providing language assistance to Haitian Creole speakers. Then she connected them to the charity’s thrift store for the warm clothing they would need to endure winter in Ohio and furniture and appliances to set up their new homes. The community center also offered computer access for them to apply for work permits and look for jobs in one of the companies that were drawn to the area by state economic incentives, like the massive Amazon warehouses and distribution centers in neighboring counties.
Employers specifically recruited Haitian workers via staffing agencies for hard-to-fill positions, their ads touting above-minimum-wage pay and benefits, luxuries for immigrants coming from a country ravaged by decades of political turmoil and a pair of earthquakes that killed and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Arrivals in Springfield ticked up during the COVID-19 pandemic as more people emigrated from Haiti after the president was assassinated and violence worsened. Others came from big cities with deeply rooted Haitian communities, like Miami and New York, drawn by the promise of well-paying jobs in an affordable community that seemed to want them there.

The city of Springfield, Ohio, which is home to thousands of Haitian families, is scrambling to get ready for mass deportations that will likely leave many children without their parents. (Photo by Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
Then, during last year’s presidential election, Springfield’s Haitians became the target of a maelstrom of misinformation after someone posted online that they were eating their neighbors’ pets. President Donald Trump amplified the lie, as did Vice President JD Vance, who grew up an hour’s drive away, in Middletown, Ohio. Neither the city nor its newest arrivals could stop or control what came next. Neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups like Blood Tribe and Patriot Front disrupted community events and staged protests in front of City Hall and the mayor’s house. Phoned-in bomb threats forced the temporary closure of schools. In February, the city of Springfield and targeted individuals sued Blood Tribe over its intimidation campaign. Rollins, who lives across the street from the mayor, is one of the other plaintiffs.
It’s almost as if the threats and volatility only fueled and refocused Rollins, who does not accept a salary for her work. As the world around the Haitians in Springfield changed, the types of services offered by St. Vincent de Paul shifted, too — from helping them establish a life in the city to navigating the Trump administration’s immigration policies that threaten their ability to legally stay in the country.
On the day of his inauguration, Trump issued an executive order — “protecting the American people against invasion,” he called it — setting the tone for what was to come. He has since attempted to move up the expiration date of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which allows people from Haiti and other designated countries facing conflict or natural disaster to live and work in the United States for a set period of time. He also terminated a Biden-era program known as humanitarian parole, urging immigrants protected by it to self-deport and revoking their ability to work. (These and other pieces of his immigration measures have been challenged in court.)
There were 210,000 Haitians in the United States on humanitarian parole as of late last year. There are currently some 330,000 Haitians in the country with TPS, including thousands in the Springfield area. As things stand, the deadline for them to leave the country is February 3.
Over the summer, as immigration agents moved to detain and deport immigrants all across the United States, sometimes to countries that are not their own, Rollins and others at St. Vincent de Paul used every opportunity available to them to tell Haitian parents to get their U.S.-born children American passports.

Casey Rollins says nine children in two days have shown up with their immigrant parents already gone and in need of custody arrangements when there are only 17 foster families in all of Springfield. (Photo by Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
“If the child has a passport and the parents have to take the child with them, or have to give the child to a family in a different country — say they have to send them to a family member in Chile, or they have to take them to Chile — well, the child can’t travel to Chile without a passport,” she said.
The passports are also proof of U.S. citizenship, a critical shield at a time when even U.S. citizens are being caught in Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Rollins’ efforts soon bumped up against complications: a father has gone back to Haiti and is not present to sign the paperwork, a missing birth certificate must be ordered for a child born in another state. She also had to contend with the emotional ups-and-downs prompted by the helter-skelter nature of immigration policy implementation and shifting program end dates, she said.
The Haitians she works with, “keep thinking that there’s going to be a Hail Mary moment,” Rollins said. “They just have this unbelievable faith — I wish my faith was as strong as theirs is … But at the same time, I wish their faith was a little bit more pragmatic. Maybe they know better, and it is all going to work out. I hope to God they’re right. But I’m looking at this thinking, ‘No, let’s be ready. Let’s be ready for whatever comes.’”

Rollins is now preparing for a worst-case scenario that may be all but inevitable.
“I’m the town crier, literally and figuratively. That’s all I seem to do these days,” Rollins told The 19th during a recent interview. She was sitting at a table at St. Vincent de Paul, shading in this year’s Christmas card featuring her seven grandchildren — or, as she put it, the “seven little activists” who “go out on picket lines with me.” The cards often get political. Last year’s theme was “love thy neighbor” and featured Santa Claus looking out the window of the community center at a line of immigrants waiting to get in, drawn over a collage of headlines about Springfield’s Haitian residents. This year’s states: “I need to be able to tell my grandchildren that I did not stay silent.”
She dabbed at her eyes as she talked, wondering what might happen to the Haitian parents she has come to know and, most of all, wondering what might happen to their children.
On a recent Thursday, the local NAACP chapter convened a town hall at a Baptist church with the theme “preparation for mass deportations.” The seats were nearly full, and people stood in the back of the nave, lining the walls. Security was heavy; three police cars parked out front. NAACP President Denise Williams introduced a panel that included Rollins; Viles Dorsainvil, director of the Haitian Community Help and Support Center; Carl Ruby, a local pastor whose congregation is heavily invested in assisting local immigrants; and key city officials: Mayor Rob Rue, City Manager Bryan Heck, Police Chief Allison Elliott and Clark County Health Commissioner Chris Cook.

When it was her turn to speak, Rollins leaned into the microphone and introduced herself. “Hello. I’m Casey Rollins, and I’m a servant leader at St. Vincent de Paul. I am part of a ministry that is from all over the world.” She felt a pit in her stomach.
At St. Vincent de Paul, she noted, the “number one priority for us is always the children — always, always, always, think of our children.” Then, she laid out what has been obvious to her since the summer: The deportation of Haitian parents may very likely result in a “child custodial dependency crisis in this town, in this state, in this country.” Because parents may be deported after a raid, without the chance to decide whether to bring their children when they leave the country. And because they may choose to leave their children behind to give them a shot at living a safer, more stable life in the United States. For many of these kids, this is their country.
She explained that she and the workers at St. Vincent de Paul had already helped Haitian immigrants obtain passports for their U.S.-born children, sometimes at a rate of three to four a day. But, she said, the passports wouldn’t be enough.
A ripple went through the crowd when Rollins told them about the nine children who had come to St. Vincent de Paul after their parents’ deportations. There were audible gasps. When it came time for questions, nearly every one of them was about the children.
Cook added that there are more than 1,300 children in Clark County who have been born to Haitian parents in the last few years alone, meaning all of them would be citizens. The number is likely far higher, plus thousands of children who emigrated from Haiti and more who were born in another country during their parents’ immigration journey.
“The volume of need for this service far exceeds the service we’re able to provide,” Rollins cautioned. “Please, please, bear with us all as we cry a lot, as we rage a lot. Feel free to do that with us. Come see us if you’d like to be a part of this initiative and this effort.”

Volunteers packed 1,200 Christmas food baskets this week, some of which will be delivered directly to Haitian families. (Photo by Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
From a legal standpoint, assisting minors remaining in the country without parents may require action in two different court systems: family and immigration. Children who are U.S. citizens will need legal guardians to sign paperwork for passports and other documents and to handle routine matters like school enrollment and doctors’ visits. Many will need to pursue a type of guardianship that is triggered by an emergency event, like a deportation or detainment, in order to maintain custody of their children while they are still here.
Noncitizen children will also need guardians — and they will have their own immigration cases to contend with.
Rollins and others assisting Haitian families want to find a way to avoid a potentially chaotic period when decisions cannot be made on a child’s behalf because they don’t yet have a legal guardian. To succeed, they need to find lawyers to take cases that touch both court systems.
Rollins — a 66-year-old from a large Irish Catholic family who taught school for 34 years and educated many of Springfield’s leaders — is a woman of faith who also believes in the power of community. That’s what she’s leaning on these days.
About two weeks ago, a juvenile court magistrate texted her a photo of the business card for Bridget Emiko Jackson, a family court lawyer who was just telling the magistrate that she wanted to take on more immigration cases. Within minutes of receiving the text, Rollins and Jackson were talking on the phone.
“I couldn’t get out of the courthouse parking lot before I heard from Casey,” Jackson said. “Next thing I know, I’m working on a presentation.”
Jackson is putting the finishing touches on a series of slides that lay out what a legal process could look like to assist children with guardianship. A friend and former law school classmate she now practices alongside has jumped in to assist. Their goal is to have it ready for potential funders, volunteers, other lawyers, community groups and relevant government agencies as early as this week.

Casey Rollins talks with Lou Ann Horstman of Springfield Neighbors United at Groceryland in Springfield, OH on December 11, 2025. (Maddie McGarvey for The 19th.)
Rollins knows there will need to be many more people like Jackson to handle the number of guardianship cases that will very likely arise under the current climate — and if the February deadline for the end of TPS holds. She keeps hundreds of informational sheets about filling out child passport applications and creating family immigration raid emergency plans on the long table just past St. Vincent de Paul’s front doors. Two volunteers spent last week fully focused on immigration matters as others began to pack 1,200 Christmas food baskets. Some will be hand-delivered to Haitian families.
She noted that already, people have reached out to help, at times “transcending their politics.” Groups like Springfield Neighbors United, a critical partner in the passport effort, and G92 have formed to help the cause. Leaders from the Nation of Islam are working in concert with Catholic nuns. Rollins hasn’t always agreed with the city’s elected leaders, but works with them closely because, she said, “I believe in people who believe in people.”
And she is choosing to believe in the underlying goodness of the people of Springfield, where she grew up, married, worked and raised her son. She is choosing to believe they will not let their Haitian neighbors down.

Speaking to a joint session of the House and Senate, Kelly listed a familiar litany of her accomplishments (restoring fiscal stability, balancing budgets, funding schools, bringing new jobs to the state) while celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs’ move across the border from Missouri. Yet reading the speech closely, one could detect a note of regret here and there, a touch of sadness.
For the fact is, Kelly’s tenure was defined as much by what she prevented than what she accomplished.
Republican leaders would have slashed education spending, doubled down on the failed economic agenda of former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, done even more damage to LGBTQ+ youths. Kelly slowed or stopped much of this retrograde agenda. But next year, someone else will be giving the state of the state address, and Kansas will have entered a new era.
“If you think about the last decade in America, the speed of change we’ve endured is staggering,” Kelly told the crowd. “We now live our lives attached to devices. It’s now how we do business, how we keep up with the news, how we talk to our coworkers and our friends, even our own grandchildren.
“And in the midst of it all, we also survived a global pandemic, only to return to a world changing even faster — with remote work, AI bots, and cars that drive themselves.”
Ah, the pandemic. Kelly had scarcely a year in office before COVID-19 scrambled her plans. Medicaid expansion, one of her top priorities on the campaign trail, gave way to the urgent necessity of keeping Kansans alive as a deadly virus swept across the state. Lawmakers like former Sen. Mark Steffen, R-Hutchinson, made political hay of the confusion.
Years after the pandemic were distinguished by huge federal recovery spending, which brought its own conflicts and controversies. Kelly won a second a term, thanks to the a lackadaisical campaign by then-Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who is now a congressman. But an enduring GOP supermajority limited her options, and she doubled down on economic development as her signature accomplishment.
Kelly had perhaps hoped to begin a new era of bipartisanship and collaboration with Kansas Republicans. Instead, they badmouthed her from the beginning, claiming she didn’t have a mandate. Her final state of the state touched on this as well.

“Instead of representing their communities, elected officials turned into foot soldiers for their political parties — firing off insults and vitriol to score likes or follows or wins for their team instead of doing what’s right for their constituents,” she said. “It’s as if they checked their free will at the door and just did as they were told. Treating their own colleagues in such angry and dehumanizing ways, just because they’re in the other party.
“And the most frightening part — it’s now become the new normal. An accepted part of political discourse. Well, I reject it. We must all reject it.”
You can see Kelly’s trademark soft touch here: She uses the plural “parties” as though she’s referring to both Democrats and Republicans. Anyone who has watched Kansas politics since 2018 knows the latter bears the lion’s share of the blame here. It’s not even close. Kansas Republican Party officials have turned blind eyes to shocking rhetoric in their pursuit of political power.
In some ways, Kelly reminds me of a president with close Kansas ties, Barack Obama. Like her, Obama ran for office as someone who transcended partisanship. However, once he moved into the executive suite, he found that Republican opponents had decided to face him with all their collected fury.
Obama spent eight years as president attempting to collaborate across the aisle. Instead, Republicans operatives such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner channeled dark currents in their own party to prevent progress.
Their work bore fruit, eventually, with the election of Donald Trump, a crude and bombastic would-be authoritarian.
Let’s hope that Kansas leaders leave us a better legacy after Kelly’s tenure.
She summed up her legacy Tuesday night: “I did not get elected governor — twice — by screaming the loudest or bullying others to get my way. Quite the opposite, I’m here because Kansans were looking for someone who would turn the volume down, to do more listening than yelling, to bring people together, to compromise, and govern from the middle.”
Kelly stood against feckless partisans and should be commended for her steadfastness. She remains in office throughout the year, and who knows what surprises await. But her plans for Kansas, and her theory of politics, saw only partial fulfillment over the past decade. If only government worked the way she suggests.

(Getty Images file photo.)The acreages that make up the Wayne National Forest in Southeastern Ohio are a patchwork of land parcels which lie in 12 Ohio counties.  
In the 1800s, the region was heavily logged to supply wood for 46 charcoal furnaces used for iron smelting. Farming also damaged the landscape as the remaining areas were cleared for agriculture, causing destructive soil erosion. 
Nature, time, and help from the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s helped restore the second-growth forests we see today. 
Sadly, the oil and gas industry is seeking to frack parcels within the wooded areas, possibly destroying the vibrant mesophytic ecosystem that has evolved over the last nearly 100 years. 
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be accepting oil and gas leasing applications in September 2026 for 41 oil and gas parcels, totaling 2,795 acres. These parcels of the Wayne are located in Monroe and Washington Counties. 
Currently, they are seeking public input (written comments) pertaining to the 2026 lease sale. These comments are due on Jan. 15, 2026 and can be submitted via the Bureau of Land Management site.
More than 85% of Ohio forests are privately owned, making the Wayne National Forest very important for Ohio residents and non-residents. 
This forest remains a sanctuary for people who need an escape from their hectic lives.

Visitors find peaceful settings, as well as spaces for recreating, bird watching, and fishing in the natural environment provided by the Wayne. 
There are hundreds of miles of hiking trails, horse riding trails, mountain biking trails, and off-road vehicle trails. Over a quarter million visitors find their way to the Wayne every year. 
The Little Muskingum River flows through the middle of the Marietta Unit of the forest. 
It “has an exceptional warmwater quality designation” and species like the rare river otter and the state endangered Ohio lamprey make their homes in the river. 
Additionally, the Wayne is critical habitat for the eastern hellbender salamander, a species which has been proposed for listing as an endangered species. 
When speaking of fracking in Ohio’s State Parks in 2024, then-state Rep. Don Jones said, “You will never know where fracking has occurred”. I strongly disagree. 
I live in Harrison County, one of the most fracked areas of Southeastern Ohio. 
Well pads and fracking infrastructure have taken over the rural landscape. 
Examining areas around the towns of Scio, Cadiz, and Jewett via a satellite image with Google Maps reveals over 179 well pads in the county. 
These appear like small white squares on the Google landscape map, but if you zoom in on these pads, you will see some of the infrastructure associated with fracking; large storage containers, wells, compressors, roads, and often the outline of pipelines crossing through the areas. 
These well pads are not reclaimed because many times wells are often re-fracked. 
What was once a region of rural beauty has become an industrial zone, as fracking eats away at the wooded hills like metastatic cancer. 
Fracking significantly impacts forests, as land is altered for well pads, roads, pipelines, and other infrastructure. 
Research shows that up to 19 acres per well pad is needed for gathering lines. In addition to gathering pipelines, there are transition pipelines, and distribution pipelines, as well as roads to the well pads. 
The construction of this infrastructure results in clearcutting of the forested area, which leaves gaps in the forest canopy. Think of it as death by a thousand cuts. 
The Halliburton loophole legislation of 2005 exempted natural gas drilling from most federal regulations created to protect human health and the environment. 
Companies are exempt from disclosing the chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing but an EPA assessment reported there were at least 1,606 chemicals used in fracking that could impact drinking water. Leaks, spills, and runoff from operations threaten groundwater and surface water quality, impacting aquatic ecosystems. 
Billions of gallons of radioactive waste brine are generated by the industry. 
This brine, although toxic in nature, is exempt from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 
Every day “brine” tankers travel through fracked communities to deliver the toxic brew to Class II injection wells. 
Fracking the Wayne, especially in the Washington County region, could mean more Class II wells for an area already dealing with well contamination issues from brine infiltration into production wells.

The process of high-pressure hydraulic fracking requires 1.5-16 million gallons of water per well.
In Ohio, a facility is allowed to withdraw surface water in the amount of “up to two million gallons per day in any thirty-day period without first obtaining a permit from the chief of the division of water resources under section 1521.29 of the Revised Code.” 
Ohio saw record droughts in the summers of 2024 and 2025. 
Counties where fracking is ongoing experienced extreme and exceptional droughts in 2024.  
Withdrawing water from streams decreases volume, increases pollution concentrations, increases water temperatures, decreases dissolved oxygen, and affects the pH, making streams less habitable for aquatic organisms.
Surface water will no doubt be withdrawn from the local streams in the Wayne National Forest. 
Fracking creates air pollution that can seriously impact wildlife. 
A Colorado study revealed that exposure to air pollution from fracking could cause neurological problems, respiratory diseases, and cancer in wild animals. 
Some of the compounds released during fracking include benzene, a known carcinogen, as well as xylenes and nitrogen oxides. 
Studies show these compounds can cause cancers, particularly if exposure occurs within a 0.5-mile radius of a well pad. 
There are additional issues that will impact the rural area that makes up the Wayne National Forests. 
The hydraulic fracturing process requires 2,300 to 4,000 truck trips per well. Many of the roads in rural areas are not built to withstand the amount and weight of these trucks and additional traffic has resulted in an increase in vehicular accidents. 
Anthropogenic noise from fracking reduces habitat quality and interferes with communication for species that rely on acoustic communication. 
The bright lights on the drilling rigs and pads can significantly impact birds, especially during migration. 
A 2020 study shows “shale oil and gas production reduces subsequent bird population counts by 15%, even after adjusting for location and year fixed effects, weather, counting effort, and anthropic land-use changes.” 
Ohio’s Republican legislature and Gov. Mike DeWine sacrificed our state parks to fracking during a lame duck session in 2022. 
Without any public comment period, our parks were opened up for fracking. 
Now our only national forest and the rural communities surrounding it will become a new sacrificial zone. 
The BLM says on its page, “The preliminary parcel list is not subject to protests or appeals.” 
Does this mean Ohio’s citizens have no recourse? 
At the very least, we need to let our concerns be known to the Bureau of Land Management. 
Allowing our natural resources in Southeast Ohio to be exploited to supply power for data centers or to be exported out of the country is not ecologically or economically sustainable for our region.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2203750670-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 04:57:50.875967

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator via SouthWings)The Atalco refinery in Gramercy will receive federal funding to produce more critical minerals under a new agreement between its Bermuda-based owners and the U.S. Department of Defense.
The partnership includes a $450 million investment that will allow the facility to produce gallium, a soft metal used in semiconductors, and to ramp up its refinement of aluminum oxide, a feedstock mineral used to make finished aluminum, according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development.
The plant is expected to produce over 1 million metric tons of alumina per year and up to 50 metric tons of gallium per year under a new agreement between the U.S. government and Atalco’s owner, Concord Resources Holdings Ltd., a firm domiciled in Bermuda with offices around the world.  
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

The investment includes $150 million in funding from the Defense Department. Concord and its majority shareholder, Pinnacle Asset Management, will invest another $300 million in private equity and expects to receive more federal funding, according to a separate news release from the company.
“For the past decade, our investment philosophy has centered on bolstering the U.S. supply chain for critical minerals and other commodities,” said Jason Kellman, Pinnacle’s chief investment officer. “This strategic partnership plays an important role in strengthening our country’s critical minerals supply.”
The new additions to the plant are expected to create 500 new jobs, according to the company’s press release.
Atalco, which also goes by Atlantic Alumina, is the only remaining alumina refinery in the U.S
and has been the subject of investigative reports by the Illuminator over a series of toxic waste discharges state and federal inspectors have documented for the past year. 
Under one of its related enterprises, Concord mines the rust-colored mineral bauxite from Jamaica and ships it to the Atalco facility in Gramercy, where it is refined into a white aluminum oxide powder called “alumina.” The powder is then sold to metal smelters that turn it into finished aluminum metals and alloys.

(Here are Parts One and Two.)
It looks at the law’s treatment of municipal and regional housing growth plans, including what happened to H.B. 5002’s “fair share” proposal; opportunities for development; and an agenda for the General Assembly in 2026. 
At the outset we wish to be clear that as attorneys we represent affordable housing developers, proponents, and advocates who seek to create more affordable housing. However, in ways explained below, we believe the new Act will make affordable housing production more difficult, and thus the General Assembly in 2026 should review and revise the Act to at least remove or ameliorate the obstacles, and otherwise remove exclusionary barriers and positively reform local zoning.
Municipal and regional housing growth plans
The new Act (Sections 4-7) introduces “housing growth plans,” adopted by either a municipality or regional council of governments, of which there are nine:  Capitol Region, Northeastern Connecticut, Lower Connecticut River Valley, Western Connecticut, Northwest Hills, Naugatuck Valley, Greater Bridgeport, South Central, and Southeastern.
The Act repeals General Statutes § 8-30j, the part of Public Act 21-29 that mandated every municipality to prepare and file an affordable housing plan by June 2022. Nearly every municipality did so during 2021-2023. 
Section 8-30j was less than effective because it only required municipalities to prepare a plan and file it with the state Office of Policy & Management, but gave little guidance as to content or standards. The new Act, however, contains only vague guidance in the nature of aspirations, imposes a complicated review process with lengthy timelines, and has no enforcement mechanisms or penalties. (Co-author Tim Hollister co-chaired a statewide Working Group in 2022-2023 that reviewed and evaluated these plans and in a February 2023 report to the legislature, made substantive and specific recommendations for improvements in the future plans.)
The 2021-2023 plans were supposed to be valid for at least five years.  The time, effort, and expense that dozens of municipalities invested in preparing those reports are now superseded.  The new Act makes no mention of building upon the 2021-2023 reports.  This is at least illogical, because when municipalities prepare the growth plans mandated by the new Act, a natural starting point should be to use what they produced just two or three years ago.  The new Act seems to direct municipalities to start from scratch.
The overall housing growth plan process begins with OPM, by December 2026, preparing a statewide housing needs assessment.  By June 2027, each regional council must prepare a regional housing needs assessment that includes a “recommended affordable housing goal for each member municipality.”  The methodology must include:

Federal Fair Housing Act “affirmatively furthering” obligation (outreach to those most in need of housing);
“Appropriate regional metrics” and cost-burden indicators;
“Appropriate factors for fairly allocating need among municipalities, including proximity to transportation, commercial and industrial zones, employment opportunities; available developable land; and municipality’s share of multi family housing stock”; and
Adjustments based on income and poverty levels.

Each regional council submits its assessment and recommends the municipal affordable housing goals to OPM, which may not reject them “solely on the basis that such needs assessment or goal may result in a greater number of dwelling units being developed than [OPM] deems adequate.” (We think this means OPM cannot reject the goal because OPM thinks it is too high, but the wording is not clear.)  No affordable housing goal may exceed 20 percent of the “occupied dwelling units in such municipality.”
The Act then requires all municipalities in the Capitol, Northeast, Lower Connecticut River Valley, Northwest Hills, and Southeastern Connecticut regions to submit their housing growth plans to OPM by June 2028; and those in the South Central, Greater Bridgeport, Naugatuck Valley, and Western regions to submit by June 2029, and every five years thereafter.
All plans must state “housing growth policies,” which are programs and practices designed to “reduce or remove regulatory constraints on the construction, rehabilitation, repair or maintenance of affordable housing units, such as zoning regulations amendments, fee waivers, tax-fixing agreements, tax abatements, and expedited approvals;” or “actions intended to promote” affordable units such as sewer infrastructure, donations of municipal land, and “agreements with developers” for developments that include affordable units. (This provision says “or” but appears to mean “and.”)
Every plan “shall reduce specific regulatory barriers to the development of dwelling units” and “promote additional dwelling units. . . .”  In addition, the plans must:

Identify specific zones or parcels where affordable housing units that will meet the municipality affordable housing goal can be approved by “summary review;”
Promote affordable housing units that will be subject to a 40-year restriction that will preserve the units for “persons and families” that earn 30 percent, 50 percent, or 80 percent or less of the statewide or area median income;
Set forth “strategies” for diversity of unit types, and accessibility in housing for the disabled;
Explain how the plan addresses “significant disparities in housing needs” and implements the “affirmatively furthering” purposes of the federal Fair Housing Act;
Contain an inventory of “developable land;”
Identify infrastructure needs including sewer capacity to achieve the affordable housing goal; and
Contain an implementation schedule.

The 20 municipalities with the lowest “adjusted equalized net grant list per capita” have a different set of criteria for their plans. They must prioritize preservation of existing affordable units; identify policies that will promote new affordable units “without displacing existing residents;” and identify infrastructure needs of existing residents.
If a municipality proceeds with its own housing growth plan, instead of the regional plan, then at least 90 days before the municipal plan is due to OPM (June 2028 or June 2029, as listed above), it must submit its plan to its regional council, which may propose amendments within 60 days.  If the municipality rejects any proposed amendment, it must provide a written explanation to the council.  The municipality then submits its plan to OPM, which has 120 days to review and accept or reject.
If OPM rejects the plan, the municipality must submit its plan to the new Council on Housing Development, which must provide written notice, reasons, and needed amendments if it denies.  The municipality can then resubmit to the Council within 30 days.
If a municipal plan is approved, the municipality must submit an annual progress report.  OPM must publish guidance for such annual reports by March 2026.
An approved plan establishes eligibility for financial awards called “grants-in-aid,” to assist with “construction, improvement, or expansion of public infrastructure.”  Grants are based on demonstrated progress” toward the plan’s “housing growth policies and affordable housing goal.”
If a municipality fails to submit a plan within the required time frame, the chief elected officer must give OPM a filing date not more than 30 days out, and the municipality will be ineligible to apply for a four-year moratorium from § 8-30g applications until it files.
Candidly, it is hard to imagine a more convoluted set of review and approval procedures than those listed above, or a more overwhelming task for OPM than providing a meaningful review of 80-plus housing growth plans in 2028 and 2029. The Act’s requirements for these plans include both vaguely-stated aspirations yet direction to specify steps zone by zone, parcel by parcel. How will OPM assess the compliance and details? If it approves all or most plans, it will be seen as a mere rubber stamp, and if it rejects a slew of submissions, it and the legislature will be criticized for not providing adequate guidance.
Moreover, unless we are missing something, the proposed plan preparation, review and approval process contains an impossibility, because it specifies that every municipality must decide within 30 days of receiving its affordable housing goal (June 2027 deadline) whether it will adopt the regional council’s housing growth plan –a plan that is not even due to be prepared and filed until June 2028 and 2029. Again, this is an example of an apparent drafting error that scrutiny could have avoided.
But on top of this procedural morass, the Act spells out four substantive criteria for new municipal and regional housing growth plans that conflict with existing law and are destined to be dysfunctional. The requirements are that every new plan must be “consistent with:”

The municipality’s Plan of Conservation and Development, adopted under General Statutes § 8-23 and prepared every ten years by the planning commission;
The regional plan of conservation and development, adopted by the regional council within which the municipality is located;
The State of Plan of Conservation and Development; and
A “local water pollution control authority’s” (a/k/a sewer commission) plan, “if applicable.”

How do these requirements conflict with existing law and guarantee dysfunction?  Let us count the ways.
For decades, it has been an accepted element of zoning and planning in Connecticut, with narrow exceptions, that municipal plans of development are advisory only as to the adoption of zoning regulations and approval of special permits and site plans. 
Our leading land-use law treatise, Connecticut Land Use Law and Practice, written by former Judge Robert Fuller and now edited by attorney Dwight Merriam, observes that municipal “POCDs” are “a planning concept. . . not based on existing conditions and zoning but rather a blueprint for recommended future development. . .,” and are based on “studies of physical, social, economic, and governmental conditions and trends.” 
As a result, “in Connecticut, “the zoning commission. . . is not controlled by recommendations of the planning commission….” “Connecticut has always maintained the independence of the zoning commission, and periodic attempts by planners and others to give more power to the planning commission at the zoning commission’s expense have occurred.” It should be noted that while zoning regulation amendments are an ongoing responsibility, POCDs are only revised every ten years.
POCDs are not zoning plans.  They are general and aspirational, not site-specific regulatory documents that can or should govern zoning regulation amendments, especially zone by zone, parcel by parcel plans for affordable units.  (That is what the § 8-30j plans were for, before they were repealed.)  Thus, the requirement that housing growth plans must be consistent with the municipality’s POCD creates a structure and process inconsistent with a basic premise of zoning in Connecticut.
Yet another problem: suppose wily opponents of affordable housing revise the municipal POCD by stripping out facilitation of affordable housing? Would the municipality then be free under the new Act from having to adopt any new or revised affordable housing zoning regulations? The point is that the requirement of plans being consistent with POCDs is a blueprint for exclusionary zoning.
Finally, as to regional plans, the notion that regional councils of government will be able to mediate disagreements among member towns about affordable housing goals seems unrealistic, yet the new Act requires this.
Which brings us to the requirement of consistency with the State Conservation and Development Policies Plan, 2025-2030, which includes the infamous Locational Guide Map. The “State C and D Plan” serves many useful purposes, providing an updated compilation of statewide development trends and a list of goals to which state agencies should aspire. But the Plan is not in any way a regulatory document or a land-use or site-specific zoning plan. Its Housing chapter is all of two pages, and contains only a list of general “targets” with which no one would disagree. Therefore, the new Act’s requirement that municipal and regional housing growth plans be consistent with the State Plan is misaligned because the State Plan does not specify land-use requirements with which a local or regional housing plan could conform.
Which leads us to ask whether the intent of this consistency requirement is to convert the Locational Guide Map into a type of statewide land-use control. 
The State Plan and the Map formally apply when a state agency invests more than $200,000 in a “growth-related project,” but the Locational Guide Map is a color-coded depiction of the entire state that identifies “Activity Zones” (Major Urban, Regional, Local, Suburban and Rural) and steers state agency actions away from “Conversation Factors” such as wetlands, farmlands, aquifers, “critical habitats,” and similar characteristics. 
Our concern is that OPM, or affordable housing opponents, will try to use the Locational Guide Map as a statewide zoning map by declaring that multi-family and affordable housing proposed outside an Activity Zone is not consistent with the State Plan.
Our state agencies have tried this before. In 2005, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and OPM assembled a plan in which the Locational Guide Map contained three shades of green – vast areas of land in dozens of municipalities – and the state DEEP decreed that it would not grant low-interest loans of federal Clean Water Act funds for any proposed sewer extension or expansion that would serve an area colored any shade of green on the Locational Guide Map. 
Since, as noted above, sewers are usually essential for multi-family and affordable housing, DEEP essentially installed itself at a statewide multi-family housing supervisor. When this became apparent, housing advocates and the development community convinced the legislature that this was a misuse of the State Plan and Map and in 2013, the legislature revised both specifying these documents should govern prioritization of certain state funds, but not be a statewide, top-down land use plan. The new Act appears to reenact the earlier regime.
Yet another dysfunction is the requirement that housing growth plans be consistent with local sewer plans.  Under state law, the sole job of water pollution control authorities (sewer commissions) is to manage capacity and engineering in the public sewer system.  Our courts have held in several cases that sewer commissions may not use sewers to control or enforce land use and zoning; that is the exclusive purview of the zoning commission.  For example, a town may not set parcel-by-parcel sewer gallonage limits as a way to prevent anything other than single-family homes on each parcel.
Like the other three consistency requirements in the new Act, sewer plan consistency is a roadmap for exclusionary land use. 
A good example is the fact that the Town of East Lyme recently enacted a three-year moratorium, extendable, on all new sewer connections that will use more than 20,000 gallons per day. This effectively prohibits anything other than small residential development until at least 2028. So does East Lyme now have no obligation to facilitate multi-family housing, because its sewer commission has adopted a plan blocking such housing for the foreseeable future? Is this what the governor and the General Assembly had in mind when they framed the new Act around the phrase “Towns take the lead?”
Another important question: how will drafters of housing growth plans determine whether their plan is consistent with all four touchstones, and what will they do if the state and local POCDs and sewer plans conflict with each other, which is highly likely?
In summary, the sections of the new Act that require municipal and regional housing growth plans to be consistent with the town and regional POCD, the State Plan and local sewer plans contravene existing law and practice. They will be unlikely to facilitate affordable housing production.
Fair share
Interestingly, when what is now the Act was reintroduced in November, proponents of the “fair share” provisions of H.B. 5002 claimed that the new Act preserved key elements of the May-June 2025 proposal, while some others claimed that fair share had been removed.
The new Act contains echoes of fair share, but removes the mandates that towns enact zoning regulations that will facilitate the highly prescriptive affordable housing unit and household income targets stated in H.B. 5002. 
The fingerprints of fair share are found in the Act’s Section 7, which requires regional councils to conduct a housing needs assessment and assign to each municipality an “affordable housing goal,” which goal becomes an organizing focus of the municipal and regional housing growth plans. The main difference from the May-June 2025 bill is that municipalities are required only to adopt “strategies” and “policies” and a schedule, but with no mandates or deadlines for revising zoning regulations.
Development opportunities
Two foundational questions are: will the General Assembly and the governor actually appropriate the incentive funds and underpin key sections of the new Act? And will municipalities, faced with complete new requirements but not mandates or penalties for non-compliance, actually cooperate? 
Meanwhile, for the development community, the opportunities for 2026 and beyond appear to be:

Take advantage of the new parking rules to increase residential density;
Examine land zoned commercial or mixed-use for opportunities to develop middle housing;
If a municipality proposes a transit-oriented district or priority housing development zone, pay attention to the potential for residential development as-of-right or by summary review;
Continue to use § 8-30g where appropriate;
Continue to work with proven financial and development programs administered by DOH and CHFA, including tax credit and low interest loan programs;
Keep an eye out for CMDA development agreements and opportunities they create; and
Pay attention to grants by OPM and DOH, as they may be an early sign of a development opening.

 A Legislative agenda For 2026
Though legislators may be reluctant to revisit the new Act in the 2026 short session, these problems need attention:

Untangle and simplify the process and schedule for housing growth plans;
Repeal the dysfunctional and illegal “consistency” requirements for such plans;
Modify the nine-unit cap on middle housing developments to a number that will attract developers;
Explain how the CMDA program is intended to fit with the new housing programs;
Clarify the notably confusing phrases, undefined and hard-to-understand terms, and vague standards that permeate the Act;
Clarify roles of municipalities vs. zoning commissions;
Be sure the study committees looking at sewer policies and the § 8-30g Ten Percent List at least do not create new obstacles to affordable housing development; and
Consider (again) the “low-hanging fruit” we have advocated before, which is to require that all zoning regulations by a date certain comply with Public Act 21-29’s amendments to General Statutes § 8-2.

As readers can tell, overall, we are not fans of the new Act. While H.B. 5002 had its flaws that probably justified the governor’s veto, the new Act does not portend robust solutions to our affordable housing shortage. 
The goal remains the approval, financing, and construction of thousands of lower-cost housing units, and that goal appears to be as compelling and unaddressed as it was a year ago.
Tim Hollister and Andrea Gomes are land use attorneys at the Hartford office of Hinckley Allen.  They both work regularly on affordable housing development.  
In 2022-23, Hollister co-chaired a statewide working group tasked by the legislature with reviewing all of the affordable housing plans (so-called “§ 8-30j plans”) prepared by nearly all municipalities and providing recommendations on how such plans could be improved.  In September 2024, he published here a five-part series about affordable housing reform and in July 2025, a two-part series explaining House Bill 5002, the one vetoed by the governor in June 2025, and what could be done to fix it.
Gomes regularly represents clients before local and state agencies and in state court. She has assisted with obtaining municipal approvals and litigating affordable housing matters and property disputes such as quiet title actions, easement disputes, nuisance actions, and adverse possession cases. 
Attorney Raphael Podolsky also contributed to this series.

The torch. The water. The idea that someone was standing at the edge of the country, holding a light, saying you can come in now. It felt settled. Like a promise you weren’t allowed to question.
I didn’t think about it again for a long time. Until Renee Good.
Renee Good is dead. Shot in South Minneapolis. And the news cycle is doing what it always does. It’s eating the corpse.
We keep a woman in the harbor holding a torch and promising refuge. We tell our kids she means something. Then a real woman is killed in the street while trying to protect people with less power than her, and the argument immediately collapses into compliance, procedure, and threat assessment.
The lie tastes like ash in the mouth. Those two images, the bronze promise and the bleeding body, are incompatible. The only way we make them coexist is by lying. To ourselves. To each other. And to the dead.
The Compliance Trap
The reflex is instant.
One side screams “Compliance.” She should have listened. She should have stopped.She used a car as a weapon.
The other side screams “Murder.” Excessive force. Escalation.She was trying to get away.
They argue about split-second tactics. About angles and physics. About the legal definition of fear. They zoom in. Frame by frame. Inch by inch. Not because it leads to truth, but because staying small feels safer.
It lets us cling to the comforting delusion that the system is sound, and only individuals fail.
“Just comply.” It sounds like advice. It sounds reasonable. It sounds like something you’d say to keep yourself safe.
But it isn’t safety advice. It’s an instruction we internalize to accept outcomes we cannot confront. A lullaby for obedience. If you just follow the rules, the teeth of the machine won’t bite you.
But the Statue of Liberty doesn’t have a plaque that says Comply and you will be safe.
It says: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
That isn’t a law. It’s a posture. An orientation toward the vulnerable.
Renee Good had that orientation. She stood between the power and the powerless. A shield made of flesh and urgent compassion. And in America, that is the most dangerous place to stand.
The Enemy of the Structure
This isn’t really about whether the agent felt fear. Fear is cheap. Fear is the default operating condition of a militarized system.
This is about the geometry of the state.
The state claims a monopoly on protection. It says: We keep you safe.
But when the state becomes the thing people need to be kept safe from, when it’s the one tearing the family apart, hunting the neighbor, the citizen steps in.
Renee stepped in. She brought a whistle. The state brought a gun.
And the system cannot tolerate that.
It cannot tolerate a mother acting as a shield against a federal operation. It creates a logic error. It disrupts the spreadsheet.
Look at the history. Slavery was legal. The people who hid runaways were criminals. Native removal was legal. The people who resisted were savages. Jim Crow was legal. The marchers were agitators. Kent State was legal. The students were threats.
Every time, the argument is the same: They should have listened. They broke the order. They didn’t comply.
We love the idea of a protector. We build statues to them. We write movies about them. But in practice, in the street. we shoot them.
The Erasure
The tragedy isn’t only that she died. The tragedy is what happens next.
By focusing on compliance, we turn a moral act into a tactical failure. We turn a woman who loved her community into a suspect who disobeyed a command. We erase the why and obsess over the how.
We erase her courage and replace it with a police report.
That’s the move. That’s always the move. Make it technical. Make it legal. Make it procedural.
Don’t let anyone talk about the heart. Don’t let anyone talk about the fact that she died trying to keep a family together. Because if we talk about that, we have to look back at the woman in the harbor. We have to read those words again: Yearning to breathe free.
And we have to admit something we don’t want to face.
If the Lady in the Harbor stepped off her pedestal today, if she stood in the street in Minneapolis, torch in hand, between agents and the huddled masses, if she stood between power and the fragile, they’d probably shoot her too.
And the news would say she should have just dropped the torch.
The geometry is brutal. Point A: the promise carved in copper. Point B: the body on the asphalt. The line connecting them is straight and thin and soaked in contradiction.
We keep pretending the line doesn’t exist. We keep calling the space between the points tragic instead of broken.
But the dead don’t get to pretend. And neither should we.

That was until a Dollar General opened a stone’s throw away. Within months, we sank. 
Middletown is known for its plethora of small businesses. With more and more towns growing indistinguishable from each other, all littered with a combination of the same regional and national chains, small businesses are becoming a rare asset. 
Everyone who has ever gone to the same mom-and-pop shop over any length of time knows that they are more than a place to buy milk, snacks, and lotto tickets. It feels almost impossible to see the same faces behind the counter and not somehow learn about their family vacation next month, or the storm coming on the weekend, or about a car robbery that happened to their neighbor – who lives near you, so you better be careful! 



I grew up sitting behind the counter while my dad chatted with seemingly every single person who came up to him. Whether they were wealthy widows who liked to treat themselves to chocolate and cigars now and again or a group of boys coming in from Xavier down the street, my dad knew them all. As a teen who was constantly on her phone, being at the store was one of my most cherished points of connection with my real-life community. I think at a time when everything we need can be delivered almost magically to our doors, these casual, nothing conversations can mean more to us than we thought possible. I’d only noticed once they were gone.
My family’s story is not unique. In fact, one out of every 20 independent grocery stores will go out of business within a few years of a dollar store arriving in their area. With the booming rate at which dollar stores have been expanding, many small businesses are facing the repercussions multiple times over. The opening of big box stores has always been challenging for small businesses, but the rapid growth and unpredictability of dollar stores pose another threat entirely.

Aida Sherwani

Due to competition within different dollar store chains (ie, Family Dollar, which owns Dollar Tree, versus Dollar General), it is hard to know when a Family Dollar will open and sink a Dollar General; ergo, it is hard to know whether a small business should ride out the storm or jump ship. Recently, 1,000 Dollar Tree-owned stores have been set to close; meanwhile, Dollar General forecasts net sales to grow between 3.7% and 4.7% by the end of January 2026. One thing is certain, though, families like mine are having their livelihoods washed away by these mega-chain corporations. 
Some places have legislation against dollar stores. In 2020, the city of Manvel, Texas, adopted an ordinance that prohibits the building of new dollar stores within two miles of another dollar store, convenience store, or gas station. Furthermore, in 2019, the city of Stonecrest, Georgia, adopted a total ban on new dollar stores. These are concrete examples of municipal governments putting their people before their profits. Similar ordinances have been adopted in Connecticut as well. East Hartford adopted an ordinance prohibiting a new dollar store from opening within 2,000 feet of another dollar store. In my research, I have found 28 cities that have adopted similar ordinances on dollar stores. The progress is limited, but real. 
Despite this, both Dollar Tree and Dollar General have forecasted an increase in profits, and with that will come expansions into more typically lower-income areas, like where I live, stealing money from the community, because that is what they are doing. Dollar General failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, while Family Dollar failed 2,100 price inspections in 20 states. At the counter, instead of telling you about a sister getting married in the spring, they are charging you a price that wasn’t on the shelf and pretending not to notice.
Now, I completely understand that a stranger telling you to bypass your cheapest, most widespread convenience store option may sound out of touch and too demanding. As a low-income person myself, I understand the benefits of dollar stores. I only ask you to think twice before you patronize one. 
As for legislators, I continue to advocate for laws that will keep small businesses afloat. An ordinance limiting chain dollar stores would preserve the charms many CT towns are known for, my hometown of Middletown especially, as well as protect their residents. Supporting small businesses is key to creating strong community bonds, and that may be worth more than the convenience of a dollar store.

Richard Blumenthal both issued  press releases on January 9,  expressing the outrage most of us feel at the actions of ICE  and President Donald Trump.
They called for an independent investigation of the shooting of American citizen Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis and also of how and why a demonstrator was struck by a federal vehicle at a peaceful demonstration I attended the next day at the Federal Building in Hartford.
In a democracy rooted in law, everyone’s actions must be lawful.  When there is disagreement about what is lawful, there are channels to go through to determine it—courts, state and local governments, arrest warrants, etc. 
Here I’m impressed with Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam’s response to the motor vehicle incident and the pepper-spraying of protestors last Thursday night: “We will be investigating what appears to be a hit-and-run incident by what appears to be a governmental employee as we would any other hit-and-run incident.”
Any of us can express outrage and call for investigations and resignations, but we expect more from our elected officials.
Larson’s co-sponsoring of the No Secret Police Act is a start, but just a start. His and Sen. Blumenthal’s presence at that rally would’ve been an enormous shot-in-the-arm for the protest and this movement.
They, not we, have the power to introduce bills and gather support from their  colleagues in Congress. The FY 2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill is being used by some of their colleagues as leverage to demand ICE reforms. We need them to support such demands.
Our own Sen. Chris Murphy is planning to introduce legislation requiring ICE agents to have warrants, prevent them from wearing masks during arrests and limit their use of firearms.
Larson and Blumenthal need to lend their support or co-sponsor. They have the bully pulpit to rally us to action —in the streets, at work, at town council meetings —to maximize whatever power we individuals do have.
I’ve heard them both using it at gatherings at the Capitol. We need them to lead us at this time. At this point in their careers, we need them to be the leaders their constituents and our country need them to be.

One number he won't fret over: The state's eight congressional districts, which he insists will not be redrawn.","Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) discusses upcoming 2026 session in his office Monday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The 2026 legislative session will be primarily about the numbers for Senate President Bill Ferguson.
The Baltimore City Democrat enters his seventh session as leader of the Senate. His chamber will have the first crack at Gov. Wes Moore’s last budget of the term, and its projected $1.5 billion deficit.
But one number Ferguson will likely not focus on is the state’s eight congressional districts. Despite pressure from the governor and the House ro redraw the districts mid-cycle, the Senate leader has staked out opposition to the move, and says now it’s too late to act even if a bill lands in the General Assembly on opening day.
“I think we’re still at the same place,” Ferguson told Maryland Matters when asked if the Senate had changed its position on the issue. “And I’d say I think the window is closed. The filing deadline [for candidates] is Feb. 24, the attorney general said it’s at least 120 days to prepare for a case at the trial court level.”
Ferguson sits on a five-member redistricting advisory commission appointed by Moore. After several virtual meetings late last year, the panel considered nearly three-dozen maps Friday, and could make a recommendation when it meets again this Friday.
Any legislation that stems from that is likely to come from the House. Ferguson has been clear that his chamber would not take up the issue this close to the election, and any bill that makes it out of the House could land in the legislative purgatory of the Senate Rules Committee.
House Speaker Peña-Melnyk begins first session tackling budget deficit, immigration policy

Ferguson said a bill at this late stage would “significantly impact the election.”
“I think we’ve already missed the window,” Ferguson said.
For Ferguson, the 2026 session begins what he called his “third chapter” as presiding officer: First with former House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), then with Jones and Moore, and now with Moore and new Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel).
“I keep saying this is chapter three, and I’m hopeful it’ll be the best chapter yet,” Ferguson said.
“I would say we probably likely agree on most issues and the outcome of most issues,” he said Monday. “it’s the means of getting there.”
One of those issues — perhaps the biggest issue — will be the budget.
The legislature wrapped the 2025 session believing a package of one-time fund shifts, cuts and $1.6 billion in tax increases had erased a $3.3 billion deficit and left them with a projected $300 million surplus for the fiscal 2027 budget. Instead, lawmakers start the year staring at a projected $1.5 billion budget gap.
“I don’t think any of us expected us to be in the place where we are, but due to the federal uncertainty, to Medicaid costs, health care inflation, we’re back in a place where we have to do some heavy lifting to balance the budget,” Ferguson said.
“I don’t foresee us doing any revenues for it,” he said. “I think we’re going to have to really cost-contain wherever possible. We’re going to have to look deeply into the formulas to find places where we can adjust and moderate the growth that we’ve seen.”
Maryland has been the state hardest hit by the elimination of federal jobs, losing nearly 25,000 since Trump took office, according to the most recent figures.
That’s in addition to inflationary pressures and increasing costs of health care and services for persons with developmental disabilities, where Ferguson said there are “700 individuals in Maryland that account for $400 million worth of spending.”
“That’s a half a million dollars of spending annually on an individual, 700 individuals … in the developmental disabilities community, where the Marylanders with the highest needs,” he said. “That is a lot, it sounds like a lot of money, but if it allows them to have a life, to be able to have basic care, you know, that is a commitment that we in Maryland have made.”
But the Senate leader warned of tough choices ahead.

“It will crowd out other priorities,” he said. “We will balance the budget. There is only so much you can push in any direction, and so it is entitlement spending. So, if somebody is eligible, then we spend it.”
Changes are possible when it comes to eligibility.
“I think we are going to be adjusting our eligibility alongside of what was required with the Republican budget bill, we have to figure out how Maryland will adapt and adjust to that,” Ferguson said. “We anticipate that a number of Medicaid-eligible individuals are likely to be kicked off the rolls.”
In the short term, there’s a savings, he said. But eventually, the costs escalate as those who fall below the eligibility guidelines delay health care, show up in emergency rooms or stay longer in hospitals to treat severe illnesses.
“That’s the most expensive kind of care,” Ferguson said. “And so I think that’s why these decisions have to be looked at, not just on a year-by-year basis. It’s what is the net impact overall of policies that are underpinning a lot of the costs.”
Ferguson said the legislature will also have to focus again on broader affordability issues, including the costs of electricity and policies meant to decrease housing costs.
“It’s going to be very similar to what we said last year. It’s going to be short term, midterm, long term,” Ferguson said of efforts to rein in utility bills. “In short term, the rebates were an important feature for twice a year to provide immediate relief for people in the hardest-hit months in the winter and then … in the summer.”
The Senate leader said he expects the legislature to consider additional subsidies for electric bills. He did not provide specifics but said the money for the payments could come again from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is typically used for energy efficiency projects.
Some of the funds will also be used to backfill cuts made to federal programs for wind, solar and battery projects. If those projects get knocked off schedule, he said, it will mean less power generation, “which will increase the cost of electricity overall.”
With another budget deficit in Maryland, Republicans see an opportunity

“The long term is really to continue to push for generation here in Maryland, and that is with cleaner sources than exist today,” he said. So, if it’s coal — we want to get rid of coal — we’ve got to do it in a way that is cleaner and affordable.
“And so, in some cases, we’ll see a transition to natural gas. In other places, we’ll see expansion of opportunity around nuclear,” he said. “I think we’ll see big investments in batteries and renewables, and so we need it cleaner than what exists today.”
Ferguson said he also expects to take up legislation to counter some other federal policies including immigration enforcement. One of those bills — Senate Bill 1 – would prohibit law enforcement officers, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, from using masks to obscure their faces.
“I think that … the way that we’ve seen these operations be conducted in Maryland and across the country is absolutely abhorrent and is horrifying and shocks the conscience for I hope, the vast, vast, vast majority of American people who do not want to be living amongst a paramilitary enforcement of the law,” Ferguson said.
A second bill would ban 287(g) agreements between local police departments and federal immigration enforcement.
“We’ll do what we can at a state level,” he said. “I think that ICE has become an institution that has severely lost its way, and Maryland law enforcement, by partnering with ICE at this point, is only creating further distrust between law enforcement and the population that employ them.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The Maryland Democratic Party’s annual luncheon, hosted the day before the start of the legislative session, typically serves as a rally for the party faithful and a chance for party leaders to lay out possible trials and tribulations during the next 90 days.
This year, however,  there was also a sense of reflection, as Democrats paid tribute to two notable figures taking their leave from their current positions and reflected on challenges in the recent past and near future.
New House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) paid tribute to her predecessor, former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), whom she honored as a trailblazer. Jones was unable to attend the Tuesday event.
“Speaker Adrienne Jones opened those doors for many of us. And she’s a transformative leader, someone who was unapologetic and has left an impressive legacy,” Peña-Melnyk said. “Someone whose shoes I can’t fill, but she left them in the right direction for me.”
The luncheon also served as a light send-off for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), who announced last week that he would not seek reelection this year after almost 45 years in Congress and almost 60 years in state politics.
List of possible Hoyer successors continues to grow, with more ‘definitely considering’

“I rise before you to look across this room and know that there are very few, if any, here who were alive when I was elected … some 60 years ago,” Hoyer said, drawing chuckles from the room. But Hoyer also warned the crowd that state lawmakers are going to have a challenging year wrangling the state budget deficit and policy moves from the Trump administration.
After dealing with a $3.3 billion budget shortfall last year, lawmakers return this year facing another looming deficit, this time to the tune of $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, federal policies out of the Trump administration threaten to disrupt policy goals for Maryland Democrats.
Peña-Melnyk, addressing the event for the first time as speaker, highlighted the legislative challenges that she and state lawmakers will face during session, ranging from rising energy costs to the anticipated loss of Medicaid coverage as a result of federal changes, on top of the budget challenge.
But she assured that she would hold her own as speaker, with the help of her colleagues.
“Trust me, I am not an idealist – that young delegate that came in 20 years ago. No, I am more pragmatic now,” she said. “But you’re not going to take that fire and hope and faith out of me.”
She also thanked the delegates that pulled out of the race for the speaker position last month, recognizing House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who she said were “also very deserving” of the serving as speaker, but had “the grace to withdraw their names, so that I could go forward.”
“This race was intense, but it was respectful and it was civil,” she said. “It takes a lot for you to withdraw your name when you are also very deserving and have done the work, and I thank you for believing in me.”
Under her leadership, Peña-Melnyk said the House would embrace the challenge with respect and civility, working alongside the Maryland Senate and the Moore administration.
“Is it going to be easy, the work we’re about to do? No it isn’t,” she said. “We have a deficit. People are struggling, but I know we can talk and sit down.”
While Peña-Melnyk looked to the immediate future, Gov. Wes Moore (D) looked inward, offering self-reflection on the three years of hi first term — proud of the progress made, while acknowledging that things didn’t always go as planned.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) promised to take the lessons learned over the last three years as governor to “be better” in the last year of his first term. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)
“I cannot sit here and tell you all that I know I have gotten it all right,” he said. “I can tell you on the places I haven’t gotten it all right — I am never going to stop getting better.
“I am never going to miss an opportunity to grow, miss an opportunity to push, miss an opportunity to test myself … miss an opportunity to do something that we believe, even if it’s by a margin, it’s going to make the lives of the people of the state better,” he said.
Heading into the session, Moore said he is grateful for the “mistakes” and “lessons learned,” though he did not offer specifics.
“For this moment, I’m grateful for the trials, I’m grateful for the tribulations,” Moore told the gathered Democrats. “I’m grateful for the lessons learned. I’m grateful for the mistakes. I’m grateful for the heartaches. I’m grateful for the things I know I can’t take back.
“Because all of them are not just what makes us human, it’s what makes us better. And being better is exactly what the people of this state deserve,” Moore said.
Abrupt end
But the reflections were abruptly cut off by the end of the luncheon. Due to speakers running over their allotted time throughout the event, the lineup needed to be shuffled to accommodate Moore’s departure, as he was operating on a tight schedule Tuesday.
Moore was originally scheduled to speak last, but state Democratic Chair Steuart Pittman moved the governor ahead of both Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Lt. Governor Aruna Miller’s scheduled speaking slot.
About a third of the attendees walked out after Moore’s comments, leaving before Miller could highlight some of the high points of the past year, which included drops in violent crime rates in Baltimore and new companies investing in the state. After Miller, Pittman announced that the event was out of time and shut it down before Lierman was able to speak.

The eight candidates who were already filed with the Maryland State Board of Elections last week gained a ninth Tuesday, when Republican Michelle Talkington, who unsuccessfully challenged Hoyer in 2024, filed her candidacy paperwork with the board.
His paperwork was not in Tuesday, but Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George’s) announced Monday that he’s in the race for the 5th District seat. He already had a congressional campaign website that claimed he had raised $100,000 in one day and garnered 14 endorsements.
And that doesn’t include the other state lawmakers and former congressional candidates who said this week they are “definitely considering” the possibility of a run.
Political analysts predicted the Democratic primary would be crowded, with the winner of it almost certain of a general election victory in the district, where there were 2.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in 2024. The district includes the three Southern Maryland counties of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s with portions or Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties.
Analysts also said they expect voters in the district would choose a more progressive Democratic nominee in the June 23 primary than the more-moderate Hoyer.
Boafo said Tuesday that he is optimistic about the race, which he said is about “the next chapter for this district.”
“It’s about new generation of leadership,” said Boafo, 31, who worked as a campaign manager for Hoyer between 2019 and 2021. “This is a five-month sprint, so we only have a short amount of time. We got to get out there and see where we go from here.”
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) — one of the “definitely considering” candidates — stressed Tuesday that whether it’s him or someone else, the person seeking the office must have “the people of the district in mind.”
“It just can’t be people who just want to be in political office,” Wilson said. “It’s important [that] whoever we have in office realizes that. It’s a huge concern of mine we just start attracting a lot of politicians, and their claim to fame is politics. Tell me what you have done. I’m hoping that somebody has that kind of dignity to make sure they’re running for the right reasons.”
Other “strongly considering” candidates include Sen. Arthur Ellis (D-Prince George’s) and former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who ran unsuccessfully for the 3rd District seat in 2024. While Dunn lives in the 8th District, congressional candidates in Maryland are not required to live in the district they’re seeking.
Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), who chairs the county’s House delegation, reiterated from last week she’s giving “strong consideration” to run. Williams said she’ll decide in about a week.
In addition to Talkington, a Charles County resident, there are five Democrats, two unaffiliated candidates and another Republican currently filed for the seat, according to the board of elections. One of those Democrats, retired Navy officer Terry Jackson, said over the weekend that Hoyer’s decision to step down opens the field.
“No one should be anointed. This open seat levels the playing field, and voters deserve a race decided on merit—not inevitability or insider assumptions,” said Jackson, who filed his candidacy in October.
Hoyer, who said Thursday that he would likely recommend a successor at some point, said that Tuesday was not that time.
When asked a possible endorsement as he left the Maryland Democratic Party’s annual legislative lunch, where fellow Democrats heaped praise on him for his service, Hoyer would only say, “I’m not going to do anything right now.”

Records are not always as complete as you would like.
It’s why Ken Burns has a job.
It is in that spirit that we make a smallish correction to the reported biography of House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s).
Maryland Matters reported (as did others) that Peña-Melnyk’s election to the rostrum in December represented a number of firsts in the chamber. Among those, that she was the first immigrant to be speaker of the House of Delegates. At the time of reporting, the state legislative library could find no records that suggested otherwise. (Those librarians are actively engaged in an effort to build out the biographies of past officials – a legislative genealogy, if you will.)
A late-night tip sent us down a research hole — a very specific hole.

While we cannot say who was the first immigrant Speaker of the House, we do know there was at least one before Peña-Melnyk — John Hubner, a Baltimore County Democrat.
Hubner, a Catonsville resident, owned and developed real estate around the turn of the century. He served both in the House and Senate — and served as both speaker and, several years later, as Senate President, according to a Maryland State Archives biographical sketch.
The sketch did not list his birthplace. But an obituary in the Baltimore Sun and a copy of his death certificate issued on Sept. 8, 1920, did note his place of birth as Bavaria, Germany — an immigrant to the U.S. The state Department of Legislative Services Library helped confirm the research.
Jack Derr, senator from Frederick, dies
Former Sen. John W. “Jack” Derr, who represented Frederick and Washington counties, has died.
“Jack was an always pleasant, soft spoken, and respected legislator during his entire 16 years in the Maryland Senate,” said Marty Madden, a former state senator. “This demeanor made him an extremely effective advocate for his constituents in Frederick and Washington counties. Jack bought goodwill to all sides regardless of the issue. Both Annapolis and Washington could use more Jack Derrs.”
Derr died Jan. 7  in Park Rapids, Minnesota, where he and his wife had a retirement home. No cause of death was released. He was 84.
He was born in Frederick in 1941. He attended Frederick High School and in 1963 earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Maryland, College Park. He also served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1963-1969.
Derr, a Republican, was elected to the Senate in 1982 and served four terms — all on the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee. He also served as Senate Minority Whip from 1996-1999 when he left the Senate.
Derr is survived by his wife Joy and the couple’s four children: David J. Derr (Martha) of Gig Harbor, Washington; Elizabeth Derr Schultz (Matthew) of Anchorage, Alaska; Andrew M. Derr (Kelly) of Middletown; Amy Derr Hodges (John) of Bristow, Virginia; and 15 grandchildren.
Funeral services are planned for noon Eastern time at Hubbard United Methodist Church. The service will be livestreamed from Park Rapids.
Bryant appointed to elections role

Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday named Eric Bryant to fill the seat on the Maryland State Board of Elections vacated by Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann when he left to become the state’s budget secretary last fall.
Bryant most recently served as chief of staff for Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th), but has “more than three decades of experience in law, government, and elective politics,” according to a statement from the governor’s office.
“Eric Bryant’s career has been defined by a deep understanding of the law and an unwavering commitment to the democratic process,” Moore said in the statement. “He brings a rare perspective that combines technical legal expertise with a lifelong dedication to civil rights. Eric is the right public servant to ensure Maryland’s elections remain fair and free.”
Moore’s office said Bryant’s experience in local, state, and federal campaigns “give him practical experience with the election laws of Maryland, the Maryland State Board of Elections, federal elections law, and the Federal Election Commission.” He has worked for years on voter re-enfranchisement, as well as on an update to state elections regulations so that they kept pace with digital advertising.
Before working with Mfume, Bryant spent 14 years as a partner with Rifkin Weiner Livingston LLC. He also worked as a national office staffer with the NAACP, working on an array of civil rights issues, including large-scale voter registration drives and voter re-enfranchisement efforts. He called the nomination to the elections board “a humbling honor.”
“As a product of the civil rights movement, the principle of ‘one person, one vote’ is more than a slogan to me, it is a moral imperative. I look forward to serving the board with purpose and integrity to ensure Maryland continues to have transparent, free and fair elections,” he said, according to the governor’s statement.
Bryant earned his law degree from the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and his bachelor’s degree from Duke University.
Two new judges for Montgomery, Prince George’s circuit courts
Apparently, it’s appointments week in Annapolis, in addition to being the opening week of the 2026 General Assembly.
Moore appoints three to fill vacant House seats, Hoover steps back at PSC, in political notes

Moore on Tuesday elevated Montgomery County District Court Judge Victor Manuel Del Pino to the circuit court bench in the county and announced the appointment of Joseph C. Ruddy, a lawyer in the Prince George’s County Office of Law, to a seat on the Prince George’s Circuit Court.
“The Montgomery County and Prince George’s County Circuit Courts are gaining two exceptional legal professionals who have dedicated their lives to advancing justice under the law,” Moore said in a statement released by his office. “These public servants bring a wealth of legal experience, and I am grateful for their continued service to our state.”
Del Pino has been a district court judge since 2019, and before that was in private practice for nine years with McGann, Del Pino and Hughes. He was a prosecutor in the Montogomery County State’s Attorney’s Office for seven years, including two years as chief of the Gang Prosecution Unit. He also served two terms on the board of trustees of the Maryland Public Defender’s Office. A lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he is fluent in Spanish. He is set to begin teaching this year the Georgetown University School of Law, and earned his law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
Ruddy has been with the Prince George’s County Office of Law for seven years, where he has been legal adviser for the county police since June. Before that, he spent more than six years as deputy county attorney, where he provided legal guidance to all county agencies, including the County Council. Roddy was a prosecutor for 15 years in the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office, and served early in his career as a clerk to Prince George’s County Circuit Judge Ronald D. Schiff. He has been a course instructor for multiple police departments, covering topics that include the Fourth Amendment and expert testimony, and earned his law degree from the Catholic University of America.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/state-house-flag-newsletter-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-13 22:59:06.559535

“It’s a very humbling thing. I’m very excited. I’m very grateful that the residents of district 63 have elected me as their representative and House District 63 and I’m looking forward to going to work for them,” he said.
Crow’s platforms included improving public education and maintaining a business-friendly environment.
Democratic candidate Judith Taylor said in an interview Tuesday evening that despite her loss, she feels confident in the votes she got.
“First time out of the box, and I got half of what a seasoned, polished professional politician got,” Taylor said.
Crow raised $134,779 and spent $26,784. Many of his cash donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs) and businesses.
According to campaign finance records, Taylor raised $14,410 and spent $5,446. All of her cash donations came from individuals.
The seat became vacant after former Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, resigned following her appointment as president of the Alabama Public Service Commission last June.
The district has been solidly Republican since 1998, when former Rep. Tim Parker switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. The seat was held by Robert Bentley, later the governor of Alabama, from 2002 to 2010. Rep. Bill Poole, R-Tuscaloosa, got 63% of the vote in 2010 and did not face any competition in 2014 or 2018. Almond got 66% of the vote in her last election in 2022.

Enrollment for 2026 fell in Wisconsin and nationwide as premium costs rose and enhanced subsidies ended at the end of 2025.With premium costs sharply increased and enhanced subsidies to reduce them no longer available, the number of people signing up for health care in the federal marketplace is behind last year by more than 5%, according to a preliminary report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, which manages the HealthCare.gov enrollment, reported this week that Wisconsin enrollment fell by more than 17,000 below 2025’s record enrollment, which topped 310,000. As of Jan. 3, 289,213 Wisconsin residents had enrolled in plans for 2026.
HealthCare.gov is the marketplace created as part of the Affordable Care Act. It is a platform for people to purchase health insurance who aren’t covered by an employer or by some other health plan, such as Medicare or Medicaid.
Nationwide, enrollment for 2026 is 22.77 million, CMS reported — a decline of about 1.5 million from 2025.
The loss of enhanced premium tax credits, which cut the cost of health insurance purchased at HealthCare.gov, has been predicted to lead many to drop out of the marketplace. The enhanced subsidies expired at the end of 2025. Smaller subsidies remain in place, but premiums have also risen in cost, for several reasons.
According to insurance analysts, one factor in that increase was that insurance companies expected the higher prices to drive some people out of the marketplace — particularly those with fewer health concerns who are willing to take the chance that they won’t need coverage.
The remaining population is expected to have more serious health needs, making their care more expensive but also raising the cost for insuring the entire remaining pool of customers.
The U.S. House has passed a bill that would extend the enhanced subsidies another three years. Its future in the U.S. Senate isn’t clear.
Open enrollment through HealthCare.gov is still available until Thursday, Jan. 15, with coverage starting Feb. 1. For consumers who enrolled by Dec. 15, 2025, coverage began Jan. 1.

Jan. 13, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceA union-backed auto worker at Ford Motor Co. was caught on video heckling President Donald Trump when he visited a Dearborn factory on Tuesday ahead of his address to the Detroit Economic Club. The video that has now gone viral shows Trump responded in kind by mouthing an expletive at the worker, twice, and displaying a middle finger as he walked away.
Now, the union says the worker has been suspended while Ford looks into the matter.
A representative from the UAW told Michigan Advance that they could confirm that he was suspended but the length of the suspension was unknown. The union was also uncertain about the process that would follow to investigate the matter.
A message seeking comment from Ford to confirm if the worker was fired or suspended was not immediately returned on Tuesday evening.
In a statement to the Advance, White House communications director Steven Cheung called the worker “a lunatic” who was “wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage.”
“And the president gave an appropriate and unambiguous response,” Cheung said.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said she spoke to a well placed source in the worker’s local union who said he was facing disciplinary action.
“Ford said they can’t talk about it because it’s a human resources issue,” Tlaib said. “In the past, when President Obama (went) onto the plant floor and other times people have said some terrible things, they didn’t get fired.”

@michiganadvance #trump #epsteinfiles @Distillsocial ♬ Quiet Music – Stacey Barelos


U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) also told the Advance that the union confirmed that the confrontation meant the man was facing disciplinary action.
Dingell also said she was inquiring with Ford about the status of the man’s employment, and if he was being suspended and investigated in violation of his free speech rights.
“When you’re on a factory floor with union members that have strong feelings, you need to be prepared for whatever they’re gonna say, and I hope they’re not firing him because I believe in free speech,” Dingell said in an interview. “The UAW worker was expressing his right to free speech, and I’m asking questions as to what has happened.”
The video, which was first published by Distill Social shows Trump walking around a raised portion of the Dearborn F-150 plant when the worker, who is not seen on screen, yells to Trump and calls him a “pedophile protector,” a reference to Trump’s widely reported connections to deceased pedophile and sex trafficker Jeffery Epstein and the Trump administration’s bungling of a new law that ordered the FBI to release all of the files that the department had available to them.
Some have seen the constant delays from the FBI and the slow walk to release the files as Trump protecting either himself or his wealthy elite friends from scrutiny or a clear connection to Epstein.
In response to the confrontation, the Democratic National Committee denounced Trump for being “more concerned with his ego than his spiraling economy, where job cuts are skyrocketing, hiring has slowed, unemployment remains high, and prices continue to soar.”
“As working families struggle to make ends meet in Trump’s economy, the Trump family and their wealthy donors keep getting richer — there’s no bigger ‘F-you’ than that,” said DNC Senior Advisor for Messaging, Mobilization and Strategy Tim Hogan in a statement. “The real question is: Why does the mere mention of Epstein set him off?”
Tlaib echoed that point.
“The worker could have said anything, but this worker felt compelled to say you’re protecting a pedophile. I feel very strongly that Ford Motor Company is sending a message that people can’t stand up for sexual abuse survivors,” Tlaib said.

The victory by Pemberton would continue the unbroken streak of Democratic victories in the 139th House District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich since its creation after the 1990 census. 
With about a 2-1 margin of victory at the polls, Pemberton had a lead that could not be overcome by the early-voting ballots that were last to be counted, Democrats said. The majority of those ballots were cast by Democrats.
Pemberton was opposed by Republican Brandon Sabbag of Ledyard and a write-in candidate, Mark Adams of Norwich, in a special election called after the death of Rep. Kevin Ryan of Montville, a Democrat who first won the seat in 1992.
Unofficial results later posted on the secretary of the state’s elections site showed Pemberton carrying all three towns, with 64% of the vote; Sabbag had 28% and Adams, 7%. Turnout was 20%.
With Pemberton’s victory, the House will return to full strength, with Democrats once again holding a 102-49 super majority.
Sabbag’s campaign was hit by the disclosure Monday by The Day of New London that he had a criminal record, with convictions for misdemeanor assault and felony witness tampering in 2018.
Pemberton is a political newcomer, encouraged to run by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, whose district is home to the state’s two federally recognized tribes, the Mohegans and Mashantucket Pequots.
Until recently, Pemberton was an unaffiliated voter.
He and his wife are the parents of two children. They live in the Uncasville section of Montville, which was named by British colonists for their military ally, the Mohegan sachem Uncas.
There is one issue unresolved by the election: a pending lawsuit by Adams over his exclusion from the ballot.
Adams, the Republican nominee in 2022 and 2024, was endorsed in the special election by the Independent Party and claims the secretary of the state’s office wrongly refused to accept his Independent Party nomination papers over a technicality — a missing signature. 
Should he succeed, the remedy could be a new election.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CT4A2940_-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 21:57:39.825449

Despite pleas from Gov. Gordon and others, Joint Appropriations Committee debated whether economic development is the proper role of state government.
The post Lawmakers move to defund Wyoming Business Council ahead of budget session appeared first on WyoFile .","The primary budgeting arm of the Legislature voted Tuesday to defund the Wyoming Business Council, the state’s top economic development shop since 1998.
Following a motion by Powell Republican Sen. Dan Laursen, the Joint Appropriations Committee agreed to zero out the council’s budget, leaving $2 million to administer existing loans. Though the recommendation must go to the full Legislature during the budget session that begins in February, the committee’s direction carries significant weight. 
Committee members also indicated there’s another bill in the works to more fully close out the Business Council, “statutorily.” A majority of members indicated they were willing to sponsor such a bill as a committee.
Closed for business?
Before the vote, committee member Rep. Trey Sherwood, a Laramie Democrat, offered a “friendly amendment” to Laursen’s motion. 
“My thought would be to leave, I don’t know, approximately $200,000 to provide to the Department of Transportation to create signs that could hang on the ‘Welcome to Wyoming’ signs that say ‘We’re closed for business.'”
Rep. Trey Sherwood (D-Laramie) stands outside the State Capitol. (Mike Vanata/WyoFile)
The motion died.
Devils Tower Republican Sen. Ogden Driskill said he had doubts about the Business Council’s effectiveness as well. But he warned that defunding the organization without contemplating Wyoming’s future role in economic development will have broad, lasting negative impacts for the state’s economy.
“We probably ought to just go ahead and open up the anti-business council, because that’s really what we’re doing,” Driskill said. “That sounds a little harsh, a little bitter today. Guess what? The decisions you folks are making, should they become law, dramatically affects my grandkids and great-grandkids.” 
Gillette Republican and Appropriations Co-chair Rep. John Bear said the state will be better off without the council.
Colleagues “to my left just said, ‘You know what? What are you for?'” Bear said. “I am for free markets, for capitalism, and my [colleagues who] said we need to problem solve, I agree. We need to problem solve.
Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, sits at his desk during the Wyoming Legislature’s 2025 general session. (Mike Vanata/WyoFile)
“But I’m here to tell you,” Bear continued, “I don’t believe that government is the solution to most of our problems. So with that, I don’t think this agency has been effective, and I don’t think they’re going to be effective. We’re going to reset. I think we need to determine something that will work.”
Business Council’s role
Sensing an appetite among Joint Appropriations Committee members to take such an action, Gov. Mark Gordon last week sent a letter to the legislative body imploring members to examine, but not defund, the council.
“I understand, it may be time for the Business Council to benefit from more careful scrutiny from the Legislature in how it goes about the tasks assigned to it,” Gordon wrote in a Jan. 7 letter to the committee. “A course correction may be warranted, but a wholesale defunding of the [Business Council] would be counterproductive.”
WyoFile reached out to the Wyoming Business Council on Tuesday, but the organization declined to comment. 
The Business Council had requested a budget of $112 million for the next biennium, or two-year budget cycle. Gordon, in his recommendation to lawmakers, trimmed the request to $54.6 million, mostly by removing $50 million for an ongoing broadband buildout effort.
The committee last week called on Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell to answer questions about ongoing concerns that the organization wasn’t aligned with Wyoming businesses and communities. 
Dorrell noted that the council has been asking lawmakers to engage in a longer discussion about how to realign the organization with a changing economic and political environment.
“We are very willing to not defend our programs, or to defend the efforts that we’ve taken so far, but rather to seek out the problem and address it with the right statutes and the right investment mechanisms. That’s what you have in front of you,” Dorrell said.Aside from existing and potential Wyoming businesses, municipalities throughout the state often rely on the council for direction on how to expand their economies, as well as loans to update aging, critical infrastructure such as water and sewer.

A couple of members of the Montana Public Service Commission are crying foul after leadership approved a final decision in a major NorthWestern Energy rate case without calling for a vote on the final amended order, which may result in higher bills for customers.
Commissioner Randy Pinocci in particular said Monday the final order misrepresents his stance on the complex case as a “yes” — contrary to his stated position in an email.
Commissioner Brad Molnar said the “stolen” vote from Pinocci means a rate increase was issued in a procedural move, but without a public vote by the five-person, all-Republican commission that oversees public utilities.
Molnar and Pinocci, however, may have unwittingly delegated their authority to object to a final order to PSC President Jeff Welborn and Vice President Jennifer Fielder.
In a phone call, Welborn said the Public Service Commission laid out a process to consider the case, and all commissioners were on board. Now, he said, some commissioners appear to be trying to “run from their votes.”
Molnar was ousted as PSC president last year and he and Pinocci have been at times aligned against the other three commissioners.
The case also concluded without impacts to customer bills being publicly available from the Public Service Commission.
A spokesperson for the PSC said a filing with impacts on bills is due Friday, and a NorthWestern spokesperson said the utility will meet the deadline.
The current lack of information about bill impacts reflects the complexity of the case, according to the Public Service Commission.
But the questions raised about votes show the strife the Public Service Commission experienced last year remains — with potential impacts to work that affects customers.
“It’s a shame that we spend so much time around here trying to navigate curveballs,” Welborn said.
Molnar said the scheme will have consequences for ratepayers: “Open your checkbooks, boys and girls.”
Who voted, when and how?
In the final order, the “signature block” lists the names of all commissioners.
It shows Welborn, Fielder and Pinocci as signing onto the order; Commissioner Annie Bukacek abstaining in part; and Molnar dissenting in part.
However, Molnar said commissioners voted on amendments but never on “the final order as amended.” And Molnar said saying “yes” or “no” to an amendment isn’t the same thing as saying “yes” or “no” to a final product.
The order itself noted the PSC unanimously voted 5-0 to both extend the deadline to issue the final order, and to authorize “commissioner leadership,” or Welborn and Fielder, to approve the final language.
But in an interview, Pinocci said his “yes” vote in November indicated he supported extending the deadline to view the final order after it was amended — one part of that motion. He said he anticipated he also would have an opportunity to vote on it.
“I’m thinking the final order is going to come in front of us,” Pinocci said.
More questions, confusion
In a series of emails Molnar released publicly, Pinocci noted on Dec. 23 that he was dismayed to learn his vote was reflected in the final order as a “yes,” and that he intended to remain a “no” until a rehearing.
He told the Daily Montanan he had earlier emailed a “no” vote on the order. Commissioners typically vote at publicly noticed meetings, not by email.
“The only conclusion I can logically come to is that ‘leadership’ wanted to use my vote to pass the rate increase using me as their unwitting accomplice,” Pinocci wrote. “ … Even an appointed commission would not sink this low.”
An email on Dec. 24 from Welborn directed staff to “honor email directives in the signature block,” or the list of signers in the order, when making final revisions.
In that email, sent late that morning, Welborn said he and Fielder were marked as approving it; Bukacek was marked as approving in part and abstaining/dissenting in part; and Pinocci and Molnar were marked as dissenting.
But an email that afternoon from PSC Executive Director Alana Lake to commissioners noted Pinocci would be marked as a “yes.” It said the final order would be published by 5 p.m. the same day.
(A separate email from Lake indicated she had explained to Pinocci that he would be listed as a “yes” vote, and it said he understood the reason.)
“Some of you expressed a desire to have your signature removed or specific verbiage reflected,” Lake wrote. “Staff worked very hard to try to accommodate your requests within the parameters of the law and policy.”
Lake also reminded commissioners of the unanimous approval to extend the deadline to issue the final order and allow leadership to review and approve it.
“In the spirit of transparency and public accountability, we cannot, in good faith, reflect sentiments that occur outside a public meeting,” Lake said.
‘No good deed’
In a phone call, Welborn said he believed the process was “abundantly clear” as laid out in the public meeting, and commissioners have a responsibility to understand it.
The vote in November that extended the deadline and gave leadership authority to approve the order was in fact the final vote and always meant to be the final vote, he said.
However, that procedure did not appear to be clear to all commissioners.
In an email about a draft final order in December, Commissioner Bukacek said the draft did not accurately reflect the intent of the commission “because the votes were taken piecemeal … and the commissioner votes varied depending on the portion.”
“Now we are being asked to vote for the combination as a whole,” Bukacek said. “This makes it an inaccurate representation.”
In the email, however, Bukacek suggested a bifurcation of the order for accuracy but said if the final draft didn’t change, her signature should not be on it. Bukacek declined to comment for this story.
An email from a staff member to Bukacek also appeared to indicate a subsequent vote or decision was expected — recommending if Bukacek fundamentally disagreed with any part of the order, she should “have your vote stamped NO.”
In response to the reason commissioners were emailing votes in the case, Welborn said it was a good question, and he could not speculate.
Asked why his email directed staff to “honor email directives,” Welborn said he was doing his best to ensure the final order was something “that honored everybody’s wishes.”
“It’s kind of a no-good-deed-goes-unpunished,” Welborn said.
However, he said, he relied on staff to ensure a sound process, and he is certain “everything was done in accordance with the law.” Now, he said, some commissioners want to change their minds and question the process to boot.
“We’ve got people, commissioners, that are trying to run from their votes, or so it seems,” Welborn said.
Motions for reconsideration due Friday
Molnar said in December, he suggested a work session multiple times to fix the error and hold a final vote, but Welborn did not schedule one. In his dissent in an email, Molnar said he opposes the order as written.
In a phone call, Welborn said he couldn’t recall the details around a work session request, although if it took place, he believes legal staff likely evaluated it and turned it down, based on legal standards.
An email from legal staff on Dec. 19 said a work session could be held on Dec. 24, but only if leadership agreed.
The email said a “delegation of authority” policy allows staff to issue an order “absent an objection from a commissioner,” and commissioners voted in this case to limit the ability to object to leadership.
Vice President Fielder has been leading Public Service Commission meetings rather than Welborn after Molnar’s ousting as president, and Fielder could not be reached for comment for this story.
At the end of the day, however, Welborn said he believes the signatures in the final order accurately reflect the outcome of the votes at the November meeting.
“Regardless of all the back and forth, I guess my question is, ‘Is there a problem with the way the order was written in regards to the way the votes were taken in a public meeting?’” Welborn said.
The final bill
Parties involved in the rate case can file motions to reconsider any part of the case, and those are due on Friday.
A filing that will show impacts to customer bills also is due Friday.
In an email, PSC spokesperson Jamey Petersen explained the reason the impacts on bills wasn’t available in advance of the commission issuing the final order.
“Because this case involved complex disallowances (costs the Commission refused to let the utility recover), the final math depends on a compliance filing by NWE,” Petersen said.
However, Petersen also said the order focuses on which costs were “reasonably incurred” to provide “safe, reliable service.”
“By law, these decisions must be based on the evidence of the utility’s actions rather than a specific target for bill impacts,” Petersen said.
She said NorthWestern Energy must calculate the rates based on the directions in the order, and the PSC will have bill impacts once the filing is “submitted and verified.”
Late on Tuesday, Molnar said he made another attempt the same day to call for a public vote on the rate case, but it only received support from Pinocci.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 20:58:16.199857

Civil immigration arrests would be prohibited within 1,000 feet of state-owned or leased facilities absent a judicial order or warrant under a proposal being developed in the Pennsylvania Senate. 
The move comes in response to increased “warrantless immigration arrests in places that should be safe” by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, according to a cosponsorship memo from state Sen. Amanda Cappelletti (D-Delaware/Montgomery). 
“This has created a chilling effect,” Cappelletti wrote, “discouraging residents from seeking essential services, frightening our communities and undermining public trust in our government.”
Her proposal comes days after demonstrations nationwide over a fatal ICE shooting encounter in Minneapolis. It also follows months of mounting outrage over the surge in arrests and detentions by immigration officers during the past year under the Trump administration, often without due process and in some cases resulting in U.S. citizens being taken into custody. 
The memo dropped just before President Donald Trump’s pledge Tuesday to withhold federal funding from “sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities.” It wasn’t immediately clear what that would mean for Pennsylvanians, given differing interpretations of the classification among sources including the Department of Justice and the Center for Immigration Studies.

A spokesperson for Gov. Josh Shapiro said the governor won’t “hesitate to go back to court if funding for Pennsylvania is threatened.” 
Shapiro’s office has initiated or joined a number of lawsuits during the past year seeking frozen funds from the Trump administration. State Attorney General Dave Sunday, whose office would traditionally lead such litigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cappelletti highlighted New York, Illinois, Connecticut and Washington as states that have similar rules in place; Oregon, Vermont and California do, too. 
Each of those states had already enacted other laws governing ICE cooperation, which Pennsylvania has not, including restrictions on local law enforcement entering agreements with federal immigration officials. There’s active litigation in New York over counties allegedly running afoul of state law there for arrangements formalized in recent months.
Fifty-two agencies in the commonwealth have such contracts in place, according to the federal government, more than double the number as of last summer. They’re known as 287(g) agreements after the section of U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act that provides for the delegation of specific ICE functions to state and local law enforcement. 
Three took effect last week for police departments in Coraopolis, Allegheny County; East Franklin Township, Adams County; and Kittanning, Armstrong County, federal records show.

Cappelletti told the Capital-Star her proposed restrictions on civil immigration arrests would extend to police and other non-federal agents. 
“If you are acting to enforce immigration policy and law, you must have a judicial warrant or order to enter a state facility. And it’s that simple. Whether you’re an official ICE agent working for the federal government or you’re working through that contract, it’s the same principle,” Cappelletti said Tuesday. “If you choose to enforce it elsewhere, that’s another question.” 
The GOP-controlled Senate has passed bills before aimed at fostering – rather than limiting – cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
Lawmakers have advanced proposals to ban or restrict sanctuary designations on multiple occasions during the past decade. 
Last spring, a measure to require ICE notification when undocumented immigrants commit crimes passed the chamber and has since stalled in the Democratic-majority House. 
And SB1021 to enhance penalties for offenses against immigration officers, meanwhile, awaits consideration by the state Senate Judiciary Committee.

Cappelletti said she hopes her colleagues “see the need to ensure that our federal law enforcement officers are indeed acting within the bounds of their duties and within the law.”
“Currently, we know that that is not happening, and it’s creating a lot of terror in our communities,” she said. 
Asked about potential Republican support, Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said through a spokesperson that his caucus will continue to focus on safety and security of communities in the commonwealth.
“Collaboration between state and federal government is critical as we work to recover from the disastrous border policies of the Biden Administration and seek to protect lawful citizens,” Pittman said. 
Cappelletti said she intends to introduce her legislation soon. Some details still are being finalized, including what would qualify as a state facility. 
“It’s very clearly going to include anything that the state owns or leases or that a state entity uses. And that’s a government agency, a public authority or board where the governor or the executive office has appointed the chairperson or the majority of the board members, things of that nature,” Cappelletti told the Capital-Star. “We have those definitions in place. And we’re just looking to see how expansive we might be able to be, or how limited we have to be, depending on case law.” 
State Rep. Manuel Guzman (D-Berks), who’s pushed previously to limit ICE detention and cooperation in Pennsylvania, said he’ll introduce a companion measure in the House.
“Communities … should be able to access state services without fear of unjust enforcement,” Guzman said in an emailed statement. “We must safeguard our communities, uphold Pennsylvania’s authority over its own facilities, and ensure the dignity, safety, and rights of every Pennsylvanian.”

Dan McKee outline his vision for a better Rhode Island, progressive advocates filled the State House rotunda early Tuesday night to provide theirs — one calling on McKee and other state leaders to make more commitments toward reducing homelessness.
Embattled McKee highlights affordability, takes on Trump in 2026 State of State

“We are living in challenging times,” Kevin Simon, director of outreach for the Mathewson Street Church in Providence, told the crowd of 70 people. “This is not the Rhode Island we want, this is not the Rhode Island we hope for.”
It’s the second consecutive year demonstrators have used the governor’s State of the State speech in order to highlight the growing economic disparities and social challenges facing Rhode Islanders through a “People’s State of the State.” 
This year, advocates were able to air their grievances from the center of the State House under an agreement reached in a federal lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Rhode Island after the McKee administration barred protesters from the rotunda during his 2025 State of the State.
Activists didn’t dwell on last year’s State House access issues, instead focusing their attention on what to do for homeless Rhode Islanders in the middle of winter. Simon reminded the crowd that volunteers counted at least 2,373 unhoused individuals across the state during the annual Point in Time Count last January. It was a 2.8% decrease from the record high of 2,442 in 2024, but still too high for Simon’s liking.
“That number should be zero,” he said. 
Here are the policy changes advocates want to see from state leaders:

More warming centers, even more oversight
The 2025 Point in Time census of Rhode Island’s unhoused population found 618 people were without any shelter across the state — a 15.7% increase over 2024.
Advocates demanded the state to expand the network of emergency warming centers beyond what the $1.7 million grants the state’s Executive Office of Housing allocated to groups last fall to support such spaces, along with increasing the number of seasonal shelter beds.
That included $200,000 given to the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, which used the money toward its newly created No One Dies (NOD) program, where local churches open their doors as overnight warming centers during extreme weather.
The initiative launched Dec. 5, and the State Council of Churches has already spent nearly half of its allocation, said Harrison Tuttle, a warming center coordinator for the organization. In the last several weeks, he said over 400 people have experienced “a new standard of care.”
“It’s been led with compassion and the expertise of some of the best outreach workers in the state,” Tuttle said in an interview.
Though advocates organized by the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project commended the state for its recent investment, speakers at the protest claimed people staying overnight at some shelters and warming centers have been mistreated. They alleged many spaces lack any place to store belongings, sanitary showers and bathrooms. One speaker told the crowd when she stayed at Crossroads Rhode Island’s emergency shelter in Providence, she had to sleep on a table.
“It was humiliating and uncalled for,” she said.
To ensure quality control across the state’s network, advocates said they want to see the Executive Office of Housing increase inspections and oversight of the warming centers and shelters. 
A spokesperson for the office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on advocates’ proposal.

ECHO Villages across Rhode Island
To ensure fewer Rhode Islanders are without shelter, advocates called on the state to construct more rapidly deployable sites like ECHO Village —  the community of 45 tiny cabin shelters that opened in February 2025 off Route 146 in Providence.
While quick to assemble, ECHO Village cabins sat empty for over a year as officials struggled to figure out how they fit into the state’s fire and building codes, which had no category for the shelters.
ECHO Village originally had a one-year lease through fall 2025. State officials extended it through the end of September 2026.
To ensure delays never happen again for any similar type of shelter project, lawmakers last year approved legislation that would exempt municipalities from fire and building codes for 180 days, so long as a city or town declares an emergency, to construct temporary shelters.
Continue placing “Housing First”
Advocates say state leaders have insufficiently addressed the root cause of homelessness across the state: a perceived lack of permanent housing for very low-income households.
Permanent supportive housing is a cornerstone of the “Housing First” model, which prioritizes providing immediate housing without preconditions, such as sobriety or treatment programs, to stabilize lives of residents. An estimated 1,500 Rhode Islanders now live in such housing units.
McKee’s “RI 2030″ plan calls for adding 350 more units with services plus 500 deeply subsidized units by 2030. 
“We can’t wait until 2030 — we need to be looking at ways to solve this now before we start to lose more friends,” Simon said. “So many Rhode Islanders are one medical emergency or paycheck away from being homeless.”
But there’s a big question mark over just how many units can be added as the Trump administration fights to shift more federal funding to programs that tie housing to accountability.
A group of democratic-led states, along with another coalition of communities and homeless care providers, sought a preliminary injunction after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a Nov. 13 Notice of Funding Opportunity that would have capped how much of the $3.9 billion grant program could be used for permanent supportive housing at 30%. 
That policy is on pause after a federal judge ordered HUD to keep its “Housing First” approach for now as lawsuits filed against the Trump administration by the Rhode Island Council of Churches and a coalition of blue states continue to play out. However, HUD’s revised funding notice released Jan. 8 stated it would go back to its original 30% funding cap if the Trump administration wins the legal battle.

End alleged police harassment 
Exacerbating the homelessness crisis, at least in Providence, advocates say is the “misguided” policy of allowing police to continue to raid homeless encampments.
The Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project gathered outside the capital city’s Public Safety Complex last February to protest incidents between police and homeless individuals reported at the Mathewson Street Church.
At the time, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office said the city was “deeply committed to addressing homelessness through a comprehensive, collaborative approach.” Since then, there have been fewer incidents outside the church, Simon said. But issues still persist elsewhere in Providence.
Danny Griffiths, who has been unhoused for most of the past 20 years, claimed he was jumped by three police officers in August 2025.
“I got assaulted,” he said. “They didn’t ask me my name, didn’t ask me nothing.”
Griffiths is now recovering from drug addiction and said he’s still stopped by police even as he’s started to get back on his feet. He wants problem officers to be held accountable.
“We can do great things, all we need is a nudge,” Griffiths told the crowd.
Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Smiley’s office said in an emailed statement Tuesday that  “the city has a process when an encampment is reported by a member of the public or another entity. “This involves a multi-department approach of which Providence Police are one piece.”
“Many encampments are addressed through the work of outreach partners prior to engagement from city departments,” Vega added. “This approach follows all city and state laws and national best practices.”
Advocates demanded that the state, particularly the Rhode Island Office of Attorney General, end the “unconstitutional actions.”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment Tuesday night.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins underscored the force of the Republican supermajority and its 2025 policy wins in his response to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s final State of the State address.
Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, also promised solutions to cost of living issues, health care woes and academic outcomes in K-12 schools during the 2026 legislative session, where Republicans maintained an 88-37 advantage in the House and a 31-9 margin in the Senate.
Kelly’s State of the State speech was part victory lap, part warning. Kelly, who will leave office at the end of 2026, celebrated enticing the Kansas City Chiefs, who will move from Missouri to play in a new stadium in five years, and her seven years in office. And she cautioned against accepting uncivil political discourse as the norm.
It’s Hawkins’ final State of the State response, too, which he prerecorded ahead of Kelly’s address Tuesday. He is running for state insurance commissioner. His rebuttal touted tax relief legislation, and he spoke of prioritizing quality K-12 schools, housing and roads.


Three things, he said, have made a difference in the state budget.
One: A focus on efficiency inspired by the Trump administration’s DOGE, or department of government efficiency. Two: Investing in government functions such as schools, roads, public safety and water. And three: Reducing state spending.
His 2024 speech was laden with critiques of Kelly and the Biden administration, and he vowed at the time to focus on shrinking government, reining in energy costs, improving civil services and cracking down on communist China.
Two years later, he threw fewer jabs. He criticized Kelly for “covering up waste, fraud and abuse” in the state budget and “massive” spending proposals. However, the Republican majority was, by its own authority, responsible in 2025 for proposing, negotiating and passing the state budget.
“The bottom line is we are focusing on the core services of government and doing those things right,” he said. “We’re putting people first, and it’s working. This past year alone, we reduced state spending by over $200 million.”
That figure is in contrast to the 2024-2025 state budget.
Republicans actually reduced spending by $38 million last year compared to the governor’s proposed 2025-2026 budget, according to numbers confirmed in August by his staff.
Hawkins said schools were the Legislature’s No. 1 budget priority. Republicans historically have not always put forth proposals that fully fund public schools, however. He voiced support for a proposed bipartisan cellphone ban in K-12 schools, hypothesizing it could improve test scores.
Health care, he said, is another priority.
“It’s beyond frustrating to see enormous federal and state government funding pumped into the system, and yet costs keep skyrocketing, and middle class families are forced to keep paying more,” he said.
Hawkins has opposed Medicaid expansion in Kansas, which has shown in some states to lower state and consumer costs.
The solutions Hawkins sees include improving hospital reimbursements, enhancing telemedicine, improving hospital pricing transparency, lowering prescription costs and creating oversight for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, a $50 billion program established in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to offset the bill’s cuts to rural health providers. He said the fund, if used wisely, has the ability to rightsize health care for rural Kansas communities.”
“Payouts to big hospital systems and programs based on buzzwords instead of actual care, as some have suggested, are not going to cut it,” he said.
He said the 2026 Legislature, “as part of our people-first agenda,” will concentrate on cost of living concerns, including housing, insurance and utility costs.
Hawkins promised to modify tort law to lower insurance costs and deregulate single-family home building to lower housing costs. Quality and affordable housing was identified as a major need, especially in rural communities, in the state’s 2021 Housing Needs Assessment. A growing population and the compounded effects of the 2008 recession have created a housing shortage in Kansas. The Legislature last year passed legislation that will whittle down the state’s low-income housing tax credit program, which helped fund the construction and rehabilitation of low-income rental housing, until it is discontinued in 2028.
Hawkins, who has served 13 years in the Legislature, ended his response by committing Republicans to having Kansans’ backs.
“When I look out on our great state, I see the challenges we face,” he said. “But we’ve faced challenges before.”
Bleeding Kansas, grasshopper plagues, ice storms, prairie fires, tornadoes and the dust bowl, to name a few, he said.
“But Kansas remains undefeated,” he said. “We dust ourselves off, and we confront our problems head on, and we carry on.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1120203-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-13 20:58:16.199857

I’m Dan Hawkins, Speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives. Serving you in the people’s house in Topeka is a privilege, and what an added honor it is to speak with you and others all across the great state tonight.
Two years ago, I had the honor to deliver this address. At that time, I told you about the Republican Better Way plan, our commitment to put Kansas families first by protecting our communities, honoring the value of work and making Kansas the greatest state in the nation to live, work, raise a family and retire. Two years later, I want to share with you our success stories and highlight where we go from here. The issue I hear the most about these days is cost of living.
Quite frankly, the Biden administration sent inflation skyrocketing, making it nearly impossible for families to make ends meet. Republicans in your state House and Senate have been taking decisive action because we share your concerns about taxes, inflation and the cost of living. As part time citizen legislators who live and work in places like Dodge City, Wichita, Hays and Overland Park, we feel the same real world pressures you do.
So what can be done about it at the state level? Let’s start with taxes.
In the last two years, as a Republican majority, we eliminated the state portion of your property tax for 2026. We eliminated the state sales tax on groceries. We lowered state income tax rates. We repealed the state income tax on Social Security, and we increased child tax credits. That’s real tax relief to lower your cost of living. And believe me, we’re not done looking for ways to further address property tax issues, as government spending at the local level is too often rising even faster than inflation.
Of course, the other part of the story is that taxes are directly related to spending, so we’ve also been wrangling the state budget to bring it under control. Three things are making a big difference on our budget. First, while Governor Kelly continues to do everything in her power to cover up the waste, fraud and abuse in government welfare programs, the Republican majority is successfully pushing for greater transparency and efficiency in order to make better use of every tax dollar. This means really looking under the hood when it comes to government programs and doing things like removing folks who are deceased or illegal immigrant enrollees from welfare programs so the cost of health insurance doesn’t keep rising. Every fraudulent dollar spent by the government is a dollar out of your pocket. It must end.
Second we’re investing wisely in core state government functions, like schools, roads, the state water program and public safety, so they are stronger and better. In my first term as Speaker, I established the House water committee. That committee has already established long-term funding for the state water program, prioritized the revitalization of outdated infrastructure, and are implementing a strategy to ensure Kansas water resources are sustainable long into the future.
When we eliminate absurd and unnecessary spending, we put the money where it counts. We can focus on the true budget priorities and do those things better, avoiding unnecessary costs down the road. Finally, we’re resisting massive new government spending programs like those repeatedly proposed by Governor Kelly. Enough is enough. You will never get government spending under control if you keep adding new programs.
The bottom line is we are focusing on the core services of government and doing those things right. We’re putting people first, and it’s working. This past year alone, we reduced state spending by over $200 million.
Now let’s talk about our kids for a moment and how we can secure a bright future for them in our state. Schools are our number one budget priority, with billions invested each year. But money is only one piece of the education equation. To make the best use of our K-12 spending and to help kids succeed, it’s time to address the issue of electronics in the classroom. In 2023, Florida passed the classroom cell phone ban. Since taking this step, both student test scores and school attendance have improved. We have to be honest. We all know cell phones are a distraction. Kids spending all day looking at their phones and addictive social media is not a recipe for success. We need better academic results for our kids, and getting cell phones out of the classroom is one meaningful approach we should adopt now in Kansas.
Another issue the legislature is focused on is health care. It’s beyond frustrating to see enormous federal and state government funding pumped into the system, and yet costs keep skyrocketing, and middle class families are forced to keep paying more. In Kansas, we’re taking a strategic approach that focuses on actual solutions to root problems, things like improving reimbursements for hospitals, enhancing telemedicine options and creating meaningful oversight of the Rural Health Transformation Fund, which, if used wisely, has the ability to right size health care for rural Kansas communities. Payouts to big hospital systems and programs based on buzz words instead of actual care, as some have suggested, are not going to cut it.
Next up, it’s critically important to improve transparency in hospital pricing so people can be empowered to hold the health care industry accountable, and we must find bipartisan solutions to end the abuse of federal programs intended to lower prescription costs in places like rural Kansas, but instead end up lining the pockets of big corporate health systems.
Finally, as part of our people-first agenda, we’ll be concentrating on housing, insurance and utility costs in the coming months. We must eliminate red tape and over regulation so single-family homes can be built more quickly and affordably. We will work on tort reform efforts to bring down insurance costs, and we will rein in the big rate increases proposed by the electric monopolies. A balanced approach is essential to address cost of living concerns.
This will be my final year as Speaker of the House. It’s a position I never imagined I would hold. I truly love the state of Kansas, and know it is the best state in the union.
When I look out on our great state, I see the challenges we face. But we’ve faced challenges before. This was the location of Bleeding Kansas that sparked the war that divided our nation. We faced grasshopper plagues, ice storms, prairie fires, tornadoes and the Dust Bowl. But Kansas remains undefeated. We dust ourselves off, and we confront our problems head on, and we carry on. To the stars through difficulties isn’t just a motto. It’s who we are.
Republicans in the State House remain committed to having your back and putting the policies in place that help us excel as a state, but it’s not the elected officials who make Kansas great. It’s the farmers, engineers, aviation innovators, teachers, soldiers, skilled laborers, techies, small business owners and cowboys. It’s the people, and the people of Kansas will excel as long as the government stays out of their way. That is truly the better way. God bless you your families and God bless the Free State of Kansas.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1080142-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-13 20:58:16.199857

The Alaska Court System is offering waivers for court filing fees for eligible Alaskans on that day. 
The Alaska Bar Association, in coordination with the Alaska Court System, Alaska Legal Services Corporation, the ACLU of Alaska and local bar associations are offering free legal services, as well as free transportation to the Anchorage event. 
“By offering free legal assistance on this day, Alaska attorneys honor Dr. King’s legacy by helping remove barriers to justice and supporting Alaskans who need it most,” said Lea McKenna, pro bono director of the Alaska Bar Association in a news release. 
Volunteer attorneys will be available for free, confidential legal assistance for Alaskans for civil  — that is, non-criminal — legal matters, including divorce and family law, landlord-tenant issues, probate, consumer or debt issues, or public benefits including disaster relief applications. 
Every year, an estimated 75% of low-income Alaskans experience at least one civil legal issue, according to data compiled by the Alaska Legal Services Corporation, a nonprofit that offers free civil legal services, said McKenna in a phone interview on Tuesday. 
“A lot of people, they don’t seek help because they don’t know where to find it, or they don’t know that the problem they have is actually a legal problem, or they just decide to deal with the problem themselves,” she said. “And this can lead to a lot of instability in people being evicted from their homes, losing employment, or losing custody of a child. So providing these resources to help close that access to justice gap is absolutely critical.” 
McKenna said there is also a high demand for attorneys in Alaska. The Alaska Legal Services Corporation reports each year they have to turn away about 50% of eligible individuals due to limited capacity and resources. 
“Here in Alaska, there’s what we refer to as legal deserts, which are communities where there’s no, or a very low percentage of attorneys per person available,” she said. “And so one of the goals of these clinics is to kind of help close that access to justice gap, by providing brief legal services in the form of advice, consultations and advice for people on a drop-in basis.” 
This year on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, residents impacted by ex-Typhoon Halong who need disaster-related legal help can consult with attorneys on their application for state and federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, in person in Anchorage and Bethel. 
Attorneys can help with disaster assistance applications, proof of damages, appealing denials, or help apply for more aid if needed for storm damage and recovery, McKenna noted.
Residents must apply to both state and federal assistance programs to qualify for disaster relief. The application deadline for disaster assistance has been extended to Feb. 20. 
The events will also offer language interpretation services. In Anchorage, a free shuttle service will be provided from the Brother Francis Shelter and the 56th Ave. Cold Weather Shelter. 
Ongoing legal resources
For legal assistance beyond Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Alaskans can access ongoing legal information and assistance for civil issues online with Alaska Free Legal Answers at Alaska.FreeLegalAnswers.org. Attorneys with the Alaska Bar Association are available to provide free, confidential support and answer questions via email. The association also offers legal resources and information on upcoming events on their website. 
The Alaska Court System offers legal resources and services for navigating the courts through their Access to Justice office, which includes the Family Law Self-Help Center.
Additional legal resources can be found at AlaskaLawHelp.org, provided by the Alaska Legal Services Corporation.

Bob Ferguson on Tuesday celebrated the “heart and spirit” in Washington communities ravaged by flooding in December, then pumped up fellow Democrats with calls for taxing millionaires and standing up to federal immigration agents whose actions he deemed “unjust.”
In his second address to the Legislature, Ferguson avoided the sticky topic of a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. He focused instead on the lives upended by the storms and those on the front lines of the response. He then hit on topics resonating strongly in the ranks of Democratic lawmakers.
“When the story of this historic flood is written, it will recognize that when history paid us an unexpected visit in December of 2025, the people and this state stepped up and faced the challenge head-on,” the first-term Democrat said in a half-hour speech delivered in the House chamber. “It’s that heart and spirit of our people that allows me to report today that the state of our state remains strong.”
Democrats applauded his proposals to put more money into maintaining the state’s transportation system, building more ferries, constructing affordable housing and sustaining early learning education with philanthropic help from billionaire Steve Ballmer.
They rose and roared with approval of Ferguson’s embrace of taxing the income of millionaire earners. They did so again when he said he wanted to see a bill barring federal immigration agents from shielding their identities when operating in the state. He called for that bill to be delivered to his desk “immediately so I can sign it into law.”
These reactions were a far cry from 2025. Last year, many Democrats, who hold majorities in both chambers of the Legislature, grimaced throughout much of the new governor’s reform-minded inaugural speech.
“I think the reaction that you saw from the Democratic caucus is he hit on the topics we care about,” said Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, who is caucus chair.
Ferguson, as he did a year ago, namechecked Republican lawmakers involved in bipartisan legislation he supports concerning veterans, reckless driving and affordable housing.
But it evoked little response from GOP members, unlike a year ago, when Republicans’ praise overflowed for what they heard. 
“He’s not nearly as friendly to us as he was last year,” said Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, who last year lauded Ferguson’s address because “he focused on the real tasks ahead and avoided rampant partisanship.”
Here are 5 takeaways from Ferguson’s address. 
Left unsaid
Ferguson never mentioned the looming multibillion-dollar budget shortfall. Erasing it is arguably the most important and difficult task that he and lawmakers face in the 60-day session.
He’s proposed across-the-board spending cuts, siphoning $1 billion from the state’s emergency reserves and shifting nearly $600 million in revenues from the state’s auctions of air pollution allowances to make ends meet. Teachers, health care workers, and environmentalists — core constituencies in the Democratic Party base — are among the loudest critics.

“We’re trying to make the budgetary reality line up with some of the poetry that we heard today,” said Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle. “We govern in prose. We write our budgets with hard arithmetic. It’s going to require additional revenue, which we did not hear a lot of support for today.”
Scott said he appreciated Ferguson’s pitch to get more students and families to seek federal financial aid for college.
“It is hard to square that with the governor’s budget proposing a 3% cut across the board” for the University of Washington, he said. Cutting higher education does not line up with the values of constituents in his district, which is home to the university.
A historic session?
Enacting a tax on millionaire earners would be a historic achievement, Ferguson said.
“Our system takes too much in taxes from hardworking families and not enough from the wealthy. That’s not fair. That’s not right,” he said.
There’s no legislation yet proposing the tax. Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, are the sponsors and it is getting written up. Pedersen confirmed Tuesday that the basics of the legislation are still expected to involve a 9.9% tax on income over $1 million, excluding capital gains.
Ferguson made clear in his speech that most of the revenue from the tax, which could total as much as $3 billion a year, must be put back “in the pockets of Washingtonians.”
He wants the money used to expand eligibility for and increase the amount of the Working Families Tax Credit, which goes to low- and middle-income households, and to lower taxes on small business owners. Another chunk should go into the K-12 public school system, he said.
Democrats like the idea. Republicans are dug in against it. It isn’t going to be easy, but Ferguson urged the Legislature to “seize this opportunity” to make the tax system more fair.
Storm recovery
The financial toll for residents and infrastructure from the December storms will be costly and recovery will take months, in some cases years. But Ferguson didn’t, as he has before, talk about how he’ll make the most “persuasive” case to secure federal aid from a Trump administration that denied the state’s aid request following a destructive 2024 wind storm.

Instead, he heaped praise on the response of public agencies and local governments.
“Government gets its share of criticism. But it’s only fair to stop and notice when government delivers, especially under the most challenging and stressful circumstances,” he said. “We were not passive observers of a historic event.”
ICE top of mind, Trump unmentioned.
Surprisingly, Ferguson never mentioned President Donald Trump or the Republican-controlled Congress. 
But he took direct aim at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, tagging it as one of the “external challenges that create division and costs to our state, our families and our communities.”
“We need to be direct about what is happening in our country and our state with ICE. It’s horrific, it’s unjust, and it needs to stop, now,” he said. 
Republican perspective
Legislative Republicans saw Ferguson’s speech as a departure from the bipartisan tone he struck last year. When he took office, they were hopeful he’d be more of a centrist than his predecessor. 
Those hopes were heavily dashed when he signed billions of dollars in new and increased taxes into law to help fill last year’s budget shortfall. 
“I guess we will never know which Bob Ferguson we’re getting any day of week,” Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, told reporters. “When he took office last year, it looked like he wanted to be a Democrat Dan Evans that Washingtonians remember for generations, and now he looks like a governor desperate to shore up his base.”
Last year, Republicans were delighted to hear Ferguson cite several of their policy priorities in his address, including new grants to hire more police officers. This year, the Republican-backed bills Ferguson mentioned were mostly noncontroversial policies likely to pass anyway, Stokesbary said. 
The speech signals to Republicans that they’re in for “58 and a half days of fight over what it means for state government to clear the path for people to live prosperous lives here,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ferguson-State-of-State-2026-2-1024x769.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 20:58:16.199857

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A bill making it easier to convict drunken drivers advanced unanimously to the Senate floor on the opening day of the 2026 session, signifying legislators are serious about making changes after years of failed efforts. 
The bipartisan legislation would remove loopholes that can allow driving under the influence charges to get tossed over minor videotaping issues and strengthen penalties when the driver injures someone else. 
Victims of drunken driving rarely receive justice, said Steven Burritt, who leads South Carolina’s chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
“This is the best opportunity we’ve seen in a while to finally do something substantial that maybe would make a difference,” he told the SC Daily Gazette following Tuesday’s vote by the full Senate Judiciary Committee.
The bill, initially pre-filed in December 2024, saw no movement at all last year. But on senators’ first day back in 2026, they fast-tracked it from subcommittee to full committee to the floor.
South Carolina stands out as having the nation’s highest drunken driving fatality rate, according to a 2024 report from MADD’s state chapter. That reflects 474 DUI deaths in 2022, the fifth-highest number overall and worst rate based on population, according to the report. 
Nearly half of all fatal crashes in South Carolina involve a drunken driver, according to the South Carolina Department of Public Safety. 
“It’s very important to pull South Carolina up from the bottom,” said Laura Slade Hudson, executive director of the South Carolina Crime Victims Council. “We need to stop the gamesmanship that takes on in the courtroom, and that’s what this bill attempts to do.”
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey made clear ahead of the session’s start that tightening the state’s DUI laws is a priority this year.  
The state needs to “make those criminal penalties more severe, try to crack down on the number of injuries and fatalities we’re having on South Carolina’s roadways,” he said last Wednesday during the Senate GOP Caucus’ question-and-answer session with reporters. “The fact is that our laws are way too weak, and there are too many people getting hurt because of it.”
State law requires an officer to videotape a drunken driving arrest in its entirety, starting from the moment officers activate their blue lights, to include a roadside sobriety test and a breath test, if the driver takes one.
Prosecutors have been pushing for changes for over a decade, saying the requirements result in drunken drivers escaping conviction just because an officer’s audio malfunctioned or the person stepped out of the camera’s frame during their sobriety test.  
Under the proposed change, video that “substantially complies” with the filming requirements could convict. 
The bill also adds a mid-level punishment possibility. Causing “moderate bodily injury” would be a second-degree felony that could send a driver to prison for up to 10 years. That can include fractures or dislocations, injuries that need to be treated with anesthesia, or if the victim loses consciousness for a “prolonged” period, according to the bill.
Existing law makes DUI a felony if the driver seriously injures or kills someone else, which can result in up to 15 years or 25 years in prison, respectively.
“If the penalty is low, it is not a deterrent for them hurting you,” Massey, R-Edgefield, said during the committee meeting.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3870-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 20:58:16.199857

That was until 12:52 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 10, when he posted an antisemitic video on Instagram.
“A Jew in my backyard, I can’t believe my Jew crow didn’t work,” an animated Disney-Princess-esque character says to a short yellow figure with a long nose. “You’re getting baptized right now.”
About two hours later, Pittman is alleged to have driven to synagogue, the Beth Israel Congregation in northeast Jackson, where federal authorities say he used an ax to break through one of the windows. Once inside, Pittman is alleged to have doused the lobby with gasoline and set it on fire with a torch. 
The flames reduced the historic synagogue’s library and administrative offices to charred ruins — and burned his hands in the process.

Federal authorities say Pittman laughed when he told his father what he did, boasting about finally getting “them.” 
Pittman is facing state and federal arson charges, including elevated hate crime charges at the state level. The federal criminal complaint says he admitted to law enforcement that he targeted the synagogue for its “Jewish ties.” 
Previous local news reports show Pittman, who goes by his middle name, was a multi-year honor roll student and varsity baseball player at St. Joseph Catholic School in Madison. After graduating in 2024, Pittman attended Coahoma Community College in the Mississippi Delta, where he played on the baseball team. 
The federal criminal complaint detailing Pittman’s alleged crime stands in stark contrast to the aspirational and seemingly comfortable life documented on social media by the suburban student-athlete from one of Mississippi’s wealthiest cities.  
Pittman has posted regularly on his X account, often about baseball and Christianity. Many posts pair videos of him practicing his swing in a batting cage with a captioned Bible verse. 
His most recent post, on Jan. 6, links to a website called One Purpose, which describes itself as a faith-based community for men focused on “​​Scripture-backed fitness. Brotherhood accountability. Life-expectancy maxxing.”
“Maxxing” refers to a trend, popularized on sites like TikTok and Youtube, where people talk about maximizing certain aspects of their lives — most often physical appearance, health or wealth. 
This photo provided to Mississippi Today, of a Snapchat account labeled “Spencer,” shows Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, who has been indicted on a state charge of first-degree arson in the Jan. 10, 2026, fire that heavily damaged Mississippi’s largest synagogue.
Mississippi Today reviewed the site’s domain, which showed that the website was created on Dec. 5 and registered to a Stephen Pittman in Madison. 
A number listed under the domain name has been disconnected, and efforts to reach Pittman’s family and his court-appointed attorney on Tuesday were unsuccessful. His court-appointed federal public defenders did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.
The site Pittman promoted days before he allegedly committed a shocking act of antisemitic violence offers a window into his beliefs. Court records, a review of Pittman’s online activity, and an interview with a longtime friend also paint a portrait of how he spent his time and his worldview, one that appears to have been informed by internet subcultures weaving between fitness, finance and Christian Identity. 
With reports showing an increase in antisemitic content and encounters on social media, researchers argue that a review of a suspect’s digital footprint can provide insight into their motive.
Sheep or Shepherd? 
The One Purpose website, which culminates with an offer of a $99 per month membership subscription, is a mishmash of pop self-improvement fads alongside religious references. 
A bar at the top of the site shows a number shifting back and forth between 240 and 245 “brothers building their temples right now,” a reference to the supposed number of paying subscribers.
The top of the site advertises 96 scripture lessons for free next to a beaming yellow button that asks users to begin their “transformation.” A click of that button opens a prompt that asks the user to select whether they are a Shepherd or a Sheep, a biblical metaphor that contrasts those who lead through divine guidance and those who are easily lost and dependent on others. 
“This is a pivotal moment,” the site says. “Will you follow the crowd or lead with purpose?”
The Shepherd button directs the user to answer questions about what ails them, such as a lack of confidence, discipline or energy. The user then selects from a list what “wordly methods” they’ve used to change, such as diets or workout routines. The user is prompted to imagine a transformed version of himself. Eventually, the prompt asks for the user’s information to create a personalized “temple plan.”
The user is directed to a “biblical nutrition” plan touting the “Seven Species of Israel,” including wheat, pomegranate and honey. 
Pittman’s emphasis on a puritanical diet extends to his broader online footprint, one that shows he was not simply a passive consumer of content but also encouraged others to engage with his corner of the internet. 
Stacks of cash, diet fads and ‘how to destroy a society’
Pittman appeared to have multiple social media pages, including duplicate accounts on various platforms.
Mississippi Today reviewed Pittman’s social media activity and interviewed one of Pittman’s longtime school friends. The person was granted anonymity to share details from Pittman’s social media activity and their personal interactions. To verify the person’s connection to Pittman, Mississippi Today cross-referenced screenshots of messages Pittman sent the person with other screenshots of Pittman’s Snapchat username. 
Of all his accounts, Pittman seemed to be most prolific on Snapchat. So much so, he even posted a photo of himself in the hospital with burnt hands, allegedly after setting fire to the synagogue.  
According to the friend, Pittman has “changed a lot” in recent years, living an extremely online existence. The friend said Pittman posts 10-15 Snapchats a day, often documenting his interest in diet trends, fitness, expensive cars and thousands of dollars in cash he claimed to have made through an artificial intelligence platform.
“He posts about either him eating the kind of food that’ll make him really ripped, or his money stuff, or him driving his Porsche or his dad’s Porsche,” the friend said. 
Pittman also frequently posted his fitness regimen, the friend said. He would post about “testosterone optimization” and videos of himself cracking raw eggs into his mouth. His physical regimen also included injecting himself with steroids, the person said.
“He was probably like, ‘OK, I’m gonna get jacked’ or whatever,” the friend said. “And he definitely did steroids, because he posts him putting needles into himself.” 
Themes such as diet, masculinity and fitness frequently co-occur in online spaces associated with the “manosphere” and Christian nationalist-adjacent subcultures, where physical strength, dietary “purity” and hormonal optimization are framed as markers of masculinity and discipline.
The friend said Pittman never talked much about politics, and that is supported by his Instagram page, which shows little engagement with notable political figures.
On Instagram, Pittman described himself as an entrepreneur, a follower of Christ and a “lawyer” of God. His bio includes an Italian flag and dove emojis.
He follows hundreds of accounts, suggesting he was an avid user, including baseball accounts, well-known rappers like Drake and Playboi Carti, President Donald Trump, an account devoted to “Catholic hopecore content,” several motivational accounts and pages about conspiracy theories. 
Pittman also posted photos on his Instagram account showing a Porsche, jewelry, stacks of dollar bills and a reference to an AI venture.
“Link in bio, start making passive income with less than 10 minutes a day, Crazy ROI, 300k views and you’ve already been repaid for the ai. Stop being lazy get started today,” Pittman wrote, linking to a now broken webpage. 
The content on Pittman’s Instagram shifted in the fall of 2025. Prior to that, Pittman would often go months between posting, and all of his photos were about baseball or his friends, such as pictures of him at bat or in the outfield.
“We have brotherly bonds that couldn’t be broken,” he wrote in May 2022 about his high school baseball team. 
But on Dec. 13, Pittman posted a slideshow of photos, the first one seemingly of him holding his middle finger up to multiple stacks of $100 bills. “Money is the root of all evil,” he wrote in the caption. “Hate hates growth.” 
More bizarre posts followed. A video of him driving with the hashtags “bullish,” “ecom,” “clipping,” and “dropshipping.” On Dec. 23, he posted a video of himself stuffing multiple $20 bills into a Salvation Army donation box. 
The next day, he uploaded a video of his hand on the steering wheel of a car, listening to a Chief Keef song, a post he captioned “How to destroy a society: Make discipline cringe. Make truth offensive. Make masculinity shameful. Make femininity weak. Make families unstable. Make loyalty rare. Make education manipulation.” 
Earlier this month, four days before he posted the antisemitic video, Pittman posted a bullet point list of recommendations for a “Christian Diet,” including raw milk, raw eggs, raw honey, raw oysters, raw nuts and “Only God-made fats,” such as olive oil, butter, lard and ghee. 
Influencers in online spaces popular with young men interested in masculinity, diet fads and faith can sometimes blend self-improvement content with ideological messaging, portraying modern society as decadent or feminized, some analysts have noted.  
Pittman also created a second Instagram account, with the first post in July 2025, to promote free fitness routines that he would create for clients if they DMed him the word “SHRED.” His videos included photos of him flexing in front of mirrors and frying red meat and eggs. 
But in between all of the newfangled fads Pittman seemed to embrace, a professed devotion to God seemed to remain at the center of his pursuits. 
‘Synagogue of Satan’ and Christian Identity 
After Pittman was arrested at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, where he had sought treatment for burns, investigators said he admitted to starting the fire at Beth Israel, which he called the “synagogue of Satan.”
It was not the first time the Jackson congregation had been targeted, and it was not the first time that phrase was directed at a Jewish house of worship in Mississippi. Jewish people make up a small percentage of Mississippi residents. Although Beth Israel is the state’s largest Jewish congregation, it has only about 150 families as members.
“Synagogue of Satan” is a phrase used by followers of Christian Identity, a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity, to refer to Jews. In Mississippi in the 1960s, it was also adopted by the Ku Klux Klan, which in 1967 bombed Beth Israel Synagogue over its rabbi’s support for civil rights.

Christian Identity is a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity that teaches that Adam and Eve were white, that non-whites were created on the Sixth Day with the animals and have no souls, and that Jews are the offspring of Satan. Christian Identity teaches that white people are the true Israelites and that Jews are impostors.
More recently, the phrase has been adopted by figures such as Candace Owens, the right-wing commentator who has used the phrase and suggested there are people “who are pretending to be Jews, but are in fact people that worship Satan.”
Pittman, who is scheduled to return to federal court for a preliminary hearing Jan. 20, first appeared on Monday afternoon via video conference from a hospital, accompanied by a public defender. 
Aside from answering the judge’s questions, the young man did not speak. At times during the proceedings, he appeared to be leaning back in his chair, gazing away from the camera. Both his hands were heavily bandaged.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Assembly’s 80 members kicked off a new two-year session Tuesday with 12 newcomers, a wider Democratic majority, and calls from legislative leaders of both parties for more bipartisan cooperation as politics becomes increasingly divisive.
Assemblyman Louis Greenwald (D-Camden), the lower chamber’s majority leader since 2012, told those gathered at the Patriots Theater at the Trenton War Memorial that the public’s growing disillusionment with government should spur politicians to find common ground.
“We must remember that politics is not supposed to be a bloodsport. It’s about trying to work through our differences with civility and respect,” Greenwald said.

Assemblyman John DiMaio (R-Warren), the lower chamber’s minority party leader since 2022, echoed that sentiment, saying legislators most urgently need to cooperate to solve a growing energy affordability crisis across the state.
But DiMaio’s speech was more battle cry than peace offering.
“We will work with the majority on what makes sense for New Jersey, and we will fight clearly, loudly, and unapologetically when we’re alone,” DiMaio said. “No one party owns this institution. That is not obstruction. That is democracy.”
All 80 seats in the Assembly were on the ballot in November. The Assembly members sworn in on Tuesday included 68 incumbents and 12 first-termers, including five who flipped GOP seats to give the Democrats a two-thirds supermajority in the Legislature’s lower chamber. Democrats hold a 57-23 majority in the Assembly (the party retains its 25-15 majority in the state Senate.)
After November’s election, Assembly lost five female incumbents but picked up three female newcomers: Assemblywomen Maureen Rowan (D-Atlantic), Marisa Sweeney (D-Morris), and Katie Brennan (D-Hudson).
The other first-term Assembly members, all Democrats, sworn in were: Anthony Angelozzi in Burlington County’s 8th District; Eduardo Rodriguez in Union County’s 20th District; Vincent Kearney and Andrew Macurdy in Union County’s 21st District; Chigozie Onyema in Essex County’s 28th District; Jerry Walker in Hudson County’s 31st District; Ravinder Bhalla in Hudson County’s 32nd District; Larry Wainstein in Hudson County’s 33rd District; and Kenyatta Stewart in Passaic County’s 35th District.





















































































Assemblyman Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), the longest-serving Assembly speaker in state history, on Tuesday began his fifth term at the helm of that chamber.

Assembly leaders of both parties told members that affordability will be their most pressing priority.
Home ownership remains out of reach for many New Jersey residents, Greenwald said.
“If we ever want to stop the brain drain and fully utilize and realize the return on our investment in public education, we must make it affordable for young people to stay in New Jersey. We must bring the American dream back within the reach of every single New Jerseyan, and not just those at the very top,” Greenwald said.
DiMaio took his time onstage to blast his Democratic colleagues for tax rebate programs and other policies he said have made New Jersey less affordable.
“Our Democratic friends believe that affordability starts with taking more people’s money and creating new programs to give some of it back, new agencies, new acronyms, new hoops for residents to jump through just to reclaim some of what they have already earned,” DiMaio said. “Republicans believe affordability starts by not taking that money in the first place. That difference shows up everywhere. It shows up in a budget process where spending continues to grow year after year, programs expand without discipline, and last-minute add-ons become routine.”

Laura Kelly's final State of the State speech is a call for sustained political civility and investment in education, mental health and water reform.","Gov. Laura Kelly arrives Jan. 13, 2026, in the Kansas House to deliver her final State of the State speech. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly says Kansans wouldn’t have elected her if she were the type of politician who screamed the loudest and relied on bullying others to get her way.
She said during her annual State of the State speech Tuesday night it was a certainty Kansas would have suffered in terms of managing the government, advancing economic activity and elevating the quality of life if voters had chosen a governor who confused toxicity for leadership.
“I’m here because Kansans were looking for someone who would turn the volume down, to do more listening than yelling, to bring people together, to compromise and govern from the middle,” Kelly told the joint session of the House and Senate. “Kansans are the most civil, decent people on earth. And they expect that from us, too. I say to everyone here — do not let the loudest voices, on either extreme, drown out the voices of the vast majority of Kansans who want to see us work together.”
Kelly said placing cooperation ahead of partisanship and having the courage to treat colleagues with respect was key to finding common ground among politicians with different ideologies and backgrounds. She said this form of leadership led to enactment of 587 bipartisan bills in her seven years as governor. It created an environment where cross-party dialogue could produce an economic incentive deal for construction of a stadium in Wyandotte County to host the Kansas City Chiefs.
“To land the Chiefs, we all put politics aside,” the Democratic governor said. “We all put personal differences aside. And we didn’t care who got the credit.”
She said the core of this mostly collegial relationship was borne through years in which Kansas overcame three major challenges. She said the state moved away from an era of budgeting woes marked by “gimmicks and funny money,” underfunding of K-12 schools, crumbling bridges and highways, a quality of life that fed a youth brain drain and missed opportunities for job growth.
The perception of Kansas was transformed by attracting more than $30 billion in business investment and the creation of 80,000 good-paying jobs since 2019, Kelly said. The state slashed annual taxes by more than $1 billion, including elimination of the unpopular $500 million state sales tax on groceries. The balance in the state’s rainy-day fund mushroomed to $2 billion. High-speed internet was provided to 117,000 homes and businesses. Kansas paid down debt. The state’s crime rate fell to a 20-year low.
“I know there is more to do,” Kelly told the GOP-dominated House and Senate. “But after seven years, I also know that the state of our state has never been stronger. Ultimately, we were able to get our state back on track because we showed that civility can still exist in our politics, that you can get a whole lot done when you work with others.”

Kelly, a term-limited governor who leaves office in January, said this moment in Kansas politics shouldn’t be taken for granted.
“There are too many forces trying to push us all into our partisan corners and make the other party the enemy,” Kelly said. “Let me state the obvious. We live in extraordinarily challenging times. And I don’t just mean our politics.”
Kelly said societal change in the past decade was head-spinning. People emerged more attached to telephones and other electronic devices than ever before. The world crashed into the COVID-19 pandemic. People emerged from the other side to more remote work, AI bots and self-driving vehicles that made people yearn for simpler times, Kelly said. An era defined by disruption required more, not less, from political leaders, she said.
Kansans demonstrated at the ballot box they yearned for leaders who could offer strength, resolve, character and a clear vision, Kelly said. She said the United States received the opposite at the national level in Washington, D.C.
“From both parties,” Kelly said. “Where it became acceptable for our nation’s leaders to treat one another in the most uncivilized ways imaginable. Language and behavior we’d never tolerate from our own children. Instead of using this new technology to reach people with messages of unity and hope, these devices have been turned into weapons for elected leaders to ignite chaos and anger and even violence.”
“Instead of representing their communities, elected officials turned into foot soldiers for their political parties — firing off insults and vitriol to score likes or follows or wins for their team — instead of doing what’s right for their constituents,” Kelly added. “It’s as if they checked their free will at the door and just did as they were told. Treating their own colleagues in such angry and dehumanizing ways, just because they’re in the other party. And the most frightening part — it’s now become the new normal.”
She said the better alternative was to model political discourse evident in Kansas, where politicians could engage in civil exchanges and, at times, acknowledge folks in the other political party had good ideas.
She said that same attitude would be useful in the 2026 session of the Legislature, which began Monday.
Kelly said the state should fully fund K-12 public education and increase the state’s investment in special education. To fill a funding gap ignored by Congress, she said Kansas had provided $120 million for students in special education. Kelly’s proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year would continue to increase state investment in disabled and gifted students in public schools.
She said Kansas also ought to provide sufficient funding to cover the cost of reduced-price meals in schools to ease financial stress on families.
“We know with grocery costs being what they are right now, that for many of these families, even that reduced cost is untenable,” Kelly said. “Let’s make it clear: No child in Kansas should ever have to worry about having enough to eat. Life is hard enough for our children these days.”
Kelly endorsed a bipartisan Kansas Senate bill that would ban cellphone use by students during the school day. The “bell-to-bell” ban in public and private schools could be implemented in the 2026-2027 school year.
She said Kansas had taken strides to improve services to people challenged by mental illness, but the Legislature should do more to increase treatment beds, hire more treatment professionals and to broaden the crisis response network.
The governor urged the Legislature to dedicate themselves to crafting a comprehensive, long-term strategy for advancing reform in water policy. The state needed a stable funding source for programs aimed at improving the supply and quality of water statewide, she said. The majority of water used in Kansas goes to irrigating crops, which invites political turmoil when changes were proposed.
“I know it is a very sensitive political issue,” Kelly told lawmakers. “But the future of our entire state is dependent upon the actions we take today. It will require looking beyond the next election and looking instead to the next generation.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1130394-1024x726.jpg,,,2026-01-13 20:12:24.372658

Wyoming Freedom Caucus members on a key budget committee take aim at the state’s lone four-year public university.
The post Lawmakers vote to axe UW’s block grant, defund Wyoming Public Media appeared first on WyoFile .","Lawmakers voted Tuesday to cut $40 million from the University of Wyoming, or approximately 11% of the block grant for the state’s only four-year public university. 
On top of the $40 million cut, the committee voted to defund Wyoming Public Media and to deny funding requests related to UW athletics, an energy-related initiative, the school’s family medicine residency program and matching dollars intended to incentivize major gifts. That brings the total to nearly $61 million. 
The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee is meeting in Cheyenne this week to write a budget bill ahead of next month’s legislative session. That work follows three weeks’ worth of budget hearings and involves the panel voting on Gov. Mark Gordon’s recommendations for every state agency. 
Unlike other state agencies, where lawmakers have line-item spending oversight, the Legislature provides UW with a block grant, affording the state’s lone four-year public university a kind of budget flexibility. 
When it was time Tuesday for the committee to consider the block grant, Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft brought a motion to reduce it by $40 million. 
“There’s some, in my mind, there’s some reshuffling of priorities [on] where the state should actually be spending money,” Pendergraft said at the meeting. “And when I look at the University of Wyoming, I think that that’s a place where we could probably pull in the reins for a little while.”
At Pendergraft’s suggestion, the committee also voted to exempt the College of Education and the College of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Natural Resources from the cuts.

Pendergraft is a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — a group of hard-line Republicans who won control of the House in 2024. The upcoming budget session will be the first since the group gained such a foothold and secured a majority of seats on the House Appropriations Committee. 
“We are monitoring the situation very closely and acknowledge there are a lot of steps along the way before a final budget is signed into law,” Chad Baldwin, UW spokesperson, told WyoFile. 
‘Crippling amount’
Pendergraft’s motion prompted a heated and emotional debate between committee members. 
Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, called the cut “a crippling amount” and the kind of decision that will “haunt the state.”
“This is the main university that educates our kids in Wyoming. They don’t have three other choices like they do somewhere else. This is what we have,” Driskill said. “This body is sending the message to the people of Wyoming, our own people, ‘Don’t stay here. Don’t come here.’”

Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, spoke in favor of the motion, telling the committee he had concerns that “there are things being taught in our university that don’t align with the way of life.”
But cutting $40 million won’t address concerns over curriculum, Driskill said. 
Laramie Democratic Rep. Trey Sherwood also spoke against the motion, citing the way it would directly impact her constituents. The university is located in Laramie.
“The governor gave us a balanced budget, which he’s required to statutorily. And when we get down to it, we are also required by law to pass a balanced budget. So we’re not in a deficit. There’s no loss of funds,” Sherwood said. “This proposal to remove funds from the University of Wyoming, in my mind, is cutting for cut’s sake.”
Morale is “quite low” on campus, Sherwood said, pointing to UW President Ed Seidel’s upcoming departure and Laramie’s high cost of living.
“I just want my constituents back home to know that I see that, and I feel the stress that you are under, and I wanted to say publicly, thank you for your service, and know that this is one day, and we will continue to fight for you through the process,” Sherwood said. 
The motion was passed on a voice vote, with at least Sherwood and Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, voting against it. 
More proposed cuts
On top of the $40 million cut, the committee denied a request to fund an assistant professor for UW’s family medicine residency program in Casper, as well as $12.5 million in matching funds intended to boost fundraising. 
“This, to me, is the double whammy of this whole deal,” Gierau said. “You cut the block grant and … then you cut ways that they can try to raise money to earn it back.”
Lawmakers also voted to trim $450,000 from the governor’s recommendation of $4.5 million for a critical minerals initiative at UW. 
“To best serve the state, UW now needs to support interdisciplinary research and education focused on technologies that use Wyoming minerals,” the governor’s budget explanation states. “This requires that UW strengthen its facilities for advanced materials research and develop technologies such as sodium batteries (that will use trona), advanced magnets, and quantum computers and sensors (that will use Wyoming rare earth elements).”
Pendergraft brought two additional motions aimed at UW that the committee ultimately adopted — one to cut $6 million from the university’s athletics department, another to prohibit $1.69 million in state dollars from passing through the block grant to fund Wyoming public radio (the station is formally referred to as Wyoming Public Media).

The $6 million request stems from a landmark NCAA settlement in June that allows colleges to compensate student-athletes for their name, image and likeness. 
“The settlement fundamentally reshapes the financial structure of college athletics, requiring institutions to directly support student-athletes through compensation, expanded benefits, and compliance measures,” according to the budget book. 
Haroldson, a Freedom Caucus member, pushed back on the motion, arguing it “will have a ripple effect across the state.” 
“The University of Wyoming, being a [Division 1] school, it’s the only thing we have. And in my community, I mean, it’s an exodus,” Haroldson said. “If you want to go and see what Highway 34 looks like on game day, it’s pretty impressive.”
In his explanation for seeking to cut public funding for Wyoming public radio, Pendergraft said, “it’s not the role of government.”
“It is not the concept of government to have an immediate extension like a ‘Pravda,’” he said, referring to the former Soviet Union’s Communist Party newspaper, which served as a government mouthpiece for state propaganda. 
Gierau pushed back. 
“I understand the concept about using state dollars, but where you lose me is when you say things like ‘Pravda.’ And let me explain why,” Gierau said. “Because then it leaves the impression that what you’re doing is, you’re against it because of what they’re saying, not the fact that they’re saying it. And that is a slippery slope.”
While the University of Wyoming holds WPM’s license, the station is editorially independent. 
At the end of the debate, some lawmakers who supported the cuts sought to ease tensions with colleagues.
“Everybody feels a little bloodied up after those discussions,” House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said. 
“We’re all friends. We’re all here to do what’s best for the state of Wyoming. So we’ll keep working at it,” he said. 
The committee has the rest of the week to finish crafting the budget ahead of the session that begins Feb. 9.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)North Carolina lawmakers learned how coming federal cuts to SNAP benefits could affect the state’s bottom line during an oversight panel hearing Tuesday.
President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” into law last summer, a sweeping spending and tax cut package that will cut federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by 20% over the next decade — the largest cut to the program to date, according to a Harvard Kennedy School of Government analysis.
About 41 million Americans and 1.35 million North Carolina residents rely on SNAP benefits.
Other changes in the OBBBA will transfer some of the program’s costs from the federal government to the states, with higher costs for states that don’t meet stringent new requirements for eligibility verification.
“It created a new error rate state match, and this is going to be concerning for the vast majority of states,” Leslie Ford, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Alliance for Opportunity, told lawmakers.
Starting in fiscal year 2028, states must have an error rate under 6% to receive full federal funding for their SNAP benefits. A 6% error rate would mean six out of 100 SNAP eligibility enrollments contained mistakes.
If a state’s error rate is at or above 6%, they must pay a percentage of the costs for their food benefits. The percentage they pay increases as the error rate grows higher.
If a state can’t or won’t pay its required share, federal funding will also be withheld, effectively shuttering SNAP in that state.
“Why is Congress looking at this? It’s because we’ve seen the SNAP error rates spike substantially,” Ford said.
North Carolina reported a 10.21% error rate for fiscal year 2024, meaning the state would be responsible for 15% of SNAP costs if that level of error continues. This would be about $433 million per year.
Rep. Grant Campbell (R-Cabarrus) asked about preventing similar issues in the future.
“We weren’t aware of this error rate,” he said. “Are there other problematic things in the administration or distribution of this program that we need to be looking at now?”
Mike Leighs, deputy secretary at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, said error rates have historically increased when there are changes in policy, as there were during the Biden administration and coming out of the pandemic.
“This really isn’t a measure of fraud,” he said. “This is really an inaccurate eligibility determination.” For example, people may have been receiving benefits that were too high or too low, Leighs explained.
Looking at fiscal year 2025, the state’s error rate is at 7.05% through August — much improved over the earlier 10.21%. Leighs said they’re making progress toward the goal of less than 6%, but he also cautioned that it isn’t yet clear which fiscal years the federal government will use to determine states’ compliance.
Andy Ellen, president and general counsel at the N.C. Retail Merchants Association, said food aid is vital for some areas of the state, and a full shutdown of the program could cost the state 7,000 jobs, from retail to agriculture to logistics.
Ellen said shuttering the program would be especially damaging to businesses in counties with high SNAP participation rates, like Robeson County, where nearly a third of residents rely on federal food assistance.
“SNAP is not supplemental in many counties. It is what stabilizes your local food economy,” he said. “It’s what makes that grocery store have the ability to stay open.”
Generally, Ellen said, grocery stores run on thin margins, making perhaps a 2% profit. Many lower-income counties are also food deserts, so keeping existing grocers open is even more critical there.
During the federal government shutdown at the end of last year, the longest in history, North Carolinians went without SNAP for about two weeks.
Smaller grocers experienced a drop in business during that time, Ellen said
“They saw a notable increase in shoplifting; store sales declined dramatically,” he said. “It was a short-term window, but it was a very good history lesson on what the impact of SNAP is for grocery stores and other retailers in the communities that they serve. Long-term would probably have been devastating for a lot of these stores.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ebtsign-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 20:12:24.372658

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Just hours before the Virginia General Assembly was set to convene, Democrats on Tuesday held onto two House of Delegates seats in special elections, extending a winning streak that has followed a wave of legislative departures to fill key roles in Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s incoming administration.
By 8 p.m., Democrat Gretchen Bulova defeated Republican Adam Wise in House District 11 by 69.7–29.8% out of 5,932 votes cast, according to unofficial results from the Virginia Department of Elections. Bulova will succeed her husband, former Del. David Bulova, who retired his seat after being tapped last month as Virginia’s next secretary of natural and historic resources. 
And in House District 23, Democrat Margaret Franklin defeated Republican Vern Robinson by 77.2–22.6% out of 6,428 votes cast, filling the seat vacated by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, who is joining Spanberger’s cabinet as secretary of the commonwealth.
The two contests were the latest in a series of special elections triggered by lawmakers leaving the General Assembly to serve in Spanberger’s administration. Democrats have so far managed to defend each of the vacated seats, maintaining their majority in the House of Delegates and the state Senate as the new governor prepares to take office.
While the districts in Tuesday’s elections lean Democratic, Republicans had hoped the off-cycle contests might present an opening to flip at least one seat amid typically lower participation.
“We congratulate Delegate-elect Gretchen Bulova and Delegate-elect Margaret Franklin on their special election victories in HD-11 and HD-23,” House Democrats said in a statement. 
“As the General Assembly prepares to get to work, we look forward to serving alongside them, rolling up our sleeves, and delivering strong, responsible leadership that meets the moment and delivers for Virginians across the commonwealth.”
HD-11, located in northern Fairfax County, has long been a Democratic stronghold. The district backed Democratic candidates at every level in recent statewide elections and is home to a large number of federal workers and college-educated voters.
Gretchen Bulova enters the House with deep ties to the district and state politics. She previously served as a member of the Fairfax County School Board and has worked as an advocate on education and environmental issues. 
On the campaign trail, she emphasized continuity with her husband’s record, highlighting priorities such as public education funding, environmental protection and transportation.
David Bulova, a veteran environmental legislator first elected in 2005, was selected by Spanberger to lead the natural and historical resources secretariat, overseeing agencies responsible for environmental regulation, conservation and historic preservation. 
His appointment was part of a broader effort by the incoming governor to draw experienced lawmakers into her cabinet.
HD-23, which covers parts of Prince William County, has also trended Democratic in recent cycles as the region has grown more diverse and suburban. 
Franklin campaigned on a platform centered on public education, health care access and economic opportunity. 
A longtime community advocate, Franklin has worked with local nonprofit organizations and emphasized her experience navigating state and local systems on behalf of families. 
Her victory ensures Democrats retain control of a seat that King had represented since winning it in a 2021 special election. King’s move into the administration created the vacancy that Franklin will now fill.
Tuesday’s outcomes mean Democrats have successfully defended multiple seats vacated by lawmakers joining Spanberger’s cabinet, reinforcing the party’s strong hold on the House as the 2026 legislative session approaches.
Another special election is scheduled for Jan. 20 in House District 17, also in Fairfax County, where Democrat Garrett McGuire will face Republican Christopher Cardiff. 
Both are vying to succeed Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, who is set to become Virginia’s next secretary of finance in Spanberger’s administration.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) A Republican member of the Utah State Board of Education who backed a 2025 state ban on collective bargaining for public workers is now suing the state’s largest teachers union. 
Cole Kelley, who is also a financial literacy and business teacher at American Fork High School, alleges dues paid by members of the Utah Education Association ultimately go toward political causes, parties or candidates even though the association has said they do not. 
Exhibits attached to the lawsuit include a list of the union’s contributions to Protect Utah Workers. The coalition led an effort earlier this year to undo the unpopular law restricting collective bargaining for the unions like the UEA before lawmakers repealed it themselves. 
Bill to eliminate collective bargaining for teacher, firefighter and police unions moves forward

Kelley and the conservative Freedom Foundation filed the lawsuit Monday in Salt Lake County’s 3rd District Court, alleging violations of Utah’s Truth in Advertising Act. Kelley and the organization are both seeking damages of $2,000 and attorney fees. They’re also seeking court orders finding the union engaged in deceptive trade practices and requiring corrective advertising.   
The Freedom Foundation’s website says it is not a think tank but a “battle tank that’s battering the entrenched power of left-wing government union bosses who represent a permanent lobby for bigger government, higher taxes and radical social agendas.” 
The group previously filed complaints alleging wrongful political spending by unions in Pennsylvania and Washington state. It also sued the state of Oregon last week over a new state law making it illegal to impersonate a union representative.

The Utah lawsuit accuses the Utah Education Association of falsely claiming that member dues “are not used for political parties, candidates, or campaigns.” It alleges that such statements on the union’s website and social media are considered advertisements under state law because they’re made “in connection with the solicitation of business.”
A spokesperson for the Utah Education Association declined to comment on allegations in the pending lawsuit.  
“The UEA remains committed to serving Utah public educators and the students they serve with integrity, respect and transparency,” Hailey Higgins, director of communications and public relations, said in a statement to Utah News Dispatch. Higgins added that Kelley is not a member of the union. 
Kelley and the Freedom Foundation contend portions of UEA members’ dues go to the National Education Association, which uses them “to support and/or oppose political parties and candidates with millions of dollars in expenditures each year.” The National Education Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  
Kelley was elected to the Utah State Board of Education in 2024. His district includes an eastern portion of Utah County, along with Wasatch, Duchesne, Daggett and Uintah counties.

Kim Reynolds lead a standing ovation for Iowa National Guard service members during her Condition of the State address Jan. 13, 2026. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Gov. Kim Reynolds spoke  Tuesday on her proposals on property taxes, veterans’ benefits and health initiatives this session in her Condition of the State message, she said finding ways to spend government funding effectively is key to all of these goals.
Reynolds, who has served as Iowa governor since 2017, announced in April 2025 she would not seek reelection, meaning 2026 will be her final session leading the state’s executive branch. In her remarks, she said she was entering the session “deeply grateful, fully committed, and determined to finish strong.”
One of the issues she said Iowans have told her is most important to address before she leaves office was reducing property taxes. The governor said her property tax bill, with text not yet available online, is a solution to address the growth rate of property taxes across the state, which she said are rising “faster than inflation, faster than paychecks and faster than population growth.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session, Reynolds named property taxes as her top priority for the upcoming year. Over several months, she and legislators held meetings across the state with local government officials and community leaders discussing the state’s property tax system, in addition to holding roundtable discussions with Iowans about the impacts of property tax increases on Iowans.
Through these discussions and reflections on previous legislative attempts to limit local taxing authority, Reynolds said she found limits on specific levies are not an effective way to address property tax increases.
“So this year, we need to go after the real driver of the problem, spending,” Reynolds said. “Spending is what drives taxes, always has, always will. And the most reliable way to protect taxpayers is to limit the growth of government itself.”
The governor’s proposal would cap overall revenue for local government to 2% growth each year, with an exemption built in for new construction. The cap also includes exceptions for debt service and school funding.
The measure incorporates two ways aimed at helping local governments reduce costs. The proposal would create a $10 million fund of one-time money to provide grants to local governments pursuing consolidation and shared service agreements with other local governments for services like emergency medical services, law enforcement and public health. It also would remove election mandates for county treasurers, auditors and recorders, meaning these positions could become appointed, instead of elected, positions in the future.
The proposal also would change how often property tax assessments are conducted, moving from every two years to every three years. Additionally, it would limit the use of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts and accelerate the timeline for using the state’s Secure an Advanced Vision for Education (SAVE) funding stream for property tax relief.
Reynolds said the proposal also works to provide property tax relief for both older homeowners and new homeowners. The legislation would freeze property taxes for seniors age 65 and older in homes valued at $350,000 or less, “because no one should be taxed out of their own front door,” she said. The bill would also create FirstHome Iowa Accounts modeled after the Iowa 529 Plan, the state-sponsored savings plan that allows families to create a savings fund for a person’s future educational expenses that offers both tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified costs.
The FirstHome Iowa Account proposal would mean funds in tax-deductible savings accounts could be used to for the purchase or closing costs of a home, with certain restrictions. The money in these accounts could only be used to purchase a home in Iowa, and the person using the funds cannot have owned a home in the past three years in the state. Unlike the 529 Plan accounts, the FirstHome Iowa Accounts would be subject to some federal taxes, as there is not a federal equivalent to the program.
This proposal differs significantly from the legislation brought forward by Senate Republicans Monday. Senate Study Bill 3001 proposes ending the state’s “rollback” system of calculating property taxes, while Reynolds’ measure would not make a change to this system. The Senate GOP measure would also expand Iowa’s homestead tax credit, while the governor’s bill would change the homestead tax credit to a tax exemption.
House Democrats have also introduced a property tax plan earlier in January to freeze property taxes for seniors age 65 and older, triple the Homestead Tax Credit and limit annual property tax growth to 4%.
Reynolds honors National Guard servicemembers, calls for changes to county veterans’ benefits services
Reynolds began her address by acknowledging Iowans who died in 2025, including three legislators who died in office, Rep. Martin Graber, Sen. Rocky DeWitt and Sen. Claire Celsi, as well as former Rep. Janet Metcalf.

She also spoke on the loss of two Iowa National Guard service members, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard of Marshalltown and Sgt. Edgar Torres-Tovar of Des Moines. They died Dec. 13, 2025 in Palmyra, Syria when a gunman associated with ISIS fired on American troops, also injuring three other Iowa soldiers and killing a U.S. civilian. Reynolds said the Torres-Tovar family was honoring their son’s death in a memorial services Tuesday evening, while Howard’s wife, parents and brother attended the Condition of the State address. She told them their family “remains in our prayers, and we will never forget Nate’s sacrifice.”
“When I reflect on the evil that robbed our state of two exceptional young men and wounded three others, I’m aware that no words can right the wrongs of their deaths or make up for the heartbreak of their loved ones,” Reynolds said. “But know this: their service lives on — in the families they cherished, in the communities they strengthened and in the freedoms they helped preserve.”
Reynolds said Iowa owes service members a “debt of gratitude,” which is “best paid by ensuring our veterans get every benefit they’ve earned.” She said while the state is home to nearly 178,000 veterans, only one-third of veterans are receiving the benefits they earned.
“That’s not acceptable,” Reynolds said. “An outdated system that provides little accountability is leaving too many veterans — and well-meaning county officials — without the tools, training and consistency they need. So tonight, I’m proposing a bill to modernize the system statewide.”
While the state currently provides counties funding to train Veterans Service Officers across the state, the governor is proposing redirecting this funding to create a centralized training program through the state Department of Veterans Affairs and create a single statewide claims program for submitting veterans’ benefits claims.
Additionally, while each Iowa county currently receives $10,000 to support their local VSOs, the program proposes tying state funding to outcome and performance measures. It would give counties in the top third of VA compensation per capita $15,000; the middle third of counties $5,000, with a bonus award of $5,000 if compensation per capita is increased by 5%, and the bottom third of counties $2,000 with a bonus award of $3,000 for a 5% per capita compensation increase.
“The goal is simple — more benefits reaching more veterans,” Reynolds said. “Let’s do more for the heroes who’ve done so much for us.”
Federal dollars directed toward cancer programs
Making effective use of taxpayer dollars is not limited to state and local governments, Reynolds said, but also includes federal funding flowing to the state through both established programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, as well as the Rural Health Transformation Program established through the tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in 2025.
Iowa was awarded $209 million in the first year of the Rural Health Transformation Program funding, and Reynolds said more than $50 million of that federal funding will be invested in cancer prevention, screening and treatment. Concerns about cancer in Iowa have grown as the state has the second-highest cancer incident rate in the country.
The $50 million will go toward expanding cancer screenings for uninsured and underinsured Iowans, investing in cancer specialists and cancer treatment equipment in rural Iowa, and funding radon testing kits, mitigation efforts and specialists, Reynolds said. This work is already beginning, she said, as the state has already received 250 proposals from around Iowa for the program with plans to begin awarding contracts by the end of January.
More funding will become available for these efforts in future years, she said, with the state expecting the funding to grow to $183 million over the course of the five-year grant.
Cancer is not the only public health condition impacting Iowans, Reynolds said — she also said obesity is a “serious public health issue” in the state and an issue the state government is working to address through food programs.
Iowa has received federal approval of waivers for SNAP and the Summer EBT programs, funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in the past year. Under the waiver, SNAP dollars cannot be used to purchase foods like candy and soft drinks in Iowa. In 2025, the state received funding to implement the Healthy Kids Iowa demonstration project instead of approving SUN Bucks, the federal summer nutrition program for children. However, beginning in summer 2026, Reynolds announced she will participate in the Summer EBT program after USDA approved a waiver requiring these funds are subject to the same restrictions on eligible foods as SNAP.
Reynolds said she is asking the Legislature to approve a measure that would direct the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services “to maintain a federal waiver going forward” for these programs.
“The days of government programs that enable chronic illness are over,” Reynolds said. “It’s time for a new era of accountability and health.”
Updates to prescription drugs, charter schools
Reynolds’ health care agenda also includes measures that would allow both ivermectin and contraceptives to be sold over the counter to Iowans without a prescription, and would restrict the use of certain dyes and preservatives in school foods. Ivermectin — a drug approved for parasitic infections in humans and animals  — was used by some to treat COVID-19 despite a lack of research into its safety and efficacy. Reynolds has proposed over-the-counter access to contraceptives in past sessions but conservative activists and lawmakers have scuttled the idea.
The governor is also proposing changes to Iowa Code that focus on charter schools, both changing language that would allow charter school students to access concurrent enrollment classes and extracurricular activities, as well as shifting certain per-pupil state aid categorical funding from public school districts to a charter school where the student attends classes.
“I am proposing a bill to ensure per-pupil funding truly follows the student, so that every public-school student receives equal support, no matter which public school they attend,” Reynolds said.
Immigration status verification
Though she did not bring them up in her address, Reynolds is proposing codifying her executive order requiring state government departments use the federal E-Verify system to confirm state government employees work eligibility, and requiring Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database in order to verify immigration and citizenship status of people seeking professional licenses.
Gov. Kim Reynolds delivered her 2026 Condition of the State address in the Iowa House chambers Jan. 13, 2026. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Reynolds signed the executive order with these provisions in October 2025 after the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, who had been granted an administrator license by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in July 2023 that was revoked following his arrest.
The governor is also introducing two other measures related to immigration. One would establish a new “presumption of detention” law, stating undocumented immigrants arrested for felony and non-simple misdemeanor charges are presumed to be a flight risk and not be eligible for bail. This presumption could be rebutted.
The second measure would require people registering to vote in Iowa to swear they are a U.S. citizen. Currently, Iowa only requires people to confirm they are a citizen when voting, though registering to vote as a noncitizen is illegal. The proposal would recategorize the crime of falsely claiming to be a citizen while registering to vote as a Class D felony. This proposal follows disputes in the 2024 election cycle about citizenship of individuals who voted or registered to vote in Iowa identified by the Secretary of State’s office as “potential noncitizens.”
According to Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, 277 of the 2,176 people identified were confirmed to not hold U.S. citizenship. Of those individuals on Iowa voter rolls, Pate said his office had found 35 non-U.S. citizens cast ballots that were counted in the 2024 general election, five ballots that were rejected by Absentee and Special Voters Precinct boards, and 22 noncitizens who registered to vote in 2024 but did not participate in the election.
Reynolds proposes spending increase
The governor also released her budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2026. Reynolds’ budget proposes spending $9.666 billion in FY 2027, an increase of roughly $188 million from the current year’s budget. According to the budget, the state is expected to have roughly $10.546 billion in available funds, with an expenditure limit of $9,877 billion, while accounting for a $1.464 billion in reserve funds and proposed $583.9 million transfer from the Taxpayer Relief Fund.
Reynolds is proposing a roughly 2% increase in state funding, with a a 2% State Supplemental Aid rate for K-12 schools and 1.5% increase in funding for Regents and community colleges, 1.5% increase for state health and human services, judicial and justice systems and a 0.1% reduction for other state appropriations.
No mention of eminent domain
An issue the governor did not touch on in her speech was eminent domain. The use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects is expected to be an early point of debate at the Legislature this year following the dramatic passage — and ultimate governor veto — of a bill related to pipeline projects at the end of the 2025 session.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh said he plans to introduce several bills on the issue in 2026, including a proposal to widen the corridor approved by the Iowa Utilities Commission in these projects, avoiding the use of eminent domain while allowing the project to move forward.
Meanwhile, earlier Tuesday afternoon, a House subcommittee moved forward with a bill that would ban carbon dioxide pipeline operators from invoking eminent domain to construct, operate or acquire right-of-way for carbon sequestration pipeline projects.
The issue of eminent domain in pipeline projects caused disagreements within the Republican trifecta in 2025, particularly in the Senate. While Reynolds did not directly discuss the subject, she said not all lawmakers may agree on every issue this session.
“We may disagree,” Reynolds said. “We have disagreed. We will disagree again. But those disagreements have always been rooted in conviction, not indifferent, and in a shared belief that Iowa is worth fighting for. And that’s what this session must be about — not politics, but people.”
One last ‘Condition of the State’ to come for Reynolds
Reynolds took over from former Gov. Terry Branstad, who she served as lieutenant governor for, in 2017 when he left the position to serve as U.S. ambassador to China during President Donald Trump’s first term. She served two more full terms in the office, winning the 2018 and 2022 elections.
As she will give one more Condition of the State address in 2027 before the next governor is inaugurated, Reynolds said she would hold off on reflecting on her accomplishments — though she did celebrate many of the measures passed during her tenure as governor, like the passage of a flat individual income tax and the Education Savings Account program.
“There will be time to look back and time to say thank you,” Reynolds said. “But tonight, our focus is forward — on what still needs to be done, and on doing it together.”

Dear Editor,



I am appalled and shocked that our Vermont pro-Palestinian groups are filing an ethics complaint and calling for the resignations of the five Vermont legislators who traveled to Israel on a much-needed fact-finding mission. 

READ MORE

These legislators were going to Israel, a strong U.S. ally and a democracy, to see what happened on October 7, 2023, and what has been happening in Israel since then. 
It has always been common practice for our political leaders to travel to different parts of the world to help them see the points of view of those on the ground. 
I know that members of pro-Palestinian groups have gone to Israel on their own fact-finding missions. Is the fact that our legislators went on the invitation of the Israeli government rather than the Palestinian Authority making this an ethical question? 
Once again, these groups—Jewish Voice for Peace and the Vermont Coalition for Palestinian Liberation—are using propaganda statements that I believe are not only inflammatory but also inaccurate.
In my view, these actions demonize Israel, collectively target Jews, normalize antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric and create hostile environments for Jewish families, students and civic leaders here in Vermont.
I hope that these actions are not allowed to go any further in our open-minded Vermont; that they will not try to stifle the opinions of others, and that our legislators will not feel that they always have to toe the line.

And the icing on the political cake at the end of each legislative session: Setting the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend.
The list is longer than the course schedule in my final semester of college. I needed passing grades in seven classes to get a diploma. It was my own fault for not doing the work the first three years.
 That last semester was about four months long, about the same time as the 121 days that Alaska legislators will have to do their homework before adjournment in May.
They will likely put off the hardest decisions until the final days. That’s the way it usually works, giving lawmakers time to get used to the inevitable tough calls and disappointments, wearing down all sides on the issues until a majority can accept a deal.
No doubt many of the legislative decisions will be difficult and will require heavy lifting to overcome political opposition, and many will result in wounded pride.
Aside from strained backs and bruised egos, a lot of those decisions could jeopardize legislators’ efforts to win reelection in the fall. Whereas I was motivated that last semester to get a degree and get a job, too many legislators are motivated by keeping their job.
Lawmakers — at least most of them — know what is needed for a better future for Alaska. But for too long, the holdup to coughing up what is needed has been the next election.
A memorable statement almost 20 years ago summed up the dilemma in less than 20 words: “We all know what to do, we just don’t know how to get reelected after we’ve done it.” That was President Jean-Claude Juncker, then serving as prime minister of Luxembourg, which has fewer residents than even Alaska.
A European Commission report in 2008 elaborated on Juncker’s statement: “Politicians are deeply aware of the need for structural reform in Europe … yet they are reluctant to bite the bullet out of fear to lose the next general elections. Of course, this fear is rooted in experience.”
Putting reelection over responsible decisions is all too common. Just look at Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s seven-year itch to do little but talk about big dividends and big plans, as if he were in perpetual reelection mode.
But structural reform is what the state needs.
Alaska needs a long-term fiscal structure that collects enough money to fund the public services, education, roads, ferries and all the other pieces of a state that attract residents, not drive them away.
We need a tax structure that draws on more than just oil wells, that earns a share of the earnings taken by online merchants that profit from Alaskans, that ensures non-residents who draw substantial wages in Alaska leave some of it behind to help pay for services, and that calls on Alaskans to help pay the bills too.
We need leaders this year among the 60 legislators. They don’t have to be fearless leaders, just fearful of the damage caused by doing nothing.
And if the governor vetoes their work, he’ll be gone in 11 months. It will be up to Alaskans to reelect legislators who did their job so that they can do it better next year with a new governor.

Larry Rhoden asked lawmakers on Tuesday to pass legislation that would stop the delivery of medication into the state that can be used to end pregnancies.
“This session, I’ll be working with legislators and the attorney general on legislation to stop abortion pills from coming into South Dakota, and I hope that legislation reaches my desk,” Rhoden said.
Abortion is already illegal in South Dakota, unless the mother’s life is threatened by a pregnancy. 
Late last year, a New York-based nonprofit called Mayday Health posted abortion rights advertisements at gas stations around South Dakota. The ads, which directed people to a website on medication abortion options, drew a cease-and-desist letter from South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley. 
Governor proposes ‘limited budget’ for SD that avoids big cuts but keeps school funding flat

“Abortions are banned in South Dakota except for specific, extenuating circumstances,” Jackley’s office wrote in a press release on the issue. “State law also prohibits the administering or procuring of any medicine, drug or substance to perform an abortion.”
Jackley is suing the organization to stop the ads. Mayday Health countersued in federal court, arguing that South Dakota is trying to suppress constitutionally protected free speech.
In his State of the State speech Tuesday during the first day of the 2026 legislative session at the Capitol in Pierre, Rhoden, a Republican, told a joint session of the state Senate and House of Representatives that the state can do more to stop medication abortion.
He also asked lawmakers to rise and thank the leaders of two crisis pregnancy centers in the state, which he said help women who have “complications” from abortion medication and some who are “seeking reversal” of the medication’s effect.
No bill outlining how the state would stop abortion pills from entering the state has been filed. Rhoden and Jackley’s offices did not offer any details on any such proposal when asked by South Dakota Searchlight.
“The bill has not yet been introduced, and the supporters will be made known at the appropriate time,” said Josie Harms, Rhoden’s spokeswoman.
Democrats decry ‘misinformation’
In his speech, Rhoden said abortion medication being “illegally mailed into South Dakota” is the “biggest threat to unborn lives” in the state. He also said the pills are dangerous for women.
Senate Minority Leader Liz Larson, D-Sioux Falls, said she “obviously” disagrees with South Dakota’s abortion ban, but said her biggest issue with Rhoden’s speech was the governor’s “mentioning of facts that are untrue” about abortion pills.
“They are used in a variety of medical situations, including miscarriage and abortion, that are really necessary for women,” Larson said. 
Dueling federal and state lawsuits arise in dispute over abortion-rights ads in South Dakota

Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Public Broadcasting she took issue with “blatant misinformation and mistruths” about medication abortion, and that Mayday Health’s ads amount to “First Amendment rights and protected speech.”
Wittman mentioned the state’s “life of the mother” exception and said she’d like to see legislation “clarifying what the life of the mother actually means.”
“I’m hopeful that we’ll see it this year,” Wittman said. “We’ve always been looking for clarity around abortion access in South Dakota.”
Rhoden’s proclamation on abortion drew praise from a political opponent, however.
Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, is running against Rhoden in this year’s primary election for governor. Hansen said he appreciated that portion of Rhoden’s speech and called it an area of agreement. 
“Pro-life has always been near and dear to my heart,” Hansen said. “And the governor called out our pregnancy help centers in the state, who do incredible work each and every day.”
Property taxes
Hansen said he disagrees with Rhoden on property tax legislation, an issue that’s set to be heavily debated throughout the three-month legislative session. A summer task force, a group Hansen was a part of, came up with 19 proposals to deal with growth in property taxes. Rhoden said last year that he didn’t like many of the ideas.
On Tuesday, he talked about his own previously announced plan, which would allow counties to replace their share of owner-occupied property tax revenue with a half cent sales tax.
Governor: ‘Not much I’ve seen that I could support’ in legislative property tax proposals

His proposal offers “flexibility” to local decision-makers, Rhoden said, noting that sales tax collections could help the counties that most need property tax relief.
“The areas with the biggest property tax increase are also those that attract the most visitors,” Rhoden said.
Hansen rejected that plan as a tax increase. 
“I remain committed to lowering the tax burden on the people of the state by actually cutting the size of government,” Hansen said. “And I’m looking for more support out of the governor’s office for that kind of approach.”
There were also a host of property tax proposals last year. Rhoden noted in his speech that a property tax bill he’d championed was the only one that passed. It sought to slow residential property tax growth with several methods, including temporarily capping assessment growth, exempting some home improvements from assessment calculations, and expanding eligibility among disabled and elderly people for assessment freeze programs. 
“It wasn’t meant to solve every problem, but it helped to stem the bleeding,” Rhoden said. “Now, it’s time for more substantial relief.”
Focus on national security in economic development
Rhoden declared national defense the next major area of economic development for the state. 
He pointed to Sioux Falls-based MMS Products, which he said is “leading the field for innovation of drone munitions.” The company recently secured a $35 million federal contract. 
National security “will be the major focus of my economic development efforts,” Rhoden said.
Governor awards $1 million for business parks in hometown of political opponent

He said economic development “is a good thing,” and pointed to recent Future Fund awards to a biotechnology project company in Brookings and industrial parks in Aberdeen and Watertown as proof that money “can be used, strategically, to support forward-looking projects.”
The Future Fund is a pool of money, paid for through a tax on employers, that’s meant for economic development and is under the governor’s sole control. 
Gov. Kristi Noem’s use of the fund, including for a rodeo and to support gun range funding rejected by the Legislature, drew scrutiny prior to her exit from the state. 
The first bill filed for this year’s session in the state Senate seeks to require the state Board of Economic Development to review all applications for loans or grants out of the Future Fund.
Rep. Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, is the majority leader for the House of Representatives. All lawmakers agree that economic development is good, he said, but the details are important. 
“It’s a good thing, but it’s not the only thing,” Odenbach said. 
Some lawmakers have expressed concerns about data centers, including Rep. Dylan Jordan, a Clear Lake Republican. A data center proposal in his county has drawn opposition, as has a proposal for Minnehaha County. 
Odenbach expects to see plenty of discussion on data centers, which have drawn opposition from even those he described as “free-market” Republicans who support growth but also “like peace and quiet.”
“We need to make sure we’re safeguarding our water resources and also safeguarding our residential electric utility users so that they don’t wake up one day and there’s a 25% rate increase or a blackout because we’ve gotten ahead of ourselves in building data centers,” Odenbach said.
Public safety
The Spearfish Republican said lawmakers in both parties are likely to support Rhoden’s policy initiatives on public safety. 
Rhoden threw his support behind a bill offered by South Dakota’s State Tribal Relations Committee that would recognize tribal officers as law enforcement officers in South Dakota.

Under current law it’s a felony to assault a state, county or local police officer, but not to assault an officer employed by one of the state’s tribes.
“For far too many years, tribal law enforcement officers have not had the full protection of South Dakota law,” Rhoden said. 
Rhoden also said he will propose a bill that would scrub the addresses of law enforcement officers and judges from the state’s voter registration database to protect them from potential attacks.
The doxxing — releasing home addresses and contact information — of law enforcement “has become a serious problem in other states,” Rhoden said.
Rhoden recognized one law enforcement officer by name during his speech: Emily Metzger, a state trooper. Metzger ran her patrol car into a vehicle speeding in the wrong direction on Interstate 90 last year in an attempt to stop it. The offending vehicle kept going after the first collision, Rhoden said, and Metzger again ran into it to stop it before arresting the driver. 
Metzger was in the House gallery for the speech. Rhoden awarded her the Governor’s Award for Heroism on Tuesday and asked her to stand for an ovation from lawmakers.

Colton Moore, prohibits local governments from regulating firearm storage, effectively overturning ordinances like Savannah’s requirement to lock guns in vehicles. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia Senate on Tuesday passed its first bill of the session, which would ban local governments from requiring gun owners to lock their firearms in vehicles.
The bill, Senate Bill 204, passed by a 32-21 vote after a short debate over the balance between local public safety initiatives and statewide Second Amendment protections. The measure, which was carried over from last year, now heads to the governor. 
“You see, we are the supreme lawmaking authority in this state, not some liberal municipality,” said Trenton Republican Sen. Colton Moore, who sponsored the bill and who argued on the Senate floor that the bill would restore “freedom back into the hands of the citizenry.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill specifically targets ordinances like one enacted in Savannah, which requires firearms to be secured in locked vehicles to prevent theft and establishes a maximum penalty of $1,000 in fines and 30 days in jail for people who leave them inside unlocked vehicles. Under SB 204, no county or municipality may regulate the storage of firearms through zoning, ordinance or resolution.
The bill would allow gun owners affected by such a local ordinance to sue the local authority. Those who prevail can recover at least $25,000 plus attorney’s fees.
Moore claimed Tuesday that the ordinance has turned car theft victims into criminals.
“You can travel the state freely, knowing that you’re not going to be a victim of a crime and then be made a criminal, as we’ve seen in Savannah, Georgia,” Moore said during the floor debate. 
Tuesday was Moore’s last day in the Senate. He is stepping down to run in the special election to replace former Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. 
In November, a Chatham County judge threw out a case against a man cited under the ordinance, which the judge ruled violates Georgia law and the U.S. Constitution, the Associated Press reported at the time.  
A separate challenge is still pending and “should be ready for trial in a couple months,” according to John Monroe, a lawyer representing the suing parties.
Attorney General Chris Carr filed an amicus brief in the lawsuit, saying that the ordinance violates the Georgia Assembly’s authority over county or city ordinances.
“Courts give that mandate effect through the doctrine of state pre-emption: local ordinances regulating matters the General Assembly has claimed are ultra vires and void,” Carr, who is a candidate for governor, wrote in the brief.
Sen. Derek Mallow, a Democrat from Savannah, defended his city’s ordinance, saying that it regulated the car, not the gun itself, and that the Savannah ordinance has been an effective tool in reducing gun violence.
“This has reduced gun thefts by over 30% in one year, in the city of Savannah alone. The city overwhelmingly supports the Second Amendment, but they also believe that public safety is at risk when guns are stolen from unlocked cars,” Mallow said, adding that leaving loaded firearms in unlocked vehicles allows them to fall into the wrong hands.

Chief Justice Rosen and the entire Kansas Supreme Court…members of my Cabinet…leaders of the Kansas tribes… all the constitutional officers and legislators assembled, – it is an honor to speak with you tonight.
Before I begin, I would like to recognize a special guest with us this evening– I believe many in this chamber know him, as he has been a tireless advocate for deeper economic and cultural ties between Kansas and Ireland, the land of my ancestors. Senator Mark Daly, please stand to be recognized. And as they say in the old country, failte!
This is my first time standing before all of you since we announced some very exciting, historic, actually game-changing news for our state.
Our beloved Chiefs are coming home to Kansas.
Their world-class stadium, which opens five years from now, will make Kansas a sports and entertainment mecca. We’ll compete to host Super Bowls, Final Fours, concerts, and so much more. Thousands of new jobs and billions in new economic activity.
And, as I said at the announcement, we’re reminding the nation that we are not a flyover state, we are a touchdown state.
And we brought the Chiefs to our state without a tax increase on Kansans and without pulling a dollar from other priorities in the budget.
This is not only a massive win for Kansas. It’s a win for the entire region. We were able to ensure that our kids, our grandkids, can carry on the tradition of roaring for the Chiefs just down the road.
I’m proud to welcome the local leaders who were instrumental in making this happen.
KCK Mayor and CEO of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County, Christal Watson, and Mayor of the City of Olathe, John Bacon. Please stand to be recognized.
And Mark Donovan is also in the gallery. Mark is the President of the Kansas City Chiefs and deserves much of the credit for getting this deal done. It is an honor to have you here with us tonight. Please give our regards to Clark and the entire Hunt family.
Ultimately, we were able to accomplish this amazing feat for two reasons.
First, we’ve made Kansas a place the Chiefs want to call home – with a strong economy, a strong workforce, strong communities, and – of course – an extraordinary fan base.
And second, because a bipartisan team of leaders in this chamber, along with the local officials we just recognized, and many members of my administration, worked together to make this happen.
Orchestrating these efforts was our own eco/devo wonder boy, the Lt. Governor of Kansas, David Toland.
David, please stand and take a bow for a job well done.
To land the Chiefs, we all put politics aside.
We all put personal differences aside. And we didn’t care who got credit.
We did what was best for Kansas and for our shared future.
That’s how you do big things.
That’s the way it’s supposed to work.
As you know, this is my final State of the State address. Hold your applause.
And as I reflect on my two terms as Governor, I think about three of the major challenges we faced.
First, we needed to stop the bleeding – because, when I took office, Kansas was in a world of hurt.
Our budget was pieced together with gimmicks and funny money.
Our schools were underfunded, and many had to resort to four-day school weeks. Our roads and bridges were crumbling and unsafe.
These problems had to be fixed.
Second, we needed to improve the quality of life for all Kansans.
We did that by cutting taxes, by creating thousands of good-paying jobs, and making our public schools not just functional – but exceptional.
And third, we needed to change people’s perceptions of Kansas and become a place where young people are eager to put down roots, where businesses see opportunity, where tourists flock to visit, and a place where Kansans are proud to call home.
I know there is more to do.
But after 7 years, I also know that the state of our state has never been stronger.
And I know the state of our future has never been brighter.
Now, you all know me – I am an eternal optimist, but I am also solidly pragmatic.
So let me state the obvious – we live in extraordinarily challenging times.
And I don’t just mean our politics.
If you think about the last decade in America, the speed of change we’ve endured is staggering.
We now live our lives attached to devices.
It’s now how we do business, how we keep up with the news, how we talk to our coworkers and our friends, even our own grandchildren.
And in the midst of it all, we also survived a global pandemic, only to return to a world changing even faster – with remote work, AI bots, and cars that drive themselves.
Many of us wish we could go back to simpler times, but we know we can’t.
We live in an era defined by disruption.
An era that requires more from our leaders than ever before.
Yet, right when Americans needed leaders they could look to for strength, for resolve, character, and a clear vision, they got the exact opposite at the national level.
From both parties.
Where it became acceptable for our nation’s leaders to treat one another in the most uncivilized ways imaginable.
Language and behavior we’d never tolerate from our own children.
And instead of using this new technology to reach people with messages of unity and hope, these devices have been turned into weapons for elected leaders to ignite chaos, and anger, and even violence.
Instead of representing their communities, elected officials turned into foot soldiers for their political parties – firing off insults and vitriol to score likes or follows or wins for their team – instead of doing what’s right for their constituents.
It’s as if they checked their free will at the door and just did as they were told.
Treating their own colleagues in such angry and dehumanizing ways, just because they’re in the other party.
And the most frightening part – it’s now become the new normal.
An accepted part of political discourse.
Well, I reject it.
We must all reject it.
When I look at the successes we’ve had these last seven years, here’s what they all have in common: they required elected officials from different parties, with different ideologies, from different parts of the state, to come together, meet in the middle, and find common ground to do what’s best for Kansas.
There’s a word for that.
It’s called civility.
It’s conducting ourselves with a sense of decency.
It’s disagreeing on issues but doing so respectfully.
It’s demonstrating the humility to know you’re not always right.
Acknowledging that folks in the other party are also good Kansans, and that they might have good ideas, too.
It’s being open to compromise, to building consensus.
And it’s always being guided by the principle that if you simply treat people the way you want to be treated, anything’s possible.
Since the beginning of my administration, by using this approach, we’ve been able to enact into law 587 bipartisan bills.
That’s 587 times coming together, across the aisle – in today’s politics.
That’s something we should all be proud of.
And just look at what we’ve accomplished by doing that.
For seven straight years, we fully funded our public schools.
And we’re seeing the benefits of that investment – graduation rates are now the highest they have ever been.
We established the Blueprint for Literacy to make sure all Kansas children are reading at or above grade level.
And, while the national discussion has only just recently turned to affordability, here in Kansas, we knew it was a top priority long before it became a political buzzword – just by talking to Kansans.
In response, to help Kansans deal with rising costs, we cut over $1 billion per year in taxes.
We totally eliminated the sales tax on food, saving Kansas families $500 a year.
That’s huge – and we got it done together.
We cut taxes for seniors living on fixed incomes by completely eliminating the state income tax on Social Security.
We cut taxes for parents to make child care more affordable.
We cut taxes for farmers to lower input costs.
All of this is why, last year, CNBC named Kansas second in the country for cost of living. There are two reasons we’ve been able to return so much money to taxpayers.
First, we’ve managed the budget responsibly – turning the deficits we inherited into surpluses. Secondly, because we’ve grown our economy – increasing our annual revenues.
That’s been driven by a sustained, historic stretch of economic wins.
I’m talking about:

Urban Outfitters in Wyandotte County
Amber Wave in Phillips County
Bartlett Grain in Montgomery County
Hilmar Cheese in Ford County
Boeing in Sedgwick County
Schwan’s in Saline County
And then of course, Panasonic and the Kansas City Chiefs.

In total, new businesses have invested over $30 billion in Kansas.
That’s 30 billion dollars.
And created over 80,000 new good-paying jobs.
These are careers that Kansans can build their lives around.
And it happened because we worked together.
And that’s not all.
We also created the Office of Early Childhood.
We blended 20 programs into one so parents, providers, and businesses will have a single point of contact for everything they need to support our youngest Kansans.
We have developed partnerships with the private sector to exponentially expand access to quality early childhood experiences all across Kansas.
Right here in Topeka, the State of Kansas and Blue Cross Blue Shield will soon cut the ribbon on a 160-slot child care facility just blocks away from the Capitol.
The Office of Early Childhood was a reform most of us agreed we needed – but we had different ideas how to get there.
So, we talked about it, we hammered out our differences, we compromised, and we got it done. See, there it is again – civility in action.
Because we worked together, we also closed the Bank of KDOT once and for all.
And we’ve gone back to investing in our infrastructure the right way, the way we used to. Restoring Kansans’ rightful pride in their highway system.
Together, we opened the Office of Rural Prosperity to put a focus on the unique economic needs of our rural areas.
We’ve invested millions in high-speed internet – connecting over 117,000 homes and businesses to this economic lifeline.
And together, we’ve provided record funding for law enforcement. And they’ve spent the money well.
Crime in Kansas is now at a 20-year low.
Everything I just talked about, we did it all while making sure our budgets were balanced. Every year.
We did it without a tax increase.
We paid down our debt.
Our credit rating is strong.
Our rainy-day fund stands at $2 billion.
Together, we have returned fiscal sanity to Topeka.
Ultimately, we were able to get our state back on track because we showed that civility can still exist in our politics, that you can get a whole lot done when you work with others.
But we cannot take it for granted.
There are too many forces trying to push us all into our partisan corners and make the other party the enemy.
And, sadly, we have seen some examples where the ways of Washington have crept into our conduct here in Kansas.
Where the level of discourse in this building went places I know many of you weren’t proud of or comfortable with.
We must have the courage to treat each other with respect, regardless of the intensity of debate and discourse.
We must have the courage to put what’s right ahead of what’s politically expedient.
We must have the courage to put compromise ahead of party purity.
This moment in our politics requires it.
And make no mistake, it’s also what the people of Kansas want.
I stand before you as evidence of that.
I did not get elected Governor – twice – by screaming the loudest or bullying others to get my way.
Quite the opposite, I’m here because Kansans were looking for someone who would turn the volume down, to do more listening than yelling, to bring people together, to compromise, and govern from the middle.
Kansans are the most civil, decent people on earth.
They embody the spirit of neighbor helping neighbor.
And they expect that from us, too.
So, I say to everyone here – do not let the loudest voices, on either extreme, drown out the voices of the vast majority of Kansans, who want to see us work together.
It’s been the right approach.
It’s been an effective approach.
And it’s what we need to do this legislative session to make it our strongest ever.
When it comes to this session, it won’t surprise you that my priorities always start with our public schools.
Let’s step back a moment and acknowledge this remarkable comeback story.
Just 10 years ago, in the aftermath of the disastrous tax experiment, we had many school districts in Kansas forced into 4-day school weeks.
Then, just as we finally restored full funding, Covid hit.
And educators and parents had to adjust to remote learning, which we all know was horrible for everyone, especially the students.
But our communities rallied.
Teachers went into overdrive.
Parents put in the extra time at home.
Kansans take so much pride in their public schools.
And together, we doubled down on our commitment to them.
Not only fully funding our schools, but record funding for our schools.
We all did our part – but it’s our educators who are the real heroes here.
I’d like to speak about a special group of them for just a moment.
Joining us tonight are a group of educators from Topeka Public Schools.
They have the distinction, or perhaps, at the time, the burden of teaching my own daughters, Kathleen and Molly, well over 20 years ago.
Each made a lasting impression on both me and my daughters.
Like so many of our dedicated teachers, the work they do with their students extends far beyond the classroom walls – they build relationships, they mentor, they guide – in every sense of the word, they educate.
They’re here tonight representing so many Kansas teachers who go above and beyond for our children and seldom get the recognition or gratitude they deserve.
So, please stand as I call your name:

Marti Bass, Kathleen and Molly’s kindergarten teacher at Potwin Elementary.
Diane Kimsey, Kathleen’s fourth grade teacher at Potwin Elementary.
Kirsten Cigler, Kathleen and Molly’s English teacher at Topeka High.
Anton Ahrens, Molly’s chemistry teacher at Topeka High.
And Harry Peterson, Kathleen’s gifted facilitator at Topeka High.

They’re joined by Dr. Tiffany Anderson, Superintendent of Topeka Public Schools, who has transformed vocational and educational opportunities for students in Topeka, most notably by creating the Topeka Center for Advanced Learning and Careers.
Please give these educators and educators all across Kansas a huge round of grateful applause!
It speaks volumes that so many of us can think back decades and remember the teachers who touched our lives, and our children’s lives.
I believe there’s even more we must do to support them.
At the state level, we have.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about our federal partners. Once again, the federal government has dropped the ball on funding for special education.
When you think about what parents take on when they have a child with a disability, you realize just how unconscionable that is.
Now, Kansas has already stepped up and added over $120 million for special education. We’ll keep calling on Washington to cover its fair share, but until it does, my budget will continue to increase this investment.
We will never turn our backs on these children or their families.
We also know that tens of thousands of families in Kansas qualify for reduced-price school lunches – especially in some of our most rural areas.
And we know with grocery costs being what they are right now, that for many of these families, even that reduced cost is untenable.
So I am, again, including funding in my budget to allow students currently on reduced price meals to move entirely to free meals – to ease that stress on their families.
Let’s make it clear: No child in Kansas should ever have to worry about having enough to eat. Life is hard enough for our children these days.
And we need to face this fact: technology is making it much, much harder.
Smartphones and social media have exposed our children to a world they are not ready for, and to social pressures they don’t need or deserve.
It’s creating a mental health crisis and a learning crisis.
Talk to parents, these are the first concerns they raise – 9 times out of 10.
The research on this is now very clear.
Anxiety in our kids is up.
Depression is up.
And, tragically, even suicide is up.
Cell phones are making it much harder for our children to learn and for our teachers to teach.
We need to step up and do something about this.
This session, we must pass the bipartisan proposal to ban cell phone use during the school day.
I want to thank Majority Leader Chase Blasi and Minority Leader Dinah Sykes for their work on this critical issue.
Get that bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law.
We know that mental health challenges are not limited to our children.
It is a reality so many Kansans and their families face.
When I first took office, our mental health system in Kansas was seriously lacking. Our continuum of care – prevention, treatment, inpatient, post-discharge services – all had huge gaps, dangerous gaps.
We had no crisis hotline.
We had long waitlists for treatment.
We had a severe shortage of mental health professionals and services, particularly in our rural areas.
Fortunately, there were legislators on both sides of the aisle and leaders in our state agencies who recognized the danger and focused like a laser on solutions.
Now we have the Office of Early Childhood, which will ensure our youngest children get the start in life they need to become resilient, productive adults.
We were one of the first states in the country to implement the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model, that will focus on the whole person approach.
We were one of the first states to operationalize the 988 Crisis Hotline, a vital link to lifesaving services.
We initiated and substantially increased mental health services in our schools, ensuring that our children have access to help where they need it, when they need it.
Soon, we will open a new state psychiatric hospital in South Central Kansas that will mitigate the wait lists at Osawatomie and Larned.
And now, when judges must incarcerate someone whose primary issue is substance abuse, they can be sent to the newly renovated East Campus at Lansing Correctional Facility, where they will live in a therapeutic environment designed to treat their addiction and prepare them for successful reentry to their community.
We have done a lot. We have filled many gaps.
But unfortunately, the needs of Kansans require that even more must be done.
We need more treatment beds.
We need more professionals.
We need more crisis response.
And my budget does just that.
Join me in making mental health a real priority this session.
When we announced the agreement with the Chiefs to move to Kansas, we showed Kansans – and the rest of America – that we are capable of coming together to do big things.
And that we’re able to think long term.
Now, we must do that again.
We must do something that no legislature, no administration, has ever been able to accomplish, and that’s to properly address our water crisis.
Last year, we took a critical step by establishing the Water Task Force, led by Representative Jim Minnix and Senator Kenny Titus.
Now, I’m calling on the legislature to support that task force in its work to lay out a comprehensive, long-term strategy and identify a dedicated funding source, much like we have successfully done for our highways.
I know it won’t be easy.
I know it is a very sensitive political issue.
But the future of our entire state is dependent upon the actions we take today.
It will require looking beyond the next election and looking instead to the next generation.
And some day, when your great-grandchildren are looking at the family album, let it be said that when you were in the legislature, and you had the chance, you did the right thing.
Water isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a Kansas issue. And it is a time-sensitive issue.
Let’s treat it that way and make it a top priority this session.
When you think back on this journey we’ve been on together, it’s quite remarkable – the turnaround Kansas has made.
Ten years ago, Kansas was generating national headlines like:
“What’s the Matter with Kansas? It can’t do math.”
Late night shows mocked Kansas, calling us a Laboratory of Fiscal Disaster.
But now, instead of being a national punch line, we’re winning national awards for economic development, for modernizing our unemployment system, for our first-class roads.
And perhaps the greatest recognition of all, the Kansas City Chiefs, who have won three Super Bowls while I’ve been governor, something no other current governor can claim, they will literally move Kansas to the big leagues.
Big things are happening in our small state.
And there are more big things to come if we work together.
In my first State of the State in 2019, I encouraged us to consider a fairly profound question: what is Kansas worth?
What sacrifices are we willing to make for the state we love?
Were we willing to do the hard work, putting what’s right for Kansas above what’s right for our political parties?
Tonight, I highlighted all of the successes we’ve had by doing just that.
But that spirit of civility must endure in the months ahead and years ahead, as the challenges we face will only get bigger.
We must live up to our state motto, Ad Astra Per Aspera, and show America that civility in our politics is still possible.
That civility is what brings us together.
And that civility is a winning formula.
For governing. And for life itself.
Thank you. Good night.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1130357-1024x762.jpg,,,2026-01-13 20:12:24.372658

The Montpelier post office is facing a staffing shortage on four of its delivery lines. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Signed, sealed, delayed: Montpelier Post Office struggles with long wait times — again.","Tom McDonough spent 29 years working for the U.S. Postal Service, mainly as a postal clerk. So he’s very familiar with dealing with frustrated customers waiting for their packages.
Customers like himself. 
“The point of view of the clerk up there, I understand,” he said. “I can see what they’re faced with.”
McDonough has been waiting for nearly two weeks for his packages, which include medication, tax information and now-outdated Christmas cards. He can see through the postal service’s informed delivery, which allows him to receive online updates, that his package had reached the Berlin facility 10 days ago. But somehow it hasn’t made it to his Middlesex home 6 miles away.
McDonough is one of at least a dozen central Vermont residents who have reported postal service delays on social media since the start of 2026. On Montpelier’s Front Porch Forum, residents have complained about not receiving letters and packages not showing up on their expected delivery date. 
Those delays are only the latest issue in a long series of challenges the postal service has faced in the Montpelier area over the past few years. National postal cuts and local flood damage to the old Montpelier post office have caused similar spotty service snags in the past. 
In a Monday statement, USPS spokesperson Paul Smith confirmed that there has been “sporadic delivery” on a few routes in Montpelier. He said the postal service has implemented contingency plans like bringing in employees from nearby offices to maintain deliveries when staffing issues arise. 
However, an email from Josh Scott, manager of consumer affairs for the Vermont district of USPS, provided by McDonough contained additional details. Scott told McDonough that the Montpelier office is managing four vacant delivery routes due to staffing shortages. 
As of Friday, Scott told McDonough, “We have two carriers dedicated specifically to working through the backlog of packages so that we can move mail out as quickly and safely as possible.”
Locals can also go in person to the Montpelier Carrier Annex in Berlin to pick up their mail, Scott said. But residents on Front Porch Forum have reported that postal workers at the facility will hand over their mail, but not their packages. USPS did not clarify the distinction in its emailed statements. 
Other Montpelier residents told VTDigger that reaching the in-person facility would be a challenge. Melodie Lewis, who lives in downtown Montpelier, is disabled and uses a walker to get around. 
She said she desperately needs to get ahold of a bill that’s due on Jan. 15, and is hoping her son can drive her to go get it.
“I just have a feeling I’m gonna go up there and they’re gonna say, ‘Oh, that’s in the truck,’” she said. 
She emphasized that she has nothing but good things to say about the “friendly” mail carrier for her apartment complex. 
“I don’t think it’s her fault,” she said. “I think it’s the postal service. They need to have more employees.” 
Vermont lawmakers and local officials have raised concerns about the post office for years. At the tail end of his first term in 2020, President Donald Trump appointed a new postmaster, Louis DeJoy. Vermont’s congressional delegation lobbied against his cost-cutting measures multiple times during his five years in office, blaming him for mail delays. When DeJoy resigned in March, U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said “good riddance.” 
Montpelier also spent over a year without a post office after the July 2023 floods damaged the old location at 87 State St., leaving residents unable to use a P.O. Box, send packages or buy stamps. A new retail facility opened at 89 Main St. in October 2024. 
Lewis said her mail delivery in the past has been “hit or miss,” averaging out to a few days per week. But this is the first time it’s gotten quite this bad. 
“They must be stretching themselves really thin,” she said. 
McDonough said he’s noticed more frequent delays of a day or two, which stood out to him as a change from how the post office ran before he retired in 2016. 
“It was unheard of to miss a delivery day,” he said. “The postmaster would go out and deliver mail.”
It’s unclear how much the staffing shortages could also be due to the general workforce shortage in Vermont. Smith said the postal service is hosting virtual job fairs two days a week in the Vermont area. Scott noted that the Montpelier office was planning to post new job openings online soon. 
In December, Middlesex resident Jessica Millard asked on Front Porch Forum about finding volunteers to help deal with the postal backlog. But she told VTDigger that she’s since learned there’s a lengthy screening and training process for anyone working for USPS, including a federal background check and drug test. 
“It seems to me that the postal service should consider streamlining or lessen the restrictions somewhat given this crisis,” she said via email. “It would be a great volunteer opportunity for high school students who want to boost their volunteer hours for their resumes.”
In the meantime, she’s still waiting for her mail. 
“I wish I had a good, uplifting ‘community-rallies-together-and-to-save-the-post-office’ story,” she said.

Jirdes Winther Baxter, the last living survivor of the diphtheria epidemic that prompted the 1925 serum run credited with inspiring the Iditarod Sled Dog Race, died Jan. 5 at Bartlett Regional Hospital at the age of 101.
“This is kind of an end of an era for that period of time,” Fred Baxter, one of her sons, said in an interview that Tuesday.
His mother, born Jirdes Winther on Feb. 25, 1924, to parents who had moved from Norway to Nome, was hospitalized with diphtheria on Jan. 31, 1925, in the midst of an epidemic of the disease that winter. Only a few days earlier, Nome’s only doctor, Curtis Welch, sent an emergency telegraph to the U.S. Public Health Service requesting 1 million units of diphtheria antitoxin.
That resulted in the famous serum run by 20 mushers and about 150 sled dogs over 674 miles in five and a half days from Nenana to Nome. Jirdes Winther and her two brothers received the last of the existing serum, and their mother the first of the new serum when it arrived at the beginning of February, according to Fred Baxter.
Jirdes Winther spent another 22 days, including her first birthday, in quarantine.
At least three documentaries, plus other historical projects, have included Jirdes Winther Baxter’s story. On Feb. 24, 2024, a one-day-early 100th birthday celebration featuring tributes from numerous officials took place at the Juneau Yacht Club.
“I’m hoping that everyone that has gathered around you to celebrate your 100th is spending it with you in true Alaskan style,” U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in the call played to those gathered over a speakerphone. She said it was an occasion to celebrate “those who have helped make our state the most incredible place, and you and your family have done just that.”
Jirdes Winther moved with her family to Seattle in 1927 because her mother was still suffering from effects of diphtheria before the family returned to Alaska and settled in Juneau in 1929, according to citations and other official biographies documenting her life. She met and married Fred Baxter (subsequently naming one of their sons after him) in 1943.
Her husband was elected to the Juneau City Council (later the City and Borough of Juneau Assembly) in 1956, 1958, 1960 and 1962. Meanwhile, she worked for Lt. Gov. Hugh Wade and then the Retirement Division of the state Department of Revenue.
A citation from the Juneau Assembly recognizing her 100th birthday honors her as a “shadow member” of the municipal council during the 15 years her husband would eventually serve. A citation by the Alaska Legislature states she “took a great interest in local politics, providing support and guidance during her husband’s fifteen years in elected office.”
Jirdes Winther Baxter’s husband died at home on Oct. 14, 2009, at the age of 89. The couple raised six children.
Their son Fred Baxter said his mother was taken to Bartlett Regional Hospital with medical complications on the morning of Jan. 3, and she was among family members until her death the following Monday.
“We probably had 20, 25 family members here in town that were spending hours up there in a room with her, and talking and reminiscing about a good time,” he said. “And she would be lucid sometimes, and sometimes she was just in discomfort. And then when she’d wake up and open her eyes she’d want to talk a little bit.”
No memorials or other services have been scheduled yet, her son said.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A group of young plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit against the federal government alleging a series of executive orders threaten their constitutional right to life by exacerbating climate change haven’t given up on their fight. 
After a federal judge in Missoula dismissed the case, Lighthiser v. Trump, last fall over a lack of jurisdiction, the plaintiffs asked the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene and overturn the ruling that blocked their efforts to challenge the federal government’s plan to “unleash American energy.”
“Our government has a system of checks and balances, and right now those checks have failed us,” lead plaintiff Eva Lighthiser said in a statement. “These executive orders are directly harming me and my fellow plaintiffs. Every additional wildfire, smoky day, flood, puts our lives and health at risk. With this appeal, we have hope that the Ninth Circuit will uphold its constitutional duty to protect this nation’s young people.” 
 Lighthiser v. Trump is the latest of a series of youth-led climate change lawsuits brought by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based advocacy law firm, during the last decade. Several of the plaintiffs were also involved in the Held v. Montana case, a landmark court victory for climate activists. 
In a hearing last September, several youth plaintiffs testified to the harm they suffer from climate change, including increased experiences with environmental disasters, respiratory issues exacerbated by wildfires and heat waves, and concerns that their future families and careers could be jeopardized by federal actions.
They alleged that three executive orders President Donald Trump signed early in his second term will accelerate human-caused climate change and cause further harm throughout their lives. 
Expert witnesses, including renowned climate scientist Steven Running and policy experts, testified to the harms suffered by the plaintiffs and the ability of the government to roll back the orders. 
But federal district court Judge Dana Christensen “reluctantly” dismissed the lawsuit, despite writing that the court had been presented with “overwhelming evidence that the climate is changing at a staggering pace, and that this change stems from the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, caused by the production and burning of fossil fuels.”
While the plaintiffs showed they have injuries that can be concretely traced to fossil fuel production, he said their requests for relief, including an injunction against multiple federal agencies, exceeded the court’s authority. 
“At the heart of Plaintiffs’ request is that the Court wind back the clock to the regulatory framework that existed on January 19, 2025,” Christensen wrote of the date Trump’s second term started.
Granting the plaintiffs’ request to roll back executive orders and subsequent agency actions would require the court to “monitor an untold number of federal agency actions to determine whether they contravene its injunction,” the order wrote. “This is, quite simply, an unworkable request.”
In their appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the plaintiffs’ legal team argues that the district court does have the authority to rule on the claims, and they should be allowed to amend their complaint and return to the lower court for a ruling “on the merits.”
“Solutions exist for every workability, policymaking, and specificity concern raised by the district court,” lawyers for the plaintiffs said in their opening brief. “The district court simply did not address them.” 
In his order dismissing the case, Christensen relied on a court ruling in the federal case Juliana v. United States, which was also a youth-led effort stretching across three presidential administrations that alleged a federal failure to mitigate the effects of climate change. The case never went to trial and was repeatedly dismissed due to a lack of standing. 
However, he wrote that if the appeals court disagreed with his interpretation of previous rulings, Christensen “welcomes the return of this case to decide it on the merits.”
 “The district court recognized that these Executive Orders are causing a children’s health emergency and directly harming the youth plaintiffs, but wrongly concluded it lacked the power to provide relief,” Julia Olson, lead attorney to the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “President Trump’s orders cost these young plaintiffs their ability to live healthy lives … The cost to our clients’ physical health and safety is enormous and can be remedied by the federal courts saying the President’s acts violate the U.S. Constitution.”
In a statement to the Daily Montanan, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Trump “ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy which gave unfair and preferential treatment to certain sectors of the industry.”
“As promised, President Trump declared an energy emergency on day one in the best interest of the American people to protect our economic and national security. He will continue to unleash American energy,” Rogers said.

Sheryl Delozier announced Tuesday she will not seek reelection after nine terms, putting her Cumberland County district up for grabs.
Delozier has represented the 88th District, which includes Mechanicsburg, New Cumberland, Shiremanstown, Hampden Township and part of Lower Allen Township, since 2008. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.
Pennsylvania Democrats immediately identified Delozier’s seat as a prime opportunity for the party to strengthen its majority in the state House. 
With all 203 House seats up for election in November and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro running for reelection, state Democratic Party Chairperson Eugene DePasquale said he hopes to build on the momentum of the 2025 elections. The party  retained three state Supreme Court seats and won dozens of down ballot races across the commonwealth.

“We are not only going to reelect Gov. Josh Shapiro, but we are in a great position to expand our majority in the House and flip the Senate. With a trifecta in Harrisburg, Governor Shapiro will be able to get even more done for the people of Pennsylvania in his second term,” DePasquale said.
The state Democratic Party said Delozier’s retirement from the House is a sign that state Republicans are aware their “full embrace of Donald Trump’s toxic Washington agenda is putting them on shaky ground for 2026.”
The partisan make-up of the House could change before the Nov. 3 general election. House Speaker Joanna McClinton called special elections later this year.
Voters will elect state representatives Feb. 24 to complete the unexpired terms of former Rep. Joshua Siegel (D-Lehigh), who was vote in as Lehigh County executive, and former Rep. Dan Miller (D-Allegheny), who was elected to the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court. 
On March 17, voters will elect representatives to replace former state Rep. Lou Schmitt (R-Blair), who resigned Dec. 31 to become a Blair County judge and former Rep. Toren Ecker (R-Adams), who was elected to a judgeship in Adams County.
Delozier told PennLive she is leaving the House to pursue other opportunities and did not give a specific reason.
As a leader in the House Republican Caucus, Delozier made a name as a bipartisan lawmaker at a time when the General Assembly became more divided. House Democrats have controlled the chamber by a single seat since 2023, while the GOP maintained their three-decade majority in the state Senate.
Delozier partnered with House Appropriations Committee Chairperson Jordan Harris on the second revision of Pennsylvania’s 2018 Clean Slate law, which erased low-level criminal convictions for thousands who have not committed another crime.

(Julie Bennett/Getty Images)Claudette Colvin, whose challenge to Alabama’s segregation laws nine months before Rosa Parks provided a spark for the modern Civil Rights Movement, died on Tuesday. She was 86 years old.
The Claudette Colvin Foundation announced her death on their website but did not give a cause. A list of survivors was not immediately available.
Colvin was a 15-year-old teenager when on March 2, 1955, she was arrested for refusing to give her seat on a bus to a white passenger. According to a Montgomery Advertiser account published over two weeks later, Colvin was sitting on a segregated bus when a white passenger got on, and she was ordered to move to the rear.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Colvin declined, even after police boarded the bus and gave her two orders to move. The police then pulled her off the bus.
Colvin told the Montgomery Advertiser in 2019 that while racism was nothing new to her, she had just spent a week in February studying Black history with a teacher who taught her about the contributions Black Americans made to the country and about the injustices in the South.
“For these historical, iconic women I had been taught so much about, I just couldn’t move,” she said. “I just couldn’t move. That’s the only way I knew how to resist, to not move. So they just dragged me off the bus.”
Montgomery Mayor Steven T. Reed said in a statement Tuesday that Colvin “helped lay the legal and moral foundation for the movement that would change America.”
“Claudette Colvin’s life reminds us that movements are built only by those whose names are most familiar, but by those whose courage comes early, quietly and at great personal cost,” the statement said. “Her legacy challenges us to tell the full truth of our history and to honor every voice that helped bend the arc toward justice.”
U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham, wrote in a Facebook statement that Colvin was “a true civil rights champion.”
“Her story is often overlooked, yet her quiet courage paved the way for generations to claim their rightful place in our democracy,” the statement said.
After being pulled off the bus, Colvin was handcuffed and taken to a local jail.
“In an old Western, when the bandits are put in the jail, you can hear the sound of the key go ‘click,’” Colvin said. “I could hear the sound when the jailer locked it. I knew I was locked in, and I couldn’t get out. I started crying. I started reciting the 23rd Psalm.”
Colvin’s mother and pastor bailed her out a few hours later. Her arrest — particularly the fact that a 15-year-old was handcuffed — sparked anger in Montgomery’s Black community, and several activists, including attorney Fred Gray and E.D. Nixon, the former president of the local NAACP, saw that Colvin’s case could be used to challenge local segregation laws.
At trial, Colvin was convicted of assault, violation of segregation laws and disorderly conduct. But on appeal, a judge dismissed the segregation and disorderly conduct charges, leaving only the assault charge (police claimed she attacked them while being removed; Colvin said she did not remember doing so). She was sentenced to “indefinite probation.”
Gray, who represented Colvin, had wanted to push her case further, but as historian Taylor Branch wrote, the judge’s dismissal of the segregation charge against Colvin made a federal case against the city’s Jim Crow laws more difficult. Branch also wrote that some leaders in Montgomery’s Black community were concerned that Colvin, who was pregnant, would be “an extremely vulnerable standard bearer.”
Nine months later, Rosa Parks, who had over 15 years of experience as an activist, was arrested on charges similar to Colvin’s. But unlike Colvin, Parks faced a single charge of violating Montgomery’s segregation laws, allowing a federal court challenge to proceed. Colvin, who knew Parks through the NAACP’s youth organization, did serve as a plaintiff in Browder v. Gayle, the federal case that struck down Montgomery’s bus segregation laws in 1956, after the 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Gray said in 2019 that Colvin’s action “gave the moral courage” to many local activists to push on.
“A 15-year-old girl who did what she did, and was willing to take whatever consequences, not knowing what was going to happen — when you compare it, Claudette had a lot more courage than many of us involved,” he told the Advertiser.
Colvin said she felt stigmatized in the wake of the arrest and found it hard to see other people get recognition for similar actions.
She later moved to New York and worked for decades as a nursing aide. Recognition slowly came to her: In 2017, Montgomery proclaimed March 2 “Claudette Colvin Day.”
In 2021, Colvin moved to have her “indefinite probation” stricken from the books. Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, who represented Colvin in her action, said in an interview Tuesday that Colvin and her family feared that the conviction meant that she could be jailed for any violation.
“Every time she would come back to Montgomery to visit family, she always feared that the police would pull her over for some sort of pre-textual reason and use it as an excuse to throw her in jail,” he said. “She lived with all this fear for so long, and her family lived with that fear.”
Colvin’s record was expunged that December. She joked that “that really means that I’m no longer, at 82, a juvenile delinquent.”
But Colvin also said that she could not have left the bus.
“Living in a segregated society, I wasn’t going out of my boundaries looking for trouble,” Colvin said in 2019. “I didn’t have the support. Nobody asked me to do this. I was ostracized after I had a child out of wedlock. I just went on my own, and I knew I had to take care of myself. I’m a self-made woman. You have to have strong courage, strong faith and belief in yourself.”

Dan McKee is leveraging his 2026 State of the State address to appeal to voters’ hearts, minds, and above all, their wallets.
“When I was working on this upcoming budget, I was thinking about the costs that keep Rhode Islanders up at night, the costs we must lower to keep our state competitive and growing,” McKee said a few minutes into the speech, which was scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at the Rhode Island State House Tuesday. A copy of the speech was shared with Rhode Island Current ahead of time.
His solution: an “Affordability for All” agenda that soothes wallet woes like health insurance, taxes, child care, energy bills and gasoline. The series of tax cuts and credits will keep $215 million in people’s pockets for the first full year, with an estimated $1.4 billion in collective savings over the next five years, McKee said. 
But first, the embattled five-year governor must secure a second full term, beating low approval ratings and fierce criticism from at least one serious Democratic competitor. 
The 2026 gubernatorial election hovered, unmentioned but unignored, over a packed crowd of elected officials, judges and special guests in the House of Representatives chamber.

Oscar Perez received the first mentions of the night, as McKee paid tribute to the students, families, university staff and first responders who “showed their best selves” during the fatal Brown University shooting exactly one month ago. Two students were killed and nine more were injured, with a six-day manhunt before the shooter was found dead in a storage facility in New Hampshire.
“There aren’t words to fully express the gratitude I feel for the countless people who stepped forward during this painful time,” McKee said. 
Seated nearby, temporarily displaced from his usual position behind the rostrum, was House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, still mulling a challenge to McKee in the 2026 gubernatorial primary. Shekarchi expects to share his decision by the end of March. 
Dollars and cents 
McKee offered a broad brush preview of his funding and policy priorities Tuesday, which will be unveiled in full when the governor releases his proposed fiscal 2027 budget Thursday.
One noteworthy detail: McKee’s pledge to undo the 2-cent hike in the gas tax that took effect in July. The increase, approved by lawmakers as part of the fiscal 2026 budget, helped close the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s perennial budget shortfall, providing an estimated $8.7 million to the transit agency in fiscal 2026. Policy experts doubted motorists would change their patterns when paying 41 cents, rather than 39 cents, a gallon at the pump.
But McKee on Tuesday touted the $9 million in “relief” from his proposed rollback.
“When it comes to filling up your tank, every dollar matters,” he said.
The governor said his forthcoming budget proposal will also “fully close” RIPTA’s projected $14 million deficit for fiscal 2027. He did not say how, nor did he acknowledge that the agency’s funding gap would widen if the gas tax is reduced. 
In another nod to tax woes, McKee pitched his plan to eliminate the state income tax on Social Security benefits. Rhode Island is one of only eight states that tax Social Security  income, though residents 67 and older are exempt if their total income is less than $107,000 a year, or $133,750 for joint filers.
Tax relief is the top priority for AARP Rhode Island, which estimates more than 91,000 seniors paid state income taxes on Social Security in 2022. The tax provides $40 million in state revenue each year.
McKee did not explain the napkin math that will even out these new expenses, which stand to widen a projected $101 million deficit without new revenue sources. 
In fact, his address laid out many more new or increased expenses, like a $325 per child state tax credit program. The total cost to establish permanent and regular tax relief for families with minor children was not available. Other new or increased costs included:

$1 billion in energy bill relief over the next five years, including a 25% cut to the fees charged by Rhode Island Energy based on state taxes and policy mandates. 
$20 million to help Rhode Island meet new federal rules around Medicaid eligibility and keep recipients insured.
$10 million to help hospitals care for the projected increase in uninsured patients. 
$9.5 million to launch a “marketplace affordability” program to help 20,000 residents maintain their health coverage through the state health exchange despite expiring federal subsidies.

McKee also pledged unspecified funding for Planned Parenthood and to double the state’s annual grant to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank. The fiscal 2026 budget included $800,000 in support for the state’s central food bank after lawmakers opted to increase funding from McKee’s initial proposal for $550,000.
Taking on Trump
Much of the extra money for social safety net programs aims to cushion the blow of sweeping federal changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Preliminary state analysis suggests devastating human and financial impacts for Rhode Island: Tens of thousands of low-income residents, seniors and lawful immigrants are at risk of losing critical food assistance, health insurance or both. As participation in Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and HealthSource RI declines, federal funding to the state will also shrink, leaving state administrators with fewer resources to carry out the massive changes to longstanding programs.
McKee blasted President Donald Trump for the “harmful policies” while promising to protect vulnerable residents and defend the state’s economy and values.
“As Governor, I’m not going to stand by and let President Trump price Rhode Islanders out of their way of life,” McKee said. 
His comments came one day after a federal judge in D.C. lifted the Trump administration’s order to pause work on the Revolution Wind project. The 65-turbine project being built south of Rhode Island was 87% complete when the federal suspension order arrived in December — just five months after an initial stop work order halted the project.










As Governor, I’m not going to stand by and let President Trump price Rhode Islanders out of their way of life.


– Gov. Dan McKee


The second halt to construction threatened major financial losses for the international developers, while putting Rhode Island’s economic and environmental future in limbo. McKee singled out Tony Vaz, a union carpenter and one of 2,000 local laborers employed through the Revolution Wind project.
“Tony, until this project is complete, I will stand shoulder to shoulder with my fellow Democratic governors and put the full weight of our state behind this fight,” McKee said. “Let me be clear: We will not back down.”
Other guests of honor who received shoutouts during McKee’s remarks included Sonya Cheteyan, a senior at Rhode Island College and one of the first soon-to-be graduates from the college’s new cybersecurity program; Nashaly Salazar Martinez, a working mom who staggered shifts with her husband, Austin, because they couldn’t afford child care; George Ortiz, co-founder and chief servant officer of the ELISHA Project, which helped fill gaps in food assistance during the federal government shutdown; and John Galvin, president of AAA Northeast.
The Providence insurance company was recently awarded $6.8 million in redeemable state tax credits to expand its local operations for its related insurance carrier, Motor Club Insurance Company. The carrier plans to hire 370 workers and open a new claims center by 2030.
 J-O-B-S

McKee called jobs “the heart of opportunity,” underscoring the emphasis by spelling out the four-letter word. 
Under his administration, the state has added 36,000 private sector jobs. That includes, including significant expansions and openings of major companies, from Fidelity to Amazon, Blount Fine Foods and REGENT.
“We’re not just attracting new companies and helping existing businesses grow,” McKee said. “We’re putting people to work, building projects that will pay dividends for generations to come.”
Jobs and workforce development form the foundation for a massive $600 million borrowing scheme McKee pitched Tuesday, subject to voters’ approval on the ballot in November, as follows:

 $215 million to support infrastructure improvements at all three state higher education institutions
 $120 million to boost housing supply, including a dedicated $25 million carveout to increase home ownership; 
$115 million to expand maritime and defense infrastructure, invest in life science and manufacturing companies
 $50 million to upgrade career and technical education classrooms in public secondary schools
A new state history center (amount unspecified) as requested by Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore. Amore initially failed to win over lawmakers on a $102 million state archives building in 2024, but returned with a proposal for a scaled-down $60 million version.

A separate, $20 million homeownership program will be launching later this month, McKee said. Also coming up on the calendar: the scheduled sale of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital.
The Centurion Foundation has pledged to finish lining up the financing to buy the hospitals by Friday, as bankrupt owner Prospect Medical Holdings looks for a fast exit.  
McKee, whose administration unsuccessfully tried to orchestrate a backup offer from Landmark Medical Center’s owner, Prime Healthcare, said Tuesday he will “do everything in our power” to keep the safety net hospitals open.
Tucked into the nearly hourlong speech was a brief acknowledgement of what preliminary polls suggest might be the biggest problem facing McKee’s reelection: the Washington Bridge. McKee has repeatedly rebuffed questions concerning oversight and repair work to the aging westbound highway before its late 2023 closure. But his forthcoming fiscal 2027 spending plan will provide “additional engineering oversight” at the state transportation department to review inspection reports as a preventative step, McKee said.
He did not address potential consequences for Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. Helena Buonanno Foulkes, McKee’s 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, said she would fire Alviti if elected governor. Foulkes also excoriated McKee for the lengthy and costly rebuild.
But, as McKee noted, the replacement bridge’s November 2028 completion date is two years sooner than the expected rebuild of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland, which collapsed in March 2024, killing six people. 
McKee ended his sixth State of the State address with a message of resilience. 
“As we all think about the future of our state over the next few years, this is my commitment to you: Together, we will stand up to President Trump when he tries to take away Rhode Islanders’ health care, food assistance, jobs, or the programs that families rely on,” McKee said. “I am asking the people of our state to join me, and together, we will continue to build the future Rhode Island deserves — because Rhode Island’s future is one worth fighting for.”
House Minority Leader Michael Chippendale, a Foster Republican, is scheduled to deliver the response on behalf of the state Republicans.

When the board adopted a plan without a voting site on the Greensboro campus, students stood with their signs near the front of the room behind the presenters’ desk. 
After a student said board members wouldn’t look them in the eye, board Chairman Francis De Luca threatened to call the cops on students if they didn’t leave. One student said the outcome would have been different if the group was white. De Luca said he resented that suggestion.
Jeff Carmon, the state board’s only Black member, walked up to the students and encouraged them to keep working. 
The student protest was just one mark in a contentious meeting where the state board’s Republican majority decided that Elon University and Western Carolina University also will not have early voting sites for the primary, even though those colleges have a history of hosting polling places. 
Western Carolina University in Jackson County has had a polling place on campus since 2016 that’s been used in five general elections and four primaries, according to a document prepared for the board.  The state board voted 3-2 to get rid of it. 
Without the campus site, the closest polling place for students will be a recreation center nearly two miles away. Students without transportation will have to walk along a four-lane highway and through a meadow to get there. 
Closing the campus voting site would not save money, but “would create barriers to voting for young, rural residents,” Jackson County Board member Betsy Swift told the state board. 
Sixty-four percent of students don’t have vehicles, she said. 
But Jackson County Board Chairman Bill Thompson said parking on campus is scarce, and students will find their way to the recreation center. 
“Students are adults,” he said. “They’ve demonstrated above-average ability and mobility.”
Taylor Bucklin, a Raleigh resident and recent Western Carolina University graduate, said getting rid of the campus voting site will hurt student engagement and reduce voter turnout. 
“This is an awful, evil decision,” she said. “I don’t agree with it one bit.”
Board member Siobhan Millen, a Democrat, said she was disappointed but not surprised by the votes. 
“We want to encourage kids to vote, so I’m kind of disappointed how it came out,” she said. “Student voting is in the crosshairs.”
A&T students gathered outside after the board rejected a campus site. 
Zayveon Davis, a voter engagement leader at the HBCU, said shuttles would be available for students to vote at the nearest polling place. 
“It’s really disappointing that we came all this way for our voices not to be heard, for us to be laughed at to our face, and for our votes not to be protected, but I’m extremely proud of the effort that we did today,” Davis said. “So I hope that everybody leaves here knowing that your voice does matter. Your vote does matter. And if it didn’t, they wouldn’t be working this hard to take it away.”

Sunday voting rejected
The board’s Republican majority also rejected several counties’ early voting plans that included Sunday voting hours. 
Local county boards of elections adopt early voting plans for primary and general elections that include polling locations and hours. If local boards do not unanimously agree on a plan, the state board decides. The state board can vote on a plan posed by the county board majority, the minority, or come up with its own plan. 
The state board set plans for a dozen counties on Tuesday where local board votes were not unanimous. 
In five of those counties, they rejected Sunday voting hours. 
Harnett will not have Sunday hours for the first time since 2018. Sunday voting was eliminated in Greene County, which has had Sunday voting hours for primaries and general elections since 2016.
Democrats on the Brunswick County elections board wanted to add Sunday hours to accommodate the county’s fast-growing population. The state board majority rejected that plan. 
Democrats on the Craven board wanted Sunday hours, but Craven Board Chairman Ross Hardeman told the state board there was no precedent for Sunday voting in midterm elections. 
The state board voted against Sunday hours even in an instance where the local board’s majority wanted them: the Columbus County Republican board chairwoman voted with the board’s two Democrats for Sunday hours. 
“She believes in the value of Sunday voting,” Carmon said of the Columbus Chairwoman Jillian McPherson-Edge. “What are we doing if we don’t support what the chair of this particular board believes?”
Noting that Columbus has had Sunday voting hours in recent years, Millen said the state is “retreating,” and going against the advice of the county Republican chair. 
“I just find that outrageous,” she said. 
Most votes were 3-2 with Republicans in the majority. 
Republicans tend to want to limit Sunday voting and college student voting. 
During a break in the meeting, De Luca said he does not like voting sites on university campuses.
“I’m not thrilled,” De Lucas said. “There’s no parking. They may set aside parking, if it’s filled, you’re going to get a ticket. We don’t put sites where there’s no parking anywhere else.”
De Luca said he is also against Sunday voting. “I don’t think we should be voting on Sunday,” he said. “I know a lot of people who do nothing on Sunday because that’s the Lord’s day.”
Sunday early voting is frequently used by Black churches for “Souls to the Polls” voter engagement drives.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4969-1024x593.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 19:11:50.326717

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)A ban on police face coverings has been one of the most talked about policy proposals in the first two days of Washington’s legislative session, with lead lawmakers and the governor lining up in support.
Senate Bill 5855, which covers local, state and federal law enforcement, stems from fears of masked federal agents carrying out immigration raids and arrests across the country. 
The bill’s prime sponsor, Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, said he thinks “it will make our marginalized immigrant communities feel safer” and build trust between the public and police.
Last week, for example, masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents reportedly arrested three people and pulled them into an unmarked van, according to The Seattle Times.
The House speaker and Senate majority leader both cited the bill as a priority, and Gov. Bob Ferguson called it out in his State of the State address on Tuesday. 
“As an American, I never thought I would see federal agents in masks jumping out of unmarked cars and grabbing people off our streets,” Ferguson said during the speech. “Let’s get that legislation to my desk immediately.”
Ferguson’s comments were greeted by a standing ovation from Democratic lawmakers. 
Pete Serrano, who leads the federal prosecutor’s office in eastern Washington, told the Senate Law and Justice Committee on Tuesday the bill could run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Serrano, who also serves as “special attorney” to Attorney General Pam Bondi, cited the Constitution’s supremacy clause that holds federal statutes “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.” 
In September, California became the first state to approve such a ban. It took effect Jan. 1. 
The Trump administration is suing to block the law. Sen. Jeff Holy, R-Cheney, argued the Washington bill “isn’t ready for primetime” until courts weigh in on the California law. 
The federal government has argued masking is necessary for immigration agents threatened by members of the public who can share authorities’ personal information online.
Under the legislation, people detained by masked officers could sue them in their official capacity, potentially opening up local governments to legal liability.
There would be exceptions to the ban, like for undercover officers or members of SWAT operations. It also doesn’t cover face shields, helmets or personal protective equipment.
In 2021, the Legislature passed a law requiring officers be “reasonably identifiable” while on duty, but it doesn’t touch on face coverings. The same year, Congress required military members and federal law enforcement to visibly display their name and employer while responding to civil disturbances. The federal law exempts those who don’t wear uniforms while carrying out their duties and those working undercover.
The Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs is opposed to the new legislation. James McMahan, the group’s policy director, told lawmakers current law requiring authorities to be “reasonably identifiable” is enough and the bill needs more exemptions, like for officers working in freezing weather.
Paula Sardinas, founder of the Washington Build Back Black Alliance, called the legislation a “common sense accountability measure.”

“Accountability is not anti-police, transparency is not anti-safety,” Sardinas said. “Clear standards protect the officers and the public alike by reducing escalations, misunderstandings and harm.”
The Law and Justice Committee is set to vote on the bill Thursday, putting it a step closer to the Senate floor. The identical version of the legislation in the House was also set to be heard in committee Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A House subcommittee advanced a bill Tuesday that would prohibit carbon dioxide pipeline operators from exercising eminent domain for the purpose of building a carbon sequestration pipeline. 
Landowners and some Iowa Republicans have been opposed to the use of eminent domain, or the taking of private property with just compensation for public use, in relation to a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. 
The House passed a similar bill last year, and a faction of senators attempted to amend a different pipeline-related bill to an eminent domain ban, but the effort was not accepted on the Senate floor. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said the language in House Study Bill 507 is “as simple as it can get.” Holt said the bill would not stop the pipeline from being built, but would protect Iowans’ private property rights.  
“Economic development is of profound importance, but it does not trump fundamentally constitutional rights,” Holt said. “The use of government power to seek property for a private economic development project is not constitutional.”
Opponents of the bill argued it would stall economic growth in the state by blocking construction of the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, a project that would connect to ethanol plants in Iowa and surrounding states and transport sequestered carbon dioxide from the plants to underground storage. 
This would give Iowa’s renewable fuel industry access to the ultra-low carbon fuel market.
The project has already been affected by a South Dakota law banning the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines. Recent filings indicate Summit may change course from its original plan to sequester the carbon dioxide in North Dakota, in order to avoid crossing through South Dakota. 
Jake Ketzner, speaking on behalf of Summit Carbon Solutions, said HSB 507 would “kill” the project and take away Iowa’s ability to compete in new and emerging markets for low carbon ethanol.
Ketzner said the company instead supports a bill that widens the pipeline corridor beyond the route in its state permit to allow the pipeline to find a route without having to cross through unwilling landowner’s property.
“This bill is a ban,” Ketzner said. “We can do better.”

Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, has said he plans to file a bill related to eminent domain. While not yet filed, Klimesh has said his bill, rather than banning eminent domain, would allow pipeline operators to deviate from their approved routes to instead find passage with willing landowners. 
Klimesh has said his vision for dealing with the controversial topic, is similar to an amendment filed by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, to the pipeline bill in 2025. 
This amendment was opposed by Senate Democrats and a group of Senate Republicans who sided with the majority of House Republicans on the pipeline issue. The pipeline has caused tension within the Iowa Republican Party. 
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said the bill boils down to the constitutional rights and protections that Iowans have around property. Thomson said even with the bill, there are still issues of eminent domain that will have to be solved in the state of Iowa.
“The Summit proposal is a clever, but very corrupt perversion of our constitutional system,” Thomson said.
Several representatives from labor unions also spoke against the bill and said it would lead to a “direct result in job loss for the Iowa trades workers.”
Landowners who testified in favor of the bill said Summit could still build its pipeline if the bill were enacted, but it would protect them from eminent domain.
Pipeline opponents say House is behind them
Earlier in the day, landowners opposed to the pipeline project gathered in the Iowa State Capitol Rotunda to kick off their fifth year lobbying against the project. 
Last year marked the first time a pipeline-related bill was taken up in the Senate, and while the bill narrowly passed the chamber, it was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds. 
Landowners, wearing their signature red attire, joined in a prayer led by Rockwell City pastor Dillon Brandt. He prayed lawmakers would “seek what is best for the people, the land and future generations.”
Peg Rasmussen, a Montgomery County landowner impacted by the second proposed phase of Summit’s project, came to the Capitol Tuesday to begin her second year lobbying against the pipeline. 
Rasmussen said she felt the House was “solidly behind” the pipeline fighters’ cause, but said the Senate, “as always” will be a challenge. 
Rasmussen said Holt’s bill was a “simple clean bill.” 
In her veto message, Reynolds said House File 639 had “vague legal standards and sweeping mandates” rather than “clear, careful lines.”
Rasmussen said landowners, about 80 of whom were in attendance Tuesday, have asked some of the senators who have been previously on their side to submit an eminent domain ban — like HSB 507 — in the Senate. 
She said that while she hasn’t seen the language of Klimesh’s bill, she doubts it’s “as short and simple” as HSB 507. 
What about the Senate bill?
Holt argued that a bill widening the pipeline corridor may reduce the use of eminent domain for the project, but it does not protect landowners as eminent domain could still be used.
Tom Hayes, president of South Central Iowa Federation of Labor, spoke in opposition to the bill and said for all of the pipeline projects he has worked on, eminent domain was a problem.
“This bill can knock out only the carbon capture pipeline,” Hayes said.
He argued a bill that allowed pipeline operators to look outside of their approved routes would go further in preventing the use of eminent domain on private property owners.
Holt and Thomson held that carbon capture pipelines do not rise to the level of a public use that is required for the use of eminent domain.
“I will continue to support ethanol, I will continue to support corn growers, and I will continue to support agriculture, but they do not trump the constitutional rights of the good men and women sitting in this room,” Holt said.
Holt advanced the bill to the House Judiciary Committee.

“His quality of life would go down because I wouldn’t be able to pay for what we need to live,” Basham said. 
A funding freeze on federal safety-net programs that support low-income families and their children will harm all families who seek child care in the state, providers and advocates said in a press call U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, organized Tuesday.  
The Trump administration froze $10 billion for the Child Care Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and the Social Services Block Grant programs in Colorado, Minnesota, New York, California and Illinois. The states all have Democratic governors, and the funding freeze is seen by Democrats as punishment against states disfavored by President Donald Trump.

The Administration for Children and Families, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told the states they will not get money for the programs while the federal government conducts a “thorough review of the State’s use of funding for compliance and alignment with statutory requirements.” 
Sharyl Boehm and Cheryl Gould, co-owners of the Rocky Mountain Children’s Discovery Center in Cañon City, have worked in child care for 30 years. The funding freeze will have “immediate and devastating consequences for families and educators at our facility alone,” Boehm said. She said 42 children and their families would immediately have their child care upended. 
“These parents rely on child care assistance in order to work and support their families,” Boehm said. “The majority of our families in this rural area, it takes two. So both parents are working as hard as they can to pay the bills, and without child care, that doesn’t happen. It’s an impossible choice between employment and caring for their own children.”
Rocky Mountain Children’s Discovery Center has been caring for Basham’s son since he was 6 months old.
“They know about his fears, and they know how to comfort him, and they work with him in every way,” Basham said. “I will be one of the people that will not go to work because my son needs to be safe, and I know he’s safe at Rocky Mountain. ”
Parents have started posting on social media looking for anybody to care for their child, which Boehm said is “really scary” because people who are not licensed or qualified may end up providing child care. Gould said having fewer children in their center due to the funding cuts will affect their bottom line, and could also lead to employee furloughs.










These parents rely on child care assistance in order to work and support their families,” Boehm said. “The majority of our families in this rural area, it takes two. So both parents are working as hard as they can to pay the bills, and without child care, that doesn't happen. It's an impossible choice between employment and caring for their own children.


– Sharyl Boehm, co-owner of Rocky Mountain Children’s Discovery Center in Cañon City


“It really hits us in the heart to say to these families, ‘No, you can’t come because there’s no funding,’” Gould said. “ That’s just not right. Everybody knows somebody who is dependent on child care.”
Pettersen, a mother of two young children, said the $3 million being withheld for child care assistance will affect 27,000 children in Colorado, most of whom are under the age of 3. She said the federal assistance only goes to families whose income is less than $59,000 a year. 
“Half of our state already lives in a child care desert, and we have one of the most expensive child care systems in the country,” Pettersen said in the virtual press call. “Colorado loses a billion dollars in revenue because of lack of access to child care, and 10,000 women have said that they would like to be in the workforce, but they can’t afford child care, and that has a huge impact on our economy.”
New burden for county staff
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat running for governor, filed a lawsuit with the other affected states that says the president does not have the authority to unilaterally freeze funding approved by Congress for the states. A judge issued a temporary order halting the funding freeze last week.
The sudden funding freeze undermines the stability of children and their families, as well as local and state economies, according to Heather Tritten, president and CEO of the Colorado Children’s Campaign, a nonprofit policy and research organization. Colorado also uses CCDF funds to train and license all of its child care providers, she said. 
“While the freeze is currently paused, this action should never have occurred,” Tritten said. “Children can’t vote. They can’t run for office, and programs that support children should never be used in political gamesmanship.” 
Colorado receives about $136 million in block funding for TANF, administered through Colorado Works, every year. In 2024, a Colorado family of three received a maximum monthly TANF benefit of $585, according to the National Center for Children in Poverty. Last year, the state was allocated about $140 million in federal funds to pay for care for children in low-income families, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Colorado’s federal assistance for child care is administered through counties, so the funding freeze adds an additional burden for county staff, Lisa Roy, executive director of the Colorado Department of Early Childhood, said. She said state agencies are working together to monitor the impacts of the funding freeze and supplementing with state dollars where possible.
“The funding ensures children are in safe, nurturing early learning environments while enabling parents to work,” Roy said. “They can also pursue education, but most of all, maintain economic stability.”
The state anticipates its federal funding to support child care will run out by Jan. 31.

“I’d like to take the opportunity to tell you a little bit about how the gun got in my bag,” Christina Nolan, a prospective Vermont Supreme Court justice and former top federal prosecutor in the state, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. 
The committee was hearing from Gov. Phil Scott’s most recent two nominees to the Vermont Supreme Court, as their appointments require Senate confirmation. 
Nolan explained herself after Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, asked her about an email he received about “a firearm in a courthouse security system,” an incident that made headlines in August. 
Nolan said it started when she was an assistant U.S. attorney. Someone she prosecuted began threatening to torture and kill her family, she said, so she bought a gun. 
A few times, Nolan and her wife heard knocks on their door that spooked them. And one night while Nolan was upstairs, her partner yelled for her and said that someone was knocking again. She took out her gun and went downstairs, Nolan said, and when she went to get the door, the person was gone. 
Maybe a classic game of ding dong ditch? Nolan didn’t think so — she was armed and ready. She must have brought her gun upstairs and put it in her bag, she said. 
“The bag that I was carrying was like a Mary Poppins bag,” Nolan said, bottomless and full of stuff. 
When she walked into a courthouse in Windham County the next morning, security guards found the gun in her bag, she said. State law bans firearms and other deadly weapons from courthouses.
But Nolan said it was a mistake. “I try my darndest not to make the same mistake twice,” she said. 
Instead of being charged with a crime, Nolan partook in a pre-charge diversion program and a gun safety course, she said. “I’m a rule follower,” she assured senators. 
Besides accidentally toting a gun, Nolan reminded senators that she prosecuted the notorious EB-5 scandal at Jay Peak resort in the mid-2010s and played a major role in a federal prosecutors’ $8 billion legal settlement with Purdue Pharma in 2020. 
Nolan also assured the committee that she thinks the court should uphold the rule of law and act as a bulwark against government oversight, especially executive action.  
Scott’s other nominee, Michael Drescher, last week resigned as Vermont’s top federal prosecutor, he told the committee. Though he and Nolan served under President Donald Trump — and Nolan ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in 2022 — both emphasized that the court should be apolitical. 
The candidates need Senate confirmation to serve as justices. Baruth said that as the bench feels more politicized under Trump’s administration, he will encourage the chamber to maintain “evenhandedness” when considering the nominees.

In the know
Nikhil Goyal, an adjunct assistant professor of sociology at the University of Vermont and former policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Monday announced he’s running for state Senate in the Chittenden Central district.
The district, Vermont’s most urban and diverse, is currently represented by Pro Tem Baruth, a Democrat/Progressive; Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, a Progressive/Democrat; and Democratic Sen. Martine Gulick.
Goyal, an author, says he’s seeking both the Democratic and Progressive nominations.

Lawmakers may seek to expand penalties for animal cruelty in light of recent abuse cases.
Rep. Emilie Krasnow, D-South Burlington, is sponsoring H.578 and kicked off an afternoon of testimony on the bill in the House Judiciary Committee. The bill, which is tentatively scheduled for a committee vote this week, would expand the definition of sexual conduct with an animal, make certain discretionary penalties mandatory and make it easier for the state or welfare organizations to receive money from defendants to pay for the care of abused animals.
“How we treat animals reflects who we are as a community,” Krasnow told the committee.

Hot topics
In a packed House Corrections and Institutions Committee, Rep. Will Greer, D-Bennington, fanned himself with a sheet of paper and asked Rep. Brian Minier, D-South Burlington, to turn down the heat. Must be all the people in the room, Greer said. 
Minier didn’t even touch the thermostat, saying it didn’t work anyway.  
“Some politician you are, Brian,” Greer said, implying a good one would’ve lied.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A state Senate panel advanced a proposal expanding a law originally passed to keep Confederate monuments in place.
The bill introduced by Sen. Danny Verdin, R-Laurens, and co-sponsored by 29 other Republicans would extend the protections under a portion of state law, commonly called the Heritage Act, to all memorials on public property in South Carolina. It also would stop the addition of informational plaques placed near some monuments in recent years offering broader context on the bad parts of history.
Republicans on the panel, chaired by Verdin, voted with little debate to move the legislation along for consideration by the full Senate Finance Committee. The two Democrats on the panel did not vote.
Representatives of two associations representing South Carolina’s cities and counties opposed the proposal, saying it pre-empts local authority. Members of only one group, the American Heritage Association, spoke in favor. It formed in 2018 to fight the removal of monuments.
A twin proposal in the House has yet to be heard.
A statue’s removal
For a quarter-century, state law has given the Legislature sole authority over whether to remove or change the name of any building or memorial on public property that commemorates American wars, as well as Native American or African American history.
But that did not stop the 2020 removal of the bronze statue of John C. Calhoun from a downtown Charleston park, prompting the Charleston-based association to declare the so-called Heritage Act — a title that’s actually nowhere in state law — “no longer effective.”
The group sued on behalf of descendants of Calhoun two years after Charleston City Council voted to lift the statue from its 125-foot pedestal, where it stood for 124 years. The council’s vote came in the aftermath of a white police officer killing George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis. The group wanted it put back on public display somewhere in Charleston.
The city of Charleston argued in court it was within its rights because the statue was not on public property. The city leases the square from the Board of Field Officers of the Fourth Brigade, a historic militia that owns Marion Square where the statue sat atop a stone pillar.
Plus, the city continued, the 12-foot-tall figure didn’t memorialize a war, Native Americans or Black history.
While Calhoun, a former U.S. congressman, secretary of war, and vice president under two presidents was a fierce defender of slavery, he died 11 years before the first shots of the Civil War were fired in Charleston Harbor.
SC legislators seek to expand Heritage Act protections to all public memorials

Attorney General Alan Wilson gave the same reasoning in an opinion released days after Calhoun came down in June 2020: The Calhoun statue was not protected by the law, he wrote.
When the group faced legal challenges over whether it was actually eligible to sue, the association followed up last year by asking legislators to change the law altogether, amid more efforts by other boards and municipalities to oust memorials honoring certain controversial historic and Confederate figures.
Legal standing
Though it’s called the Heritage Act, those words don’t actually appear in state law. The memorial protection was part of a 2000 compromise that moved the Confederate flag from atop the Statehouse dome to a 30-foot flagpole beside a Confederate memorial on the Statehouse’s front lawn. (That compromise also made both Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Confederate Memorial Day state holidays.)
The Legislature removed the flag from the grounds entirely in 2015, following the massacre of nine Black parishioners of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston by an avowed white supremacist.
Brett Barry with the American Heritage Association told senators that his group raised and spent $250,000 in legal fees to no avail, as Charleston Circuit Court Judge Jennifer McCoy ruled in January 2024 that only the state attorney general can enforce the Heritage Act.
Wilson, in a separate lawsuit over a marker elsewhere in Charleston, submitted a court brief last July saying his office does not have the resources to defend the more than 1,000 monuments across the state.
“We spend all this money on these legal cases, but because of deficiencies in the Heritage Act, none of our lawsuits have ever been tried on the merits, but rather dismissed or forced to settle on appeal,” Barry said.
In addition to expanding the scope of monuments covered under the law, the proposed legislation would allow private organizations to sue to block removal and punish people who vandalize or move a monument without the Legislature’s approval.
A judge could order restitution. The state could also withhold tax aid to local governments where it happened.
Meanwhile, Charleston and the American Heritage Association reached a settlement in July over the Calhoun statue’s removal. The city turned the statue over to a newly formed nonprofit called the Calhoun Monument Preservation Society, which has said it will put the monument somewhere outside the city limits.
Historical marker installed
While the Calhoun memorial no longer stands in the Charleston park, a relocated monument honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was put nearby.
In 2021, the Charleston County School District removed the 2.4-ton highway monument from the Charter School for Math and Science on King Street. The American Heritage Association sued again, this time on behalf of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which had originally installed the marker.
This time, the attorney general filing a friend-of-the-court brief saying the 2021 removal violated the Heritage Act.
Ultimately, the lawsuit was dropped after the group reached an agreement with Marion Square’s owners. The monument has been in the park since December.
Other monuments
Other monument removals that have drawn the ire of the American Heritage Association include:

A statue of Christopher Columbus pulled from a city park in Columbia and transferred to the S.C. State Museum after it was vandalized in 2020.
A name change to a city of Charleston auditorium whose previous namesake, Christopher Memminger, owned slaves and served as the Confederate States’ first treasury secretary.
Attempts in North Augusta to remove an obelisk memorializing Thomas McKie Meriwether, a white man who died participating in a mob that attacked a Black South Carolina militia at what became known as the Hamburg Massacre during the 1876 governor’s race. The mob captured and executed four of the Black soldiers. The city, last year, installed educational panels telling the story of the massacre. An inscription says the white supremacists “do not represent the attitudes of the people of North Augusta today,” the North Augusta Star reported.

In cases, such as the Meriwether memorial, Barry told legislators the plaques “seek to denigrate the monument’s subject matter, thereby allowing perhaps the greatest alteration of all.”
“By physically altering these sites with purported modern clarifications, we effectively hijack the original intent,” he said. “By prohibiting the physical alteration of monuments, we allow history to exist as it was, providing future generations intellectual freedom to engage with our ancestors on their own terms.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_0602-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 18:58:58.738784

(Photo courtesy of Essentia Health) North Dakota health officials are encouraging residents to pay attention to potential flu symptoms after five influenza-associated deaths this flu season — with two deaths in children younger than 10.  
North Dakota had not reported a childhood flu death since 2016. 
“It remains rare,” Dr. Michelle Dethloff with the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said of child deaths. 
But cases of the flu have not been rare this flu season. 
More than 5,000 cases have been reported in North Dakota as of Jan. 3. There were 1,727 cases reported during the week of Christmas. 
“Cases have been widespread across the state,” Dethloff said. 
Dr. Justin Reisenauer, chief medical officer for Sanford Health, said flu season is hard for parents of children who don’t yet have language skills to describe symptoms. 
“It definitely can be scary for parents,” Reisenauer said. 
Some symptoms to watch for include fewer wet diapers, dark urine and not seeing tears when a child cries — all signs of dehydration. Other signs include increased fussiness or being lethargic, congestion, fevers, blue lips or fingertips and labored breathing. 
North Dakota officials celebrate being among big winners in federal rural health funding

“Where you see the ribs flaring out on the sides of their chest wall when they’re trying to breathe, or you see their nose flaring at their nostrils as they’re trying to breathe, or their belly is sucking way in and then pushing out, we call that belly breathing, those are indications of the infant or child struggling to breathe and having to work extra hard to move air,” Reisenauer said.
Parents should seek medical attention in those cases, he said. 
Hospitalizations because of the flu have been climbing in recent years, state data shows, and vaccination rates have been declining. 
About 25% of North Dakotans have had a flu vaccine this season, with those over the age of 65 the most likely to get a shot. The state vaccination rate had been above 30% as recently as the 2023-24 flu season. 
But it is not too late. 
Dr. Josh Honeyman, an emergency medicine physician at Essentia Health in Fargo, said people can still get the vaccine, even if they have already been sick. 
While influenza A is the primary strain affecting North Dakotans so far, influenza B could pick up later in the season, Honeyman said. Someone who’s already been sick with one strain could catch the other one, he added.
But wait until you are feeling healthy again before getting a shot, Honeyman said. 
Dethloff said a vaccination will cover both those strains. 
While new cases may be declining, “there can be a second wave,” she said, as flu season can sometimes stretch into April or May. 
COVID-19 and RSV are other respiratory diseases that are circulating, but at much lower levels than the flu. 
Dethloff reminded people to stay home when they are feeling sick, to cover their cough and wash hands regularly.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A key step to preventing the spread of diseases like COVID-19 or influenza is simple: washing hands. But lack of piped water in parts of rural Alaska has made that simple practice not so easy to carry out.
Now a technological innovation has boosted rural Alaskans’ ability to do that important disease-fighting task.
The Miniature Portable Alternative Sanitation System, or Mini-PASS, a portable water station that does not require connection to any piped water system, proved effective at helping people wash their hands properly, and there are signs that its use is fending off contagious diseases among children, according to a recently published study.
The Mini-PASS is a stripped-down version of the full Portable Alternative Sanitation System that was also designed by Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and its partners.
The full PASS units typically store 50 to 100 gallons of water, and the units include connections to septic tanks, allowing for flush toilets to take the place of “honey buckets,” the plastic-bag-lined buckets commonly used in rural Alaska areas lacking water and sewer systems. The Mini-PASS units lack those septic connections, and they typically allow for storage of 20 gallons of water. Storage tanks are placed above sinks, and used water drains into collection buckets.
The Mini-PASS units are much cheaper than full PASS systems, costing a little over $10,000 for construction and delivery, according to ANTHC. A full PASS system can cost about $50,000 per household, according to ANTHC. That sum is vastly lower than the cost of extending piped water and sanitation service, which can total $400,000 or more per household in parts of rural Alaska.
Simplicity had its virtues during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, there was urgency for distributing Mini-PASS units to several rural communities — places where people living in unpiped homes were hauling water, often in difficult circumstances, then using and reusing it in germ-spreading basins.
The consortium, with the help of partners, distributed hundreds of Mini-PASS units to rural households during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 350 units had been distributed as of 2021, and more have gone out since then.
“The idea was people were not going to be reusing the water, that it was free flowing, that you’d wash your hands, and then it would go into the wastewater bucket, the gray water bucket,” said Laura Eichelberger, an ANTHC research consultant and co-author of the study.
“And because the pandemic was this urgent situation of crisis, they needed to get as many of these units in as they possibly could. And so they took the idea of the PASS and just made it as simple and cheap as possible,” she said.
The recent study used interviews to measure the effectiveness of mini-PASS. In all, there were 163 interviews from 52 households.
Water use is considered an indicator of public health, and the Mini-PASS units led to an increase in water use that expanded over time, the results found. Average water use per person increased by 0.08 gallons per month in households that used the units, meaning that after a year, water use was up by 0.96 gallons a day per person, or 3.6 liters per day, the results found.
Additionally, people with Mini-PASS units reported that children 12 and under had fewer symptoms of contagious diseases.
There was a “statistically significant decrease in the reported symptoms, respiratory in particular, for households who were actively using the Mini-PASS as their primary hand- washing method, compared to those that were still using wash basins,” said Amanda Hansen, the study’s lead author and another ANTHC health researcher.
Prior to the distribution of Mini-PASS units, water use in unpiped villages in Alaska averaged only 5.7 liters per person per day, according to a 2021 study by researchers at Canada’s McGill University. That was well below the World Health Organization standard of 20 liters per person per day, according to that study.
Parts of rural Alaska continue to face daunting challenges in securing adequate water and sanitation services.
Parts of rural Alaska continue to face daunting challenges in securing adequate water and sanitation services. According to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, more than 30 communities were considered “unserved” as of 2020. The category applied when less than 55% of homes are served by piped, septic and well or covered haul systems.
Still, there has been significant progress in recent years. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the number of rural Alaskan homes without water, sewer or both has decreased by a notable 70% over the past two decades.

Kim Jackson leads a press conference introducing Democratic bills intended to limit ICE's power in Georgia. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Senate Democrats unveiled a raft of proposed bills Tuesday that they say will protect Georgians from what they characterized as a rogue federal government using immigration enforcement to terrorize citizens.
“As this regime has sought to build a wall against progress, the progress of achieving America’s values and ideals, we must build a wall against (President Donald Trump),” said Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones. “And the legislation presented here today is a step towards protecting all of Georgia’s citizens and making sure that we continue to pursue America’s ideals and goals.”
The bills seek to restrain the operations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the National Guard in Georgia.
ICE, which is tasked with enforcing immigration laws, has been subject to increased scrutiny since sharply increasing the scale of its operations under the Trump administration. On Jan. 7, an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Good in her car, sparking widespread protests of the federal agency’s tactics nationwide, including in Georgia.
Identifying ICE agents
Stone Mountain Democratic Sen. Kim Jackson’s Senate Bill 389 requires ICE agents to display badges and bans them from wearing face coverings while on duty other than for medical or safety reasons or while conducting covert operations.
“We have men who are unidentifiable roaming our streets, snatching up people and taking them and then they are able to commit crimes and hide because we don’t even know their identity,” Jackson said. “So my bill will call for ICE agents to take off their mask to show their face.”
Critics of ICE’s tactics say agents wear masks and cover their badges to avoid being identified and held accountable for violence or illegal behavior.
Supporters of the agency like Savannah Republican Rep. Jesse Petrea say masking has become a necessity because agents and their families have had their personal information published and received threats after their faces have appeared on social media.
“Clearly the reason the masks are out there is the progressive left has been doxxing them and endangering their families and threatening their families and threatening them in a very personal way. That’s unacceptable,” Petrea said. “So if they want to mask themselves, that’s perfectly fine with me.”
Petrea said ICE agents have experienced steep increases in threats and attacks since Trump took office last January, which Petrea calls politically motivated. The Trump administration has pursued a mass deportation campaign.
National Guard deployments
Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Senate Bill 390, which was sponsored by Jones, aims to codify that National Guard troops cannot be stationed in Georgia without the permission of the governor unless the deployed troops are “in the service of the United States and are acting under authority that is validly invoked by the President of the United States.”
Trump has deployed National Guard troops to cities including Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; Chicago and Memphis. The Trump administration has argued that the deployments are necessary to prevent crime, while Democrats argue they are illegal shows of force.
The bill would have no effect on the Georgia National Guard deployment to Washington announced by Gov. Brian Kemp in September.
ICE out of schools, churches
Sen. Nabilah Parkes. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Duluth Democratic Sen. Nabilah Parkes’ SB 391 would require a judicial warrant for any state, local or federal agency to conduct immigration operations at a school, college campus, public place of worship, hospital, public library or family violence shelter.
“Kids should be focused on learning, not fear, and parents should be able to drop their children off at school knowing it is a place of stability and not disruption, and no one should get dragged out of their home or workplace without a judicial warrant,” said Parkes, who is running for Georgia insurance commissioner. “That’s basic constitutional due process.”
Suing ICE
Sen. Josh McLaurin. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Sandy Springs Democratic Sen. Josh McLaurin said he introduced SB 397 to allow Georgians to bring civil action against federal officials who violate Georgians’ constitutional rights.
McLaurin said the bill’s passage would make ICE agents face the same potential legal consequences as state and local law enforcement officers for violating Georgians’ rights.
“ICE does not currently face that threat in Georgia, which means they know that if they act unchecked, nothing will happen to them,” he said. “A personal lawsuit against ICE agents under Georgia law is essential to deterring ICE agents from ever committing these crimes in the first place.”
A difficult road
Jackson acknowledged that bills restricting ICE operations will have a tough time achieving passage in a Republican-dominated state during an election year.
“We understand that the road to the governor’s desk is quite limited, that path is narrow, but we also stand here and hope that common sense and good policy might persuade a few of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stand up and to resist and to be a part of good policy making on behalf of the good people of Georgia,” she said.
Rep. Jesse Petrea. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
But Petrea argued that the good people of Georgia already have good immigration policy.
Petrea said Georgia has not seen major ICE activities as in states like Minnesota in part because of state law requiring local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE.
In 2024, Kemp signed Petrea’s “Criminal Alien Track and Report Act.”
In an interview Tuesday, Petrea said that cooperation makes immigration enforcement safer for everyone.
“They’re going straight to ICE when they’re requested, so ICE is just picking them up and taking the bad guys out,” he said. “You don’t have to go into the community and break down doors when the bad guys, in this instance, are handed over to you by law enforcement.”

During – and again after – Tuesday’s first meeting of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, co-chairman Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, alleged the budget proposal Gov. Brad Little presented Monday does not balance and was built on gimmicks. 
After Tuesday’s meeting adjourned, Tanner issued a press release alleging Little’s proposed budget “does not balance on an ongoing basis” and leaves year-end cash balances that Tanner described as dangerously low.
Idaho Legislative Guidebook: How is the state budget set?

“The governor’s budget does not balance,” Tanner wrote in his press release. “It relies on one-time gimmicks, spends more than the state takes in on an ongoing basis, and leaves Idaho with the lowest ending fund balances in nearly a decade.”
“These razor-thin reserves leave Idaho with virtually no margin for error,” Tanner added. “Any revenue slowdown, economic disruption, or continued Medicaid growth could force a special legislative session.”
Tanner made his comments on his first day helping lead JFAC as a co-chair. 
On Jan. 5, Tanner was appointed to take over as co-chair for former Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who resigned from the Idaho Legislature to take a job with the federal government in Washington, D.C.
 Idaho’s top budget official says Gov. Little’s proposal balances state budget without cutting too deeply

Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff, who serves as Little’s budget chief, disagreed with Tanner. 
Wolff stated repeatedly that the budget proposals for the current year and next year balance and are forecast to leave a positive ending balance of $32 million for the current year and $25.5 million for next year. 
“This budget is balanced,” Wolff told Tanner.

Wolff also cautioned Tanner, who is in second legislative term and who was not serving in office the last time the Idaho Legislature had to make deep budget cuts coming out of the Great Recession, against making budget cuts that go too deep. 
“Sometimes cutting too deep makes it so that we cannot grow out of it,” Wolff said. “If we start cutting too deeply with these budgets, we will not have the opportunity for continued growth and meeting some of the needs that we have around the state. So it is very deliberate, very essential.”
On Tuesday afternoon, Little’s office issued a written statement backing up Wolff and expressing confidence in Idaho’s economy. Wolff also announced the corporate income tax filings came in more than $100 million ahead of projections in December, which erased the shortfall in corporate tax filings that Idaho had experienced so far in fiscal year 2026.
“The latest revenue projections clearly validate Gov. Little’s confidence in the strength and forward momentum of Idaho’s economy,” Little’s office said in a written statement Tuesday.

Wolff said Little’s office brought in teams of economists, tax experts and state agency directors to help develop the budget proposal and devise a way to avoid a budget deficit without depleting the state’s major rainy day reserve accounts or repealing Medicaid expansion. 
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, attempted to soften the tone following Tanner’s comments. Wintrow said she hopes the legislative branch and the executive branch of government work together to navigate Idaho’s budget and revenue challenges. 
At the same time, Wintrow made no secret of blaming the budget committee and the Idaho Legislature for creating the projected revenue and budget shortfalls facing the state.
“I would remind the committee that we’re in the position we’re in because this committee didn’t vote on the revenue number until late (in the legislative session), and then we backed our expenses into the revenue that we wanted so we could do some tax cuts, and now we’re going to suffer for it,” Wintrow said. 
“I would hope that we would all work together to recognize why we’re here,” Wintrow added.
 Idaho budget committee outlines 10-week plan to cut funding, balance state budget

In addition to picking apart Little’s budget proposal, JFAC members also unveiled their 10-week schedule for the 2026 legislative session. The schedule calls for budget committee members to complete the annual budget-setting process March 12.
Other key dates on JFAC’s schedule include:

Friday, when the Economic Outlook and Revenue Committee is supposed to present a revenue recommendation to JFAC.
Jan. 23, when JFAC is scheduled to begin cutting budgets through the budget rescission process.
Feb. 6, when JFAC is scheduled to set the bare-bones maintenance of operations budgets that are intended to keep the lights on at state agencies.

Beginning Feb. 13, the budget committee is scheduled to begin taking action on any proposed budget enhancements from state agencies or departments.

State health officials say it’s not too late to get a vaccine to protect against the worst impacts of the illness.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont sees increase in flu as cases around the country surge .","Flu is surging around the country, and Vermont is not immune to the national trend, though the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent dashboard for the disease identifies the state’s illness prevalence as lower than much of the U.S.
In Vermont, about 20-25% of tests have come back positive this season, according to a state dashboard with data through Jan. 3.
Statewide, nearly 8% of visits to a Vermont emergency room or urgent care were due to flu-like illnesses; nearly 6% were related to diagnosed flu cases, according to the state data available through Jan. 3. Both rates were much higher than this same period last year.
The overwhelming majority of these tests have come back positive for one particular strain of influenza A, which is the most common of the four flu virus types. This year, a particularly vicious subvariant of that strain, subclade K, has dominated most flu cases across the country. While Vermont’s testing does not have that extra level of granularity, it’s likely these cases in the state are subclade K, said John Davy, the health surveillance epidemiologist at the Vermont Department of Health. 
Experts are not yet sure whether this strain is so prevalent due to the fact that it spreads more easily or due to it being more dangerous. But it’s clear that the illness has been especially brutal this season: In New York, the state has had the highest number of flu cases ever reported in a single week. In Connecticut, doctors told a local news outlet that the surge is the highest they’ve ever seen.
At UVM Medical Center, the illness prevalence mirrors statewide numbers, confirmed Phillip Rau, a spokesperson for the Burlington hospital. That is starting to trend downward, Rau added, though Vermont’s flu season generally lasts into late March. 
The hospital currently has around 20 people admitted with the flu or related health concerns, he said.
Rutland Regional Medical Center, the state’s second largest hospital after UVM Medical Center, is seeing a much earlier spike in cases than in years past. In December, the hospital had 106 positive flu cases, compared with just 17 in December 2024, according to the hospital’s spokesperson Gerianne Smart. 
As of Jan. 13, the Rutland hospital has confirmed 88 cases of flu this month so far, while last January there were 125 cases the entire month. 
Smart said this early surge may be due to the fact that more severe symptoms lead people to seek out care.
Wastewater testing — done at six sites in Vermont — also shows flu increasing in the state. The most recent reports show “high” levels of flu in wastewater, though earlier in December levels were “very high.” Montpelier and Burlington sites show a higher concentration of the illness than the Ludlow and Middlebury sites.
Davy, at the health department, explained that it’s important to assess all of these available data points together. “Each has its kind of strengths and weaknesses, reflecting a slightly different sort of phenomenon on the ground,” he said.
He said that the reason the CDC’s dashboard may show lower rates in Vermont than in neighboring states may be due to differences in how each state calculates and reports flu occurrence and may be because Vermont’s smaller population makes the data more responsive to smaller shifts in behavior — like a dip in the number of people seeking care over the holidays. 
It doesn’t mean that there’s a shortage of flu in the state. He pointed to the outbreak reports that the health department receives from institutions — places like schools and nursing homes. Those show a growing number of flu cases, which he said can be a useful indicator for the rest of the state. 
Over one-fifth of patients with flu-like illness in Vermont are children under 5 years old, according to the state data from Dec. 28 to Jan. 3 — a “big, disproportionate amount,” compared to the state’s population that age, Davy said.
“These are populations where vaccination can have a really positive impact,” Davy said. 
The variant arose this summer, and thus was not incorporated as a reference strain in this year’s flu vaccine, though early research from England shows this year’s shot does convey some immunity. 
“Subclade K may be more likely to evade a vaccine, but folks’ immune systems are still going to benefit,” Davy added. “It could mean the difference between a real severe illness that you spread to a lot of people and a more minor illness that you’re less likely to spread.” 
In Vermont, only 32% of the population, or around 208,000 people, have received the flu vaccine so far this season, according to a state dashboard.
The surge comes in the midst of changing guidelines from the CDC surrounding childhood immunization, including a demotion of the flu vaccines from something the federal body recommended for all children, to an immunization it recommended only after children or their guardians discuss with a doctor. Last week, Vermont state health officials held firm to their existing guidelines recommending that all children receive the vaccine against flu.
Davy noted that the majority of flu deaths each year are children who did not receive the flu vaccine. 
On top of vaccination, Davy recommended individuals protect themselves and others from flu by practicing familiar safety measures against respiratory illnesses: stay home if you’re sick, wear a mask in crowded areas and wash your hands often.

Deborah Ross (D-NC 2) speaks at a protest in Raleigh outside the state Supreme Court building on January 27, 2025 (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar)Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “should resign or be removed from office,” Rep. Deborah Ross urged on Tuesday, joining a chorus of Democratic colleagues in the wake of high-profile clashes between ICE and protesters.
In a statement Tuesday morning, Ross called Noem a “disaster for North Carolina,” citing the deployment of ICE and Border Patrol agents en masse in Charlotte, Raleigh, and other cities, as well as delays to federal disaster relief for Western North Carolina under Noem’s oversight of FEMA.
After the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, Ross said, Americans are “seeing what North Carolinians already know: DHS desperately needs new leadership.”

“Noem authorized and oversaw the devastating immigration raids in Charlotte and Raleigh. At her direction, masked agents descended on our cities, terrorizing law-abiding citizens and abducting people off the streets based on the color of their skin,” said Ross, a Democrat representing the Second Congressional District.
A spokesperson for Noem did not respond to a request for comment.
Ross’s remarks follow growing Democratic rancor aimed at Noem, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) telling reporters Monday that the secretary is “completely and totally unqualified” and “should be run out of town as soon as possible.” He did not rule out pursuing her impeachment should Democrats retake control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections.
Ross would support Noem’s impeachment, a spokeswoman said.
She joins her Democratic colleague Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.-04), who called for Noem’s resignation or removal in a statement on social media on Jan. 9. Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.-12) urged an independent investigation into Good’s death but did not reference Noem, while Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.-01) issued no statement on the shooting.
Democrats sense an opportunity to channel anger over President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown into voter backlash against the president’s party in the coming congressional elections. A YouGov poll taken in the wake of the Minneapolis shooting found that a majority of respondents disapprove of ICE, including 56% of independents.

Good’s shooting sparked protests across the U.S., including in North Carolina, where demonstrators in Charlotte. Durham, and Wilmington among others mobilized to condemn ICE in the days after the shooting.
DHS leadership has laid the blame for violent clashes on Democratic rhetoric, releasing statistics on Jan. 8 — a day after Good’s death — showing 275 assaults on ICE officers and 66 vehicular attacks against them since Trump took office in January 2025.
“This unprecedented increase in violence against law enforcement is a direct result of sanctuary politicians and the media creating an environment that demonizes our law enforcement and encourages rampant assaults against them,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.
 Finding fault in funding Helene recovery 
Ross also laid blame on Noem for a lack of aid to western North Carolina.
“Noem is personally responsible for slowing the flow of federal aid dollars to support Helene reconstruction in Western NC,” Ross said. “Because of her, families and communities that lost everything have been forced to wait months for the help they need to get back on their feet.”
Under Noem, FEMA has delayed disaster assistance to communities in North Carolina for months, vexing local leaders who have struggled to get through layers of bureaucracy. All payments exceeding $100,000, for example, require Noem’s personal sign-off.
In December, Gov. Josh Stein pleaded with FEMA for swifter aid. “Further delay of these approvals keeps communities and families in limbo, in some cases paying expenses on homes they cannot live in while they await word from FEMA,” he wrote.
Taken together, these failures are disqualifying, Ross said.
“We can’t trust her when disaster strikes. We can’t trust her to obey the law. We can’t trust her to protect our rights or our homeland,” Ross said. “Enough is enough. Kristi Noem needs to go.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1270101-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 18:12:33.685431

It began operations in August 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)The National Labor Relations Board is recommending certification of a pro-union vote among workers at the BlueOval SK battery manufacturing plant in Hardin County.
The union election was held before an announcement that the plant would close and be converted to manufacturing batteries for use on the electric grid under the sole ownership of Ford Motor Co.
WKU Public Radio in Bowling Green obtained the Jan. 9 report by the National Labor Relations Board. Approximately 1,000 workers at the BlueOval SK electric vehicle battery plant had been seeking to unionize with the United Auto Workers. 
Tensions flared between those campaigning for the union and BlueOval SK for months, resulting in a tight election in August when votes for unionization came out slightly ahead. The board was weighing the status of a few dozen ballots that had been challenged and that could decide the result of the election. 
The radio station reported the board in its order decided not to open and count the challenged ballots because 31 ballots were cast by Safety Emergency Response Technicians at the plant that did not “share an overwhelming community of interest” with other workers that were petitioning for a union. 
Mallory Cooke, a spokesperson for BlueOval SK, told the Lantern in a statement the board’s report was a “wrong and arbitrary decision that prevents all eligible team members’ voices from being heard.” Cooke said the company would appeal. BlueOval SK, which is a joint venture between South Korea-based SK On and the Ford Motor Co., has until Jan. 26 to make the appeal.
The decision to side with the union comes ahead of BlueOval SK laying off its workforce with plans for Ford Motor Co. to take sole ownership and convert the facility to manufacture batteries for energy storage. Utility-scale batteries are used to store electricity for use by electric-intensive operations such as data centers and other heavy industries.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blueoval_08-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

Higgins is the former CEO of the Golden Triangle LINK, the economic development agency for Clay, Lowndes, and Oktibbeha counties. Higgins had been featured in national news, including a big “60 Minutes” report and in The Atlantic for bringing in almost $10 billion in investments to the area over his over 20 year tenure. 
According to the announcement from the Tate County Board of Supervisors and the Tate County Economic Development Foundation, they hired Higgins through a contract with his consulting firm, 2EQLAST. They did not mention Higgins’ departure from the Golden Triangle organization in the announcement.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Voter identification and congressional redistricting stand chief among concerns voiced by advocacy organizations in the state as the 2026 legislative session gets underway. 
Members of 11 organizations gathered to respond to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ State of the State address, delivered Tuesday. 
Genesis Robinson, director of Equal Ground, a Black-led, nonpartisan group working to build Black political power in the state, called the organizations “united as democracy-defense organizations.” 

The groups included Equal Ground, the NAACP, Southern Poverty Law Center, Common Cause Florida, the American Civil Liberties Union, Justice Over Everything, League of Women Voters, Florida Watch, and Black Voters Matter. 

“What we heard was a lame duck governor who is singularly focused on control,” Robinson said. 
The expanse of his control has been a “power grab,” Robinson said, to establish redrawn congressional maps, “aggressive voter suppression, attacks on local governance, and attempts to erase long-standing protections that exist for our democracy.”
In his last State-of-the-State address, DeSantis vows: ‘We will get the job done.’

In DeSantis’ address, his last, he recited statistics from his time in office, bragging about illegal immigration enforcement, and made several references to the Founding Fathers.
Johnathan Webber. with the Southern Poverty Law Center, took issue with the governor’s pride the state’s number of state employees per capita — the lowest, or among the lowest, in the nation.
“It tells me that this is a government not meeting the needs of its residents by design, and I’m afraid that it’s only going to get worse when you couple this with the failure of leadership from Congress in Washington, D.C.,” Webber said, pointing to the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Pamela Burch-Fort of the Florida State Conference of NAACP said the people represented by her organization were “totally excluded” from the governor’s address.
Similarly, Jamil Davis Black of Black Voters Matter called DeSantis’ address “absurd and completely out of touch” with at least 4 million residents in Florida, referencing the Black population. 
Davis Black, as well as several other speakers, addresssed congressional redistricting, a focus of the governor and the Legislature, with DeSantis calling a special session to address mid-decade redistricting after the regular session ends.
Republicans in several state are pushing mid-decade redistricting to boost GOP representation in Congress.
Jessica Lowe-Minor with the League of Women Voters of Florida said the need to redistrict has been “fabricated” by DeSantis and that she finds it interesting that he did not mention it during his speech. 
“Florida residents expect their elected leaders to focus on the kitchen-table issues affecting voters’ daily lives, not diverting millions in taxpayer dollars to a rushed and unconstitutional redistricting process,” Lowe-Minor said. 
Voting rights
The groups took particular issue with HB 991 and SB 1334, companion bills that would require voters to provide proof of citizenship to vote. That measure was introduced by Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka of Fort Myers and Sen. Erin Grall of Vero Beach, both Republicans.
Robinson called the bill “an arbitrary creation of rules to fix a problem that does not exist. This is not election integrity, this is administrative disenfranchisement.”
The advocates urged passage of HB 1419, focused on voter registration, including but not limited to expansion of the available languages on vote-by-mail ballots. The bill is called the Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore Florida Voting Rights Act, named for the married civil rights activists killed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1951.
Lowe-Minor said she agreed with the part in DeSantis’ speech in which he insisted that deeds are more powerful than words. “I actually found myself agreeing with that statement. … However, here in Florida we are experiencing a very stark difference between the words that are being said by our elected officials and the results that we are experiencing in our lived reality and on the ground.”
In pointing out her grievances with voting rights under DeSantis, Lowe-Minor cited in particular the petition gathering law passed last year.  Her organization is in a lawsuit with the state regarding HB 1205, which limited petition gathering efforts for constitutional ballot initiatives.
“Here we are in what should be ‘the Free State of Florida,’ finding ourselves not being able to exercise constitutional rights that were guaranteed as part of our founding documents in the U.S. Constitution,” Lowe Minor said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8140-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

There’s new leadership in charge of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont, though President Donald Trump has not yet appointed anyone to run the place on a permanent basis and the title of the person in charge keeps changing.
At the moment, the U.S. Department of Justice Department website lists Jonathan Ophardt, a longtime prosecutor, as the office’s “leadership” and this time the person in the top role has the title “Criminal Chief.”
It’s unclear why Trump, since taking office, has not appointed anyone to be U.S. Attorney for Vermont, a position that requires the confirmation by the U.S. Senate.   
Until last week, it was Michael Drescher in the top prosecutor role for Vermont, under the title “First Assistant Attorney.” All that changed when Gov. Phil Scott appointed him last week to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
On Tuesday, Drescher told state Senate lawmakers considering his confirmation that he resigned from his federal prosecutor post Friday. 
“I did that because, in order to be able to speak freely at this hearing, I think I needed to be unencumbered by being employed by the Department of Justice,” Drescher told committee members of his decision to step down from overseeing the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont.
Even before Drescher stepped down, the U.S. Department of Justice website listed the position of U.S. Attorney for Vermont — the top federal prosecutor in the state — as vacant for the past several weeks, even though the website also listed him in the top spot under the First Assistant Attorney title. 
Elisabeth St. Onge, a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, stated in an email Tuesday that “Senator Welch is aware of the vacancy in Vermont and is working to address it.”
Neither the office nor the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington has made any public announcement about the leadership change in Vermont. The office is responsible for prosecuting federal crimes and immigration law in the state as well as representing the United States in civil matters. 
Ophardt, who held the role as acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont for nearly a year in 2021, could not be reached this week for comment. Fabienne Boisvert-DeFazio, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont, declined to comment this week.
“The U.S. Attorney’s Office has no comment and we will refer you to the Office of Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of Justice,” Boisvert-DeFazio wrote in an email to VTDigger this week in response to questions about the office’s leadership.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment. 
The position of U.S. Attorney for Vermont is a presidential appointment. 
Drescher had held the role of acting U.S. Attorney for Vermont since Trump took office last January. Then in November, after Drescher served the maximum amount of time allowed by law in that acting role, his title changed to First Assistant U.S. Attorney, though he was still in charge of overseeing the office in Vermont.
That was until his resignation Friday.
Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who tracks U.S. attorney and judicial nominations, told VTDigger last month that he wasn’t sure why Trump doesn’t simply nominate a U.S. attorney for Vermont and go through the U.S. Senate confirmation process. 
It could be, Tobias said, that the president wants to bypass the U.S. Senate confirmation process or that he hasn’t found someone he wants to formally name to the post permanently.
Vermont isn’t the only federal district in the country without a Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney running the office. In addition to Vermont, six other federal district offices are listed on the U.S. Department of Justice website as vacant. There are many more federal districts run by either interim or acting U.S. attorneys.
The situation has led to confusion and several court cases across the nation regarding who is legally enforcing federal law.

Pictured, Judges Kelly Broniec, left, and Robin Ransom listen to oral arguments Feb. 1, 2024, in a case over state Senate redistricting (Pool photo by David Lieb/Associated Press).The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously upheld a law barring minors from receiving cross-sex hormones, puberty blockers and gender transition surgeries and prohibiting Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care for all ages.
The decision, written by Judge Kelly Broniec, affirms a 2024 Cole County Circuit Court ruling from that sided with the state on all counts. Both courts rejected arguments that the law should be subject to heightened scrutiny, a standard of review reserved for statutes that classify based on sex or are discriminatory in nature.
“There is no fundamental right to seek care the legislature has prohibited,” Broniec wrote.“Because (the law) does not infringe on a fundamental right, rational-basis review is appropriate.”
Under rational-basis review, a statute is presumed sensible unless challengers can show the law is arbitrary and irrational.
In their arguments, challengers represented by the ACLU of Missouri and LGBTQ+ rights law firm Lambda Legal alleged that the law discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status. The court’s rejection of this argument was key to upholding the ban.
The law “classifies only based on medical use and age,” Broniec wrote, aligning with a U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld Tennessee’s gender-affirming-care ban in June and a decision from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld Arkansas’ gender-affirming care restrictions in August.
Ruling upholding Missouri transgender care ban had ‘factual errors,’ attorneys argue

Challengers attempted to differentiate Missouri’s ban from the case precedents, arguing that Missouri’s Constitution offered more protections than the U.S. Constitution. These arguments were “not persuasive,” Broniec wrote in a footnote.
The U.S. Supreme Court precedent allows lawmakers broad discretion in areas “fraught with medical and scientific uncertainty.” The trial in Cole County spanned two weeks, delving into whether medical experts agreed on the treatment of gender dysphoria, a condition marked by distress felt when one’s gender identity differs from sex as assigned at birth.
Challengers insisted that gender-affirming care is “evidence-based” and “medically necessary,” with physicians and patients testifying about their positive experiences and defending a widely adopted standard of care from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.
But the state criticized this standard of care with witnesses who painted the association as an activist group. Some of the state’s expert witnesses admitted to be outliers, calling themselves victims of “cancel culture.”
The testimony was deceptive, Lambda Legal attorney Nora Huppert said in oral arguments in September, and the trial court’s decision included “legal and factual errors.”
Tuesday’s decision didn’t delve into the alleged errors, saying that argument was “moot.”
“The state has demonstrated the ongoing debate among medical and ethical experts regarding the risks and benefits associated with the treatments at issue,” the decision says.
Claims that the Medicaid ban violated the state’s constitution were also thrown out. Adults can still access gender-affirming care if they pay out-of-pocket, the ruling notes, but the state cannot be obligated to cover the care through its Medicaid program.
“The state has a legitimate interest in ensuring limited public funds are used efficiently,” Broniec wrote.
Attorneys with the ACLU of Missouri and Lambda Legal have not said outright whether they will appeal the decision. Though Huppert said in a statement to press that attorneys “will continue to explore every legal avenue to protect the rights and health of transgender people in Missouri.”
“Today’s decision allows the state to continue to enforce a harmful ban that singles out transgender Missourians and denies them compassion and equal access to medically necessary health care,” said Gillian Wilcox, director of litigation at the ACLU of Missouri. “The decision not only allows the state to target transgender Missourians access to health care but also leaves everyone’s health care options at the whims of politicians, should certain care ever fall into the political arena.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Redistricting-Supreme-Court-Lieb-02012024-scaled-e1707947517981-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

On Tuesday, Lassiter was back before a committee of the N.C. Child Fatality Task Force to discuss the impact of the Secure All Firearms Effectively (S.A.F.E.) campaign, which provides gun locks and targeted messaging to remind gun owners how to safely store their firearms.
The two-year-old campaign has been funded using lapsed salaries and leftover federal funds. In the upcoming short legislative session Lassiter is hopeful that lawmakers will earmark $2.26 million in recurring funds to keep the messaging front and center. Support from task force members could help secure that funding.
“We had almost 11,000 guns in the state of North Carolina stolen from gun owners last year and that’s been a trend for the last 10 years in our state,” Lassiter said.
Put another way, nearly 100,000 guns have been stolen in the past decade, often ending up in the hands of children or criminals.
Lassiter said some gun owners mistakenly think they are safer if they don’t lock up their firearms for quick access.
“The reality is that if you’re not locking up your gun in your home, then it makes it an easy target for someone that breaks in,” he cautioned. “It’s one of those easy items to sell on the street.”

Since May 2023 the NC S.A.F.E. campaign has handed out 150,000 gun locks at PTA meetings, community gatherings, gun stores, and the N.C. State Fair.
“We’re really proud of those numbers, and I can tell you when we host events in local communities there’s definitely a desire from the public to have these gun locks,” Lassiter said.
The Department of Public Safety recently partnered with RTI International to evaluate NC S.A.F.E.’s effectiveness.
Lassiter said the RTI study found the non-partisan campaign resulted in a 22% change in gun owners acknowledging guns are increasingly being stolen from vehicles and homes, and that they have a responsibility to make sure their own firearm is locked up.
The campaign has also led to two-thirds of gun owners surveyed understanding that half of North Carolina’s gun deaths are suicides. Lassiter said that shift in understanding is critically important.
“A lot of gun owners thought that most of the gun deaths were homicides,” Lassiter explained. “This is also a suicide problem, and it may be someone in your own household that may use that gun to harm themselves.”
Lassiter said the NC S.A.F.E. campaign is helping combat the misperception that it’s only important to lock up firearms when children are around.
In 2019, 53% of North Carolina’s gun owners surveyed acknowledged keeping their firearms loaded and unlocked. In 2024, that number had fallen 8% to just under 44%.
“I really feel like the message is getting through about the importance of safe storage,” Lassiter said. “But we still got a lot of work to do.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gun-inside-safe-scaled_StockPhoto_Getty-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

The board’s staff recommended it ask state legislators to write an exception into the statute for documents the board oversees. Lawmakers would have to approve a change to the law, and their legislative session begins March 9. 
As the law stands, judges can demand a large swath of personal information for themselves and their immediate families be taken down from any government or privately operated websites. Those who don’t comply with requests face the possibility of criminal charges and lawsuits. 
Starting next month, this privilege will extend to statewide elected officials, legislators, public service commissioners as well as current and retired district attorneys, assistant prosecutors and their investigators. 
For the ethics board, this means hundreds of people will be able to ask for the removal of their home address and their spouse’s workplace that are regularly included on public officials’ personal financial disclosure documents and government travel disclosure forms posted online. 
They will also be able to ask for address removals from the public campaign finance and lobbyist databases that track political donations, campaign vendors spending and lobbyist activity. 
For example, private citizens would continue to have an address attached to the political donations they have made since the 1990s in the state’s online campaign finance database. But a wide swath of public officials, their spouses and children could ask to have that information removed.

Elected officials have said these redactions are necessary because they can face threats of violence and harassment while serving in public office. Having their home address and spouse’s workplace location publicly available puts them at risk, they said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

But those redactions will make it harder to determine who is spending and receiving money in Louisiana politics.

For example, an address listing for a campaign contributor named Mike Johnson can help verify whether a campaign donation is from the U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Benton, Louisiana House Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Johnson of Pineville or a private citizen with the same name. The removal of the address would make it harder to know who is making the contribution. 
“The point of the financial disclosures and the campaign finance reports are disclosure,” Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said in an interview last week. 
From a practical perspective, Bordelon said the ethics board also doesn’t have enough manpower to deal with the number of removals it may be asked to make. Redactions for just one individual who is very politically active can require the ethics board staff to make dozens of changes to reports going back several years. 

In May, three juvenile court judges requested their information be removed from the ethics board website, which led to the alteration of 66 separate reports. 
Jefferson Parish Judge Barron Burmaster, for example, asked for his home address and his wife’s business address to be removed from online financial records he filed as a member of the Lafitte Area Independent Levee District from 2008-13, before he became a judge. 
Active judges are also prohibited from making political campaign contributions. It is less likely their addresses need to be removed from campaign finance reports other than their own. 

But elected officials who will be entitled to this privilege in February include the state’s most prolific political donors. Statewide officials, legislators and their families regularly make contributions to each other. 
Bordelon said he is also concerned the new statute conflicts with another law that prohibits the board from altering the content of a public record. 

In June, the board requested a legal opinion from Attorney General Liz Murrill advising its members how to handle redactions without running afoul of other laws. It hasn’t received a response. Murrill’s office confirmed last week that it hadn’t released the opinion yet. 
Ethics board chairman Jason Amato, an appointee of Gov. Jeff Landry, said Friday he shares the board staff’s concerns about being overwhelmed with redaction requests. Amato and board members won’t finalize their legislative agenda until next month, but he is inclined to ask lawmakers for the exemption, he said.  
The Louisiana Secretary of State was already granted a similar exception when a new version of the privacy law passed last year. The office handles public documents for qualifying candidates that include their home addresses as well as business records that can include personal information. 

Secretary of State Nancy Landry, R-Lafayette, who personally argued for the agency to be left out of the law, said her agency wouldn’t have enough staff to meet the redaction requests it would have received.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

Charlie Couch, a fifth-grader at Meadows Elementary School in Ralston, officially became Nebraska’s first-ever kid governor on Tuesday — after garnering the most votes in a November election of her peers.
The top six finalists in the race became Charlie’s cabinet and will help promote the platform she ran on, cancer awareness. They’ll also collectively come up with ideas and an agenda to push, offering a youthful perspective.
“We are showing everyone what leadership looks like in our state and in our communities,” Charlie said in her first official address following her swearing-in event attended by several state senators. 
In an interview afterward, she told the Nebraska Examiner she was nervous yet excited when she stepped onto a stool to speak into the microphone. 
“It’s awesome,” she said.
‘Stand tall’
That Charlie assumed her one-year post shortly after the Legislature witnessed the resignation of an embattled state lawmaker was a coincidence. Her victory was announced in November, and the swearing-in was scheduled. State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst resigned Tuesday morning instead of risking becoming the first sitting senator expelled from the state’s officially nonpartisan lawmaking body. 
Nearly 100 people attended the kid governor ceremony, including parents and school officials. A small band played. 
Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston — who at 83 is the oldest sitting state lawmaker — presided over the swearing in of the young governor who just advanced to the double-digit age of 10. (The last time Nebraska had a female governor of any age was Kay Orr, who served from 1987 to 1991 and was the state’s only female governor.)
“Today’s your day to stand tall,” Riepe told Charlie, following comments by State Sens. Margo Juarez and John Fredrickson, both of Omaha. The legislators all also recognized the young governor’s cabinet members, who all attended the ceremony.

“It’s important to remember that democracy does not just happen,” said Fredrickson. “It requires work. It requires active participation. To see this next generation here and so invested … gets me inspired.”
LeeAnn Pancharoen of Civic Nebraska, which led the state’s first kid governor initiative, called the moment a milestone and said Nebraska now joins states of Connecticut, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Vermont in a growing national program inspired by the Connecticut Democracy Center. 
“In a moment when many adults feel cynical or weary about democracy, these students reminded us of what that can look like at its best — hopeful, earnest, active and future-oriented,” Pancharoen said.
Personal campaign platform
Charlie, a student in teacher Benjamin Billesbach’s social studies class, won the statewide election after hundreds of fifth-graders from 22 schools viewed campaign videos, listened to candidate ideas and cast ballots from Nov. 3 -12.
Calling out cancer as an issue important to young people, Charlie, daughter of Jennifer and Charles Couch, outlined steps students could take in their own schools and communities.
She told the audience that cancer awareness was important to her because her two older sisters’ dad died of cancer when they were little. Charlie was not yet born but said she hears her mom and sisters talk about the experience.

Resources that helped them at the time — and that Charlie gave shoutouts to during her speech — were Hope Lodge of Omaha and Camp Kesem, a free overnight summer camp run by volunteers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for youths whose parents have grappled with cancer.
“Since a lot of kids whose parents have been affected by cancer have to grow up too fast to help their family,” she said. “Camp Kesem is a place for kids to just be kids.”
Charlie wants to help raise funds and to spread the word about those and other support services. 
“This victory is not just mine,” she told fellow students at a November school assembly that was broadcast online for a larger audience. “It belongs to every fifth grader in Nebraska who wants to make a real difference in our state.”


 Kid governor cabinet

The kid governor and her cabinet will work also with the nonprofit Civic Nebraska and community partners to activate their platforms and give a student voice to statewide initiatives. 
Charlie’s cabinet and their platforms: Alma White of Laurel Elementary in Laurel, providing bare necessities for students; Eila White of Trinity Lutheran School in Norfolk, creating kindness at schools; Kenzlie Reed of Neihardt Elementary in Millard, creating recycling campaigns; Reid Maulsby of Ravenna Elementary in Ravenna, student health programs; Will Milliken of Paddock Road Elementary in Omaha, making play spaces cleaner and safer, and Victoria Vargas of St. Gerald Catholic School in Ralston, the dangers of feeding wildlife.

“This first group of Nebraska Kid Governor finalists blew all of us away with their thoughtfulness, their empathy, and their determination to improve the world around them,” said Juan Milan, Civic Nebraska’s Youth Civic Leadership Programs Manager. 
Created by the Connecticut Democracy Center, the kid governor program is a national civics initiative. This year marks Nebraska’s debut in the program, but Pancharoen said her team began laying the groundwork three years ago and found “unbridled enthusiasm” among students in fifth-grade social studies classrooms.
She said the idea is to treat civics not as abstract but as something “lived and shared, even at age 10 and 11.”
The program introduced the students to civic life through a hands-on experience that mirrors real democratic participation: learning about state government, identifying community issues, developing three-point platforms, recording campaign videos, engaging in classroom primaries, and voting in a statewide election for Kid Governor, said Civic Nebraska.
Charlie said she was eager to figure out what she and her cabinet would focus on “and have some fun along the way.” She thinks she’ll host a dinner to discuss next steps with her team.
“Just think of all that we can accomplish together,” she said, wrapping up her talk. “Let’s get to work, Nebraska.”

(Courtesy NIFC)Citing high temperatures and ongoing drought, national forecasters are warning that above normal fire risk will reach parts of New Mexico this winter.
According to a National Interagency Fire Center forecast, all of eastern New Mexico along the state’s border with Texas and Oklahoma transitions from little to no risk of fire to low risk, which marks the first increase of the year. In February, the same region will experience above normal wildfire potential, according to a long-term forecast from NIFC released earlier this month.
Eastern New Mexico will also experience above-normal wildfire potential in March, according to the forecast, before subsiding in April. 
The forecasters cite ongoing drought, which they said is expected to persist and expand across the Southwest, as well as above normal temperatures. The state, along with much of the West, is experiencing “snow drought,” marked by snow cover at levels far below average. 
‘Snow drought’ observed across the West, amid higher-than-average winter temps

Even after winter storms hit much of the state last week, on Jan. 10, snow covered only about 7,700 square miles of land, which is far less than the median this time of year of approximately 12,400 square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
This is the second consecutive year forecasters have issued January forecasts deeming eastern New Mexico at high fire risk through the winter. Prior forecasts in 2023 and 2024 did not predict high fire risk in the winter months. 
Still, February wildfires are uncommon, according to Source New Mexico’s review of Southwest Coordination Center wildfire data over the last decade. Since 2016, New Mexico has had 369 wildfires, but only seven of those ignited during the month of February.
The wildfire risk is increasing as the federal government, which intervenes to fight large and complex wildfires, begins a potentially dramatic shakeup of its wildland firefighting operations. On Monday, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order establishing a new, unified Wildland Fire Service that seeks to consolidate firefighting efforts under one agency. He also named Brian Fennessy, a longtime California firefighter, as the official in charge of leading the agency.
At the moment, federal firefighters are employed across multiple bureaus and offices, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service and others. Burgum said the new agency will help better organize and modernize the federal government’s wildfire response. 
However, the Wilderness Society, an environmental group, said the consolidation effort actually just creates a larger bureaucracy and disrupts “the people who manage land and fight fire every day.”
Instead of a new agency, according to a statement Monday from the organization, Congress should fully fund the agencies currently tasked with fire prevention and suppression. 
“Fully fund our land managers and wildland firefighters and support proven prevention work like fuels reduction, restoration and science-based planning so our children inherit healthier, safer landscapes,” spokesperson Max Greenberg said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-13-at-3.46.55-PM-1024x625.png,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Local officials such as sheriffs and county clerks could renew driver’s licenses in counties without regional offices under legislation that was filed Tuesday and is a priority in the Kentucky Senate.
The bill comes in response to reports of delays in getting appointments at regional offices, extended wait times and long drives to offices for rural Kentuckians. 
Kentucky has 34 regional offices that issue and renew driver’s licenses. Drivers would still have to go to a regional office for a new license under this legislation. 
Senate Bill 7, sponsored by Shelbyville Republican Sen. Aaron Reed, would allow counties without a regional office to choose one local official to offer license renewal services. Counties with regional offices are “taken care of for now” and would keep all services at those offices, Reed said. 
Reed said the legislation would restore “local control” to “local elected officials.” SB7 has 28 cosponsors and has been labeled a priority bill by the Senate Republican caucus. Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers.
“It’s the answer to the outcry of Kentuckians from across the state … people who are sick and tired of long drives, long lines and a broken system,” Reed said. 
In 2020 a law shifted driver’s licensing from circuit clerks to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, which led to the regional office system. The move helped Kentucky comply with federal requirements to offer Real ID driver’s licenses. The Beshear administration said it would provide “greater security of personal identification.”
Years later, “you have two basic problems,” said cosponsor and the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon. “In the urban areas, it’s hard to get an appointment. In the rural areas, you have to travel, sometimes, a great distance. Those are the issues that Sen. Reed’s bill addresses and takes care of.” 
He is not making a budget request on the bill, Reed said, because it is not a mandatory move for counties. Higdon said there will be a budget request for equipment. 
“There’s a $25 convenience fee that goes along with getting your driver’s license done in the county,” Reed said. “So if you don’t want to pay that fee, you can still go to the regional offices, which will still be open.” The fees collected will stay in the office conducting the renewals, he said, to offset any expenses.

Beshear said Slinker’s past experience with the Kentucky State Police, emergency management, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and more gives him “the background to root out any wrongdoing.” 
“There’s been significant progress made in driver licensing and developing new processes and being innovative,” Slinker said during Beshear’s weekly press conference. “But we can always be better. Every day we can be better than yesterday and that’s what we’re going to strive to do.” 
Reed said he hadn’t seen the news of Slinker’s appointment, but “the results of what’s gone on in the past kind of speaks for itself. The people of Kentucky have demanded for us to fix this issue.” 
He said he had not spoken with the Beshear administration “directly” but “I can assure you that they all agree that there is an issue and this bill will be a great opportunity for them to fix it.” 
Naitore Djigbenou, a public affairs official in the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, said in an email that the cabinet had lowered wait times at regional licensing centers to an average of 11 minutes in December, down from 49 minutes in April. 
“We remain committed to enhancing services and ensuring consistency and compliance across the 35 regional offices we operate,” Djigbenou’s email stated.

Meanwhile in the House, Rep. Savannah Maddox, R-Dry Ridge filed House Bill 162, which would again give local circuit clerks the duties to issue driver’s licenses. Her bill had more than a dozen Republican co-sponsors as of Tuesday. 
After introducing the legislation last week, Maddox wrote on social media that the “current regional office model has proven to be a significant failure, creating unnecessary burdens for our citizens and undermining the efficiency of a once-effective system.” 
“For nearly a century, our circuit clerks successfully managed the issuance and renewal of driver’s licenses, providing a local, accessible, and reliable service to Kentuckians,” Maddox said. “However, the shift to a regional model has led to long wait times, travel hardships, and a lack of accountability. Citizens from across the commonwealth — rural, urban, and suburban alike — are demanding change, and it’s our duty to listen.” 
Reed said he had not read her bill. His legislation is scheduled for a hearing in Wednesday morning’s transportation committee.

James Comer during the Fancy Farm Picnic on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer of Kentucky announced Tuesday that the House Oversight Committee will start contempt of Congress proceedings against former Democratic President Bill Clinton next week. 
Clinton and his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had been subpoenaed by the committee, did not show up to testify Tuesday as part of the committee’s investigation into convicted sex offender and financer Jeffery Epstein. 
The Clintons issued a public letter to Comer accusing him of playing “partisan politics” and saying his handling of the Epstein case was impeding the investigation.
Comer, chair of the Oversight Committee, said Tuesday Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the committee had supported subpoenaing the Clintons. 
“Bill Clinton did not show up, and I think it’s important to note that this subpoena was voted on in a bipartisan manner by this Committee,” Comer said. “This wasn’t something that I just issued as chairman of the Committee. This was voted on by an entire subcommittee in a unanimous vote to subpoena former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.”
In their letter, the Clintons wrote that Comer has “immense power to target anyone and subject them to closed door interrogation and more.” 
“The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government’s role,” the Clintons said.
They continued: “The facts speak for themselves: You subpoenaed eight people in addition to us. You dismissed seven of those eight without any of them saying a single word to you. You made no attempt to force them to appear. In fact, since you started your investigation last year, you have interviewed a total of two people. Two.”
Another Kentucky Republican, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, has pushed for making more information about Epstein public. Massie led a successful discharge petition that directed the U.S. Department of Justice to release its investigation files related to Epstein, but not all of the files had been released by the legislation’s initial deadline.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_038-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

The four employees — David Murray, Elvine Vanbolden, Mychael Foster and Nirva Civilus — all alleged in their complaint that “a pattern and practice of unlawful racially discriminatory employment practices against its African American employees” exists, including that retaliation against Black employees who complain of discrimination is “widespread and well-known.”
Benson’s office denied the allegations in the lawsuit, calling them “absolutely false.”  
“Every member of the Michigan Department of State – from the top down – must follow the law, uphold the department’s ethical standards, and come to work every day committed to serve the people of Michigan,” wrote Department of State spokesperson Angela Benander in a statement. “The Secretary and department leadership do not tolerate any harassment, discrimination, or retaliation against any employee, customer, or Michigan resident based on their race, gender, or age.”
The allegations from all four employees all generally deal with policies and procedures for the department being unequally applied to Black employees and not enforced for white employees.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The complaint, which alleges violations of the state’s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, reads, “MDOS’s White managers and supervisors have adopted and regularly engage in a pattern and practice of applying said written and unwritten policies, rules and guidelines, as stated above, subjectively and in an unlawful, racially discriminatory manner towards MDOS’s African American employees and in a more favorable way toward its White employees.”
The complaint was filed on Monday in Wayne County Circuit Court, the same day that Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, the first Black person to hold that position, announced that he was dropping out of the gubernatorial race against Benson to run for Secretary of State instead. The Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus also endorsed Benson’s gubernatorial run on Tuesday, the day after the suit was filed. 
Some of the concerns in the complaint center around policies regarding use of state vehicles — the plaintiffs argue that policies around vehicle usage for the department are not evident to employees and are unevenly enforced for Black employees. 
The department provided the Michigan Advance with department data showing that Civilus, then the department’s director of quality and customer experience, traveled over 7,300 miles in state vehicles between December 2024 and September 2025 — nearly 2,000 miles more than the person with the next-highest mileage, leading to an internal investigation into her state vehicle usage.
“MDOS has no written policies, rules and or guidelines, and or those that are written are not clearly articulated as it pertains to hiring, promotions, use of state vehicles and other state properties, dispensing of discipline to employees and use of performance improvement plans,” the complaint reads.
The department also provided the Advance with copies of state driver agreements signed by Civilus, as well as other plaintiffs Murray and Foster, along with the department’s travel policy, which notes that “Any personal use of a State-owned vehicle must be pre-approved in writing by the employee’s supervisor” and “All travel must be authorized and approved by the Secretary of State or designated representative.”
Civilus argued in the complaint that the vehicle use conduct for which she was placed on a performance improvement plan was not unique to her, writing that the Department of State, “although aware that Plaintiff Civilus’ similarly situated white coworkers engaged in the conduct Plaintiff was alleged to have engaged in, have not applied the rules and policies used to justify placing Plaintiff on a PIP discipline and or hold accountable Plaintiffs white and similarly situated co-workers.”
The other three plaintiffs in the case, who all are still employed by the department, alleged that they had faced racial discrimination in other parts of their job.
Murray, who is an executive office analyst for the department, alleged in the complaint that when he was hired into that position, he was not given a pay increase that had initially been a part of the position — and that his white coworkers did receive the pay increase. He further alleged that he was passed over for a Youth Engagement Specialist position, which eventually was given to a less-qualified white applicant, because of his race. 
Murray also alleged in the complaint that, after complaining about these discriminatory practices, his supervisors at the department began to strip him of job responsibilities and unfairly accused him of violating the state motor vehicle policy, punishing him in ways that his white counterparts were not. 
Foster, a training specialist for the department, alleged in the complaint that he was held by his superiors “to higher performance, organizational and policy standards than his white, similarly situated coworkers,” which he made numerous complaints to the department’s human resources team about. He was placed on a performance improvement plan, which he alleges in the complaint he was on for a longer time period than the department’s policy allows. 
VanBolden, a state administrative manager and division deputy director for the department, alleged in the complaint that she was discriminated against while hiring for Department of State positions, specifically in one instance in which she hired a Black candidate over a white candidate, for which she was given a low rating on a performance evaluation. 
“Plaintiff VanBolden’s similarly situated white coworkers, (having supported the hire of white individuals), although having engaged in the same and or similar conduct Plaintiff was alleged to have engaged in, did not have said conduct referenced as derogatory on their performance reviews,” the complaint reads. 
Two signed affidavits were filed along with the lawsuit from former Department of State employees. The first came from former Assistant Secretary of State Heaster Wheeler, who said that “African American MDOS employees are still subjected to the above-described unlawful discriminatory employment practices that has become a custom policy and practice at MDOS, and has been agreed to, tolerated, approved and adopted by the Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson,” and that this played a role in his decision to leave the department in 2024. 
The second came from Angela Harness, the department’s former director of quality and customer experience for the Department of State who reached a separation agreement with the department in August after she filed a notice of intent to sue the department. Harness similarly wrote in her affidavit that “MDOS had knowingly failed to take action to address what has become a racially hostile environment for its African American employees.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas lawmaker raised concerns Tuesday about how to fund the state’s school voucher program in the future after advancing a request for more money that would raise its cost this year to nearly $310 million. 
A Legislative Council subcommittee, on a closely divided voice vote, endorsed the request for an additional $32 million for the Educational Freedom Account program. The full council is expected to take up the funding request on Friday.
The Educational Freedom Account program, created through a 2023 education overhaul known as the LEARNS Act, provides state funding for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. The voucher program was phased in over three years with increasing eligibility until it was open to all students for the first time last fall.
Republican Rep. Frances Cavenaugh of Walnut Ridge said she supports the program but told the Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review subcommittee Tuesday she’s worried about the Legislature continuing to approve funding beyond what had already been budgeted. 
After approving a budget that included more than $187 million for the EFA program in April, lawmakers approved an additional $90 million in June. The additional money approved Tuesday is needed to fully fund this year’s program, according to a letter from the Arkansas Department of Education.
More than 44,000 students have been approved for the program this year, each of whom can receive up to $6,864, according to the state’s education department. 
Cavenaugh asked what programs are going to be cut from the state budget to make room for the vouchers, which has become an annual expense, or if lawmakers should plan to keep funding the initiative annually until the state runs out of money. 
Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, speaks during a meeting of the Joint Budget Committee’s personnel subcommittee, of which she is the House vice chair, on Tuesday, March 11, 2025. (Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)
Republican Sen. Jonathan Dismang of Searcy, who co-chairs the subcommittee, said he didn’t want to set a precedent that lawmakers would “punt the rights to draft (Revenue Stabilization Act) to the executive branch.” The stabilization act is the legislation detailing the state’s budget priorities. 
Dismang said it ultimately is up to the Legislature to decide what gets funded in the state’s budget. 
“I understand we’re in charge of RSA, but we fund so much stuff out of RSA, and when we tell ourselves that we’ve got a balanced budget, we’re lying to ourselves and to our constituents,” Cavenaugh said. 
Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson disagreed and argued the state’s budget is balanced, which is required by law. 
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will present lawmakers a proposed state budget “well ahead” of April’s fiscal session and it will include funding for the program because it’s a priority for her, Hudson said. 
“We have one-time money for this fiscal year,” he said. “We’re not proposing to use one-time money next year. ”
When the Educational Freedom Accounts program was created, Cavenaugh said lawmakers were told it would be controlled by the budget, but she’s frustrated that hasn’t been the case. 
“I just want to make sure that we don’t get the state into an area where we, and quite frankly we’re going to be there anyway, that we have to make some really tough choices, as you said, what are we going to prioritize to be able fund, and we’re fast approaching that,” Cavenaugh said. 
Arizona became the first state to offer a universal school voucher program in 2022. Increased participation has increased the program’s cost to about $1 billion, which has contributed to Arizona’s budget woes. Opponents of Arkansas’ program worry a similar situation could befall the Natural State, especially as lawmakers continue approving tax cuts. 
Lawmakers also raised concerns Tuesday about what guardrails are in place to ensure program participants are using state funds appropriately.

That’s the forecast for the budget plan unveiled Tuesday by Gov. Mike Kehoe in […]","Gov. Mike Kehoe during his 2025 State of the State address (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s revenue surplus, nearly $8 billion a few years ago, will be exhausted at the end of the coming fiscal year even with a proposed budget that has no new money for public schools, higher education or state employee pay raises.
That’s the forecast for the budget plan unveiled Tuesday by Gov. Mike Kehoe in his annual State of the State address. He’s asking lawmakers for $527 million from the general revenue fund to make up shortfalls in this year’s budget but only $2 million more overall from general revenue for the coming year.
To slow spending, Kehoe proposes cutting $600 million in general revenue being spent in the current budget from his proposal for the coming year. Those cuts will make room for increases in demands on general revenue due to the depletion of funds that were used to substitute for general revenue in past budgets.
Kehoe’s budget proposal calls for $54.5 billion for all state government operations and building needs in the coming fiscal year, including $16.3 billion in general revenue. If lawmakers agree to all of Kehoe’s proposed supplemental spending for the current year, that would represent a year-to-year cut of about $600 million from all funds.
In his speech, Kehoe said he expects lawmakers to try to restore some or all of those cuts.
“While that is certainly your prerogative, any reversal or new spending items must have a pay-for,” Kehoe said.
There are few big, new spending items in the budget proposal. The foundation formula, the state’s basic aid program for public schools, will see no increase after receiving a $500 million boost last year to $4.2 billion. The budget also recommends no new funding for school transportation.
And after four years of substantial pay raises for state employees, the budget does not recommend any adjustments for inflation. The budget will continue the practice of giving state workers a pay raise of 1% for every two years in their position on their anniversary dates, state Office of Budget and Planning Director Dan Haug said.
Kehoe is making room for some smaller increases:

$10 million to boost the MOScholars program to $60 million. Lawmakers put $50 million into the private school voucher program last year, a move being challenged in state court.
$14.7 million for drone deployment and countermeasures by law enforcement agencies.
$63.2 million, including money from federal grants, to support the FIFA World Cup soccer matches in Kansas City.
$7.5 million for public schools that accept transfer students if lawmakers allow open enrollment between school districts.

There are mandatory increases in general revenue spending that do not increase the overall budget because the money is replacing banked federal COVID relief funds that are now being exhausted.
The total cost of replacing the exhausted funds is about $1 billion, Haug said.
In his speech, Kehoe said that after adding 3,400 new budget lines at a cost of $13 billion since fiscal 2022, it was time for restraint.
“Simply put, the days of excusing budgetary decisions with fund balances and ‘so-called surpluses’ are over,” Kehoe said.
Kehoe and the state budget office have been warning that the surplus, partially due to unprecedented revenue growth in 2022 and 2023 and partially due to billions in federal COVID-relief funding, would soon be exhausted.
From $4.3 billion left over on June 30, Kehoe’s budget proposal states, there will be only $4.7 million left on June 30, 2027.
“If we don’t get this budget on a sustainable path, we are going to see significant issues in the future, and the (fiscal 2027) budget is the first step in that journey,” Haug said in a briefing with reporters.
Kehoe vetoed $300 million in discretionary spending in June, and restricted the release of $211 million more.
The state expects $13.15 billion in general revenue in the coming fiscal year, which would be a decline of about 2% from the previous year. While revenues are expected to grow again in fiscal 2027, the increase is only about $500 million, leaving a gap of $2.7 billion between revenue and projected spending.
Gov. Mike Kehoe wants voters to decide whether Missouri should eliminate its income tax

The future revenue picture is clouded by Kehoe’s call to eliminate the state income tax. He wants voters to approve the concept of eliminating the income tax this year, with the details of how to replace the revenue to come later.
In the state’s current tax system, about 65% of general revenue comes from the individual income tax, about 21% comes from sales taxes and another 6.5% comes from corporate income taxes. That tax structure is one reason the state’s population is stagnant and its economic performance is lackluster, Kehoe said in his speech. 
“I’m tired of being in the middle of the pack,” he said. “I’m tired of pretending like merely keeping pace with everyone else is good enough.”
For the year ending June 30, the supplemental budget recommendation includes $80 million in general revenue, and $491 million overall, for increased costs in the Medicaid expansion program covering 363,000 low-income adults aged 18 to 64, as well as $71 million more for mental health services for that population.
There is also $131 million, including $28 million in general revenue, for increased costs in the Medicaid managed care system.
The budget does project that Medicaid overall will cost the state $16.8 billion in the coming year, down from $17.3 billion this year.
“This is going to be a multi-year task of getting our budget on a sustainable path,” Haug said. “This is the first year, but I think we’re making great strides to that with the $600 million in cuts.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012825_kehoe1-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-13 17:11:55.279373

Free.,Progressives in Congress vow to oppose immigration enforcement funding,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/progressives-congress-vow-oppose-immigration-enforcement-funding,,"WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus announced Tuesday they will oppose any federal funding for immigration enforcement following the deadly shooting of a woman by an immigration officer in Minneapolis. “Our caucus will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriations bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, said during a press conference.Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud. After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.The U.S. Senate is moving forward with the remaining appropriations bills for Congress to avoid a partial shutdown by a Jan. 30 deadline, and negotiations continue over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that  funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said the appropriations bill for “Homeland is obviously the hardest one,” and that flat funding, or a continuing resolution, for the agency is the likely outcome.Members of the Progressive Caucus are pushing for reforms including a ban on federal immigration officers wearing face coverings, the requirement of a warrant for an arrest and greater oversight of private detention facilities that hold immigrants. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Congress also needs to pass legislation to roll back the billions allocated to the Department of Homeland Security last summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The massive GOP spending and tax cuts package provided a huge budget increase to DHS for immigration enforcement of roughly $175 billion. “We have to urgently pass legislation to roll back the excessive funding for immigration enforcement” in the spending and tax cuts package, Jayapal said. “We cannot support additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security without seriously meaningful and significant reforms to the way that federal authorities conduct activity in our cities, our communities and our neighborhoods.”Progressives press JeffriesThe Progressive Caucus has nearly 100 Democratic House members. Those members joining the press conference included Omar, Jayapal, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Maxine Dexter of Oregon. Garcia, who is the whip of the Progressive Caucus, said the group has informed House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of their position, but did not say if Jeffries supported slashing DHS funds. “They are very concerned, and they also share our sentiment that we need to do something to bring reform, to bring change to stop the lawlessness, the cruelty and the abuse of power that's taking place within ICE and (Customs and Border Patrol) and DHS,” he said of Democratic leadership. While Democrats do not control either chamber, one tool lawmakers have used amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration campaign is the power of congressional oversight of federal facilities that house immigrants and are funded by Congress. But following the shooting in Minnesota, several lawmakers were denied an oversight visit to a federal ICE facility, a move that Democrats argue violates a court order. There will be an emergency hearing in the District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday on a new Trump administration policy that argues those facilities are funded through the spending and tax cuts package and therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits. Jayapal called the reasoning “a B.S. argument, and hopefully the court is going to see that.” Investigations urgedJayapal added that there also needs to be “independent investigations of lawlessness and violence by immigration agents and border patrol agents, and meaningful consequences for those who commit these acts of violence, not a slap on the wrist.”Dexter, who represents part of Portland, Oregon, where two people were shot by CBP the same week Good was shot and killed, agreed.“One thing is absolutely clear, when any law enforcement officer fires a weapon in any community, the public must have answers to questions,” Dexter said.Ramirez said there needs to be greater accountability beyond appropriations, and said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached. Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly is planning to introduce articles of impeachment for Noem on three counts: obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. While such a move likely would be uphill in the House, Republicans at the moment control the chamber by a very narrow margin.“DHS and ICE have been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate our rights under the pretense of security and safety,” Ramirez said.Frost said that Congress needs to assert its control over appropriations as a check against the Trump administration.  “We cannot depend on this administration to police themselves and an end to the enforcement practices that are terrorizing our communities,” Frost said. Jennifer Shutt contributed to this report.",,,,2026-01-13 17:11:55.279373

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) The Tennessee House opened the 2026 session with rancor, passing an obscure bill targeting businesses that hold one drag show in a year.
It marked a raucous beginning for lawmakers as critics of the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation held signs in the Capitol calling the bill “vague” and “dangerous” and shouted at Republican lawmakers as they entered the House chamber.
“This is the wrong bill to start the legislative session with. It sets the wrong priority,” said Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.
The bill’s vagueness will make it difficult for local governments to enforce, and performers and businesses will have trouble figuring out whether they’re complying, Sanders said.
In the first day of the 2025 legislative session, the House of Representatives passed a bill from Rep. Chris Todd, right, a Jackson Republican, to classify any business as an adult-oriented business if they hold only one drag show per year. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Numerous businesses across the state, whether they cater to the LGBTQ+ regularly or hold shows once yearly, are likely to fall into this new category if the bill becomes law, making it harder for them to operate. Local governments also would be put in the position of having to determine whether a business is violating the law.
Protesters formed a ring outside the entrance to the House chamber, singing songs about love as lawmakers entered. Inside, the protests continued.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton had troopers remove three people for shouting from the gallery as lawmakers tried to speak.
House Bill 884, sponsored by Republican Rep. Chris Todd of Madison County, would classify establishments as an adult-oriented business if they hold one drag show or sexually-related movie or activity in a year. Under the new designation, such businesses would have to be 1,000 feet from public parks, schools, churches and residences, putting them in a restricted category.
Todd, who sued the city of Jackson in 2022 to stop the LGBTQ Pride festival from being held in the city, previously sponsored the bill that lawmakers passed in 2023 to stop the festival from being held where children could see it. That law deems drag shows in some instances as harmful to minors and defines it as “adult cabaret,” prohibiting it on public property or areas where children could see the performances.
A Memphis theater group called Friends of George’s was part of a group that challenged the law in court. A federal judge initially found the measure unconstitutional, but an appeals court overturned that decision, finding that Friends of George’s lacked standing to sue. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
Democratic Rep. Justin Jones of Nashville blasted Todd’s bill Tuesday, calling it “absurd” that the legislature gave it priority on the first day of the session while families across the state are facing financial problems.
“It’s a veneer of hate to try to demonize another,” Jones said, calling the matter a “non-existent threat” that nobody other than Todd cared to take up. 
The new measure passed 73-24, but the Senate version still has to gain approval after it failed to gain traction in 2025.
Memphis schools takeover bill to resurface
The House is set to take up legislation Wednesday that would give the state control over the Memphis Shelby County School District, creating a state-appointed advisory board that would have authority over the elected school board.
The bill is pitting Republican and Democratic lawmakers from Shelby County against each other as the session begins. 
The House and Senate passed different versions of the bill in 2025 but couldn’t reach a compromise. The Senate version is to come before the House Wednesday, where lawmakers will be asked to concur or send it back to the other chamber.
Tennessee House, Senate speakers accuse Memphis schools of subverting audit

From that point, it could go to a small committee made up of senators and House members where a deal could be worked out for final approval.
Republican Rep. Mark White of East Memphis, who is sponsoring the measure, said this week he wants to reverse years of poor performance and mismanagement by the school district.
White said he worked all summer and fall of 2025 to push the House version of the bill, which would allow an oversight board to be appointed by the governor and House and Senate speakers. 
The Senate bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Brent Taylor, was amended last year to enable an advisory board to select replacements for elected Memphis board members removed by the state, a provision considered unconstitutional.
Democratic Rep. Joe Towns of Memphis said he opposes the bill, in part because the state-run Achievement School District already failed to make significant changes in Memphis schools, despite costing roughly $1 billion over a decade. The legislature dismantled the district last year.
Towns said White’s bill would make the district’s elected school board irrelevant.
“It says the elected body by the people don’t have their say. Taxation without representation,” Towns said. “These people have been elected, good, bad or indifferent.”
The advisory board, which would be funded locally instead of by the state, would supersede the elected board on budgets, contracts exceeding $50,000 and some policies.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-13 21:50:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Left out here for the wolves’: Child care crisis continues as lawmakers weigh options,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/13/child-care-crisis-continues/,"FILE PHOTO: Child care workers, parents and legislators stressed the need to protect access to child care during the Child Care Matters: Keep Mississippi Working press conference held at the state Capitol, Thursday, April 24, 2025.","Lynne Black opened her child care center in Tupelo in 2008 with $10,000 from her father, who told her it would be “a ministry more than a job.”
Since then, Black has cared for more than 1,000 children at Lil Leap Academy Too – and has heeded her late father’s words. She’s given money to parents to cover electricity bills, has gone years without a salary, and has fundraised to take children to the movies, the water park and places she believes they’d otherwise never see.
“The children might come from a single-parent home, they might live in the projects, but I want them to know that they are just as important as the next one,” Black said. “I want them to know what it was like to go to the zoo, to eat at a nice restaurant.”
Now, she doesn’t feel officials in Mississippi are taking care of her the way she has taken care of the state’s youngest residents. As a result of expired pandemic funds, nearly 20,000 families are on a waitlist for child care vouchers – coupons that make child care affordable for low-income working parents. Of the children who have stayed in child care, the burden has fallen on providers.

“(We found) that while many kids were exiting centers, those who stayed were able to do that largely because a significant number of providers provided free child care services or entered into other kinds of arrangements, like payment arrangements,” said Matt Williams, director of research at the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, during a virtual press conference Tuesday. 
That’s true for Black, who not only lost tuition from the 75 children who left her facility since the funding was paused in April, but also allows six of the remaining 30 children to attend her center for free. 
“Not only am I picking up the slack but it’s sinking me because there are some months that I can’t pay all of my taxes,” Black said. 
She is far from alone. According to a recent survey by the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, 89% of child care providers reported being negatively impacted by the pause in child care funding. The survey included responses from 229 child care providers across Mississippi, about a fifth of the licensed centers that accept vouchers in the state. 
Other findings included 315 staff terminations and 218 classroom closures among the surveyed centers. In addition to centers having to close classrooms, many are shuttering altogether. In 2025, 170 licensed child care centers in the state closed – the highest number in nearly a decade. 
Black says she doesn’t think she will be able to stay open beyond April, and never imagined she would end her career this way. 
“I am devastated,” Black told Mississippi Today. “I’ve put myself out on the forefront. And you mean to tell me you’d rather me close, and these children be left out here for the wolves?”

The children and families who Black works with are already grappling with a grim new reality, she said. Eleven of the children who left Black’s center after losing vouchers are now in CPS custody, Black said. The parents were so desperate to keep their jobs that they left their children at home with at-home security cameras, or “nanny cams,” and were later reported, she said. 
Employment is a requirement for the child care voucher program. But working parents consistently struggle to pay for child care in the U.S., which has the highest child care costs in the world. On average, it takes 10% of a married couple’s median income and 35% of a single parent’s income to pay for child care – both of which are considered unaffordable by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
Importantly, the enhanced pandemic funding didn’t expand eligibility. Instead, it allowed the program to reach more eligible families. The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children. 
The current crisis was not inevitable, advocates say. 
“It’s the result of policy choices, and it’s solvable,” said Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, during Tuesday’s press conference. 
Advocates like Burnett have called on the state to use some of its unspent funds from the program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, to plug the gap. The Mississippi Department of Human Services has repeatedly said they cannot use more than the 30% of TANF funds they are already spending on child care. Mississippi Today spoke to several national experts in December who said it was possible if the funds were channelled correctly. 
Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson, said Tuesday she and other members of the Legislative Black Caucus are exploring options to put money toward child care this session. Possible solutions include mandating some portion of the $156 million unobligated TANF funds for child care vouchers, as well as appropriating general funds, State Health Department funds and workforce development funds. 
“I’ve seen the effect of this crisis in my own community – it’s heartwrenching,” Summers said. “We’re trying to think creatively based on where monies are available to see: is there an opportunity to get some direct allocation into the (Child Care Payment Program)?”

Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford, who has long been a strong supporter of programs that help women and children in the state, said she would be in favor of continuing the $15 million appropriation the Legislature made last year to alleviate some pressure on the waitlist. 
Boyd said she hopes also to re-work the Child Care Tax Credit, passed in 2023, to make it more accessible for businesses to participate in the program. 
Amid the ongoing crisis, recent federal orders have worsened mass confusion and for some states, have meant disaster. Mississippi is not one of the five states – California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – that had its federal child care funding frozen for unsubstantiated allegations of fraud. However, all states will need to comply with new “Defend the Spend” paperwork to continue drawing down federal funds. 
States will have to attest that they have controls in place to prevent fraud and will have to submit “strong justification” for all expenses related to the child care voucher program. 
Mark Jones, director of communications at the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the agency is getting ready to submit the necessary paperwork and doesn’t expect any issues. 
“MDHS is working quickly to ensure compliance with ACF’s recent guidance,” Jones said. “These new requirements, as well as existing internal controls, ensure our agency’s commitment to the integrity of the Child Care Payment Program that supports over 26,000 working Mississippi families.”
While Mississippi seems to be in the clear regarding the recent federal crackdown, the state is still working  to resolve the voucher waitlist. Black is concerned about her finances, but she worries more about what will happen to the children she serves if she has to close. 
“They’re going to fail in school, they’re going to get in with the wrong crowd, the juvenile crime rate is going to increase, the CPS cases are going to increase drastically, they’re going to become unproductive citizens,” Black said. “Why? Because they don’t have structure. Care structures these children and prepares them for school.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/24132128/Child-Care-Providers-presser-4.jpg,,,2026-01-13 16:58:45.276139

A declining parole rate shows that’s no guarantee,Joe Garcia,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/parole-board-suitability-denials/,Many California prisoners can get a chance at release through expanded parole opportunities. But gaining release requires someone to demonstrate personal growth and accountability before the state Parole Board.,"In summary
Many California prisoners can get a chance at release through expanded parole opportunities. But gaining release requires someone to demonstrate personal growth and accountability before the state Parole Board.


Thousands of prisoners in California go before the Board of Parole Hearings each year in hopes of a chance at freedom. It’s a daunting situation that deals in high stakes for all involved. 
Parole commissioners must follow legal standards while balancing questions of rehabilitation, public safety and the lasting harms caused by the crime. Convicted offenders must try to present themselves truthfully — warts and all — as their custody files and psychological risk assessments are openly discussed. Victims and prosecutors attend hearings, usually to argue against someone’s parole. Every so often, they advocate for the incarcerated person’s release.
Other than the governor’s veto power, the commissioners’ findings are generally the last buffer against a former criminal being released. Commissioners go through extensive training and take great care in their decisions of whether someone is suitable for parole, as evidenced by a recidivism rate of less than 3%  — meaning 97% of prisoners paroled never reoffend. Less than 1% return for crimes involving violence against another person.
Over the last decade or so, California expanded parole opportunities for people convicted of crimes during their youth and for older prisoners. The annual number of parole hearings steadily increased — from 5,226 in 2018 to 9,017 in 2022, before plateauing at about 8,000 in 2023 and remaining there. The state’s prison population also dropped significantly during those years, from 128,000 in 2018 to about 90,000 today.
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has tried to shift its model of incarceration to focus on release from incarceration and re-entering society. Offering young prisoners better opportunities early in their incarceration can help them avoid the pitfalls of drug use, violence and gang activity in prison. Older prisoners generally tend to “age out” of their previous criminal behavior.
By incentivizing rehabilitative programming, substance abuse treatment and higher education, the system now aspires to help offenders work productively toward personal growth and self-improvement.
But at the same time, even with seemingly much more opportunity and incentives, the success rate for prisoners to be found suitable for parole has gradually declined — from 39% in 2018 to roughly 35% for 2019 through 2021 to below 25% in 2025.
CalMatters talked to parole experts to try and understand the dynamics behind the numbers. No one could point to any one reason for the significant decline in parole suitability rates; the experts instead said the downward turn can be attributed to many different factors.
Here’s what we learned:
Some older prisoners struggle at hearings
Many elderly California prisoners with life sentences began their terms decades ago when parole opportunities were scarce. They logically believed they had no hope of ever being paroled. Many were stuck at remote prisons that lacked access to rehabilitative programs. Now they face significant challenges to fully grasp and articulate evidence of personal transformation that parole commissioners require, such as insight, remorse and accountability.
“The number of people who are now elderly parole-eligible is going up in a significant way,” said Lilli Paratore, director of legal services for UnCommon Law, an organization that represents dozens of parole candidates each year at no cost to the prisoners. “In 2013, only 19% of hearings were 60-plus, but now 32% of hearings are people who are 60-plus, and of course that just mirrors the aging prison population.”
About 19,000 prisoners are 55 or older, according to the state budget proposal Gov. Gavin Newsom released this month.
And as these older prisoners continue to age, their mental and physical health can deteriorate and adversely impact their ability to present themselves to the parole board. Instead of becoming better prepared over time, repeated parole denials just leave them feeling more and more frustrated, confused and discouraged.
Less urgency from some young offenders
The stakes are not nearly the same for offenders without a life sentence who committed crimes while under age 26. Expanded parole opportunities now allow them to go before the board after 15 years. Unlike lifers, they know they have a pre-determined release date. Getting denied parole might mean waiting another five or 10 years to go home, rather than potentially never being found suitable to be set free.
Additionally, younger people may not make the best use of those first 15 years behind bars to pursue rehabilitation. Some do, but many falter before figuring themselves out. They tend to view their parole hearing as a chance to serve a reduced sentence, rather than their only chance at freedom.
In contrast, youthful offenders serving life sentences get their first chance at parole after serving a minimum of either 20, or more usually, 25 years. That naturally allows them more time to mature and prepare themselves for a hearing. They appreciate their parole opportunities in ways non-lifers just can’t, because their sentences are open-ended.
High bar for sex offenders
Sex crimes generate the most scrutiny at parole hearings and raise the most psychological red flags. Because these crimes are so difficult to speak about openly in group discussion — particularly within incarcerated communities — few rehabilitative programs are designed to address the specific triggers, causative factors and flawed belief systems underlying these offenses.
“There’s so many different types of people who commit sex crimes for a large variety of reasons and successful programming for those folks has to be tailored to that specific issue,” said former Board of Parole Hearings Executive Officer Jennifer Shaffer. “So you’ll have, for instance, sadists, people who actually get physically turned on by torturing people. That’s very different from somebody who has anger issues and expresses them through basically sexually dominating somebody.”
Because it’s much harder for sexual offenders to demonstrate to the parole board the necessary personal insight and transformation, parole commissioners are less likely to clear these offenders as no longer an “unreasonable risk to public safety.”
Part of the problem is that it’s more difficult for sexual offenders to clear a psychological risk assessment. “As horrible as this sounds, they may have at some point equated pain with sexual arousal — and breaking that connection is really difficult and takes a lot of very intense programming,” said Shaffer.
A prisoner’s digital footprint
Parole commissioners look through a person’s entire dossier days before their hearing and are tasked with interpreting all the facts within it through the lens of public safety. Any piece of information — such as visitor logs, write-ups, personal expenses and more — might be deemed pertinent.
“In the last few years, the world of information the board is looking at is growing — even though that information isn’t necessarily related to violence risk,” said Paratore. “They’re looking more and more at (unemployment) fraud and restitution avoidance. They’re looking at medical records. They’re looking at confidential information more and more.
“What they think they need to consider has just grown without any guardrails and resulting in more people being denied parole because the board does not know how to properly interpret that information. This is especially true of medical records.”
California began providing free electronic tablets to its incarcerated population in 2021, which ensures that all phone calls and text messages are now digitally monitored and ripe for analysis and search by artificial intelligence. Those types of detailed records can easily be highlighted now and made available to parole commissioners.
For example, more focus can be paid to how prisoners get outside money placed into their institutional trust accounts, and how they go about paying for canteen and other services. In the aftermath of COVID relief and the huge rash of fraudulent unemployment claims statewide, some incarcerated individuals’ trust account activity came into question. The extra level of scrutiny drew unwanted attention to other forms of potential misconduct.
Restitution fraud
Criminal courts can order large amounts of restitution when a person is convicted, usually separated into court fees and victims services fees. Prisoners who owe restitution will always have 50% deducted from any wages or incoming money until the debt is paid off. If a person works in the kitchen for $80 a month, they get to keep $40. Same thing if their family sends them $200. They’ll receive $100 to spend.
Particularly for lifers convicted of violent crimes, restitution can be quite high and seemingly impossible to finish paying through these 50% deducted installments. To avoid losing half their spending money, some prisoners will direct their families and friends to deposit money into other people’s accounts who do not owe restitution. The prisoners will agree to a much lower deduction fee amongst themselves, usually 20%, and hold onto more spending money for canteen.
But such under-the-table transactions now leave more of a digital footprint.Parole commissioners want to see a person show remorse and demonstrate awareness into the impact of their crime on the victims. It’s a bad look for that same individual to be seen participating in restitution avoidance to save themselves money.
“The restitution issue is the only thing I can think of to really explain the decline in the grant rate,” said Vanessa Nelson-Sloane, Director of Life Support Alliance, an advocacy group for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated lifers. “Sometimes when they pass a new law, a new population comes into the parole cycle, but there’s been no new laws recently that would make any difference in the considerations.
“I am so sure that this is it because that’s all I hear about from people who are getting denied —  restitution, restitution, restitution.”

He was sworn into office as chief justice last week in Topeka.  (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Rosen pressed the Kansas Legislature on Tuesday to expand funding for specialty courts tailored to special challenges of defendants and asked lawmakers to collaborate on solutions to the shortage of attorneys in rural Kansas.
Rosen, delivering his first State of the Judiciary speech to a joint session of the Legislature, said the state must continue to move forward with initiatives to enhance access to justice, build public confidence in the judiciary and improve efficiency of state court operations.
“Together we are making great strides improving and strengthening our courts and serving our communities,” said Rosen, who was sworn in as chief justice last Thursday. “But much work remains to be done.”
Rosen, with a father and father-in-law who worked at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, said he had a front-row seat in his youth to the Menninger staff’s transformational work on an integrated, multidisciplinary model of treating people with mental illness. As a Shawnee County District Court judge, he became acutely aware of how individuals with mental health conditions or substance abuse disorders too often cycled through courthouses.
Data demonstrated young women with mental health issues were significantly more likely to be arrested, he said. Young men taken into custody by law enforcement were more likely to suffer substance use problems, he said.
“What we came to understand then and what we know even more clearly today: Without addressing underlying issues and providing individualized support, lasting change is unlikely,” the chief justice said.
The consequences of people mired in the judicial system led Kansas and other states to begin investing in special problem-solving courts. In Kansas, those have centered on veterans, drug treatment, mental health and family relationships. Judges who guide specialty courts aim for root causes of crime, rather than just the consequences. The goal would be to break detrimental cycles by moving people to treatment and recovery.
Rosen urged the Legislature to respond favorably to an advisory committee’s request for $1.5 million in the upcoming fiscal year to broaden the state’s specialty court offerings. Stable funding enabled the system to better coordinate services, gather more data, expand programs and guarantee accountability, Rosen said.
“Individuals who graduate from specialty court programs are more likely to live stable, productive lives and are less likely to return to court,” Rosen said.
 
Rural attorney shortage
Rosen outlined the state’s shortage of attorneys in rural parts of the state. Starting in 2022, he said, the judicial branch and legislators began studying how to respond to an imbalance between urban and rural Kansas. In 2024, a report containing 10 recommendations was issued. Some required legislative support, while others didn’t.
It became evident while conducting research that law students and young attorneys were unprepared to establish and operate a small law firm in a rural county. The University of Kansas and Washburn University law schools responded by developing rural curriculum with insights into business aspects of a rural law practice, Rosen said.
Rosen said the 2025 Legislature conducted hearings on a bill that would create a rural attorney training program and a tuition reimbursement program for those who attended a Kansas law school and located in a rural area after graduating. The financial aid would be modeled after comparable initiatives tied to other scarce professionals, including veterinarians and physicians. He said Senate Bill 214, which included those provisions, remained available for consideration by the House and Senate.
“I want to be clear about the challenges that lie ahead if we don’t act,” the chief justice said. “Accessing the court system will become more difficult for Kansas businesses and Kansans seeking remedies in criminal and civil matters.”
He said there was a public safety component to the shortage. Expansion of case loads for lawyers undermined access to legal representation for children in need of care cases. The lack of lawyers complicated representation for people involved in domestic conflicts as well as criminal cases, he said.
He said urban and suburban attorneys attempted to fill the gap but were stretched thin. He said the judicial branch did launch the Kansas Online Self-Help Center to provide information to Kansans about payment of fines, court forms, court contact information and hearing schedules. The portal became one of the most popular resources available to Kansans through the judicial branch’s website, Rosen said.

Constitutional amendment
During a post-speech news conference with reporters at the Capitol, Rosen said he intentionally didn’t bring up the proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would transition the state to a system of electing justices to the Supreme Court rather than having them appointed by a governor. The amendment, crafted by conservatives irritated by the Supreme Court’s decisions on abortion and education, will be on statewide ballots in August.
He said it wouldn’t have been appropriate for him to delve into the proposed amendment during the State of the Judiciary speech to the Legislature.
“It’s really not before the court and it’s not something we’re going to be dealing with,” Rosen said. “That’s really up for the people to decide that question.”
Rosen, who grew up in Topeka and began his professional life as a school counselor, has been on the state Supreme Court since 2005. He served as a district court judge for 12 years prior to that appointment.
“The core values that I embraced in those early years of my training and professional experience — serving others, focusing on shared interests, working collaboratively to identify solutions and effect positive change, and acting with integrity — continue to guide my work today and I believe they are values that everyone in this chamber shares,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1010190-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-13 16:58:45.276139

(File photo by Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)As a part-time Legislature, Idaho’s lawmakers convene for a roughly three-month session each year. Lawmakers’ sole constitutionally required task for the session is to approve a balanced budget, but this isn’t always a straightforward task. 
The state budget does more than keep the lights on. It determines public school funding, road and bridge maintenance projects, water infrastructure, university funding, public assistance programs, state parks maintenance, wildfire suppression, and so much more. 
 Step 1: Pick a revenue number 

To ensure the budget is “balanced,” budget-writers must determine how much revenue the state expects so that expenditures don’t exceed that number. Without the ability to peer into the future and see what happens, this revenue number amounts to an educated guess. 
The state fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30, so lawmakers in January must estimate how revenue will finish out the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year. 
There are a number of factors that can contribute to revenues coming in above or below projections, such as elevated or stalling sales tax revenue depending on people’s spending habits during the year. 
Income tax revenue may vary depending on worker and business earnings, and this number shifts depending on changes to the tax rate the Legislature enacts. The federal government can provide boosted or diminished funds for programs, depending on policy decisions made by Congress or the president, such as tariffs and federal tax code changes. Other economic factors can impact this number as well.
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee is a group of state House representatives and senators who are provided with a variety of  reports and projections from economists, university scholars, industry representatives, state budget staffers and others to recommend a feasible state revenue projection. 
After hearing the estimates and factors laid out by all these groups, the committee must vote on the number members believe will get the closest to reality. 
In 2025, committee members and presenters came up with fiscal year 2026 revenue projections that spanned from $5.5 billion from the Idaho Tax Commission up to an estimated $6.5 billion from House Majority Leader Rep. Jason Monks, R-Meridian. The governor’s budget staff predicted around $6.4 billion, while the mean of the committee members’ estimates came to $6 billion.
“Generally in forecasting, that’s how it goes. You see more variability if the projection’s farther away because there’s more things that can happen to change that projection,” Legislative Services Office budget staffer Hayley Kaae-Domgaard told committee members at their Jan. 9, 2025, meeting. 
Discussion at that meeting included a desire to have enough revenue to accomplish policy goals, such as an income tax cut, which the Legislature did. That year the state approved a $253 million income tax cut, the largest in state history.

Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who also chairs the state budget-writing committee, at the time expressed some concerns about the then-threat of tariffs, as Idaho is a strong trading partner with Canada, and the looming uncertainty of when the next recession would occur. 
One member expressed annoyance at the common practice of purposely estimating a low revenue to constrain spending and keep a higher number on the bottom line. Eagle Republican and House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner argued that this results in agencies having to come back the next legislative session and ask for supplementals — a mid-fiscal-year budget request to cover costs incurred that could not be covered by what the agency was appropriated for that fiscal year. 
While the individual factors vary year to year, these are the types of considerations lawmakers must contend with each year to pick a revenue number. 
During that 2025 session, the revenue projection was just narrowly agreed on in a 10-8 vote by the committee. 
Is that the end of it, now the budget-writers can start setting budgets? 
Nope. 
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee can only make a recommendation. It’s up to the members of the powerful state budget writing committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, called JFAC, to choose a number to work from. 
Historically, the budget-writers on JFAC have voted on and approved revenue projections early in the legislative session. But, because it’s politics, sometimes the politicking delays this process. 
In 2025, after failing to garner majority support for 59 days into the legislative session, JFAC adopted a revenue projection on March 5. By then, lawmakers had already approved the $253 million income tax cut. 
With all that deliberating, the projection must be pretty accurate, correct? Not always. 
As of December, Idaho’s state budget was projected to end the fiscal year on June 30 with a $40.3 million deficit. That estimated deficit shrunk from the previous months’ projection of $58.3 million more in expenditures than revenues. 
In 2022, amid an influx of federal COVID-19 pandemic assistance, Idaho boasted a record budget surplus of $1.5 billion.

 Step 2: Agencies make requests

Idaho’s government functions are run by its agencies, commissions and councils. To get a sense of what those agencies need, they submit detailed budget requests to the governor’s budget staff within the Division of Financial Management well ahead of the legislative session. 
The administrator of the Division of Financial Management then works with those agencies and with the governor to create the governor’s state budget proposal.

Gov. Brad Little, nor any other governor, cannot ultimately set the budget. But on the first day of the legislative session, he stands before the Legislature and unveils his priorities and his budget proposal for the next fiscal year. 
The governor’s proposals and agency requests then go to budget writers on JFAC. 
Each budget gets its own hearing in a format that has changed over the last couple of years. As of 2024, budget hearings are reduced to a roughly 90-minute presentation from the legislative budget staffer assigned to work on that agency’s budget, and short remarks by the head of that agency at the end. In the past, legislators heard three-hour long presentations from the agency directors themselves as they detailed how they’d spent prior funding and their needs for the upcoming year. 
Unlike other committees, the public at large never has a chance to weigh in on these hearings. 
The budget hearing schedule can be found online here.
 JFAC work groups craft budgets

The joint budget-writing committee was formed in the Idaho Legislature in the late 1960s, and at the time, was fairly unique among other state processes, said Jaclyn Kettler, a political science associate professor at Boise State University who researches state legislatures and teaches comparative state politics.  
Some states have committees in each chamber produce their own budget proposals, and then must find a way to reconcile them to approve one budget. Other states, as well as Congress, also sometimes do large omnibus budget bills that include spending for every agency and program.

For the most part, Idaho passes a budget for each agency in separate bills. However, with the changes adopted in 2024, the committee has since undergone a “maintenance” budget process and “enhancement process.” 
“Maintenance budgets” include the funding for agencies that has already been approved by the Legislature, but no new spending. These budgets are passed in around 10 omnibus bills that combine agencies under general topics such as public safety, general government or economic development. The committee votes on the 10 budgets all at once early in the legislative session. 
Then, new spending requests are considered line-by-line for each agency. To work on these requests and determine proposed budgets for each agency, JFAC is split into working groups for different agencies. 
Which lawmaker serves on which working group is not typically publicly shared, and the groups’ work is all done behind closed doors. 
Sometimes members who work on the agency disagree on how to set a budget. 
When it comes time to vote, members bring prepared motions to set how much state funding the agency gets as well as the authority to spend any federal money that agency may receive.
There is typically a motion made for one budget and a “substitute motion” made if there’s a competing budget proposal. If there’s a third proposal, a lawmaker can make an “amended substitute motion.” After that, there can be no further motions on an individual budget. 
The committee votes on the most recently made motion first. For instance, if there was an amended substitute motion to spend $1,000 of general funds on ice cream for the Idaho Ice Cream Commission (a fictitious agency example), that would be the first motion to get a vote. If the motion dies, the committee would move on to the substitute motion to spend $2,500 on ice cream. 
If that motion also fails, the committee moves on to the original motion of $1,200 on ice cream. If all three motions fail, the work groups must get back to work and bring something different for the committee to vote on again.  
Much of the focus of the state budget is on the state’s general fund, which consists of unobligated money that the state uses to pay many of its bills and to enact policies. 
For fiscal year 2025, the state’s total budget, using all sources, is about $13.9 billion. Federal and dedicated funds typically are earmarked for certain programs or projects. The state general fund budget was around $5.2 billion for fiscal year 2025. 
 JFAC members also approve ‘intent language’ 

Once the numbers for the budget are approved, the committee members will also vote on what’s called “intent language.” This language usually dictates how the money must be used or conditions for approval. Sometimes, it may require a report on how a certain grant was used, or clarifies that certain funds may only be used for a specified purpose. 
Intent language is part of the law, and agencies may face consequences for using the funds for other purposes. The committee has the authority to order an audit of use of funds if there’s suspected misuse. 
If the audit findings are serious enough, auditors may recommend referring the case to the state attorney general for criminal prosecution. Most times, the issues are resolved before legal proceedings are brought. 
 Approved budgets go to House and Senate floors 

Once budget numbers are approved by the committee, they go to legislative staffers to be drafted into a bill. This process can take a few days, after which the budgets would show up in the House or Senate floors calendars. It’s up to leadership to decide which chamber will hear the budget first. 
The bills must pass both chambers and go to the governor to be approved.

If the House or Senate votes down a bill, it goes back to JFAC budget writers who must get back with work groups to craft a new bill that will be more likely to pass. 
If a budget passes the Legislature, the governor may then veto it. If the governor vetoes an entire budget, it’s likely that JFAC would have to take it back up. The governor also has the option to do a “line item veto,” only striking one section of the bill. 
Little has used this line-item veto power one time, and it was to strike out a section of his own office’s budget that would have eliminated his emergency fund.

 Once the the whole budget is passed and signed into law — that’s it. Sine Die. 

Once every agency budget has been approved by both chambers of the Legislature and signed by the governor, that’s it. 
However, some budget bills may sometimes be held on reading calendars as “hostages,” keeping lawmakings in session until preferred policy bills move forward. 
Once all the negotiating is complete and the policy bills that are going to move forward are approved, the hostages are released, and the chamber may vote on the bill. 
At the end of the session, which includes paperwork and some procedural moves that can sometimes delay the actual adjournment. The final adjournment of the session is called “Sine Die,” Latin for “without day,” which indicates that the work is done until next year. 
During the interim between sessions, there may be work groups and task forces and other interim committees, but the Legislature as a whole won’t meet again unless a special session is called. 
The governor may convene a special session for a specific purpose, and as of a 2022 voter-approved state constitutional amendment, the Legislature may call itself into special session with approval from 60% of each chamber’s members.

A trial in Santa Fe is set to begin Feb. 2, 2026. (Justin Garcia/Las Cruces Bulletin)A New Mexico district judge this week denied requests by social media giant Meta to dismiss a New Mexico Department of Justice lawsuit alleging the company allowed child exploitation on its sites, setting the stage for a trial to begin Feb. 2 in the state’s capital.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez first brought the civil suit in December 2023, arguing in the complaint that Meta — which owns platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children,” claiming the company is protecting its bottom line. The NMDOJ sued both the company and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
“In short, Meta has allowed Facebook and Instagram to become a marketplace for predators in search of children upon whom to prey,” the complaint stated. “Meta’s conduct is not only unacceptable; it is unlawful. This action seeks to force Meta to institute protections for children because it refuses to do so voluntarily.”
Meta has denied the allegations in the complaint and moved to have the case dismissed several times. An email requesting comment from attorneys for Meta remained pending Tuesday afternoon.
In a Jan. 12 hearing, First Judicial District Judge Bryan Biedscheid in Santa Fe ruled against Meta’s requests to dismiss and scheduled the case for a trial.
In a statement, Torrez called the ruling “an important step towards justice.”
“Our lawsuit alleges that Meta has misled the public and put children at tremendous risk of sexual exploitation and other serious harms through a series of platform design decisions made by Meta’s executives that introduce children to predators and overwhelm them with dangerous content,” Torrez said. “The judge’s ruling allows each of our claims against Meta to move to trial, and enables the NMDOJ to present the jury with the documents and testimony we’ve gathered over more than two years of litigation. We look forward to presenting our full case in court.”

That was the bottom line from Medicaid leaders at the N.C. Dept. of Health and Human Services to state lawmakers at a hearing Tuesday. 
NCDHHS says the federal changes will require an additional $44.4M a year from the state for increased administration costs, plus another $6.5M this year to match the federal funding for implementation. 
The healthcare program will face new eligibility and work requirements for the more than 700,000 Medicaid expansion enrollees beginning Jan. 1, 2027. State Medicaid COO Sarah Gregosky told a joint oversight committee the changes will require NCDHHS to upgrade its existing system to gather the data needed. 
It will also require more staff at the county level, Gregosky said, to recertify benefits eligibility every six months, rather than annually.
“This is a complex technology, policy and process change for our systems, for our county caseworkers, for providers, for our beneficiaries,” Gregosky told the panel. “All of those system changes need to be in place prior to October.”
That upfront work, she said, needs to get underway soon to allow the state to design, test and deploy the system within the accelerated timeline required by the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” law. But she said that’s complicated by the fact that federal Medicaid officials haven’t yet issued their official rules for the changes. 
“The CMS guidance is not due out until June,” Gregosky told lawmakers, “which means that we need to make assumptions now based on what’s in the legislation, but guidance may come out in June that requires us to adjust some of those assumptions.”   
“CMS has indicated while there is an allowance for an extension for states who are making good faith progress towards implementation, they do not intend to issue any of those extensions,” she added.
Assistant NCDHHS Secretary Melanie Bush said lawmakers will need to act to allow Medicaid access to additional funds, either through higher taxes on hospitals or by reallocating money from the General Fund or from other agencies, like the N.C. Dept. of Corrections, that have saved money due to Medicaid expansion,
“We need legislative action as soon as possible,” Bush said. “We need legislative action by early this year – by March 31, if possible – so that we can get the funding we need to build out these systems.”  
Lawmakers’ reactions ranged from concern to skepticism. 
“Timing here is, I think, an issue that we’re going to think through,” replied Chairman Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forysth). “This is just me talking, but I’m not sure we’ll be back before April, and so that’s something that we’re going to have to think about, talk about.”
Rep. Hugh Blackwell (R-Burke) said NCDHHS was failing to acknowledge the savings the reforms are intended to bring.
“By clarifying eligibility requirements, rather than expanding participants, you might be cutting back on participants,” Blackwell said. “The overall idea I’m getting from the department is you all feel that what you’re going to be required to do … is just busy work that’s going to add cost, and that there will be no savings anywhere as a result of all this new shuffling of policies.” 
NCDHHS Medicaid chief Jay Ludlum took issue with that characterization. 
“We are not trying to imply that there would not be offsetting costs and that this is purely busy work,” he said. 
“I don’t know where the savings are going to fall over time, but at least initially, there will have to be some investments to get there,” Ludlum said. “We do have to build, in part, a system that doesn’t exist yet.”
According to NCDHHS, NC’s Medicaid program is already some $319M in the red due to underfunding for the current fiscal year, and will likely run out of money sometime this spring. 
Republican legislative leaders don’t agree with that assessment. They’ve promised to supply more funding if needed, but so far, state House and Senate leaders have been unable to reach an agreement on a spending package.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC_Legislature_PhotoChenkel-1024x720.jpg,,,2026-01-13 16:58:45.276139

Kim Banta, R—Fort Mitchell, presents a bill during a 2025 committee meeting. (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — Two Kentucky Republicans in the GOP-controlled General Assembly are proposing term limits on lawmakers — one at the federal level and one for themselves.
Rep. Kim Banta, R-Fort Mitchell, has filed a bill that would put the question to Kentucky voters in the form of a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on state legislators. 
Meanwhile in the Senate, Majority Floor Leader Max Wise, of Campbellsville, filed a resolution that would add Kentucky to states seeking a national convention to propose an amendment to the U.S. Constitution imposing term limits on members of Congress.

Asked about both proposals Tuesday, House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, told reporters that lawmakers already have term limits — elections. 
“Every two years we have elections. You look at the turnover of this body over the last six years, we have about 80 members that have served four terms or less. So, I think we have pretty effective term limits,” he said. “But that said, we will certainly look at them and discuss with the caucus and see what the will of the caucus is.” 
Kentucky lawmakers are meeting for the second week of the 2026 legislative session, and neither bill has been given a committee hearing at this point. Both have GOP co-sponsors. 
Banta told the Lantern Tuesday afternoon that she’s supported term limits since she began serving in the House in 2019. She added that she filed similar legislation in the past. This year’s version, House Bill 288, would limit Kentucky senators to four terms of four years and House members to six terms of two years if the amendment wins at the ballot box in November. 
Banta has filed to seek reelection to a fifth term this year, though she told the Lantern that it would be her last. 
Banta said she understands arguments like Osborne’s — that elections are the way to limit terms — but pointed to the advantages of incumbency. When a candidate has name ID and voters are busy, the same lawmaker can be elected year after year and “you don’t get those fresh voices.”

“You need to come in with some experience and you need to do your duty to the commonwealth, and then you need to go,” Banta said. “I just don’t think that this should be the kind of job that you burrow into and keep.” 
If her legislation doesn’t move this year, Banta said she would file it again in 2027. 
When asked about his legislation, Senate Joint Resolution 17, on Friday, Wise told reporters that after hearing constituents’ complaints about Congress, he believes term limits are a solution. The resolution doesn’t explicitly say how many years a congressional member could serve, but rather signals Kentucky would support a convention on the topic. Wise added that he thought the resolution could have support from Republicans and Democrats. 
“I think a lot of people are very frustrated with the dysfunctional Congress. I think here at the state level, we do a lot of good work, we get a lot of things accomplished, but I think a lot of times we look at the federal level and say, man, just some things maybe need to change,” Wise said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/banta021125-1024x694.jpg,,,2026-01-13 16:58:45.276139

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined 11 other states’ attorneys general Tuesday in filing suit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for what the multistate coalition argues is unlawful discrimination against transgender people via new strictures placed on federal grant funding. 
“This is yet another distraction from an Administration that would rather target marginalized groups than do anything to help the American people,” Neronha said in a statement. “It hasn’t worked before and it won’t work here.”
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and targets what it dubs as HHS’ “Gender Conditions” — a set of certification and compliance rules attached to federal grants in a way that forces recipients to honor President Donald Trump’s January 2025 executive order which limits the federal definition of sex to a strictly binary model.
“Under the leadership of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., HHS has wasted no time in illegally implementing the EO’s [Executive Order’s] discriminatory directives,” the lawsuit reads.
Across 11 of the complaint’s 61 pages, the lawsuit outlines how the U.S. Department of Justice and HHS have gradually installed Trump’s directive into federal governance, leading to threats of canceled or clawed-back funding, as well as possible liability under the False Claims Act.
The most recent example cited by the AGs is the Dec. 29 awarding of Rural Health Transformation Program grants, which they argue require states “to certify compliance with the Gender Conditions as a condition of drawing down the funds.”
“Plaintiff States accordingly fear that agreeing to the Gender Conditions, even with reservations, will expose them to heightened legal risks and place billions of dollars of funding provided by Congress for the Rural Health Transformation program at risk,” the suit reads.
Co-leading the lawsuit with Neronha are California’s Rob Bonta, New York’s Letitia James, and Oregon’s Dan Rayfield. The AGs from Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Vermont and Washington also joined.
Each of these states stands to lose something from the HHS conditions. According to Tuesday’s filing: 
“The Gender Conditions jeopardize a vast amount of funding used by Plaintiff States to support vital health centers and health education programs; scientific research and medical education in universities; and community programs focused on improving infectious disease prevention and treatment, immunization, and maternal and infant health.
“Congress has funded these programs without any requirement to exclude entities that recognize transgender, nonbinary, intersex, or gender diverse individuals.”
The attorneys general argue that the feds are using Title IX — the civil rights law meant to prevent sex-based discrimination — as the mechanism to enforce Trump’s executive order. The Trump administration has employed Title IX in related mandates, like Executive Order 14201, which strives to keep transgender men out of women’s athletics.  
But the AGs argue that HHS does not have the “authority to reinterpret Title IX’s requirements via a funding condition,” and by maneuvering to do so, the agency “violates the President’s Article II obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and usurps the legislative authority conferred by the Constitution exclusively on Congress.”
The AGs also argue that the definitions in Trump’s first gender-defining EO “are unscientific, unworkable, and inconsistent with other ‘official’ HHS guidance purporting to define the same terms, including HHS’s Feb. 19 announcement.”
That means the plaintiff states are “unable to determine what the Gender Conditions require of them as grant recipients that is distinct from pre-existing requirements under Title IX,” the suit reads. “This uncertainty puts Plaintiff States at risk of — unintentionally — violating the Gender Conditions and being subject to loss of funding and threats of federal enforcement actions.”
The coalition wants the court to declare the grant conditions and policies unlawful, and block HHS from enforcing the restrictions. 
Like many Trump-related lawsuits, the AGs argue that Kennedy and his office have exceeded their statutorily granted powers, violating the Administrative Procedure Act. Because the gender conditions “reverse previous policies — in effect across multiple federal agencies and administrations, including the first Trump administration” and broadly affect existing antidiscrimination law, the suit claims that invoking the EO does not meet the sufficient criteria for such sweeping changes.  
The complaint notes that multiple federal courts, including Rhode Island’s, have blocked comparable restrictions in recent months, such as the preliminary injunction granted in October 2025 in the case, Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence v. Kennedy. 
When asked for comment Tuesday via email, HHS’ press office said the agency does not comment on litigation.
The case has been tentatively assigned to U.S. District Judge Melissa R. DuBose and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan.
This lawsuit is the 47th Neronha has co-led or joined against the Trump administration since the president began his second tenure in office last January. It is also the first lawsuit contra Trump that Neronha has joined in 2026. The last lawsuit he joined was filed two days before Christmas and also concerned federal limits on gender-affirming care and medicine for young people.

WILMINGTON, DE – The Delaware State Bar Association (DSBA) will host its annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast and Statewide Day of Service on Monday, January 19 at 7:45 a.m. at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. The event honors the life and legacy of Dr. King while encouraging reflection, dialogue and community action.
Richard Rothstein
Each year, the breakfast brings together members of the legal community, civic leaders and residents from across Delaware to reflect on Dr. King’s commitment to justice, equality and service. The program is designed not only to commemorate Dr. King’s impact on civil rights but also to inspire continued efforts toward fairness and inclusion in everyday life.
This year’s keynote speakers are Richard Rothstein and Leah Rothstein, a father and daughter team whose work focuses on racial justice and housing segregation in the United States. Richard Rothstein is the author of “The Color of Law”, which examines how government policies contributed to racial segregation. Leah Rothstein co-authored “Just Action”, which outlines practical steps communities can take to address segregation and inequity. Their remarks will focus on how individuals, institutions and communities can take meaningful action to advance equity.
The MLK Breakfast also serves as the launch point for the Statewide Day of Service. Following the morning program, participants are invited to take part in volunteer opportunities throughout Delaware. These projects are intended to reflect Dr. King’s belief that service is a powerful way to strengthen communities and bring people together.
Leah Rothstein
Volunteer opportunities typically include supporting local nonprofit organizations through activities such as food distribution, meal service and community outreach. Some projects require advance registration, while others welcome walk-in volunteers. The Day of Service is open to individuals, families and groups who want to honor Dr. King’s legacy through hands-on service.
By pairing reflection with action, the Delaware State Bar Association aims to create a meaningful experience that extends beyond a single morning. The event encourages participants to consider how Dr. King’s principles of justice, compassion and service can be applied throughout the year.
The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast and Statewide Day of Service offers an opportunity for Delawareans to come together in remembrance and renewal, reinforcing the importance of civic responsibility and community engagement.
Tickets for the event and volunteer opportunities are available at eventbrite.
MLK Day of Service
The first nationwide MLK Day of Service was held in 1995, and it has grown steadily ever since. Today, it is recognized as the only federal holiday designated as a national day of service, often described by its guiding message: “a day on, not a day off.” The day reflects the core values championed by Martin Luther King Jr. particularly his belief that service and collective action are essential to building stronger, more just communities.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MLK.jpg,,,2026-01-13 16:58:45.276139

Phil Murphy takes a victory lap and remembers erstwhile allies. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Gov. Phil Murphy touted accomplishments and recalled late members of his administration in his final state of the state address Tuesday.
Murphy, a Democrat who leaves office at noon on Jan. 20 after eight years as New Jersey’s chief executive, trumpeted measures that expanded the state’s paid family leave programs, nearly doubled its wage floor, and shored up state reserves after decades of bipartisan neglect.
“We proved that when we live by our Jersey values, our state government can serve the needs of working people, first and foremost,” he told a joint legislative session Tuesday. “And it is thanks to everything that we have accomplished over these past eight years that, today, we are a state brimming with opportunity for all.”
Pay raises start for New Jersey legislators

Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, succeeds Murphy on Jan. 20.
Murphy noted advancements in school funding made in his budgets, which boosted state school aid by nearly $4 billion from the final spending bill under his predecessor, Chris Christie.
The governor also extolled tax relief programs passed under his administration. Those include the Anchor program, which offers property tax rebates between $1,000 and $1,750 for homeowners or $450 to $750 for renters, and StayNJ, which promises to cut up to $3,250 from seniors’ property tax bills this year.
“Today in New Jersey, there are grandparents who can finally afford to retire here at home instead of moving elsewhere, so they can stay close to their kids and their grandkids and form memories that will last a lifetime,” Murphy said.
But he acknowledged that New Jersey remained an expensive place to live.
“We have not solved all of our problems. The sad fact is our families are still being squeezed by an affordability crisis that has swept across every community in the nation,” he said.
Murphy lauded his handling of state finances. His administration has made five full pension payments — the first in a quarter-century following neglect by Democratic and Republican administrations — and raised the state’s surplus to roughly $6.8 billion, from about $409 million in fiscal 2018.
Murphy, who in 2021 became the first Democratic New Jersey governor to win reelection in four decades, cautioned that progress could be erased if appropriators return to past fiscal practices.
“My point here is not to pat ourselves on the back. It’s to offer a word of caution. It took eight years of diligent, disciplined leadership, by a lot of us by the way, to get our fiscal house in order and to build a state that is trusted again,” he said. “But folks, if we lose our focus, all of the progress that we made could be wiped away.”
Responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars was a duty, he said, not an option.
He also touted investments in artificial intelligence and state strategic innovation centers, which he has predicted will be among his most lasting accomplishments. Those centers, in coordination with universities and private firms, use public dollars to boost growth in targeted industries like AI, biotech, and avionics, among others.
He recalled the late Dick Codey, a former legislator and acting governor who died Sunday and numbered among his top allies in the Senate earlier in the governor’s tenure, and Sheila Oliver, who was lieutenant governor under Murphy until her death in 2023.
“No matter what obstacles we faced, we were who we said we’d be,  and did what we said we’d do. And when I say ‘we,’ I mean it,” the governor said.

(Photos courtesy of Library of Congress)Lawmakers took another step toward welcoming former Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln into Florida classrooms Tuesday when the Senate Education Pre-K-12 committee approved SB 420.
The measure passed the committee on a 6-1 vote. It would require portraits of Washington and Lincoln in all K-5 classrooms and all other classrooms primarily used for social studies.
Presidents Washington and Lincoln could watch over Florida students next year

Sen. Danny Burgess, a veteran of the U.S. Army Reserve and a Republican from Zephyrhills, is the Senate sponsor and Rep. John Snyder, a Marine Corps veteran and Republican from Stuart, is sponsor in the House of HB 371.
Burgess, in announcing the bill, in particular cited a trip he took during the summer to “a historic classroom where portraits of Presidents Washington and Lincoln still hung on the wall.”
“They’re routinely ranked as the greatest presidents in our history, time and time again through those polls and the folks that do that type of data crunching. These individuals helped us become who we are as a country. It’s a return to, really, our roots,” Burgess said during the committee meeting Tuesday.
Burgess, chair of the Senate Education Appropriations committee, committed to advocating for fully funding the portraits.
Sen. Tracie Davis, a Democrat from Jacksonville, was the lone no vote. She said, “This is a precedent that can be potentially expounded upon from future Legislatures,” and voiced concern that the bill could send a signal of shifting responsibilities away from local school districts.
Burgess said the portraits could organically elicit conversations with students about who the presidents were even though the measure wouldn’t require teachers to add or alter instruction.
The portraits to be used would be determined by the state Department of Education, which would “make them available to each school district,” per the bill text. The measure would go into effect July 1 if passed.
“I feel strongly that not only do they represent obviously an immense amount to our past and how we got to where we are today, but that I felt like these individuals also rise above the politics of today. And that was important to me to make sure that they represented unity and strength and who we all are as Americans,” Burgess said.
The House bill is assigned to two committees and is not yet scheduled for its first hearing.
The Senate bill has three committee assignments, with two left now that it’s passed its first.
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration is in the process of installing statues of founding fathers in Florida counties named after the historical figures in advance of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

A pesar de ya se han pagado miles de millones de dólares en reclamaciones, los incendios expusieron los problemas del atribulado mercado de seguros de California. Es probable que todos los asegurados vean un aumento en las primas.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Un año después de los letales incendios del condado de Los Ángeles, el mercado de seguros de propiedad de California sigue siendo problemático; los sobrevivientes están demandando a las aseguradoras por reclamos demorados o denegados; y es probable que la mayoría de los asegurados del estado vean aumentar sus primas.
Siete de cada diez sobrevivientes de los incendios de Los Ángeles aún no han regresado a sus hogares, algunos en parte debido a demoras en los reclamos de seguros, según una nueva encuesta publicada por el Departamento de Ángeles, un grupo sin fines de lucro que se formó después de los incendios.
 La encuesta también reveló que 4 de cada 10 asegurados han experimentado problemas de asegurabilidad, como aumentos considerables en las primas y la cancelación de la cobertura, a pesar de que la ley estatal establece una moratoria de un año para que las aseguradoras cancelen o no renueven las pólizas de sus clientes después de que el gobernador declare el estado de emergencia. Quienes tienen viviendas que no se incendiaron pero que siguen en pie son especialmente propensos a haber experimentado grandes aumentos en sus primas, según la encuesta a 2443 adultos, realizada entre el 18 de noviembre y el 2 de diciembre de 2025.
Ya se esperaba que las primas de seguro para todos, no solo para los sobrevivientes de los incendios, aumentaran con las nuevas normas del Comisionado de Seguros, Ricardo Lara. El comisionado, que enfrentaba presiones para mejorar la disponibilidad de seguros en el estado, implementó en enero pasado un plan que busca agilizar las revisiones de tarifas y permite a las aseguradoras utilizar modelos de catástrofes y costos de reaseguro para establecer sus tarifas. El plan entró en vigor pocos días antes de los incendios de Los Ángeles.
 Ahora la respuesta a los incendios también podría conducir a primas de seguro aún más altas en general, dijo Amy Bach, directora ejecutiva del grupo de defensa del consumidor United Policyholders.
 “Abogo por los sobrevivientes de desastres, pero también por toda la comunidad de asegurados”, dijo Bach. “Por cada proyecto de ley de ‘Eliminar la Lista’, por cada mejora que implementamos para prevenir el trauma posdesastre relacionado con el seguro insuficiente, hay un costo”. Añadió que estas acciones tendrán consecuencias tanto para la asequibilidad como para la disponibilidad de seguros.
El proyecto “ Eliminar la lista o Eliminate the list”, que el gobernador Gavin Newsom convirtió en ley el año pasado, requiere que las compañías de seguros paguen el 60% de los límites de cobertura de propiedad personal, hasta $350,000, a los asegurados que sufran una pérdida total sin exigirles que presenten un inventario detallado por al menos 100 días.
Aun así, Bach sabe que estos mandatos son necesarios para mejorar la experiencia de los sobrevivientes tras un incendio, y los legisladores están presentando nuevos proyectos de ley para resolver las preocupaciones existentes. Su propio grupo publicó una encuesta en noviembre, en la que se reportaron quejas de los asegurados, entre ellas, retrasos en la comunicación con las aseguradoras, demoras en el pago de reclamaciones y la asignación de múltiples peritos para un solo caso.
 La encuesta del Departamento de Ángeles reveló que los clientes de State Farm y del Plan FAIR (las dos aseguradoras más grandes de California) fueron los más insatisfechos con la respuesta de sus aseguradoras. El departamento de seguros de California está investigando la respuesta de State Farm a los incendios y también ha emprendido acciones legales contra el Plan FAIR por su respuesta, especialmente en las reclamaciones por daños causados por el humo. Estas aseguradoras, junto con otras compañías, también enfrentan demandas de sus asegurados.
 “Los comentarios de nuestros clientes reflejan una experiencia diferente a la que se informa”, declaró Tom Hartmann, portavoz de State Farm, en un correo electrónico. “Estamos apoyando a más de 13,500 clientes afectados por los incendios forestales, más que cualquier otra compañía de seguros, y ya hemos pagado más de $5 mil millones para ayudarlos a recuperarse”.

“Hemos pagado casi $200,000 de nuestro bolsillo para reparar nuestra casa debido a la negativa del Plan FAIR de pagar nuestro reclamo”, dijo Angela Giacchetti, portavoz del Departamento de Ángeles que colaboró en el estudio. Ella también es una sobreviviente del incendio cuya casa en Altadena no se incendió, pero sí sufrió graves daños.
 “Si bien no podemos comentar sobre las reclamaciones de los asegurados individuales, el Plan FAIR de California no determina dónde residen”, declaró Hilary McLean, portavoz del plan. “El Plan FAIR evalúa cada reclamación según sus propios méritos y paga todas las reclamaciones cubiertas hasta los límites de la póliza individual”.
El Plan FAIR anunció en un comunicado de prensa esta semana que ha gestionado cerca de 5,400 reclamaciones y pagado casi 3,500 millones de dólares a los asegurados. También indicó que ha tomado medidas para mejorar su capacidad de servicio a los asegurados mediante la obtención de una línea de crédito y reaseguro, con la ayuda de un bono de catástrofe de 750 millones de dólares, posible gracias a una nueva ley que permite al Plan FAIR obtener financiación mediante bonos a través del Banco de Infraestructura y Desarrollo Económico de California.
 La Asociación Estadounidense de Seguros de Propiedad y Accidentes dice que las compañías de seguros han pagado $22.4 mil millones de los $40 mil millones esperados en reclamos totales por los incendios de Los Ángeles.
 La encuesta del Departamento de Ángeles también reveló que el 79% de los sobrevivientes enfrentan dificultades económicas, y que la mayoría de los sobrevivientes negros, asiáticos y latinos se atrasan en el pago del alquiler o la hipoteca. Además, el 40% de los encuestados expresó su gran insatisfacción con la respuesta local, estatal y federal a sus necesidades.
 Newsom declaró el martes que está trabajando con legisladores estatales, el sector bancario y otros actores en la creación de nuevos préstamos para la reconstrucción, y que el estado ampliará la elegibilidad para el Fondo Hipotecario CalAssist. La oficina del gobernador no respondió a las preguntas de CalMatters sobre si planea proponer ayuda para los inquilinos que sobrevivieron a los incendios ni sobre qué otras medidas está tomando para seguir presionando al gobierno federal para obtener fondos a largo plazo para desastres.
 “Este informe refleja exactamente lo que hemos estado escuchando”, declaró Michael Soller, portavoz del departamento de seguros. “Los sobrevivientes de los incendios forestales quieren acción y resultados”. Añadió que los problemas de la encuesta son de máxima prioridad para el departamento y, entre otras cosas, mencionó un grupo de trabajo sobre daños causados por el humo que el departamento ha convocado.
 Un proyecto de ley patrocinado por Lara y presentado por el recién nombrado presidente del Comité de Seguros del Senado, Steve Padilla, demócrata de San Diego, el martes por la noche requeriría que las compañías de seguros presenten al estado sus planes de recuperación de desastres relacionados con el manejo de reclamos; duplicar las sanciones por violaciones de prácticas justas de reclamos durante una emergencia; ampliar los pagos de reclamos por adelantado; dar a los asegurados actualizaciones del estado dentro de los cinco días cuando su ajustador sea reemplazado; y más.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/021425_EatonFireMudslides_JAJ_CM_23.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-13 16:58:45.276139

Mike Kehoe during his 2025 State of the State address to the legislature (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe wants voters to determine whether Missouri should completely phase out its income tax, leaving details on how to do it — and how to make up for lost revenue — for lawmakers to decide next year.
Kehoe laid out the plan in his annual State of the State address to a joint session of the Missouri General Assembly on Tuesday afternoon. After declaring that he was determined to trim the size of the state budget, the governor said Missouri is falling behind states like Tennessee and Texas that don’t have an income tax.
“If we are serious about building a foundation for growth,” he said, “to compete rather than be complacent, then we must begin the work now to phase-out and eliminate Missouri’s individual income tax.”
Missouri’s income tax represents 65% of last year’s $13.4 billion in state revenue. Since 2014, the top income tax rate has fallen from 6% to 4.7%. Two future cuts, bringing the rate down to 4.5%, are already on the books and will take effect if general revenue growth hits certain targets.
Missouri Democrats vow to fight any push to increase taxes on sales or services 

Missouri can maintain a balanced budget that supports essential services and eliminate the income tax, Kehoe said, by expanding what services are covered by the state’s sales tax.
“Today, much of our commerce happens through monthly subscriptions and digital services like online advertising, e-books and AI platforms that fall outside our current sales tax base,” he said, adding: “When these types of modern services are taxed, it will create new revenue for local governments.”
These increases “will need to be offset by reducing local taxes, like property taxes,” Kehoe said, “a high priority for Missourians and many of us in this room.”
Any expanded sales tax will not include agriculture, health care or real estate, Kehoe said. And he dismissed those who point to states like Kansas, which slashed income taxes in 2012 and created a fiscal fallout so severe that lawmakers reversed most of the cuts five years later.
“Some critics and members of the media will claim that tax cuts put us in a bad budget situation,” Kehoe said. “I disagree. The folks who say that just want to spend more of your money. I will never apologize for putting money back in the pockets of hardworking Missourians.”
Kehoe didn’t delve into specifics of his income tax vision, saying only that step one would involve putting a question on the statewide ballot asking: “Should Missouri begin a phased elimination of the individual income tax, with a full repeal within the next five years.”
“Once voters approve this measure,” Kehoe said, “I look forward to working with the General Assembly next session to carry out the will of the people and put this plan into action.”
The governor also pledged to look for a “sustainable, long-term solution for our growing energy demands.”
Specifically, Kehoe hopes to expand nuclear power in Missouri.
“I am proud to announce that Missouri, and this administration, is all in on nuclear,” he said.
Public school open enrollment wins tentative support from Missouri education board

Nuclear is a “safe, reliable and clean energy source that can and will power Missouri’s economic future for generations to come,” Kehoe said, calling for an update to Missouri’s Renewable Energy Standard to add “nuclear power sources.”
On education, Kehoe threw his support behind efforts to allow students to enroll in neighboring public school districts.
“Open enrollment gives families the freedom to choose the public school that best meets their child’s needs, regardless of ZIP code,” he said. “It’s about fairness. It’s about access. And it’s about making sure no child’s future is limited by their address.”
Kehoe also announced he was issuing an executive order requiring the creation of a statewide school accountability A through F grade card, saying the current system does not give a straightforward picture of how schools are performing.
“Parents deserve clear, easy to understand information,” he said, “about how schools are performing so they can make the best decision for their children.”
The governor also reiterated his support of Amendment 3, an initiative petition on the November ballot that would reinstate Missouri’s abortion ban.
“Amendment 3 reflects Missouri’s long-standing commitment to life and standing with women,” he said.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012825_kehoe2-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-13 16:12:11.605818

Jan. 13, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceDETROIT – President Donald Trump visited the Motor City on Tuesday to tout what he considered wins on the economy and other aspects of his second term, which have included a rough economic start, a brutal immigration crackdown that has led to the shooting death of an American citizen, and military attacks on several nations, including Iran and Venezuela.
But Trump’s message, delivered to a gathering of the Detroit Economic Club at the MotorCity Casino, was that the country was now rolling after getting a full year out from the administration of former President Joe Biden. That was despite a report out earlier Tuesday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that indicated prices rose 2.7% in December from a year ago, adding fuel to Democrats’ criticisms that goods, services and basic needs remained unaffordable.
Trump eschewed that notion and said that it was their fault that things were so pricey to begin with.
“They’re coming down much faster than anyone can remember it,” he said. “Prices are coming down and our growth is way up.”
Prior to Trump’s speech, the Detroit Free Press reported that two protestors were arrested outside the venue after police warned them to stay away from their security cordon. The protest was organized by BAMN, or By Any Means Necessary, which gathered at nearby Cass Park.

Trump said he was working with the pharmaceutical companies to bring drug prices down from $100 to just $10, but then failed to explain how he would do that.
He claimed energy prices would also come down dramatically now that he and his administration deposed former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, although that has drawn skepticism from industry experts. 
The president also again targeted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to lower interest rates at a faster pace. On Friday, the Justice Department served Powell with a grand jury subpoena and threatened a criminal indictment over renovation projects at the Fed’s offices in Washington, D.C. 
Powell has said the renovations were not the reason for the subpoena, but instead “a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

To that end, Trump called Powell “a jerk” who will be gone soon. He said he wanted, instead, someone in the position that when the economy produces good news, they move to lower interest rates. That assessment comes amid bipartisan criticism of the probe, seen by many as an intimidation tactic meant to curb the independence of the Fed.
Trump also touched on various aspects of auto industry policy he would like to see changed soon, including emissions and fuel economy standards that have safeguarded the environment for decades. 
Trump veers into vitriol against Democrats, those who oppose him
He also insinuated that Democrats were “evil” for their preoccupation on fighting his other policies as the economy turns around, including his immigration strategies, which have caused non-criminal immigrants being targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Harping on an old theme of Trump’s domestic policy, he again claimed that the immigrants targeted by ICE were all addicts, drug dealers and people released from jails, prisons and mental institutions.
Trump particularly focused on Somalis and African Muslims living in the U.S., mocking U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was born in Somalia, calling her “a total scam artist.”
“They’re so bad for our country,” Trump said.
He added that he has a plan to denaturalize Somalian American citizens who his administration accuses of fraud, adding fuel to the fire conservative pundits and bloggers have fanned against Somali citizens in Minnesota.
Democrats of all stripes decry Trump’s address, economic policies
A counterbalance to Trump’s claims that tariffs were working and were good for the American auto industry — and by proxy Michigan and the city of Detroit — came from Mary Buchzeig, the CEO of Lucerne International, who said that one thing that the American public needs to know about Trump’s policies is that a tariff is, indeed, a tax on them.
She said that in the short term, Trump’s tariff policies might help boost the economy, but will ultimately make the nation and Michigan uncompetitive in the long run.
Democrats across the state and nation have called Trump onto the carpet as the economy still lags and he intensifies brutal immigration crackdowns in major metropolises.
“Trump’s speech showed just how out-of-touch he is with reality, claiming that affordability is ‘fake’ as Michiganders have less money in their pocketbooks because of the Republicans’ price-hiking agenda,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Livi Teitel, communications coordinator for Progress Michigan, said Trump’s decision to speak to Detroit business leaders was likely in an attempt to “con them into supporting his economic agenda as he lies about its impact. But here’s the truth: as Trump’s agenda gets implemented, the affordability crisis in this state is only getting worse. Rising health care costs, the impact of tariffs, and cutting food assistance from families in need are making Michiganders rightfully angry, all while the president calls this affordability crisis a hoax.”
Teitel added that it was fitting that Trump spoke to business leaders at an exclusive, swanky event while “the rich are getting richer and everyone else is hanging on by a thread.”
“Let’s also not forget that the last time the Detroit Economic Club hosted the president, he insulted our beautiful city,” Teitel said. “Detroiters don’t want to hear from this twice-impeached bully any longer –– Trump needs to get out of this city faster than a jerk driver flying down the Lodge.”
Katie Smith, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Trump’s message to Detroiters had elements that Michigan Republicans will be forced to answer for in November: “reckless tariffs raising costs and killing Michigan jobs, devastating Medicaid cuts ripping away health care from nearly 260,000 Michiganders, and everything from groceries to health care getting more expensive.”
Smith specifically called out Republican U.S. Reps. Tom Barrett of Charlotte and Bill Huizenga of Zeeland, as well as candidates Mike Bouchard Jr., Robert Lulgjuraj and Amir Hassan, saying they will “own this expensive and chaotic agenda and they will lose because Michiganders have had enough.”
This is a developing story and will be updated.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)The career prosecutor overseeing the sprawling federal investigation into social program fraud in Minnesota resigned abruptly this week.
First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson was one of at least six senior lawyers to leave the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota on Tuesday, according to the New York Times and other outlets.
Thompson was the top lieutenant of Daniel N. Rosen, an appointee of President Donald Trump. He served as the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota last year before Rosen’s confirmation.
The exodus follows reports that the U.S. Department of Justice was scrutinizing the political activity of the woman killed last Wednesday by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The New York Times reported on Monday that federal investigators sought to uncover links between Renee Good, her wife Becca Good, and “activist groups” pushing back on perceived overreach by federal law enforcement agencies.
Trump on Sunday called the women “professional agitators,” according to the Times. Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier referred to Renee Nicole Good as a “terrorist.”
Elsewhere, at least four senior leaders in the Washington office of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division have resigned. Those departures, which hollowed out the top ranks of the Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, represented “the most significant mass resignation” at DOJ since early last year, MS Now reported Monday.
For years, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, Thompson led the far-reaching federal investigation into widespread fraud that siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars out of multiple federal and state social programs. His investigation into what’s become broadly known as Feeding Our Future — intended to feed hungry children during the pandemic —  brought its first charges in 2022 and eventually ensnared more than 70 defendants. State auditors say the scheme cost taxpayers around $250 million.
Thompson’s influence has grown in recent years after high-profile raids, indictments and convictions, including an attempt to bribe a juror during the first Feeding Our Future trial. He’s used his significant platform and reputation as a career prosecutor to call attention to the widespread fraud of Minnesota’s safety net.
Trump then amplified the steady drip of fraud-related news out of Minnesota. Last month, Trump called the state a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.” He has repeatedly singled out members of its Somali-American community, most of whom are U.S. citizens.
At a Dec. 18 press conference, Thompson said fraud in state-run Medicaid programs likely exceeds $9 billion. Thompson did not provide direct evidence for that claim, which Gov. Tim Walz called “sensationalized” at a news conference the following day.
At the news conference, Walz acknowledged that social program fraud was a problem in Minnesota but suggested Thompson was part of Trump’s campaign to punish a state that voted against him three times. Multiple federal agencies have since suspended billions in congressionally-mandated aid to Minnesota.
“They’re going to continue to come up with numbers that don’t have it there, and it’s sensationalized. I don’t expect anything different from this administration,” said Walz, who at the time was running for a third term as governor.
Walz dropped out of the race earlier this month, two days before Good’s killing.
The Democratic-Farmer-Labor governor praised Thompson Tuesday on X: “Joe is a principled public servant who spent more than a decade achieving justice for Minnesotans. This is a huge loss for our state.”
On Tuesday, the turmoil in the Minnesota Office of U.S. Attorney appeared to have little effect on the 2,000-plus federal immigration agents on the ground in Minnesota. A video shared on social media by independent journalist Amanda Moore showed multiple agents arresting a woman after pulling her out of a vehicle and cutting her seatbelt.
The woman said she was driving to a doctor’s appointment, according to Moore.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P1241778-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 15:58:42.497554

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A new law that could have injected politics into the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for health improvement initiatives is unconstitutional, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
In an 8-1 decision, the state’s highest court struck down House Bill 2783. The measure, which became law in 2025 without Gov. Kevin Stitt’s signature, would have let Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust board members be removed at will and sought to limit them to a seven-year term.
The seven board members are appointed by the governor, treasurer, state superintendent, attorney general, state auditor, the House speaker and Senate president pro tem, and serve staggered seven-year terms. 
The Oklahoma Supreme Court found the new law affects TSET’s independence by making tenures on the board dependent on the goodwill of the appointing authority.
“There is no law authorizing this statutory change to the constitutional language,” said the order written by Vice-Chief Justice Dana Kuehn.
Oklahoma voters in 2000 approved State Question 692, a constitutional amendment to create TSET. The entity oversees nearly $2 billion in earnings from the master settlement agreement with tobacco companies to recoup medical costs associated with tobacco use.
Creators of TSET sought to protect the funds from legislative diversion, and placed them in a trust with the earnings going toward improving health as determined by TSET.
Legislators in 2025 sought to overhaul the board’s appointment lengths  after TSET declined to immediately allocate $50 million requested by lawmakers for a University of Oklahoma children’s pediatric hospital in Oklahoma City.
TSET’s governing panel in July filed suit, challenging the law’s constitutionality. The Oklahoma Supreme Court  put it on hold.
“We are pleased that the Supreme Court agreed that Oklahomans voted to protect the nearly $2 billion of Oklahoma’s share of the tobacco settlement a quarter of a century ago and that the legislature cannot override the Constitution,” said Bob Burke, a TSET attorney.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said he was disappointed in the decision, but he respected it.
“Lawmakers acted with the intent of ensuring greater accountability and transparency over how public dollars are used, particularly given the significant size and importance of the TSET fund,” Paxton said. “While today’s ruling limits legislative authority in this instance, it does not end the conversation. As legislators, we want to ensure greater input and oversight of these funds continue to be used in the best interests of Oklahomans.”
Justice Travis Jett issued the dissent, saying a district court should have decided the case.

He is alleged to have broken into the building before dawn Saturday and to have doused a lobby in gasoline before setting it on fire. The blaze charred parts of the building and left smoke damage throughout.
The Hinds County Circuit Court indictment was announced Tuesday, a day after Pittman’s federal arson charges were filed. While the federal government has not so far filed hate-crime charges against Pittman, the Hinds County indictment recommends that if he is convicted, his sentence be enhanced under a Mississippi law punishing “offenses committed for discriminatory reasons.”

The state charges for arson of a place of worship carry a prison sentence of five to 30 years, as well as restitution for damages caused by the arson.
A Hinds County press release announcing the indictment says that because it “alleges the offence was motivated by hate,” Mississippi law allows enhanced punishment, including up to 60 years in prison, double the term otherwise permitted by law. 
In an unusual move for local law enforcement, Pittman did not make an initial appearance in Jackson municipal court before his case was taken to a grand jury Monday.
The Hinds County indictment did not include a photograph of Pittman. Federal authorities also have not released a photo of him.
Pittman remained hospitalized Monday and his first appearance in federal court was done by video conference. He was accompanied by a federal public defender and at times appeared to be leaning back in a chair, gazing away from the camera. Both his hands were heavily bandaged. 
The prosecutor, Matt Allen, moved to have Pittman detained as he awaits trial. Pittman is scheduled to be released from the hospital Wednesday and to return to federal court for a preliminary hearing Jan. 20. 
If convicted on the federal charges, Pittman faces five to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. 
The predawn fire Saturday was set in the same part of the one-story brick building that Ku Klux Klan members bombed in 1967 because the congregation’s rabbi supported civil rights.

Federal investigators alleged in an affidavit that Pittman sent text messages to his father in the course of setting the fire on Saturday. The father pleaded for his son to return home, the affidavit says, but Pittman “replied back by saying he was due for a homerun and ‘I did my research.’” 
His father later contacted the FBI and provided GPS data showing Pittman was at the synagogue early Saturday morning. 
The son “laughed as he told his father what he did and said he finally got them,” says the affidavit from Nicholas Amiano, an FBI agent in Jackson. 
State leaders have condemned the attack, and the news also reverberated internationally. Harmeet Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, wrote on X that she was “personally involved and my team is in touch with the US Attorney’s office locally.”
Other officials who publicly condemned the attack include the Democratic leaders in Congress, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. 
On Monday, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi called on the FBI to investigate the incident as a federal hate crime.
In a news release Monday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called the attack a “disgusting act of anti-Semitic violence,” but did not say whether federal prosecutors would seek to charge Pittman with a hate crime. 
“I have directed my prosecutors to seek severe penalties for this heinous act and remain deeply committed to protecting Jewish Americans from hatred,” Bondi said.

Senate Bill 21 passed the chamber 37-11 and now heads to the Indiana House.
The measure was originally authored by former Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, who left the Senate last week to join the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. The bill is now carried by Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Goshen. Zay introduced similar legislation unsuccessfully in the 2023 session.
Doriot told colleagues that pork is a staple Indiana commodity.
“Pork is a major product in the state of Indiana,” he said. “I would like for all of you to please all get a little pork in your campaign and celebrate Indiana’s state sandwich.”

Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, said he was conflicted — joking that beef producers could be the real losers.
“This campaign — I think there could be a conspiracy going on here with the pork industry against the cattle farmers,” Byrne said, drawing laughter from the Senate chamber. “I’m just a little concerned that our beef farmers are going to have a real problem with this. I’m probably going to support the bill, though.”
Byrne also referenced Zay’s repeated attempts to move the bill.
“Sen. Zay wasn’t able to get it done,” he quipped, “but Sen. Doriot is getting it done.”
But Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton, said northwest Indiana residents may have other priorities.
“Being from The Region, I’ve got to say it — the Italian beef is king of northwest Indiana,” Pol said. “I will support the bill, but know, if you come to northwest Indiana, you better get Italian beef. … I think we might be here in a couple years reassessing this vote.”
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, nodded to the state sandwich bill’s original sponsor, former Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, by placing Zay’s picture on his chair in the Senate chamber. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Sen. Daryl Schmitt, R-Jasper, rose to defend another protein.
“I am a lifelong farmer in the poultry industry,” said Schmitt, who has raised turkeys in southern Indiana for decades. “Pork kind of stole the ‘other white meat,’ and I wanted to make sure everybody understood that turkey is the real white meat.”
He, too, still supported the bill.
“I am not going to be chicken — I am going to move this bill along,” Doriot said in his closing remarks. “I support the beef industry. I support poultry. And I appreciate your vote.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Vermont has received a nearly $13 million federal grant to strengthen its child care and pre-Kindergarten programs, among other early childhood services, officials said Monday.
The grant comes from the Preschool Development Grant Birth Through Five program in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has supported parts of Vermont’s early childhood landscape for a decade, advocates said. This year’s award is the largest one-time amount the state has received.

It’s a separate award from the regular $28 million in funding that Vermont receives via the federal Child Care and Development Fund, monies President Donald Trump’s administration sought to withhold from five Democratic-led states this month. Vermont Department for Children and Families Deputy Commissioner Janet McLaughlin said Monday that the state has not received such warnings, though a memo last week increased her team’s reporting requirements when accessing the funds.
Both the application process and the birth-through-five grant itself were much more compressed than usual, according to Morgan Crossman, the executive director of the childhood policy nonprofit Building Bright Futures.
“Generally, these grants take three months to write,” she said. “We wrote it in six days.”
A 12-month clock for the funding means that the state will be without the standard window for planning and engaging contractors, Crossman added. Nonetheless, she called the funding “critical” in a year where state lawmakers face especially tough budgeting decisions.
This new allocation will help Vermont build child care capacity, improve data management and facilitate cooperation between state agencies, advocates, and local providers, according to McLaughlin.
“We’re thrilled to have these resources right now,” said McLaughlin, adding that her team was working with “urgency and focus” to “draw down every dollar that we can.”
The grant comes in a period of fast change for Vermont’s child care ecosystem. The 2023 passage of Act 76 allowed thousands of kids to newly enroll in the state’s expanded child care tuition assistance program, and over 100 new care providers have launched statewide.
But aside from these central investments, McLaughlin said there was a “long list of projects” that could continue to expand and improve the state’s care offerings for young children and families.
Two priorities will be ensuring that child care providers have the business planning assistance necessary to survive or expand, and developing a workforce in Vermont that keeps pace with the industry’s expansion, McLaughlin said.
The state’s focus on workforce will include improvements to data and technology. The grant will allow the state to update its fingerprint-supported background-check system, delays in which have caused years of headaches for child care providers. The upgrades should “dramatically reduce the turnaround times” for checks, McLaughlin said. 
Crossman said sharing information effectively between agencies and providers improves the experience of individual families, and also allows her team to do its job monitoring progress in areas like child care coverage, literacy and use of public aid programs. Vermont’s Early Childhood Data and Policy Center, a division of Crossman’s organization, is tasked with making data-based childhood policy recommendations to lawmakers based on such information.
“We’re making sure that we’re centralizing data and making it publicly available,” Crossman said.

Larry Alley studied information about food assistance program error rates at a Tuesday meeting of the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas legislative committee focused on government efficiency on Tuesday questioned why it was taking a state agency so long to implement a waiver that bans people from buying soda or candy with food assistance. 
The state is as much as 18 months away from implementing the ban, which would affect recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollars, according to testimony from Carla Whiteside-Hicks, DCF director of economic and employment services,  to the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency.
The answer did not please committee members. 
Chairwoman Renee Erickson, R-Wichita, said all the states around Kansas put the waiver in place in less than a year, and she couldn’t understand what was taking DCF so long. 
“We are an island,” she said. 
Whiteside-Hicks said a lack of employees specialized in implementation of a waiver of this complexity has slowed DCF down. She said DCF put out a Request for Proposals to hire a consultant to coordinate communications with retailers and recipients and overall implementation.
DCF applied for the waiver in May, and Whiteside-Hicks said she updated the application with more detailed information Monday. 
Although the state projected it would take 18 months to implement the waiver once the federal government approves it, Whiteside-Hicks said it could be completed more quickly. She said Kansas DCF employees are working with other states that have implemented the waiver to make their processes more efficient. 
 
SNAP error rate
The committee also asked Whiteside-Hicks about DCF’s error rate, which could potentially cost the state as much as $41 million if it doesn’t drop below 6%.
In the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the federal government stipulated that states reporting an error rate above 6% would share administrative costs with the federal government.
For federal fiscal year 2025, the Kansas SNAP error rate was 9.13%, Whiteside-Hicks said. It was 5.5% for the month of August, a reflection of measures taken to lower the rate, she said. 
“We have been addressing this. We knew what the federal threshold was,” Whiteside-Hicks said, noting the goal before passage of the new law had always been error rates below 6%. “When this legislation was passed, it caused us to double down on some of the things we were doing.” 
DCF hired a consultant to help with the process of determining the best ways to lower the error rate, she said.  
The state can use its FFY 2025 or FFY 2026 error rate to determine whether it will need to kick in for administrative costs, Whiteside-Hicks said. The focus is on lowering it this year to avoid the federal cost-share, she said.

Appeal on SNAP data
In other SNAP news, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly challenged the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s request for SNAP data Monday, calling the agency’s failure to directly acknowledge questionable legalities around how the information will be used “brazen.” 
“USDA seeks to change federal legislation with the following argument: ‘Ignore what we said.  Trust us,’” the state said in its latest filing in an appeals case before the USDA’s Appeals Board. “When this Board considers that the confidential information of thousands of Kansans and tens of millions of dollars are at stake, ‘Trust us’ simply will not suffice.”
The state has refused to turn over personal data of Kansans who apply or receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program since May, asserting that part of the USDA’s intent to use the data would violate the Food Nutrition Act and Kansas Cybersecurity Act. 
“USDA’s data demand is unlawful because Routine Use 8 intends to use SNAP benefit applicant data outside permissible (Food and Nutrition Act) purposes,” the filing said. “USDA does not deny this.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen-Alley-20260113_094232-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 15:58:42.497554

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Planned Parenthood of Utah has announced it’s restarting low-cost or free services for eligible patients now that previously frozen funding has been restored. 
As of Monday, low-income Utahns can again qualify for no or very-low-cost care at Planned Parenthood health centers across Utah for family planning services like birth control, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and cancer screenings. 
The services under the Title X Family Planning Program have resumed in the state after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Population Affairs — which administered the program — informed the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah on Dec. 19 that the grant funding would be restored. 
Planned Parenthood of Utah shutting down 2 clinics amid Trump funding freeze

Friday, Planned Parenthood of Utah received $2 million in Title X funding for the current grant year that had been withheld since April 2025, when President Donald Trump’s administration froze the funding, including $2.8 million in grants that Utah clinics relied on. 
Due to that freeze, Planned Parenthood of Utah announced it would be shutting down two clinics in Logan and St. George and increasing fees. Those rural clinics remain closed. 
Not all of the funding has been restored, though. The grant authorized last week distributed $2 million, down from $2.8 million Utah received in 2024. 
Title X is the nation’s only federal program dedicated to providing affordable birth control, cancer screenings, and other sexual and reproductive health care to people with low incomes. Federal law prohibits Title X funds from being spent on abortions. 
Shireen Ghorbani, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, issued a statement praising the restored funding but expressing frustration with the damage that has been done due to the frozen funding. 
“We are thrilled that Title X funding is restored to Utah for now, allowing more Utahns to get critical family planning services, such as birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing, that they otherwise could not afford,” she said. “But we cannot ignore the fact that too many Utahns have already felt the devastating effects of the Trump administration’s unwarranted decision to withhold this funding for the last nine months.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ghorbani said many of the 26,000 Utahns who rely on the program were “forced to pay more for their health care or go without care altogether.” 
“And because of the Trump administration’s attack on this critical program, PPAU was forced to close two health centers, leaving the communities of St. George and Logan without access to the care we provided there for decades,” she said. 
Ghorbani also warned that a cloud of uncertainty remains over future grant money.
“While this funding is restored for now, there is no guarantee that it will continue,” she said. “We do not know if we will receive the grant this year or ever again – or what other attacks on sexual and reproductive health this administration may impose.”
Still Ghorbani said Planned Parenthood Association of Utah will continue to work to provide affordable health care to Utahns in need. 
“At Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, we believe that everyone deserves affordable, accessible health care,” she said. “While the Trump administration is willing to play politics with your health, we remain firm in our commitment to deliver high-quality, affordable reproductive care for the people in our communities — no matter what. Our doors are open — still — and we look forward to continuing to serve patients in Utah.”

This story was originally reported by Lauren Nutall of The 19th.  Meet Lauren and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A federal judge has blocked efforts by the Trump administration to curb diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within Head Start early child care programs, which included attempts to revoke funding from providers who use words like “women” and “race” on grant applications.
Wednesday’s temporary injunction, which also prevented mass layoffs for the program, is the latest development in a legal battle between Head Start programs and the Trump administration, as the president continues his attempts to erase DEI and accessibility measures across federally supported programs.
In December, Head Start providers and two advocacy groups said in a court filing that the Trump administration had threatened to withhold funding for Head Start programs that use certain language — including words like “race,” “bias,” and “equitable” — on grant applications.
Plaintiffs, including Head Start programs in Pennsylvania, Washington, Wisconsin and Illinois, argue that the removal of DEI initiatives and inclusive language is contradictory to Head Start’s mission.
The ban on language “that they have been trying to implement really is contrary to what the Head Start providers are required to do under federal law, under the Head Start Act,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, which filed the lawsuit.
In May, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined his plans to preserve Head Start programs in a letter to congressional lawmakers, assuring that they would receive funding as long as they remained “consistent with Administration priorities” — as the administration was cracking down on DEI measures. This promise came after a leaked HHS budget draft reportedly suggested eliminating program funding altogether amid extreme health cuts.
The administration’s attempts to restrict Head Start have faced previous setbacks in the courts. In September, a judge ruled that HHS could not exclude families from receiving Head Start services on account of their immigration status.
For more than 60 years, Head Start has served economically disadvantaged families, disproportionately  Black or Latinx. Trump’s proposed conditions for funding will affect program directors’ ability to adequately serve these communities, particularly people with disabilities.
Calvo-Friedman shared that one Head Start Director in Washington was forced to remove from a grant proposal a plan to provide educators specialized training in teaching children diagnosed with autism. Children with autism account for at least 10 percent of the kids the director serves.
“The director of the program was like, ‘I need my teachers to have training in this so that these kids can be able to get equal access to education’ and they put that in their grant application and were told that they had to take it out,” Calvo-Friedman said. “And so I think it creates this absurd situation where it’s like, how do you serve kids with disabilities if you can’t use the word disability?”
The administration’s efforts could significantly undermine the program, which already faced a major setback in November during the federal government funding freeze when it was forced to close sites in 17 states and Puerto Rico.
“It would be absolutely devastating on children, on families and on the economics in entire communities,” Calvo-Friedman said. “For children, it would mean immediate loss of early childhood education, which has been shown to be critical in being ready for school and then having opportunities to succeed for the rest of their life in the future because they were able to be prepared to succeed in school. So it really would be cutting off opportunities to children.”
The program can also provide critical support for parents, who especially in rural areas may lack other options for child care, Calvo-Friedman said.
“What they’re trying to do by making it impossible for Head Start programs to do what they’re legally required to do is one, make it more difficult to run the program,” Calvo-Friedman said, “but two, erase entire communities from those that are being served.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)ABLE NH, a New Hampshire-based disability advocacy organization, is planning a vigil on the State House lawn in Concord Saturday to honor people who died within New Hampshire’s intellectual and developmental disability care system.
In November, the Bulletin published a series of articles uncovering systemic abuse and neglect — sometimes fatal — occurring in New Hampshire’s state-funded and state-directed disability care system. Those articles told the stories of Stephen Weidlich Jr., who was found dead in the snow behind the Allenstown house where he lived with his caretaker in 2022, and Christine Marie Bill, who was found dead in 2019 after several hours left unattended in a hot car in Andover, among others.
“Reporting by the NH Bulletin has brought forward painful truths about abuse, neglect, and loss within New Hampshire’s developmental disability system,” ABLE NH wrote on Facebook announcing the vigil. “These are not just stories. Stephen and Christine were real people. They had names, families, and lives that mattered.”
The vigil is scheduled for 4:30 to 5 p.m. Saturday.
“Disability is not the problem,” ABLE NH continued. “The problem is systems that fail to protect people and communities that do not always see what is happening. People with disabilities are leaders, neighbors, and valued members of our communities.”
ABLE NH also described the vigil as a “call to action.”
State Sen. David Rochefort told the Bulletin in late December he plans to file a late bill aimed at preventing abuse and neglect in New Hampshire’s disability care system. Additionally, the Disability Rights Center-NH is conducting an investigation into the system with the goal of creating specific recommendations for reform.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ablevigil-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 15:58:42.497554

Brandon Steele, R-Raleigh, last month.
John K. Jordan, a Republican, has served as the lead pastor at the Calvary Assembly of God, in Beckley, West Virginia, since 1998. He also works as the assistant superintendent for the Appalachian Network Council of the Assemblies of God, sits on the Board of Trustees for Southeastern University in Florida and is a faculty member at the Appalachian Network School of Ministry. He also holds a position on the General Presbytery of the Assemblies of God in Springfield, Missouri.
Steele, an attorney by trade, resigned from his seat in the House last month. He said his resignation was necessary due to “professional opportunities” arising that would “interfere” with his work in the House. His resignation came nearly a year after he was involved in a domestic disturbance where, according to a police report, his wife called 911 due to him drunkenly handling assault rifles and screaming at people in their neighborhood on Dec. 23, 2024. 
Steele served in the House since 2018 and previously sat as chair of the House Committee on Government Organization.
Jordan is originally from Parkersburg, according to his professional biography from the Calvary Assembly of God. According to a news release from Morrisey, Jordan holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of The Cumberlands and a Master of Science in Church Leadership from the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary.
With Jordan’s appointment, one seat remains vacant in the state House of Delegates following Del. Mike DeVault’s resignation on Monday. DeVault said he resigned after taking “careful consideration” of his “personal and professional circumstances.” One seat in the state Senate is also vacant since Sen. Donna Boley’s resignation last week. Boley, 90 years old, said she was stepping away to focus on her health and her family.

On Monday, Bachelder along with a handful of other previously detained young people testified in favor of a bill that was intended to repurpose Long Creek into a secure residential treatment facility instead of a prison.
“Each time I was released from Long Creek, there was no real treatment plan, no meaningful reentry support, and no follow up care,” Bachelder told members of the Maine Legislature’s Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. “I was sent home and expected to do better, with the same trauma, the same addiction issues, and the same lack of support I had before.”
Bachelder said he was denied phone calls, showers and, on one occasion, he was not provided a shirt for the duration of his stay until he had to be on a Zoom call. 
The fifth and final time Bachelder was in Long Creek, he was locked in his room on Christmas, unable to see his family, which he said was because of a staffing shortage, though the Department of Corrections did not respond for a request to comment on the account. When Bachelder finally sought treatment for addiction outside of the detention center, he never went back.
“The problem was not that I was incapable of change, the problem was that Long Creek was not designed to help me change,” Bachelder said.
“This bill matters because it recognizes that youth incarceration should not function like a prison, and that young people need mental health care, substance use treatment, education and real re-entry planning.”
The bill, LD 1923, was originally proposed by Rep. Mike Brennan (D-Portland) last year to fund the rehabilitation of Long Creek, which has been repeatedly sued for a lack of adequate services amid allegations of abuse — including violence, denial of services and excessive isolation — against the young people detained there.,. The same day as the public hearing on Monday, a longtime guard at the facility was found guilty of assaulting a 16-year-old resident.
“What we have seen over the years is that kids get detained and then we can’t get them out because we don’t have the necessary community-based services to keep everybody safe,” said Edwin Chester, a juvenile defense lawyer, in his testimony supporting the bill.
“The longer you take them out of their community, the harder it is for them to integrate,” Chester said.
Besides the evidence-based reasons to keep young people out of unnecessary incarceration, part of the argument behind repurposing Long Creek is the consistent underutilization of the facility, Brennan said. The South Portland facility currently holds about 50 young people, but was built to detain about 300. 
The Maine Department of Corrections opposed the original bill, “because what it sought to do was not workable,” said Jill O’Brien, the department’s director of government affairs. The funding allocated in the original bill would not have been enough to redesign the building to be a secure residential recovery program as proposed, she said.
After working with the department, Brennan on Monday presented what he described as a compromise — an amendment that proposes a working group to study the various options to repurposing the facility. The department supported the amendment, with O’Brien telling the committee, “we agree the state should examine the feasibility and cost of making changes to the existing facilities at Long Creek that will continue to improve and normalize the environment.”
Some advocates expressed concern that the intent of the bill had changed, saying a study would delay the much-needed redevelopment of the detention facility, which numerous people and organizations at the hearing were advocating for.
“We definitely want changes at Long Creek, but we are tired of studies,” said Jan Collins, assistant director of the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition. “Report after report has outlined the need to provide services for children in the community as an alternative to incarceration. Why, after spending tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on outside evaluations, have we not closed Long Creek?”
In 2024, the Legislature gave preliminary backing to a proposal to allocate $20 million to enhance support services for at-risk youth in an effort to avoid involvement with the criminal justice system — but the bill eventually died because it was not funded in the budget. 
Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland) sponsored that bill as well as another in 2021 that was vetoed by Gov. Janet Mills, which would have closed the facility and instead fund community-based programs and services, such as job training, mental health support and housing. At the time, the governor said closing Long Creek without an alternative plan was “fundamentally flawed.”
“Long Creek is a very harmful place, and it’s counterproductive to any rehabilitation efforts to get youth on their feet and be successful,” Lookner said, expressing disappointment over Brennan’s amendment. 
But he noted that the original bill faced an uphill battle, even if the majority of the committee supported it.
“As long as the governor is who the governor currently is, I don’t see much hope for the Department of Corrections changing its tune on Long Creek,” Lookner said.“There’s always hope that the new governor coming into Augusta will be more supportive of closing or repurposing Long Creek.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0917-scaled-e1768336449230-1024x587.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 15:58:42.497554

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After unsuccessfully backing a Catholic charter school, an Oklahoma board will “more than likely” have to deny a proposal to found another publicly funded religious charter school in the state.
The Statewide Charter School Board is expected to vote next month on a Jewish charter school’s application for approval.
Chairperson Brian Shellem said the state board is legally bound to obey an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling that rejected opening a religious charter school with taxpayer funds. A deadlocked U.S. Supreme Court let the state-level ruling stand. 
That means, “we will more than likely have to deny their application,” Shellem said, though he suggested the school could do an “outstanding job” academically. 
If rejected, the school founders would have an opportunity to reapply a second and final time.
Shellem said he expects the founders also might file a lawsuit if denied.
“I would not be shocked or surprised if this ignites another legal battle,” Shellem said. “So regardless of whatever happens, I really do believe our board would be sued no matter what.”

Ben Gamla would provide an education that is “intellectually rigorous and deeply rooted in Jewish knowledge, values and lived tradition,” according to its application. 
Each employee, though allowed to have different religious beliefs, would be considered a “servant of the Jewish faith” and would be expected to “uphold the standards of the Jewish tradition in their day-to-day work and personal lives,” the application states.
A Florida charter school founder and former Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Deutsch said he is committed to making Ben Gamla a success in Oklahoma. 
“This is something that’s been in my head for at least 10 years, if not longer, and I think the opportunity is probably the best in Oklahoma of any state in the United States of America today,” Deutsch said when presenting to the state board on Monday.
Brett Farley, who sat on the board of the now-defunct Catholic charter school, is also listed among the founding board members for the Jewish school.

The application promises a K-12 online-based education with rigorous academics. Ben Gamla, named for a high priest in Israel 2,000 years ago, also would provide instruction in Jewish religion, culture, values, rituals, texts, holidays and practices.
Like Deutsch’s secular Ben Gamla charter schools in Florida, the Oklahoma school would teach Hebrew classes. Deutsch said the Oklahoma school, though bearing a similar name, is an entirely separate organization from his Florida charter school network.
While presenting to the statewide board, Deutsch said the online school would be open to students of any background. He said he first visited Oklahoma a few years ago to explore the possibility of founding a school and visited with about 20 people, including 10 Jewish parents.
“My sense of talking to parents was there are a lot of parents that are looking for a sort of a faith-based, rigorous academic program, but there was nothing there,” Deutsch said.
State law and recent court precedent don’t allow charter schools, or any public school, in Oklahoma to adopt a particular religion. No existing charter schools in the state emphasize the Hebrew language or Judaic studies as Ben Gamla would, though multiple synagogues and Jewish community centers in Tulsa and Oklahoma City do.
An estimated 8,900 Jewish people live in Oklahoma, or .22% of the state’s total population.
The Ben Gamla application proposes opening later this year with a goal year-one enrollment of 400 students K-12. Its goal enrollment is 1,150 students in five years.
During Deutsch’s presentation, Shellem brought up the “elephant in the room” — why apply for approval after the board’s experience with St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School? Deutsch gave a succinct response.
“We have presented an application for you that we believe meets and exceeds all of your criteria,” Deutsch said. “And so, we expect and hope that you’re going to approve that application.”
The statewide board isn’t interested in “paying for Sunday school,” Shellem said after the meeting Monday. Rather, the board is hunting for charters that would produce strong academic results.
“I believe the Ben Gamla school could deliver that,” he said. “I think St. Isidore could have delivered that. And we are going to be bound by the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling no matter what, and we will comply with those orders. But, I think it’s unfortunate that we have to potentially deny schools that are highly qualified that could do an outstanding job for students in the areas of mathematics, science, reading (and) literature because of their desire to teach a religious component.”

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners is now being sued for soliciting complaints about teachers who made negative public comments about Charlie Kirk in the wake of the conservative activist’s death last fall.
Teachers Katherine Mejia of Manchester and Jennifer Smith of Johnston are suing the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners and its executive director, Michael Cavin, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit challenges Cavin’s written solicitation of professional licensing complaints related to the shooting death of Kirk in September 2025. That solicitation, the teachers argue, resulted in complaints of unethical conduct filed against them by their employers. The lawsuit alleges the actions of Cavin and the board have violated the teachers’ First Amendment right to comment on matters of public concern.

Several other lawsuits have been filed by Iowa educators, a public defender and a paramedic, all of whom allege they were fired or sanctioned for online comments posted in the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s death. Those lawsuits have focused on the actions of the employers, while Mejia’s and Smith’s lawsuit targets the state licensing board and its executive director.
Mejia’s post: Kirk was not a hero or martyr
Mejia is a counselor for the West Delaware Community School District near Manchester, and Smith is a high school family and consumer sciences teacher for the Johnston Community School District.
The lawsuit alleges that on Sept. 10, 2025, while Mejia was on district-approved leave, she used her own personal device to repost another individual’s Facebook post concerning human trafficker and child-sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and President Donald Trump. The post indicated that anyone who still supported Trump was either a pedophile or was “OK with it happening.”
The lawsuit indicates Mejia also “made another post” concerning Kirk that stated, “Let’s make one thing clear from the start: Charlie Kirk was the victim of a shooting in a country where he, along with other right-wing extremist influencers, have been inciting violence for years. KIRK IS NEITHER A MARTYR NOR A HERO. HE IS A CAUSE!”
According to the lawsuit, one person complained to the West Delaware Community School District about the Epstein-Trump post and, the next day, one person complained about the Kirk-related post.
Superintendent Jen Vance told Mejia that the second complainant intended to call U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley’s office to complain about the Kirk-related post, according to the lawsuit. On Sept. 16, 2025, Vance issued a letter of reprimand to Mejia, claiming  Mejia had made the post during work hours and asserting that Mejia should “exercise professional discretion when engaging in any online activity.”
Three days after Vance resolved the matter with a reprimand, the lawsuit claims, Vance and other superintendents around Iowa received a letter from Cavin, on board letterhead, referencing educators’ “comments regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk” and stating that “administrators are encouraged to file a complaint with the board.” Cavin’s letter then went on to specify the precise regulatory violations to be cited in such a complaint.
Because of Cavin’s letter, the lawsuit claims, Vance submitted a complaint to the board concerning Mejia’s online posts.
Smith’s post: Kirk was a ‘monster’ who spread hate
The lawsuit alleges that on Sept. 11, 2025, Smith was at home, after work, when she posted a message to Facebook using her personal device. The post was about comments that Kirk had made prior to his death, and stated: “Words below are from the one that suddenly died due to gun violence. That one death flies our flags at half-staff, and yet time and again children and school staff (who) are constantly dying just because they were doing their jobs for the betterment of society are not honored nor barely remembered. There was a school shooting on this same day. Did you know that?”
Attached to Smith’s post was an image with the words: “We remember the things he said about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: ‘MLK was awful. He’s not a good person.’ We remember his calculation on gun violence: ‘I think it’s worth … some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.’ These are not the words of healing, not the words of unity. And yet they, too, are part of the ledger he leaves behind.”
According to the lawsuit, Smith also wrote on Facebook: “RIP you monster. I’m so sure your god is fine with the awful spread of hate you completed while here on earth.”
The following day, the lawsuit alleges, Smith’s associate principal called her out of class to discuss the post, saying that there had been “a couple of calls” to the district about it. Later that day, a human resources employee called Smith at home to report that a school board member had been called about the post, adding that Smith should take down the post if she did not want her next workday interrupted. Smith then deleted the post, the lawsuit claims.
No further action was taken in the matter, the lawsuit alleges, until after Cavin’s letter was sent out, after which Superintendent Nikki Roorda called Smith to her office and stated that the board had put out a directive about posts concerning Charlie Kirk.
Roorda then filed a complaint with the board about Smith’s post, court records show.
Reynolds demands firings, objects to ‘shutting down free speech’
The lawsuit notes that members of the Board of Educational Examiners are appointees of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds and that the director of the Iowa Department of Education, McKenzie Snow, is a former Trump administration official appointed by Reynolds. Cavin, in turn, was appointed by Snow, the lawsuit notes.
In the aftermath of Kirk’s killing, Reynolds publicly stated that “anybody that celebrates the execution of a human being, it’s disgusting and unconscionable and it’s just not acceptable. Political violence should never be accepted, period. Period. End of story. And if we have discovered through the investigation that (school employees) did, in fact, celebrate taking another human life — you know, shutting down free speech — then they should, they should be fired. And we’ll wait and see what happens, but they should be fired. It has a chilling effect on those that don’t — you know, it says, ‘If you don’t agree with what I agree on, then you’re going to be silenced.’ So it’s unacceptable, just unacceptable.”
In addition, Republican Sen. Lynn Evans and Rep. Taylor Collins sent a letter to the Iowa Board of Regents urging the termination of any employees who made public comments celebrating the death of Kirk.
Another Republican, House Speaker Pat Grassley, stated that public school teachers who commented on Kirk’s death should be fired, adding that “individuals with this depravity cannot continue to hold a position with any level of influence over our children… If appropriate action is not taken, you can trust that the Iowa House Government Oversight Committee will address this issue and take action to root out this hate from our schools.”
Lawsuit: Online comments are protected ‘political speech’
“Mejia’s and Smith’s Facebook comments are classic, protected, personal and political speech,” the lawsuit asserts. It claims Cavin’s letter represents “viewpoint discrimination” against those who don’t share Kirk’s political views and that it “threatened public school administrators, who are also licensed by the BOEE, for failure to engage in viewpoint discrimination against other licensed educators who had views adverse to Charlie Kirk.”
The lawsuit alleges Cavin asserts he has the authority to discipline a licensee unilaterally, without a hearing, and can revoke any license issued by the board. Mejia and Smith take issue with that interpretation of Cavin’s authority, but add that Cavin’s views on the matter have put them “at risk of licensure discipline or revocation without due process.”
The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order preventing the board and Cavin from taking any further action in their cases, as well as an injunction restraining Cavin and the board from discriminating against, or retaliating against, Mejia and Smith.
The lawsuit also seeks an award of punitive damages against Cavin “for his reckless disregard, if not intentional indifference, to Mejia’s and Smith’s First Amendment rights.”
Cavin and the board have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Attorney General’s Office, which defends the state in such cases, has said it does not comment on pending litigation.

Ron DeSantis giving his State-of-the-State address in the Capitol on January 13, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis spent most of his 30-minute final “State of the State” address to the Florida Legislature looking back on his seven years in office, giving minimal attention to the agenda he’s focused on during his last year in office.
“We have delivered big results, and we have set the standard for the rest of the country to follow,” he declared. “We are the free state of Florida.”
Sounding at times like he did during his presidential campaign in 2023, DeSantis cited statistics that he said evidence that Florida the envy of the nation. He compared the state favorably to cities like Chicago and San Francisco, which he claimed had been “destroyed by failed ideologies.” 
Those ideological battles continue, he added, declaring that although Americans cheered the recent removal of a “Marxist dictator in Venezuela, we saw the election of a Marxist mayor in our nation’s largest city.”
Regarding the year just passed, he said no state in the country worked more diligently with the Trump administration than Florida when it came to the president’s mass deportations of undocumented individuals.
“Florida is the only state in the country that requires state and local cooperation with federal interior enforcement efforts alone,” he said, a reference to the 2025 state law that requires all 67 sheriffs in the state to sign 287(g) agreements deputizing local officers to enforce immigration law. 
“In the past nine months alone, Florida is responsible for the apprehension of nearly 20,000 illegal aliens that have been turned over to the Department of Homeland Security to be returned to their home countries. Our people are safer because of these efforts.”
It was only at the 21-minute mark that he pivoted to discussing what he hopes the Legislature will accomplish over the next 60 days. “I’ve got a lot more in the tank, but you guys only have 60 days, and so I think it’s best we get on with it,” he said.
What he did say about the new session was how he hopes to see lawmakers provide property tax relief for homesteaded properties, a theme he and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia have been pressing throughout the state over the past half-year. Lawmakers would have to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot for any such proposal to become law.
“The Legislature has the ability to place a measure on the ballot to provide transformational relief for taxpayers,” he said. “Let’s resolve to all work together, get something done, and let the people have a say.”
He invoked “affordability,” which has become the buzz word in American politics over the past year, to boast that the Legislature has addressed the property insurance crisis in Florida, referring to the recent news that Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-backed program providing coverage to high-risk Floridians, will see their rates reduced this year by nearly 9%.
He discussed his concerns about artificial intelligence (AI), and then promoted certain bills that he says he’ll be watching that would eliminate DEI initiatives in local governments, expand Second Amendment rights, and block “the creep of Sharia Law.”
With the nation soon approaching its 250th birthday, DeSantis’ speech was replete with references to the Founding Fathers, including in his finale.
“We are the keepers of the flame of liberty that burned in Philadelphia in July of 1776,” he said. “We will not allow the flame to go out. We will answer the call. We will go forward with courage. We will take bold action. We will get the job done. God Bless the state of Florida, and God Bless these United States of America.”

Democratic response
Democratic leaders blasted DeSantis’ speech minutes after he left the House chambers.
“I don’t think he addressed the true issues that affect Floridians,” Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman told reporters, specifically referring to affordability. “We’re going to be addressing the issues that he really didn’t lay out anything for the Legislature that will help Floridians.”
“I didn’t hear too many new ideas,” added  House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell. “It sounded like he was dredging up some of his greatest hits. … There were so many quotes and weird historical references. It was kind of hard to keep track. I just expected more from the governor’s last state-of-the-state address, especially because when we’re facing an affordability crisis, how do you take the rostrum and not address the number one issues facing Floridians?”
State Rep. Michele Rayner, D-Tampa Bay, said DeSantis seemed “clearly more concerned with his political legacy than the lives of everyday Floridians.”
“While Gov. DeSantis celebrates a ‘Free State’ and talks about the 1700s and ‘societies of men,’ here in reality in 2026, people in my district feel less free than ever as they struggle with crushing food and housing costs on top of a persistent property insurance crisis,” she said in a written statement.
“Instead of truly addressing urgent issues like these, DeSantis chose to primarily focus on culture wars, political theater, and downright lies to cover up the reality of how he’s hurt our state and the people living here. Floridians deserve a leader who views service as more than a platform for personal ambition — someone who puts them first.”
Florida Democrats in the Legislature are pushing three bills as part of what they are calling their “affordability agenda.”

A “National Insurance Compact” that they claim would lower the cost of homeowners insurance by teaming up with other states to spread the risk from hurricane claims.
“The H.O.M.E. Act”  (Housing Options Made for Everyone) that they say would make sure that affordable housing stays affordable by eliminating the documentary stamp tax for certain first-time homebuyers.
A version of Florida “DOGE” that they say would end wasteful spending, corruption, and “expensive sweetheart deals the DeSantis administration has made with his donors.”

However, the Democrats’ numbers in the Legislature are still so small that it’s doubtful any of those bills will get traction. They have only 33 members in the 120-member House and just 11 members in the 40-member Senate — both constituting a super-minority status.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 15:58:42.497554

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers in the Maine House of Representatives voted to override Gov. Janet Mills’ veto on Tuesday, reiterating their desire to tweak the state’s right to repair law.
The House voted 96-44 in support of LD 1228, which would clarify certain terms, particularly in regards to cybersecurity, in the automotive right to repair law passed by citizen’s initiative in November 2023. Originally, the vast majority of the House (135-12) and Senate (21-14) backed the bill.
Overriding a veto requires the support of two-thirds of present members of both chambers. Although the House met that threshold, the final outcome of the bill will depend on the vote in the Senate. The upper chamber did not take up the issue Tuesday but is likely to next week.
The successful 2023 ballot referendum required certain vehicle manufacturers to standardize their diagnostic systems and make them accessible to both owners and independent repair facilities in Maine. 
In a Jan. 7 veto letter, Mills said she rejected LD 1228 because she believes it harms local auto repair shops and veers too far from the intent of the law voters passed. Though the bill would implement a series of recommendations to clarify and improve the effectiveness of the right to repair law, Mills took issue with what she described as a “controversial provision” in the proposal that would allow manufacturers to decide how vehicle telemetric data would be accessible to independent repair shops. 
“I have heard from hundreds of independent repair shop owners asking that I veto this bill, based on significant concerns about the bill’s language that would restrict independent shops from performing even routine maintenance on modern vehicles,” Mills wrote in her letter. 
Rep. Kenneth Fredette (R-Newport) was the only member to speak on the House floor Tuesday morning in favor of sustaining the veto. He expressed concern that the bill could undermine the ability of mom-and-pop auto shops, especially in rural Maine, to stay open and offer affordable repairs. 
However, the sponsor of the bill, Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick), was joined by Republicans and another Democrat in speaking in favor of overriding the veto. Roberts said she hadn’t heard any objection from the Mills administration prior to the veto. 
For Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon) and others who backed the bill, it wasn’t a question of whether people should be able to repair what they own. She reiterated that that was already decided on the November 2023 ballot.
Rather, she said, “what we are deciding today is whether we are comfortable opening digital doors we do not yet know how to lock,” underscoring the cybersecurity risks that can come with vehicle data, particularly the potential to interfere with the operation of a car.  
“LD 1228 doesn’t undo Right to Repair. It doesn’t take anything away from consumers. It doesn’t pick winners,” said Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield). “It fixes a flaw — a serious one.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Question4_JimNeuger-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 15:58:42.497554

“DMACC acknowledges that Drake holds trademark rights in a stand-alone ‘D’ in connection with post-secondary education, athletics, and ancillary goods and services,” the agreement document stated. “However, given the predominance and placement of “DMACC” over the ‘D’ as set forth in paragraph 2 in the New Mark and the other limitations, terms, and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Parties agree consumer confusion between the New Mark and any Drake trademark is unlikely.”
The agreement listed certain exceptions for DMACC materials to feature a standalone “D,” including “historical artifacts and images” created before the 2023 rebranding effort and the community college’s campus recreation department logo, which includes a “D” with a bear paw inside.
In addition to specifying design dos and dont’s, the agreement stated that DMACC “shall expressly abandon” the application it made to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in November 2023 for its now-defunct designs, but can apply with new designs that comply with the agreement.
DMACC and Drake will also prepare dismissals of litigation and bond releases, the agreement stated, and each institution “knowingly and voluntarily releases and forever discharges the other Party of and from any and all claims related to the Disputes that either Party has or may have against the other Party.”
“Drake agrees not to challenge any use or application of the New Mark by DMACC, as long as such uses or applications comply with the terms of this Agreement,” the document stated.
Whenever Drake or DMACC update their branding guides or create a new one, the agreement states each institution must share it with the other.
Included in the agreement were rules stating both institutions must keep its terms and the negotiations that led the college and university to them “strictly confidential,” beyond a joint press release also stipulated in the agreement, unless required by law to provide such information.
“Both parties look forward to continuing their long-standing partnership and shared programs in service to current and future generations of students,” both institutions stated in a press release shared after the agreement was signed.

(Photo by Getty Images)Virginia experienced a surge in flu in the last weeks of 2025 and at the start of this year, hitting areas of Central Virginia and Northern Virginia especially hard, as noted by local hospital systems and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Central Virginia hospitals on Tuesday announced guidance for masking when people seek care for respiratory illness. 
Patients with coughing, sneezing, fever or a runny nose are “strongly encouraged” to wear a mask and to notify the front desk of their symptoms when visiting provider offices, urgent care centers or emergency rooms. This recommendation is for people whether or not they’ve had their flu or COVID-19 vaccines recently. Additionally, some hospitals require masking for all patients and visitors. 
HCA Virginia, Centra, VCU Health, UVA Health, Bon Secours and the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU made a joint announcement revealing their mask guidelines Tuesday to help reduce spread of illness where the hospital chains operate. 
While this week’s respiratory illnesses like COVID-19, influenza and RSV are moderate or trending down, according to Virginia Department of Health dashboards, the numbers typically rise and can peak in February each winter.
Nationally, respiratory illness infections are high, according to CDC data. 
The joint release from Virginia hospitals noted that vaccination “remains the most effective way” to reduce risk of severe illness, even though they are not 100% effective. That’s why the hospital systems urge people to mask up when they fall ill and stay home if they can.

Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, speaks during an Indiana House committee meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 13. 2025. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Hundreds of Indiana township governments could be forced into consolidation under a renewed attempt in the Legislature for streamlining the 1,000-plus such bodies across the state.
A House committee on Tuesday advanced a proposal that would require many townships to merge with other townships, with others being taken over by city or county governments.
Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, the author of House Bill 1315, said Indiana’s township government structure was developed for a “different era” when the state was more rural in the 1800s.
The proposal would require consolidations by township units that don’t operate fire departments, have fewer than 6,700 residents and don’t meet a minimum level of emergency financial assistance distribution. 
A township with at least 80% of its territory and half of its population living within city limits would have its functions assumed by the city unless the township operates a fire department.
“If you’re fully engulfed, or 80% engulfed, within another local unit of government as a township, there’s a redundancy in services,” said Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville. “If you’re not operating the fire department, my question is, why do we need another layer of government to do those other services?”
Long debate over townships
Indiana’s township officials have long argued for the importance of the services they provide. That work includes providing emergency aid for expenses such as utilities and housing to low-income residents, with some townships also operating fire departments or parks and maintaining old cemeteries.

Critics believe townships are inefficient and that those functions could be better operated by cities or counties. But numerous attempts in the Legislature for major reorganization of Indiana’s 1,008 townships have failed — dating back to a 2007 report on local government reform headed by former Gov. Joe Kernan and then-Chief Justice Randall Shepard. 
A legislative analysis estimated about 650 townships could be forced into a consolidation under Shonkwiler’s bill.
The House Local Government Committee voted 9-3 to advance the bill to the full House for action in the coming weeks.
A Senate committee is scheduled to consider a differing township reorganization proposal, Senate Bill 270, on Thursday.
Townships argue for different approach
Dan Shackle, a lobbyist for Indiana Township Association, told the House committee that the group considered the Senate bill a “better solution” as it does not rely on a population level to force consolidations.
“But (it) rather uses performance metrics to distinguish efficient townships from underperforming ones, a solution which clearly guarantees continuity of important township services and a solution which does not allow for a requirement for taxpayers to pay taxes to an entity in which they have no representation,” Shackle said.
Several business organizations and city and county government groups spoke in favor of Shonkwiler’s proposal during Tuesday’s committee hearing.
Shonkwiler said after the meeting that she was concerned about efficiency and accountability for township government.
“I think we’ve seen too many media stories about townships, township trustees that have had some fraud or some embezzlement or mishandling of funds, or aren’t live streaming their meetings, or don’t have a (board) quorum for a budget,” Shonkwiler told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “That’s a concern.”

Michelle DiFebo Freeman received the 2026 Josiah Marvel Cup at the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce’s 189th Annual Dinner on Monday evening.
WILMINGTON — The Delaware State Chamber of Commerce (DSCC) awarded the organization’s highest honor — the Josiah Marvel Cup — to Michelle DiFebo Freeman, Monday, January 12, at its 189th Annual Dinner.
Freeman was introduced with a video introduction featuring former governor Jack Markell and his wife Carla, Blue Hen legend and former WNBA player Elena Delle Donne and many business peers from around the state. Following the video announcement, DSCC president Mike Quaranta announced Freeman as the award recipient, welcoming her to the stage to accept the honor.
Freeman was visibly excited and shocked at the honor. Per tradition, no one in the audience knew who would be the awardee. The identity of the winner is kept a secret until the night of the event. 
Freeman was “speechless” — joking that it’s hard to make an Italian speechless — as she stepped to the podium to address the many attendees sitting in the Wilmington Room of the Chase Center. She thanked her team, those who offered her kind words in the video and beyond, and finally thanked her family, shouting out her three children specifically. 
Freeman is the owner and chief executive officer of the Carl M. Freeman Companies. The real estate company, founded in 1947 has a portfolio that reaches into Delaware, Virginia, and Maryland. The company manages the Nylon Capital Shopping Center in Seaford, Delaware, and owns both the Bayside Resort Golf Club and the Village of Bear Trap Dunes, among many other properties. 
“When you meet someone who is authentic, smart, enthusiastic, determined and gets things done, that’s an incredible combination. Michelle represents all those qualities,” Markell said via a DSCC press release announcing Freeman’s achievement.
Freeman ended her acceptance speech saying that she believed there is an area in business where a “double bottom line” exists. She made it clear that investing back into the community is just as important as anything else in business. Her philanthropic efforts back up her words.  
Freeman is the president and chairman of the Carl M. Freeman Foundation, which has given over $60 million in grant money since 1960, for a plethora of community projects, including libraries and fire stations. She is the founding chair of the Joshua M. Freeman Foundation, created in 2007 to honor her late husband. The organization’s goal is to provide increased access to the arts. The widest known initiative of the organization is its Freeman Arts Pavilion which is an entertainment venue in Selbyville, Delaware, that brings art and music programs into schools and communities that may not have such a presence.
“The sky is truly the limit with Michelle. She is resilient, principled, and unwavering in her commitment to doing what’s right,” said executive director of the Freeman Arts Pavilion and Carl M. Freeman Foundation, Patti Grimes, via the press release.
In addition to Freeman’s award, the dinner featured an address from Chamber president Quaranta welcoming people to the event. During that address, Quaranta announced he will be retiring at the end of the year, completing an eight-year career as president. 
Governor Matt Meyer spoke to those in attendance starting his address by thanking law enforcement and taking a moment of silence in remembrance of Cpl. Matthew “Ty” Snook, before beginning his speech. 
In his speech, Meyer spoke highly of Delaware’s economy, mentioning the over 250 thousand new entities incorporated in the state. He spoke to new avenues for the local economy, referencing a film tax credit and a desire to bring “Hollywood money” to the state. Meyer also spoke about education and investing in Delaware schools and classrooms. Meyer called for the passage of the Redding Consortium plan to consolidate the northern New Castle County school, including Red Clay, Brandywine, and Christina school districts, and new funding plans with the importance of putting money into classrooms.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/State-Chamber-Annual-Meeting-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-13 14:59:58.183992

Balow is the third Republican to announce a bid for Wyoming’s lone House seat. 
The post Jillian Balow, former Wyoming education leader, will run for U.S. House appeared first on WyoFile .","Jillian Balow, former superintendent of public instruction, announced Tuesday she will run for Wyoming’s sole U.S. House seat. 
Balow, a Republican, led the state’s education department from 2015 to 2022. 
“Wyoming has a history of sending warriors to Washington, and we need one now,” Balow wrote in a press release. “I am a relentless fighter and fierce champion for Wyoming. I am running to defend Wyoming’s energy economy, protect our constitutional freedoms, and make sure the voices of every Wyoming community are heard loud and clear in Washington.”
Balow is the third Republican to declare a bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray and Reid Rasner, who previously ran for U.S. Senate, have both made announcements in the last few weeks. A Democratic candidate has yet to enter the race. 
The seat is currently held by Rep. Harriet Hageman, who announced she would run for U.S. Senate after Sen. Cynthia Lummis abandoned reelection plans in December, choosing instead to retire after the term. 
While President Donald Trump has already made endorsements in Wyoming’s senatorial and gubernatorial races, backing Hageman and Megan Degenfelder, respectively, he has not weighed in on the state’s race for U.S. House. 
Who’s Balow?
Born in Laramie and raised in Gillette, Balow attended the University of Wyoming, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in education. She also has a master’s degree in education from Regis University. 
Before taking public office, Balow served under Gov. Matt Mead as a policy advisor and spent time working as an administrator in both the state’s education agency and the Department of Family Services. She taught in elementary and secondary classrooms for about a decade. 
Balow has also worked in the private sector, including a recent position with MetaMetrics, a North Carolina-based education technology firm. 
“Throughout her career, Balow has advocated for education reform rooted in accountability, parental empowerment, and choice,” her press release states. “She pairs that work with a firm belief in lower taxes, reduced government spending, small government, and personal responsibility.” 
As Wyoming’s education leader, Balow guided the department through the COVID-19 pandemic. Under an Obama-era federal policy that enabled states to set their own education priorities, Balow focused on civics education. In 2018, she ushered in a statewide K-12 computer science education initiative. 
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin appointed Balow in 2022 as that state’s superintendent of public instruction, “where she focused on parents’ rights, accountability, and returning decision-making to families and local communities,” Balow’s announcement states. 
About 14 months into the job, Balow announced that she would resign but remain a consultant for Youngkin’s administration. Her resignation letter did not provide an explanation, according to Virginia Mercury, but followed a $201 million shortfall due to a budgeting error in the education department. 
Her tenure in both Virginia and Wyoming was in part characterized by her opposition to critical race theory, an academic study of systemic racism and inequality rooted in the nation’s history that its scholars say helps explain continuing biases and disparities in modern American life. 
Balow’s Tuesday announcement touted her stances on issues beyond education.
“Balow runs on a platform that emphasizes reliable domestic energy production, strong support for agriculture and Wyoming’s outdoor heritage, and policies that strengthen families, veterans, and small businesses,” the press release states. “She is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and an avid hunter and fisherman, and another with deep ties to agriculture and FFA.”

Fire is an important and sacred part of Judaism. We light candles at the beginning and the end of the sabbath and one for each night of Hanukkah. We burn Yartzheit candles to remember loved ones on the anniversary of their deaths. We hold our fingertips up to the light of the braided Havdalah candle as we recite the blessing over the flame. Just last month, at our temple’s Hanukkah celebration, I looked around the darkened social hall at no less than a dozen lit menorahs and felt chills go down my spine. It was a beautiful sight. When the email went out Saturday morning that there had been a fire at the synagogue, and that our religious school would need to be held off-site the next day, I truly wondered if someone had left a candle burning overnight.

That evening, I learned that the fire was not started by a candle or a random electrical fire; it was arson. A man we now know to be the pimply and hateful nineteen-year-old Madison resident Stephen Spencer Pittman broke into my synagogue with an ax and set it on fire. There’s a video of him online now, his face covered with a mask, dousing the Beth Israel lobby with gasoline. I’m not sure how Pittman came to believe our small congregation of 150 families was the “synagogue of Satan” or how he reconciled his actions with his Christian faith. From what I’ve read, he is a shallow, unserious and sloppy young man whose interests included weightlifting and hating Jews. But none of that matters. What matters is that he chose gasoline and a fire torch. The flame followed the path of the accelerant. Nobody blames the fire for what happened next. The fire did what fires do: it burned.
Flames devoured the lobby, where our religious school kids grab their slices of challah and cups of apple juice from a rolling cart. The air inside the lobby was so hot that it busted out the glass of the lobby’s circular skylight. Among the photos of the wreckage, this image of the skylight was almost beautiful in its contrast and composition: the bright circle of daylight against the charred background of the ceiling.

The flames burned the administrative offices where sometimes I’d find a student sneaking a piece of hard candy off Ms. Sheila’s desk. It couldn’t have taken much encouragement for the flames to make their way to the adjacent library, whose walls were lined with wood and books, aka fire starter. The books and two Torahs in the room would have have incinerated within seconds.
Just the week before, our rabbi-in-training Ben Russell had taught the Sunday school kids how to kiss a prayer book that falls to the ground. Accidents and drops happen, Ben explained, but any text that contains G-d’s name must be treated with tenderness. We hadn’t discussed what happens when a sacred book, let alone a Torah, burns. That violence would be unthinkable.

Even now, it’s clear how all this could have been so much worse. The fire department and law enforcement responses were swift and effective. Beth Israel’s leaders were on site within hours. And the sanctuary – though covered in a thick layer of black soot – was not burned down. After the flames were extinguished, a congregant was able to find his way the ark, through halls darkened with ash and without power, to wrap the smoke-damaged Torahs in plastic trash bags before transporting them home. The Torah that survived the Holocaust and was behind glass remained miraculously unscathed. The classrooms, the synagogue archives (which coincidentally I had just spent time with in October), and the Institute of Southern Jewish Life offices are smoky and sooty but mostly untouched by fire. A layer of black grime coated my students’ Hebrew workbooks, but was easily scrubbed away with damp paper towels. From the outset, the emphasis of our congregation has been on rebuilding, bolstered by support from the wider Jackson community and from Jewish congregations around the country.
What Spencer Pittman will never understand is how much harder, and how much more satisfying, it is to build than to destroy.
At Sunday school, we always start the morning with Havdalah. Typically practiced after nightfall on Saturday, Havdalah a ritual of separation, meant to mark the end of Shabbat and the beginning of the new week. This Sunday, instead of in our sanctuary, we were in the bright, sunlit room of a local museum, chairs facing one another in a circle. With Ben out of state at rabbinical school, there was some bickering among the children over who got to hold and light the Havdalah candle, but it was quickly decided that it would be Eli, who, after all, had been the one to run and cut a sprig of rosemary in place of the temple’s now soot-covered spice box. We sang the blessing over the fruit of the vine, we smelled the rosemary, we praised G-d for creating the lights of the fire. Then came everyone’s favorite part: the satisfying sizzle as Eli extinguished the candle’s flame in grape juice in the kiddush cup. After the proper amount of sizzle appreciation, we sang the last part of the Havdalah blessing, hamavdil bein kodesh l’chol, marking the separation of the sacred from the mundane, the light from the darkness.

For Jews, only the sabbath – starting Friday evening and ending Saturday evening – is considered sacred as far as days of the week go. But this Sunday felt anything but “mundane.” Our temple had burned and with it our naiveté that hatred couldn’t destroy the same building twice. But we were together, and it was a sacred togetherness.
After Havdalah, Rachel, our religious school leader and temple board member, showed us the photos she had taken from the wreckage. Some of the children were silent. Many clamored with questions. It looks like a haunted house, Emry said, referring to a photo of a charred hallway. Everyone agreed. Eli pointed, See this is where the couch was, and there was the Tree of Life on the wall. And that’s the skylight in the lobby, Evie added. Rachel asked the kids what they wanted in a newly rebuilt library. Comfier chairs! Pink and purple books! A cotton candy machine! She showed us pictures of the aftermath of the bombings of the temple and of Rabbi Perry Nussbaum’s house by the KKK in 1967. The part of the synagogue that the bigots destroyed then is the same part that we’ll be rebuilding again.
What should we do now? Rachel asked the kids. Be Jewish! Addie shouted. Be more Jewish than ever!
We all agreed that was a good plan.

School Choice Deadline for the 2026–27 school year is 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 14
DOVER, Delaware — Families considering alternatives to their neighborhood public school have just days left to apply through Delaware’s school choice program. The deadline to submit applications for the 2026–27 school year is 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 14, according to the Delaware Department of Education.
Delaware’s school choice system allows any family living in the state to apply for their child to attend any public school district, charter school, or vocational-technical school, regardless of home address. Applications must be submitted online through the state’s portal at SchoolChoiceDE.org.  The annual application window opens in November and closes on the second Wednesday in January. Only applications submitted by the deadline are included in school lotteries.
Students must be registered at their assigned feeder school before applying for school choice. Families may apply to multiple schools and may edit or withdraw applications until the window closes. Application status can be tracked through the online portal. Districts and charter schools are required to notify families of invitation status by Feb. 27. Families who receive offers must accept or decline them by March 20.
Transportation considerations
Transportation is not guaranteed for students attending a school through choice. School districts are required to provide transportation for students attending their assigned feeder school. For choice students, districts typically provide transportation only from existing bus stops within the receiving district. Families may be required to transport students to a designated stop or directly to school. Charter schools follow similar transportation rules. Vocational-technical schools offer broader countywide bus networks, though stops are limited and may require travel to centralized locations. Transportation assignments are finalized after a family accepts a seat, usually during the summer.
Kindergarten and late applications
Kindergarten families may apply through the school choice system once their child is registered at their feeder school. While kindergarten applications may be submitted later in the year, applying by the January deadline ensures inclusion in lotteries and early placement decisions. Delaware does not offer general deadline extensions. Families who miss the deadline may apply after Jan. 14 only if they meet “good cause” criteria, which include a change of residence, change in guardianship, foster placement, adoption, documented bullying, or participation in a mental health or substance treatment program. Charter, magnet, and vocational-technical schools may also accept late applications if seats remain available.

Laura Chapman addresses the Senate on March 5, 2025. (Will Price | West Virginia Legislative photography)A day before West Virginia’s legislative session is set to start, a senator has vacated her leadership position, the latest in a series of issues in the upper chamber that point to a questionable future.
Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio, resigned as chair of the Senate Health Committee on Tuesday in a letter to Senate President Randy Smith. 
“Given your demand that I promise my support to you, I am hereby immediately resigning as Heath Chair. I made a pledge when I ran for office that my vote belongs to the people of the Northern Pahnandle and not to another senator, lobbyist or special interest group,” Chapman wrote.
In response to Chapman’s resignation, Smith said, “I have received Senator Chapman’s letter of resignation. I thank her for her leadership and hard work she put in as chairman.
Speaking with West Virginia Watch, Chapman expanded on her letter, saying, “It is clear by having two major chairs from the Eastern Panhandle as leadership team, the Northern Panhandle will be forgotten. I believe the vast majority of legislation will be Eastern Panhandle -focused, which is not good for the entirety of the state and it’s not good for the people of the Northern Panhandle.”
Republican Sen. Tom Willis, who was recently named chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is from Berkeley County and his district includes the Eastern Panhandle. 
“I am not privy to Sen. Chapman’s discussions with the Senate President and not sure where this is coming from, but of course I advocate for my constituents in my district, the very same as I will forcefully advocate for all of West Virginia as the next U.S. Senator for West Virginia,” Willis said. He is running for the U.S. Senate to replace current Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. 
Senate Finance Committee Chair Jason Barrett, R-Berkeley, also represents the Eastern Panhandle. 
Barrett said he is working to understand the needs of all parts of the state and that no area would be neglected.
“Just like every other member of the Legislature, I have an obligation to the constituents I represent. I always try to be the biggest advocate I can for their legislative priorities,” Barrett said “As the Finance chairman, my role is to put forth good policy for all people of West Virginia. I don’t envision any pieces of legislation that would benefit the Eastern Panhandle and negatively impact or be detrimental to any other area of this state.”
Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, has criticized Senate leadership in recent days, saying they had not met ahead of session to discuss priorities, while House of Delegates leadership has already outlined a focus on economic development. 
“I’ll tell you that the Senate Republican majority has no consensus on an agenda at all,” Tarr told reporters last Friday at the Legislative Lookahead event. “I expect a bit of a free-for-all, because that’s extremely odd and I’m frustrated by that.” 
Smith on Tuesday named Sen. Brian Helton, R-Fayette, as Chapman’s replacement on the Health Committee. 
He also named Jay Taylor, R-Taylor, president pro tempore; Ben Queen, R-Harrison, Senate majority whip; and Anne B. Charnock, R-Kanawha, chair of the Committee on Confirmation. 
Lawmakers will gavel in Wednesday at noon for the regular 60-day Session.
Smith named Chapman chair of the Health Committee after he took charge of the Senate ahead of the 2025 Legislative Session.
Last year, Chapman advocated for West Virginia to allow religious vaccine exemptions to its strict immunization rules. After the bill dramatically failed in the House of Delegates, she attempted to amend the wording into a different piece of legislation dealing with Alpha-gal syndrome. The House refused to concur on the changes to the bill, killing the legislation. Gov. Patrick Morrisey later said West Virginia could allow religious exemptions under a current religious freedom law, and the issue will come before the state Supreme Court next year.
She previously said she didn’t plan to sponsor the vaccine exemption bill again this year. 
Chapman was a staunch supporter of a bill banning artificial food dyes, which was signed into law last year. The measure, which is challenged in court, prohibits the sale of any food product with certain types of yellow, blue, green and red dyes.
She also worked on reforming the state’s troubled child welfare system and attempted to put stricter vetting requirements in place to prevent child abuse at in-state facilities for children. 
“I’ve focused on children and women’s issues as a mother of two young children,” she said. 
On Monday, Chapman filed to run for reelection this year for a four-year term.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chapman.jpg,,,2026-01-13 14:59:58.183992
,DC,2026-01-13 19:27:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Supreme Court appears poised to affirm trans athlete bans in Idaho, West Virginia",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-appears-poised-affirm-trans-athlete-bans-idaho-west-virginia,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority appeared likely Tuesday to keep in place laws in Idaho and West Virginia banning transgender athletes from participating on women’s and girls’ sports teams.The outcomes from the nation’s highest court expected later this year could have sweeping implications for transgender rights more broadly as President Donald Trump’s administration’s efforts to roll back those rights have extended far beyond athletics. In lengthy, back-to-back oral arguments, justices heard two cases — Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J. — which both deal with whether those states’ bans violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.  The West Virginia case also calls into question whether its prohibition on transgender athletes participating in women’s and girls’ sports violates the  federal civil rights law barring sex-based discrimination in education programs known as Title IX. Rulings in lower courts have halted the two states from implementing the bans, to varying extents, leading GOP attorneys general in Idaho and West Virginia to ask the Supreme Court to step in. Idaho and West Virginia represent just two of the nearly 30 states with laws banning transgender students’ participation in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an independent think tank. During oral arguments in the Idaho case, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he sees the growth of women’s and girls’ sports as one of the country’s great successes over the past half-century. He noted that some states, the federal government, the NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee “think that allowing transgender women and girls to participate will undermine or reverse that amazing success and will create unfairness.”

He added that “for the individual girl who does not make the team, or doesn’t get on the stand for the medal, or doesn’t make all league, there’s a harm there, and I think we can’t sweep that aside.” Kavanaugh is part of the court’s conservative wing, whose members outnumber liberals 6-3.Title IX debatedKavanaugh’s comment seemingly endorsed West Virginia Solicitor General Michael Williams’ framing of the issue, as a protection of women and girl athletes. Williams told the justices that “maintaining separate boys’ and girls’ sports teams ensures that girls can safely and fairly compete in school sports.” He argued that Title IX “permits sex-separated teams,” and “it does so because biological sex matters in athletics in ways both obvious and undeniable.” Joshua Block, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, argued on behalf of Becky Pepper-Jackson, a transgender athlete at the forefront of the West Virginia case.Block said that though West Virginia “argues that to protect these opportunities for cisgender girls, it has to deny them” to Pepper-Jackson, “Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause protect everyone, and if the evidence shows there are no relevant physiological differences between B.P.J. and other girls, then there’s no basis to exclude her.”Idaho caseIdaho’s solicitor general, Alan Hurst, argued that “gender identity does not matter in sports, and that’s why Idaho’s law does not classify on the basis of gender identity.” Hurst said the law “treats all males equally and all females equally, regardless of identity.” Kathleen Hartnett, an attorney with Cooley LLP, represented Lindsay Hecox, a transgender student in Idaho who wanted to try out for the women’s track and cross-country teams at Boise State University but would have been barred from doing so under the Idaho law because she is transgender.A federal court in Idaho halted the law from taking effect in 2020. A federal appeals court initially upheld the ruling in 2023 but adjusted the scope of it in 2024 to only apply to Hecox, not other athletes.Hartnett said the law ignored that trans girls who take medication to block testosterone do not have an inherent physical advantage in sports.“Circulating testosterone after puberty is the main determinant of sex-based biological advantage that (the Idaho law) sought to address,” she said.

Hecox “has mitigated that advantage because she has suppressed her testosterone for over a year and taken estrogen,” Hartnett said.The Idaho law, Hartnett said, “thus fails heightened scrutiny as applied to Lindsay and transgender women like her who have no sex-based biological advantage as compared to birth sex females.” Hecox has asked both an Idaho federal court and the Supreme Court to drop the case. Though a federal judge in Idaho rejected that attempt in October, the Supreme Court deferred the request until after oral arguments and could ultimately dismiss her case in the coming months. Issue actively debatedEarlier landmark rulings involving transgender rights came up before the court Tuesday — including United States v. Skrmetti in 2025 and Bostock v. Clayton County in 2020. In United States v. Skrmetti, the Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s prohibition on gender-affirming care for minors.The court held in Bostock v. Clayton County that LGBTQ+ employees are protected from employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Kavanaugh suggested the wide-ranging landscape of laws on the issue throughout the country meant the court should tread carefully in meddling in state laws.“Given that half the states are allowing transgender girls and women to participate, about half are not, why would we at this point — just the role of this court — jump in and try to constitutionalize a rule for the whole country while there’s still, as you say, uncertainty and debate?” he asked Hartnett.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has taken steps at the federal level to prohibit trans athletes’ participation in women’s sports teams aligning with their gender identity, including the president signing an executive order in February 2025 that banned such participation. He also signed executive orders regarding transgender people including orders that make it the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,” restrict access to gender-affirming care for kids and aim to bar openly transgender service members from the U.S. military.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

Diane Holland, an Okemos resident living with multiple sclerosis and a breast cancer survivor, said during a press conference hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party that Rogers, a Republican from White Lake, “cannot be trusted with our health care.”
“If he gets elected to the Senate this year, he could once again vote to gut the ACA and make it impossible for people who have pre-existing conditions, to get affordable health care, to take away the coverage that’s keeping me healthy without going bankrupt,” Holland said. “For me, it’s MS, disability or death or bankruptcy. Mike Rogers is a multi millionaire. He doesn’t know what it’s like to choose between your health or your bills or your life. But I do, and many other Michiganders do.”

Jill Murphy, who lives in Macomb County and deals with endometriosis among other medical concerns, agreed with Holland about the stress that comes with wondering if she will be able to afford the health care she needs. 
“Every year, I am left wondering whether my plan will still exist, whether my medications will still be covered, or whether my premiums will spike again,” she said. “That instability creates constant stress for households across Michigan, families are trying to plan, budget and take care of their health. But when coverage and costs change without warning, it’s impossible to feel secure, and Mike Rogers wants to make it worse.”
“Mike Rogers has spent his entire career trying to take that away from people like me, and if he gets into the Senate, there’s no doubt he’ll try to finish the job,” she added, citing that Rogers voted 14 times while in Congress to weaken Medicaid.

Holland said that her health care premiums have more than doubled without the tax credits, and she called that “the difference between making it and not making it.”
A request for comment was sent to Rogers’ campaign, but has yet to be returned.
State Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) shared even more drastic statistics about premium increases during the press conference. He described premium increases of thousands of dollars at the start of the year, as well as the harm of insurance providers leaving the ACA marketplace due to premium hikes, forcing Michiganders on those plans to find new health care quickly.
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel also took his own swing at Rogers for opposing the tax subsidy extensions, depicting him as out-of-touch with most Michiganders. 
“He’s someone who puts tax breaks for the wealthy ahead of health care for working families. He’s someone who supports Medicaid cuts while he lives up in his Florida mansion. He’s someone who celebrates when his policies spike costs for Michigan families,” Hertel said. “Michigan families deserve better.”
“This isn’t some far away political battle happening in D.C.,” Holland said. “For me, it’s about being able to live my life with dignity.”

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)Senior members of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration helped Republican state Sen. Richard Stuart clear a major regulatory hurdle for a planned solar farm on his King George County property last year. 
It’s unclear what role Youngkin administration officials played behind the scenes. But their actions produced a letter and revised easement that helped the stalled project to proceed, as similar projects proposed by citizens met challenges in other rural areas of the state.
Louisa County landowner caught up in solar farm regulation debate

In November, the solar farm was unanimously approved by the county’s board of supervisors. Stuart serves as the county attorney, but recused himself from being involved in the board’s debate of the issue.
Stuart, a close political ally of the GOP governor, said in an interview the long road to building the solar farm was frustrating because he shared the goals of conservationists who opposed the project. He said the solar farm involved a small sliver of his 1,431 acres, on land that he said his ancestors had once owned. 
“I’m protecting 1,430 acres — a thousand acres of timber, 300 and some acres of marsh,” Stuart said. “Yet they just beat you up if you try to do anything. And I don’t understand that.”
Stuart worked with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation since at least 2022 over his plans to lease 122 acres of his land to TerraForm Power, which plans to build a 22 MW solar farm. Stuart’s land is governed by an easement — in this case, an agreement between a landowner and DCR designed to “encourage preservation of open space land.”
The 2001 easement, signed by a previous landowner, forbids most industrial or commercial activities. But Stuart pointed to a later, 2017 management agreement he signed with DCR that lays out how the easement should be implemented. 
The 2017 agreement explicitly allowed solar facilities “so long as any such project is in accordance with the Conservation Easement and/or Deed of Dedication.” Stuart maintained that because the project sat on an exclusion zone, outside of the heart of the easement, he should be allowed to lease the land to TerraForm.
The argument failed to persuade former DCR director Matthew Wells, who gently rejected Stuart’s plan in an August, 2023 letter. Wells said Stuart needed to work with DCR to amend the easement in order to proceed.
Wells also sought the opinion of the U.S. Department of the Interior, whose grant funded the easement. In a June 21, 2024 letter, an official at the department said they believed the solar farm was incompatible with the easement.
But Stuart was undeterred. In a July 8, 2024 letter to Wells, Stuart threatened to proceed with the solar facility and vowed “swift legal action” if the state tried to stop him. 
Stuart said he was “most distressed by your comments to me that you must treat me differently because of ‘who I am.’” In an interview, Stuart said Wells had told him he needed to hold Stuart to a higher level of scrutiny given his status as a public official (Wells, who left DCR in October, did not respond to a LinkedIn message seeking an interview).

Stuart cc’d Richard Cullen, Youngkin’s counsel, then-Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles, and two men he described in an interview as attorneys who’ve represented him in legal matters: Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and attorney Thomas Wood IV.
A little over two weeks later, on July 26, 2024, Voyles responded to Stuart with a letter that struck a different note: “Solar energy development is specifically permitted in certain areas of the property, where it is consistent with the easement.”
TerraForm representatives referenced Voyles’ letter in hearings in front of the county’s planning commission, which nonetheless recommended against approving the project in September. Two months later, the five-member BOS opted to approve the project anyway.
It’s not clear what changed with the state’s treatment of the solar facility.
Stuart said he can’t remember if he spoke directly with Cullen during that period, but said “it would certainly make sense if we talked,” pointing to his threat of legal action against the state. He said he’d known Cullen, an attorney and mainstay in Virginia and national Republican politics, for years, but would’ve alerted any governor’s counsel in the situation.
Cullen did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. 
When the Mercury filed a public records request about the matter, the governor’s office said it was withholding 24 pages of text messages, emails and call logs between Stuart and Cullen during the period between Stuart’s warning letter and Voyles’ response.
It also withheld “half of a manilla file” worth of emails and text messages between Cullen and Voyles containing the keywords “solar” or “Stuart.”
Last month, DCR and Stuart signed an amended easement that explicitly allows solar facilities and cites Voyles’ letter as rationale for the changes.
A coalition of conservation groups called the Land Trust Alliance signed a letter to Voyles’ successor, Stefanie Taillon, in May saying that allowing a solar farm on easement was likely unprecedented in Virginia, and warning that the action could have “local and national implications.”
Residents have shared mixed reviews for the project. Laurie Schlemm told the county’s planning commission in September that the easement clearly barred solar and said the previous landowner, James Nash, who’d initially set up the easement, would be “turning over in his grave” if he knew its fate. Others, like Rose Payne, said new subdivisions were a bigger threat than the solar farm. 
TerraForm representatives said the project would generate $11.3 million in economic benefits for the county over its 40-year lifespan, including $3 million in direct revenue.
Stuart said in an interview last week that the whole process had made him wary of easements. He noted the original easement allowed for the extraction of oil and gas and said he needed to bring in revenue to help pay property taxes. 
“Some folks in these fields believe that you should not be able to do anything but
look at the land and pay taxes,” he said. “And unfortunately that probably will be the downfall of this program when they’re just too rigid with people.”
The solar farm proposal isn’t the first issue that has prompted headlines about Stuart’s property. 
In 2020, the Washington Post reported he and his wife discovered headstones on the riverbanks of the property that originated from a historic African American burial ground in Washington D.C. In 2021, 55 headstones were moved to National Harmony Memorial Park in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

(Photo by RKO)Conservation group Center for Biological Diversity has filed suit against the Trump administration for failing to provide endangered species protection to the Rio Grande cooter, a freshwater turtle that lives in the Pecos and Rio Grande watersheds in New Mexico, Texas and Mexico. 
The Jan. 8 lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that federal wildlife officials’ 2022 decision to not list the turtles puts them at risk of extinction, and contends the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ignored “mounting evidence” in order to conclude the species didn’t require protection.
“The extinction of these irreplaceable turtles would cost the Southwest a vital piece of natural heritage, so it’s shocking that federal officials failed to protect them,” said Camila Cossío, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “Rio Grande cooters are threatened by climate change, unsustainable water usage and the oil industry’s influence, but we can save them with Endangered Species Act protections.”
The turtles, which have distinctive marbled yellow striping on their shells, are vulnerable both to habitat loss from climate change but also potentially pollution from oil and gas extraction, Cossío told Source NM in a phone call. 
“They’re really slow to mature so sometimes it’s hard to see the effects, the negative effects that’s happening, until it’s too late,” she said. 
Federal protections under the Endangered Species Act would provide states funding for turtle conservation and breeding programs, she said.
There’s also been documentation of a tenfold increase in international sales of the turtles — often taken from the wild — for the international pet and food trades, with the federal government data showing an increase of 20 turtles were exported in 2016 to more than 350 in 2020.
“Just taking one turtle out of the wild for trade is a ripple effect on multiple generations of turtles,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rio-grandecooter-1024x723.jpg,,,2026-01-13 14:12:13.918866

A ticket described the misdemeanor as driving a motor vehicle “while failing to slow down when approaching a stationary emergency vehicle with emergency lights active.”
The case is pending. A Broadwater County officer issued the citation at 6:17 p.m. on Nov. 27, and McKinnon pleaded not guilty on Dec. 8, according to court records.
The citation does not state an alleged speed McKinnon was traveling on U.S. Highway 287. County Sheriff Nick Rauser said Tuesday the limit is 70 by day and 65 by night where she was stopped.
Sunset that day in the county was 4:44 p.m. according to Fish, Wildlife and Parks. (The agency sets sunrise and sunset times in the state for game bird hunting.)
When passing an emergency vehicle with lights flashing on a state highway, statute requires drivers to reduce their speed by 30 miles per hour if they can move lanes and by half of the posted speed limit if they can’t move lanes.
County Attorney Kevin Bratcher provided the court records to the Daily Montanan but said the county could not release additional details about the case, such as alleged speed, until it concludes.
“I can’t comment on the specific facts in more depth than what is printed on the citation since the case is still pending,” Bratcher said in an email, citing professional conduct rules for lawyers.
An omnibus hearing, to address procedural matters, is scheduled for Jan. 20.
The maximum penalty for a first offense is 90 days in jail, a fine of up to $500, or both. The citation lists a fine of $285.
McKinnon could not be reached for comment by email sent late Monday afternoon. She was elected to the Montana Supreme Court in 2012, and re-elected in 2020.
Sheriff Rauser said he also could not provide additional details about the specific situation that led to the citation.
However, Rauser said the law is in place to protect workers, such as law enforcement, fire personnel and tow truck drivers.
Emergency responders may walk into the lane of traffic to investigate a crime, help victims or clean up debris on the road, he said.
“It’s just important to slow down so everyone on the scene is safe and nobody is getting injured or killed,” Rauser said.
In 2021 with House Bill 264, the Montana Legislature stiffened requirements for safely passing emergency vehicles, included tow trucks as vehicles for which slowing is required, and increased penalties.

(Courtesy photo)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration is promoting Jenna Conway, a state education leader, to become the next state superintendent of public instruction. The administration has also named Connor Andrews as deputy secretary of education.
The announcement on Tuesday is the latest move by the incoming administration to shape the state’s education leadership. Spanberger, who last week announced longtime educator Jeffery Smith as Virginia’s next secretary of education, reiterated her goal to strengthen all levels of education in the state, including early childhood, K-12, and colleges and universities.

“Ms. Conway and Mr. Andrews share my deep commitment to putting Virginia’s students first, attracting and retaining world-class educators, and making strong investments at every level of our education system,” Spanberger said in a statement. “I’m proud to have them join my administration as we work to strengthen Virginia’s public schools across our commonwealth.”
Conway has served in the Virginia Department of Education for the past seven years, most recently as chief of early learning and specialized populations. She led improvements to Virginia’s birth-to-five early childhood system and oversaw special education, behavioral health, student safety and adult education, demonstrating a commitment to supporting all learners.
Her education experience also includes building a nationally recognized early childhood model. Over eight years, Conway helped double the number of birth-to-five children served with public funds. In addition, she helped shape other significant legislation, including the implementation of the Virginia Literacy Act. 
In a statement, Conway said she joins Spanberger in a commitment to strengthening the state’s public schools and early childhood programs to prepare Virginia’s future workforce and empower students, families and educators. 
“Throughout my tenure at the Virginia Department of Education, I have been inspired by the dedication of educators, stakeholders, and parents across the commonwealth. While each voice is unique, a shared purpose unites us: we believe in our children and are determined to ensure every child has every opportunity to reach their fullest potential,” Conway said.
Spanberger’s administration also announced that Andrews, who co-chairs the governor-elect’s education policy committee, will transition to the Office of the Secretary of Education as deputy secretary.
Andrews, the director of state government relations at the University of Virginia, previously served in the office of former Gov. Ralph Northam, first as a policy analyst and later as deputy policy director, where he focused on education, workforce development and labor policy. He also staffed Northam’s Children’s Cabinet, which worked to improve outcomes for children and families.
“The governor-elect’s education plan recognizes the critical role that our education system and institutions of higher education play in expanding opportunity and preparing students for success,” Andrews said in a statement. “I look forward to collaborating with partners across the commonwealth to ensure all Virginians have access to a world-class education.”

Murrill said in a news release Tuesday that Dr. Rémy Coeytaux has been charged in St. Tammany Parish with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs. She has asked Gov. […],"Photo illustration by Natalie Behring/Getty ImagesAttorney General Liz Murrill has obtained an indictment for a California doctor who she alleges sent abortion pills to Louisiana in violation of state law.
Murrill said in a news release Tuesday that Dr. Rémy Coeytaux has been charged in St. Tammany Parish with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs. She has asked Gov. Jeff Landry to approve an extradition warrant to bring Coeytaux to Louisiana to face the charge, though California authorities are unlikely to cooperate.
In 2024, Louisiana classified the reproductive health drugs mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances, the same designation given to drugs with the potential for addiction and abuse such as Valium and Xanax. The medications are the most commonly prescribed for abortion, but they also have other life-saving medical uses.
Louisiana became the first state to set criminal penalties for anyone who handles mifepristone and misoprostol without proper clearance. Offenses can be punished by one to 50 years in prison, depending on the circumstances.
The indictment, handed down Jan. 8 in St. Tammany Parish, follows an arrest warrant for Coeytaux issued in May 2024 for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a patient in Louisiana.
“This is not healthcare; it’s drug dealing,” Murrill said in a news release. “Individuals who flagrantly and intentionally violate our laws by sending illegal abortion pills into our state placing women in danger. We’ve seen the proof of that, with women showing up in emergency rooms after taking these pills and being coerced into abortions.”
Coeytaux did not immediately respond to a message left at his office phone number. A representative with the Center for Reproductive Rights responded to an email sent to Coeytaux’s office and said they would have comment shortly.
Murrill is a co-plaintiff in a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that ultimately seeks to require in-person doctor’s visits to obtain mifepristone and misoprostol. Rosalie Markezich is the lead plaintiff in the case. According to the lawsuit, Markezich said her boyfriend at the time ordered abortion drugs from an out-of-state doctor in October 2023 using her email address. Markezich said her boyfriend pressured her to take the pills, and she was unable to regurgitate them.
Louisiana issued an arrest warrant for “a California-based doctor” in 2024 after learning about what happened to Markezich, according to the lawsuit. A copy of Coeytaux’s arrest warrant that Murrill’s office provided Tuesday does not name Markezich, but it details a “complainant” who purchased abortion medication online in October 2023. The warrant links Coeytaux to AidAccess, an Austria-based business that ships medication to the United States.
This is the second instance of Murrill bringing charges against an out-of-state physician for prescribing abortion medication to a Louisiana. A year ago, a West Baton Rouge Parish grand jury indicted Dr. Margaret Carpenter of New York for providing pills to a Port Allen woman for her pregnant daughter, who was a minor at the time.
Attempts to extradite Carpenter to face prosecution in Louisiana have run into a New York “shield law” that protects telehealth providers from criminal consequences in states that have outlawed abortion. California has similar protections for its health care provides against investigations and prosecutions from other states.

Robby Mills, R-Henderson, says bills to tackle the housing shortage should be moving soon in the Kentucky legislature. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Republican lawmakers joined housing advocates from across Kentucky to tout legislation addressing the state’s significant housing shortage, though lawmakers offered few specifics on what they will propose. 
Kentucky Senate Majority Caucus Chair Robby Mills, R-Henderson, told advocates and reporters Tuesday morning that two “very good” reports from the legislature’s housing task force validated “the facts that we need more housing in the state of Kentucky.” 
The task force, which met a number of times last year, issued recommendations in November, including easing  regulations on housing developers and strongly considering providing funding to incentivize housing and infrastructure construction.
“There are several bills, there are several budget requests that have already been made,” said Mills, co-chair of the task force. “I’m really excited. Hopefully you’ll see some of these bills start rolling out here in the next week or so.”
Kentucky needs more than 200,000 housing units, including rentals and homes for sale, according to a national research firm hired by the Kentucky Housing Corp. The firm found that the gap could grow to more than 287,000 units by 2029 without efforts to build or repair housing; low-income renters could be particularly impacted by the growing shortage. 
Much of the calls for action from housing advocates centered around providing more funding to build housing. 
Housing advocates in previous years have come before the GOP-controlled legislature, in the wake of past catastrophic flooding and tornado outbreaks, asking for hundreds of millions of dollars to provide the resources for nonprofit housing builders to build homes in disaster-impacted communities.

Republican lawmakers have turned down those requests for large infusions of funding, citing concerns about whether local housing developers have the capacity to adequately use allocated funds. 
Lawmakers have created the Rural Housing Trust Fund — another vehicle to support housing construction alongside the state’s longstanding Affordable Housing Trust Fund — in addition to allocating smaller infusions of funding to the trust funds. The legislature also passed a bill last year to prevent local governments from implementing certain restrictions on manufactured housing.
Scott McReynolds, the executive director of the Perry County-based Housing Development Alliance, said “the housing supply gap is not a capacity issue — it is a resource issue.” 
His nonprofit is one the Eastern Kentucky housing developers that have been rebuilding homes on higher ground after past catastrophic floods.
“Can you spend that money? It’s a legitimate question,” McReynolds said. “But what’s been proven in Eastern Kentucky in the flood recovery, and what has been proven in Western Kentucky and the tornado recovery is when resources are available, communities find the capacity to build the housing.” 
Gov. Andy Beshear in his budget proposal called for a one-time $150 million allocation to go into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, a pool of monies the Kentucky Housing Corp. manages to help subsidize housing projects. The allocation would come from the Budget Reserve Trust Fund, also known as the state’s “rainy day” fund, which has billions of dollars available. 
Asked about conversations around a potential one-time allocation for housing, George Eklund, director of education and advocacy at the Coalition for the Homeless in Louisville, said his organization is focused on increasing fees that provide sustainable funds to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
The trust fund receives regular funds through fees on real estate transactions, though advocates say funding from those fees has waned. 
“We know that we need housing, and it is a point of crisis. So I would welcome any kind of one-time infusions to the trust fund,” Eklund said. “We personally are focusing on the fee increase, just so that we have a sustainable, modernized funding structure.” 
Eklund said increasing fees would increase available funds to the trust fund annually by $10 million and develop 6,000 units over the next 10 years. 
Lawmakers also touted legislation that didn’t see passage in last year’s session, such as a bill allowing religious organizations more flexibility to build housing on land they own. It’s a concept known as “God’s Backyard.” 
“It’s about empowering faith-based institutions and churches to use their land to serve these means. Houses of worship and religious organizations want to help,” said Rep. Sarge Pollock, R-Campbellsville.

Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, the co-chair of the legislature’s housing task force, told the gathered audience she also planned to file a bill that would automatically seal evictions from someone’s record if they’ve been dismissed. 
“Even when a case is dismissed, it can follow individuals for years, showing up on their background checks and limiting their housing options,” Witten said. “Housing stability strengthens families and it supports our workforce.” 
Among the advocates gathered by the state capitol building included those who lost homes in natural disasters Kentuckians have grappled with. 
Missy Sexton, who lives in a rebuilt home out of the floodplain in Perry County supported by funding from the Rural Housing Trust Fund, told reporters she supports more funding because of the sheer need for stable housing she sees from her neighbors. 
“When you do something good for one of us, it’s a ripple effect because we take care of each other,” Sexton said. “Every person in southeast Kentucky, they deserve safe housing.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Crews began cleaning up the walls of the Oklahoma State Capitol on Tuesday after someone wrote derogatory comments about the governor and Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the building and the surrounding area.
Officials Tuesday morning quickly used brown paper to cover what authorities called “violent and vulgar rhetoric.” They said the vandalism occurred overnight, but was discovered Tuesday morning.
While Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. Mark Southall would not disclose the content of the messages graffitied on the south side of the Capitol building, he said they included “anti-ICE propaganda and threats against politicians.” He would not say if any politicians were named specifically. 
Graffiti was also inked along a nearby underpass on 23rd Street, which cuts underneath the Capitol Complex. One of the most prominent messages named Gov. Kevin Stitt while another encouraged violence against ICE, which has been actively arresting immigrants in the country without proper authorization. 
Vandalism to the Oklahoma Capitol and surrounding areas was discovered Jan. 13, 2025. One message on the underpass on 23rd Street reads “We are the Sons of Liberty.” (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)
Another message said, “We are the Sons of Liberty,” an apparent reference to a secret colonial-era group that is best known for mastermining the Boston Tea Party and that focused on undermining British rule ahead of the American Revolution.
The underpass messages had yet to be covered up or cleaned Tuesday morning.
Southall said there is video of the act and the agency’s Criminal Investigations Division is “processing evidence.” 
“It’s really disheartending because the Capitol is the people’s house where conversations happen,” Southall said. “Desecrating the Capitol is an affront on all of Oklahoma.” 
He said the cleanup efforts are expected to take multiple days and cost “several thousand dollars.” The Office of Management and Enterprise Services is responsible for the cleanup, Southall said.
A spokesperson for Stitt referred comment to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. 
Southall said the underpass is city property so it is the responsibility of the Oklahoma City Police Department. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma City Police Department said they are not the investigating agency for these incidents. 
The vandalism will be federally investigated, the department said.

Founders say federal land takeover legislation spurred formation of political action committee on behalf of hunters, anglers and other outdoor recreationists.
The post New Wyoming PAC forms to oust ‘anti-public lands’ lawmakers appeared first on WyoFile .","Legislation demanding Congress turn over 30 million acres of federal public land to Wyoming was a bridge too far for Zach Lentsch.
Although the land takeover push by state senators last legislative session was considered symbolic, legally questionable and ultimately unsuccessful, it got the Park County climbing guide fired up. 
“That was an ‘absolutely not’ moment for us,” said Lentsch, who owns Wyoming Mountain Guides. “My livelihood depends on access to public lands, and I’m a permittee on several national forests and BLM field offices across the state.”

In the months that followed, he perceived an “acceleration” of efforts in Wyoming to transfer or sell public lands. The Cody resident grouped the ongoing push to sell landowner hunting licenses — which critics say is a step toward privatizing wildlife — into the same bucket. After talking with a group of like-minded friends and receiving “great guidance and great mentorship,” Lentsch set off on his first foray into politics. 
Last week, he launched and started promoting the “Protect Wyoming PAC.” Lentsch chairs the political action committee, and a friend, Chris Allen, is the treasurer. The committee’s chief purpose is to back Wyoming state lawmakers in the 2026 election who will protect public lands, and oppose those who favor divestiture. 
“If folks are wanting to protect public lands, we’ll support them,” Lentsch said. “And if they want to sell off our public lands, we’re not going to stand by them.” 
Allen, a Johnson County resident who pays his bills selling dental equipment, emphasized the grassroots nature of their organizing effort. There aren’t big donors pulling the PAC’s strings, he said.
“It’s organic,” Allen said. “It’s a group of people who hunt and fish and climb.”

Where the Protect Wyoming PAC will direct its money remains to be seen. Candidates have until late May to file to run for office. The committee will be nonpartisan, Lentsch said.
“We don’t have to be aligned by party,” he said. “We can support whoever is going to defend our public lands.” 
By law, Lentsch and Allen will be able to direct up to $5,000 per non-statewide office candidate and make unlimited contributions to statewide candidates. The Protect Wyoming PAC is not planning to engage in congressional races, and intends, instead, to focus on lambasting state lawmakers deemed anti-public lands. 
“The sky’s the limit, at this point,” Allen said. “Mailers, we’ve got a good website, social media, events locally and across the state, fliers, billboards, all that stuff.” 
Election spending by PACs and super PACs, including from out of state, has been on the upswing in Wyoming. The latter can’t work directly with campaigns, but aren’t bound by spending limits. 
Time will tell how Lentsch and Allen’s new political action committee will fit into the broader spectrum of campaign spending.

“We launched yesterday,” Lentsch said in a Wednesday interview. “We do have fundraising goals, and we have a couple donations so far, so we’re excited about that. But we’ve got a long way to go.” 
Notably, the candidates that the Protect Wyoming PAC will likely target also figure to be assembling warchests to defend themselves and go on the offensive. 
Sen. Bob Ide, a Casper Republican, was the lead sponsor of the unsuccessful federal land takeover resolution that provoked Lentsch to mobilize. When Ide beat incumbent Sen. Drew Perkins and was elected into office in 2022, his campaign spent $58,000, the most of any state senate candidate that election cycle. 
Ide did not respond to WyoFile’s request for an interview.

The Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission voted with no dissent to allow Secretary of State Cole Jester to accept new submissions for the monument after the artist it selected in late 2023 applied for a federal copyright for her design. Jester said that move would interfere with the state’s efforts to market the anti-abortion monument.
“We couldn’t sell a Christmas tree ornament with it,” Jester said. “We couldn’t do so many things, and it would be very problematic.”
Arkansas was the first state to enact a law requiring such a monument and fundraising for it has struggled. The 2023 law called for a monument to mark the abortions that were performed in the state between the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide and the 2022 ruling overturning Roe.
The law states that Arkansans had at least 236,243 abortions between 1973 and 2022. An Arkansas law banning nearly all abortions took effect immediately with the court’s 2022 decision.
Designer of Arkansas Capitol’s upcoming ‘monument to the unborn’ sets fundraising goal

The commission had previously selected artist Lakey Goff’s idea of a “living wall” of flora and fauna for the monument and accepted her suggestion to place it in the grassy space behind the Capitol and to the north of the Supreme Court building.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas called the proposed monument “an offensive and inappropriate use of public space.”
“The decision whether to continue a pregnancy is deeply personal, and politicians should not use Capitol grounds to shame or stigmatize people for their private medical decisions,” ACLU spokesperson Megan Bailey said in a statement.
Jester told the Arts and Grounds Commission that moving forward with building the monument based on a private citizen’s copyrighted work would be “poor stewardship.”
Arkansas Right to Life, the state’s leading anti-abortion group, said in a statement that Goff is “a talented artist and a strong supporter of life” whose design was “regrettably” disqualified from public use.
Republican state Rep. Mary Bentley of Perryville and Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton, the sponsors of the law to create the monument, both supported the commission’s decision, Jester said. He also noted that Goff could resubmit a version of the Living Wall idea and the commission could select it again.
Goff told the Arkansas Advocate she has not yet decided whether to submit a new design. She said she was not aware until Tuesday’s meeting that the commission was considering moving on from her design.

She wanted to copyright her proposal so it would remain “true to my original inspiration and design, which came from the Lord, the Holy Spirit,” she said.
The proposal had an estimated $900,000 price tag, and Goff said in August 2025 that she expected to have raised a total of $100,000 for the project by the end of October. Act 310 established a trust fund to raise money through private gifts, grants and donations, and fundraising for the project began in May 2024.
The effort had raised $25,110 by August. That total is now about $28,000, Jester said Tuesday.
Commissioner Stephen Bright, a former state representative and the Secretary of State’s Chief Taxpayer Services Officer, told the New York Times last year that he hoped to change the design to reduce its cost to about $700,000. The design would be unchangeable once copyrighted.
Jester’s office will accept new submissions until March 14.
Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature passed its own law to install an abortion-related monument on Capitol grounds, also with private funds. The bronze sculpture would replicate the National Life Monument originally installed in Rome. A copy of the sculpture is on display in Washington, D.C.

(Getty Images)Efforts to criminalize doxing in Indiana moved forward Tuesday after a Senate committee approved legislation targeting the malicious and “intentional” online disclosure of personal information.
The proposal was filed amid ongoing concerns about threats and harassment tied to recent redistricting fights and now heads to the full chamber for further consideration.
Senate Bill 140, authored by Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, cleared the Senate Corrections and Criminal Law Committee on a 6–1 vote after lawmakers adopted a narrowing amendment. Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, cast the sole no vote, citing lingering concerns about the bill’s “broad” scope.
The underlying bill would create a new criminal offense for doxing — defined as the intentional sharing of personal information about a “targeted person” — or someone closely connected to them — when done with the intent to threaten or place them in fear of bodily harm.
Lawmakers have said the proposal was prompted by a string of bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting legislators and others during the December redistricting debate.
Indiana lawmakers consider anti-doxing bill following redistricting bomb, swatting threats

Before advancing, the committee adopted an amendment to narrow the bill’s reach by removing “coworkers” from the definition of a person closely connected to the targeted individual and explicitly stating that “personal information” could include only an individual’s name.
Committee chair Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said the amendment addressed concerns Brown had raised previously about the bill’s breadth.
“I heard Sen. Brown and I agreed with her,” Freeman said. “I thought (the language) was a little broad. I agreed — took it out.”
Still, Brown said she remained uneasy even after the change, particularly with language that could sweep in private communications.
“I am a little bit concerned, too, about the broadness of the section with respect to any email, post, text,” Brown said. “You could even be texting … or emailing someone privately … and they would be included in this.”
Freeman said further changes could come later in the legislative process.
“Not disagreeing with you,” Freeman said. “My suggestion would be, let’s move it. Let’s get it out of here, and I’m happy to continue to work on it.”
Targeted lawmakers included those for and against President Donald Trump’s failed push to eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic congressional seats in favor of a 9-0 Republican delegation, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The Indiana Senate voted the maps down mid-December, after months of intense pressure and weeks of threats.
Those included swatting attempts at lawmakers’ homes — hoax reports to emergency services intended to trigger armed responses — plus bomb threats and more. No arrests have been made.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)The owner and operator of a landfill in Bethlehem will pay $1.9 million in penalties to the state for multiple alleged violations.
The fine is the largest civil penalty ever assessed for a violation of the state’s Solid Waste Management Act, said Attorney General John Formella in a press release Monday. The release announced the settlement between the state and North Country Environmental Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems, Inc., which operates a landfill in Bethlehem.
“I think it’s good that they’re held accountable for the issues,” said Nancy Strand, Bethlehem Select Board chair, in a phone call Tuesday. However, she said, given the size of the companies involved, the penalty amounted to “a slap on the wrist.” In 2025, Casella Waste Systems estimated total revenue at about $1.84 billion, according to a financial report released in October. 
Alleged violations at the landfill include placement of waste outside the permitted limits of the landfill; failure to prevent leaks of leachate, or toxic trash effluent; storage of more leachate than allowed within the landfill; failure to investigate and report certain violations; a hole in the primary landfill liner, which is intended to help keep trash and leachate contained; drilling through another overlay liner; and failing to adequately cover the landfill at the end of a working day. 
The consent decree settlement agreement does not contain a judgment on the facts around, or liability for, the alleged violations. But payment of the $1.9 million penalty, according to the terms of the agreement, will conclude the case around those alleged violations.
The fine is for past violations, and is issued “on top of” costs Casella has incurred to address those on site in Bethlehem, said Christopher G. Aslin, senior assistant attorney general, in an email Tuesday.

“Over the last two years we have invested significantly in improving the operations of the North Country Environmental Services landfill,” said Jeff Weld, a spokesperson for Casella Waste Systems, in an email. “We have worked to address compliance matters at the site by improving our control and monitoring systems, and replacing our management team.”
Wayne Morrison, of North Country Alliance for Balanced Change, wrote in a press release Tuesday that the violations were the result of “a pattern of chronic noncompliance.” The alliance has advocated against a proposed Casella landfill in Dalton and proposed expansions in Bethlehem.
The terms of the settlement may call for North Country Environmental Services, Inc., to expend a portion of the penalty funds on a separate project involving remediating the erosion of landfill debris into the Saco River in Bartlett, at the site of a former municipal landfill. The state is awaiting the results of a study on possible routes for remediation and cost estimates, Aslin said. 
Based on the outcome of that study, the state will decide whether to move ahead with the remediation project, he said. The remainder of the $1.9 million will be paid to the state, according to the terms of the settlement.
The Bethlehem landfill at the heart of the settlement has been the focus of many conversations around waste management in New Hampshire in recent years and the current legislative session. Strand said she hoped the settlement would bring attention to the status of the landfill and the town’s concerns.
“I think it’s a positive step because it recognizes the problems, at least some of the problems, that our landfill in particular has had,” she said. “It may help explain to outsiders why we’re kind of wary of the business relationship with (Casella).”

The committee also heard a bill that would restore the presidential primary, which was eliminated in 2022, as well as double the time allowed for early voting from two weeks to four weeks. A vote on both bills is expected next week.
Murphy’s bill is a response to fundraising tactics used by former state Sen. Bill Eigel, a Republican from St. Charles, who used it to finance his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2024 and is pulling money from donors to that campaign to fund his bid this year for St. Charles County executive.
Murphy said he filed the bill after The Independent reported in November that a 92-year-old Nebraska veteran who thought he had given once to Eigel’s campaign in 2023 was tapped 35 times, for $1,050 total, from December 2024 through Sept. 30 because of an automatic recurring donation.
Russell Wood is one of 141 people nationally — including six from Missouri — who made multiple donations to Eigel’s 2024 campaign for governor who are also contributors to his St. Charles County executive race. 
How a Nebraska veteran unwittingly became a repeat donor to a Missouri county campaign

One retired woman in Texas, who made 143 donations to Eigel’s campaign for governor, contributed $1,205 in 74 separate donations since December 2024.
BILL PAC, a separate committee that promotes Eigel’s campaigns, also uses the tactic.
The latest campaign donation reports are due Thursday and will show whether those donations continued during the final quarter of the year.
Eigel’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the bill.
Murphy’s bill would ban any political committee from accepting automatically recurring donations although, under questioning, he said he would be willing to change it to allow people to set up recurring donations if they wish.
The bill would also require solicitations to “state clearly, in a clear and conspicuous manner” which candidate or committee would benefit from a donation.
Murphy did not name Eigel during Tuesday’s hearing but said his campaign was soliciting contributions without giving his name but with an appeal that brought an emotional response.
“As it turned out, there were elderly people that said, ‘oh, yeah, I’m against this particular issue, so therefore I’m going to give $20 to fight this issue’,” Murphy said. “They had no idea where the money was really going to and then years later, they’re still trying to get off the automatic contribution rolls, and it’s turned into thousands of dollars.”
If the bill passed, it would not stop candidates for federal office from using solicitations that create automatic, recurring donations, Murphy said in response to questions. 
The problem, he said, isn’t limited to federal candidates and needs a state response.
“Politicians don’t have the best reputation in the world,” he said. “Some of it is deserved and some of it is certainly not. But when campaigns do things like this, they certainly do not do any of us a service and they don’t do the country any service.”
 Presidential primary

Missouri conducted its first presidential primary in 1988 but did not have a regular primary until 2000. The law authorizing the primary was repealed in 2022, but confusion in 2024 over how national convention delegates are selected shows it should be restored, state Rep. Peggy McGaugh, a Republican from Carrollton, told the elections committee.
“We found it was even worse, and it was hard to manage for the parties,” McGaugh said of using a caucus system instead of a primary.
A similar bill passed the House last year but did not come up for a vote in the state Senate.
Boone County residents line up in October 2024 for no-excuse absentee voting at the Boone County Government Center in Columbia (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The primary would be held on the first Tuesday in March of each presidential election year. The bill does not require political parties to allocate delegates based on the primary results and actual delegates would continue to be chosen in party caucuses and conventions.
The bill including a presidential primary is a wide-ranging elections bill backed by county clerks and election authorities statewide. It would extend the early voting period, increase the area around a polling place where political solicitations are banned from 25 to 50 feet and allow more time for candidates seeking local offices to file their candidacies.
McGaugh said she attached the extension of early voting — called no-excuse absentee voting and currently only allowed for the final two weeks before an election — because it has proven to be wildly popular.
The bill would double that period to four weeks.
Long lines formed in both urban and rural counties as people took advantage of the law, she said. Election authorities like it because it gives them time to solve individual voter problems, McGaugh added.
“It was exciting,” she said. “It brought excitement back to voting.”
Missourians can vote absentee as early as six weeks before the election but must be able to show a reason, such as having a disability or being away from home, to vote that early. 
Kurt Bahr, director of elections for St. Charles County, said he saw about 300 voters per day using the traditional reasons for voting absentee but the number jumped to 4,000 to 5,000 per day once the early voting period began.
“We’d love to see all six weeks but I don’t think there is enough agreement in this building,” Bahr said.
The early voting period was included in the 2022 bill that ended the presidential primary. That law also required voters to show a government-issued ID card, with photo, date of birth and an expiration date, prior to voting. 
Republicans opposed early voting and wrote the bill to end it if a court struck down the identification requirement. It was upheld by a Cole County judge in November 2024 but the decision was appealed and a ruling is pending from the Missouri Supreme Court.
McGaugh’s bill would not remove the link between the provisions of law.
Voters like early voting and a longer period would make the process go smoother, Bahr said.
“It was insanity,” he said, “not just in St Charles County, but every county, even rural counties, because of how many people were trying to come in and vote.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Murphy-Eigel-bill-20260113-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 12:59:46.357794

During his remarks, Perez briefly touched on an array of topics ranging from taxes to the economy to affordability and insurance to the costs of  “public benefits.”
“We have been summoned here to the Capitol by the Constitution of the State of Florida. We have been called to spend the next nine weeks conducting the business of the people. And that is what we will do — with all the energy, determination, and creativity we can muster. We will approach this task with an open hand, an open mind, and an open heart. The Florida House stands ready to work with anyone who is willing to put the needs of our state first,” Perez said.
“We must ensure Florida stays at the center of our planet’s race for the stars, and that our infrastructure keeps pace with our growth. Every child in Florida, from the unborn to our college graduates, deserves a fair shot at finding their own American Dream.”

Perez delivered his second and final opening day speech of his two-year term as House speaker — a stint marked by quarrels with Gov. Ron DeSantis over state spending levels, homeowners insurance, the elimination of homestead property taxes, and immigration. 
DeSantis vetoed Perez’s a priority bill from the 2025 session, which would have revamped a long-standing law that bans parents of single childless adult children and adult children of single parents from suing physicians and hospitals for wrongful death stemming from medical malpractice.
Perez did not, however, mention those skirmishes with the governor and instead focused his speech on the chamber’s ability, he said, to celebrate triumphs and in the face of adversity to  “come together” and “find our way through.”
“We stand here today ready to write together the second half of our story. And I can’t tell you how many reporters and lobbyists and others in the process have asked me, ‘What is going to happen this session?’ It’s like they want me to give away the ending. 
“Honestly, I don’t know what is going to happen. That’s okay, because the journey is the best part. I would not have traded any of the moments we have shared together — the friendships and the fights, the laughter and the tears. I would not have traded this experience just for a little more peace or a little more quiet.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7861-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 12:59:46.357794

Jim Himes' approach to navigating the second Trump presidency.,"U.S. Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT-3) is a member of the minority in Congress. How is he using his limited power during a rapidly changing era in American politics?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Lisa Hagen to discuss her article, “How Jim Himes navigates Congress in ‘unprecedented’ Trump era,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Lisa’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Lisa. A couple of weeks ago, the U.S. struck Venezuela and captured its president without informing Congress prior to the attack. You say that prompted you to investigate how Jim Himes (D-CT-4) is handling his role as the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, considering they were kept in the dark. Tell us a little bit about the role that Jim Himes plays and how he’s handling the situation right now.
LH: Yeah, it’s a very influential position that he’s in as ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, and so typically, he’s part of a very small group of people that can be privy to some of the earliest information on really major military action. And so whether it’s been a Republican or Democratic administration in more recent years, you know, a lot of the time they haven’t been able to give, or haven’t wanted to give Congress much of a heads up. Typically, maybe they’ll tell Congress, you know, right after something happens. So you know, not all the time are members of Congress getting notified, even seeking congressional approval. But I think what’s been interesting for Jim Himes over the last six months was whether it was military strikes in Iran or in Venezuela, he not only did not get a heads up, but never heard from anyone in the administration, either right away or for a couple of days on what happened, and he was finding out just like the rest of the public. So he’s kind of been put in this interesting position, given how prominent of a role this is.
WSHU: Now, tell us a little bit about the Gang of Eight. He’s a member of the Gang of Eight. What is the Gang of Eight?
LH: The Gang of Eight. It’s a, you know, jargony kind of DC term, but it’s a group of eight lawmakers. It is the top Senate and House leaders in both parties. So it’s Speaker of the House, Senate Majority Leader, Minority Leader, etc, and it’s the chairs and ranking members on both the intelligence committees on the Senate and the House side. So Jim Himes had been one of the Gang of Eight since he was elevated to his role as ranking member in 2023, and so again, he gets some of the earliest intelligence and gets briefed by administration officials, you know, usually in cases like this, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense. And so again, these are a group of eight lawmakers that are supposed to directly hear from the administration, either, you know, early or right after, when we were seeing something like a major bombing or strike.
WSHU: So, dealing with the situation the way it is being kept in the dark, how is he trying to navigate that situation to play a role in what happens going forward, considering we’re talking about a number of foreign adventures right now?
LH: Yeah, it seems like, you know, it can be fairly difficult, because of the sensitive nature of his role. You know, there’s only so much he can share publicly, but it sounds like, you know, he’s able to kind of go behind the scenes, go through back channels, and so maybe he’s not getting face time or direct contact with some of you know, these major cabinet officials, but he’s able to kind of talk to other people, not just the Rubio’s and the Hegseth’s, but he’s able to talk to other people who he has working relationships with and, you know, he, I think he has a reputation on both sides of the aisle of being to be able to work on intelligence matters. And so, at least what has been able to be shared with me, it sounds like he’s able to kind of talk through some of this and maybe try to insert his opinion and direction, sort of military matters going forward. And so it sounds like he’s trying to use whatever sway he has in Congress to do so.
WSHU: There’s been a lot of talk about the War Powers Act and Congress taking more control over how decisions are made. There’s been some movement in Congress right now. Is Himes involved in any of that?
LH: Yes, he was mentioning that. The House is also going to take up the War Powers Resolution. So the Senate has already passed that, with several Republicans joining Democrats in being able to pass that, reigning in the Trump administration from being able to further engage in military action in Venezuela without getting approval from Congress. And so they’re going to make similar efforts in the house. And so, we’ll see how that plays out. And you know, this was specifically on military action in Venezuela, but they are probably going to be other efforts in Congress to do similar war powers acts in other countries, given the threats coming out of the Trump administration on that.
WSHU: Now, Lisa, you said, speaking with Himes, you got the sense that he feels that a little bit, there’s a glimmer of hope that some of this might be reined in by Congress. What does he base that on?
LH: Honestly, it’s pure politics. It seems like you know, he was talking about the fact that, since there were local and statewide elections happening in several states back in November, including in Connecticut, where Democrats performed really well and, in some cases, maybe even outperformed. He said that kind of kick-started, maybe some Republicans are changing their tune. And again, it’s only, we’re only seeing pushback in certain forms. And it’s, you know, it’s not the entire party, but we are seeing a real realignment in certain ways. And whether that’s on the War Powers Act, whether that’s on expired Affordable Care Act subsidies, and he’s saying the fact that we are currently in an election year, in November, there will be major midterm elections, and the balance of power in Congress could change. He’s kind of looking at that as seeing small, little shifts in Congress, but again, very small.
WSHU: So, any chance that if Trump vetoes any of the actions of Congress, there’ll be the ability to override a Trump veto?
LH: They’ve tried already on some pretty small bills. They were things that I don’t even think passed in roll call votes. They were, you know, done through unanimous consent. These were, you know, pretty innocuous-sounding things that were even being pushed by Republicans, and the President had vetoed them. And so last week, we saw Congress, or the House, trying to override these vetoes. I think some Republicans went with Democrats on that, but they were not able to overcome that. And so we will see if there continue to be vetoes, if Congress will try to reassert its power in certain ways, and override some of those vetoes.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_9690-2-scaled-e1715647589371-1024x723.jpg,,,2026-01-13 15:11:50.176370
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-13 17:12:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Medical errors led to deaths of 2 incarcerated men prescribed methadone,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/13/report-medical-errors-led-to-deaths-of-2-incarcerated-men-prescribed-methadone/,CT Inspector General found that “significant medical errors” were made when prescribing methadone to Ronald Johnson and Tyler Cole.,"An investigation by the Connecticut Office of the Inspector General released Monday found that “significant medical errors” were made when prescribing methadone to Ronald Johnson and Tyler Cole, two young men who died from the combined effects of methadone and other prescribed medications while incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution. 
“The investigation suggests that both Johnson and Cole received initial doses of methadone that were too high for them, and their doses were increased too rapidly,” the report read. “The investigation further suggests that insufficient attention was given to the fact that Johnson and Cole were receiving medications that enhanced the respiratory suppression effects of methadone.”  
The state Department of Correction has administered a program known as medication assisted treatment, or MAT, since 2013, for patients addicted to opioids or heroin. As of last year some type of MAT existed in 10 of Connecticut’s 13 correctional facilities. The department contracts with Recovery Network of Programs Inc. in Shelton, which is responsible for distributing methadone at Garner. 
Johnson had been transferred from Rikers Island to Garner in July 2024. When he was first admitted to Garner, he was found to have “moderate to severe” opioid use as well as a history of other drug use, according to the inspector’s report. On July 10, 2024 he tested negative for opioids and was prescribed 30 mg of methadone, which was increased to 40 mg after two days. 
According to the report, Johnson was found with an inmate request form in his pocket. On the form, he had written, “I think I could be having a bad reaction to the methadone because my feet are very swollen till the point that it is noticible.” He had also spoken with a friend the day before his death in which he’d spoken about his swollen feet.
According to the report, a white pill was found near Johnson that DOC investigators identified as Vraylar, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The state Medical Examiner’s office later contended that the drug was Prozac. Johnson hadn’t been prescribed either medication. 
Guidelines from medical organizations, cited in the report, warn that doctors should take caution not to increase doses of methadone too quickly and to prescribe lower doses to patients who are considered to be “high risk.” 
While an initial methadone dose can be between 10 mg and 30 mg, The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Manitoba advises that for “high risk” patients, that first dose should be between 5 mg and 20 mg. High risk patients include people who are on sedative medications or antipsychotics, as well as those who have not taken opioids for a significant period of time. 
At the time of his death, Johnson had been incarcerated for nearly two months, meaning it was likely he had not taken an opioid for a significant period, and he was being prescribed an antipsychotic. The Inspector General’s office said that these facts should have prevented the medical staff from starting him at such a high dose of methadone or increasing that dose so quickly. 
“In Johnson’s case, it is likely that his body could not handle the amount of methadone that he was receiving each day, and it accumulated to a toxic level that (along with the Seroquel and Zyprexa) caused him to stop breathing,” the report read. “His death should have raised immediate red flags in DOC regarding whether other inmates were receiving medically appropriate doses of methadone.”   
Just two days after Johnson’s death, another young man at Garner, Tyler Cole, died from a combination of methadone and antipsychotic drugs he was prescribed. 
During his intake at Bridgeport Correctional Center on June 13, 2024, Cole told medical staff that he had used heroin and drank Hennessy cognac that day. Soon after, he was transferred to Garner. It was more than a month later, on July 19, when Cole was first given methadone. He was given an initial dose of 30 mg. The next day, it was raised to 40 mg. 
Like Johnson, Cole would have been considered a high risk patient, since he had not taken an opioid for over a month and was being prescribed both a sedative and an antipsychotic medication. 
The same guidelines from the College of Physicians & Surgeons of Manitoba say that methadone doses should be increased by 5 mg every 3 to 5 days, or 10 mg every 7 days. The American Society of Addiction Medicine advises increasing methadone doses “no more than 10 mg approximately every 5 days.”  
[RELATED: Drug overdoses in CT prisons raising alarms]
A lawyer for Cole’s family, Ken Krayeske, filed a claim with the state’s Claim Commissioner in 2025 asking for permission to sue the Department of Correction and requesting $25 million in damages. Krayeske called the increase from 30 mg to 40 mg within 24 hours a “pretty outrageous” jump, which wouldn’t have given Cole time to build up tolerance to the drug.
“Certainly, his dose should not have been increased to 40 mg after only one day in the program,” the Inspector General’s report read. “It is likely that methadone was starting to accumulate in his system; but the methadone’s interaction with the antipsychotic drugs and the Clonazepam (a benzodiazepine) depressed his respiration to the point where he could not breathe.” 
The Inspector General’s report did not find that medical professionals who prescribed the methadone engaged in any “criminal action.” 
“Johnson and Cole should have been prescribed no more than 20 mg of methadone per day for the first three days of therapy. Perhaps, even a lower dose was more appropriate. Thereafter, the dose should have increased at the rate of no more than 5 mg every 3 to 5 days with careful assessment of their reaction. Instead, they received the typical initial dose of 30 mg that ramped up quickly to 40 mg with fatal consequences,” the report read.
The report also notes that, in both cases, doctors or medical professionals who prescribed the methadone did not meet in person with either of the men. 
Reached by phone, Cole’s mother, Tracy Ciccone and his stepfather Jason Ciccone said they wanted the Department of Correction and the medical professionals involved with Cole’s death to be held responsible. 
“ This can’t happen again to other people,” said Jason Ciccone. “It’s a tragedy, and going forward they’ve really got to clean things up.” 
Tracy Ciccone said she felt the people involved should lose their jobs, and that Cole’s son should receive some type of monetary compensation for the events of his father’s death. 
“It’s frustrating, I think, for us, because there’s a little boy whose dad was killed. There’s a mom who lost her son, and the Office of the Inspector General says ‘This is tragic, but I can’t take any action against anybody,’” said Krayeske.  
The Inspector General’s report warned against eliminating methadone programs in prisons overall, noting that allowing incarcerated men and women who are detoxing from opioids to access methadone improves their ability to reenter their communities after they leave prison. But the report said the department should take “immediate and substantial steps” to address how the methadone program was being run.  
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said in a statement to the Connecticut Mirror that after Cole and Johnson’s deaths, the department conducted a review of the Medication Assisted Treatment program “to ensure that it is being administered as effectively and safely as possible.”
According to the report, and to Banevicius, the Department of Correction plans to hire an addiction medicine specialist to work across the prison facilities, and they will no longer start patients at Garner Correctional Institution on methadone because of the risk of combining methadone with antipsychotic medications.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PRISON-OVERDOSES-0113-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 12:12:45.779428

He also owns and operates Dooley Ag Stewardship Inc., which sells seed and cover crop mixes and offers custom seed application.
Dooley is gunning for the Democratic nomination on the ticket to replace current Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, who is running for reelection. Naig, a Republican, has been in the role since 2018. 
Dooley said he is running because the communities and families the depend on agriculture “deserve a partner who will help them succeed.”

The board's January meeting included a motion to downgrade St. Louis Public Schools' accreditation status (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri State Board of Education stripped St. Louis Public Schools of its status as fully accredited onTuesday a move the only opposing board member called a “messaging device.”
The school district has been downgraded to provisionally accredited. 
“Lowering accreditation is a broad signal and by itself does not fix audits, stabilize transportation or strengthen governance,” said Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, a board member from Pasadena Hills.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education planned only to raise accreditation during the state board meeting Tuesday, boosting the Osborn School District from provisional to full accreditation following its hiring of a superintendent in order to meet certification requirements.
Missouri senators question education officials about efforts to help struggling schools

The department has been looking at factors like superintendent certification and financial security to determine whether a school district is fully accredited since the launch of the Missouri School Improvement 6 in 2022. Any changes to accreditation based on MSIP6 scores are not supposed to be implemented until next year, which has drawn criticism from state lawmakers who want low-performing schools penalized sooner rather than later.
State board member Kerry Casey, of Chesterfield, asked the board to lower St. Louis Public Schools to provisional accreditation based on factors outside of MSIP6. She cited leadership instability, transportation issues, a poor rating from the State Auditor and the district’s late submission of its annual financial report to the state.
“(My recommendation) is strictly based on the fact that they have experienced significant change in the scope of effectiveness of their programs and their financial integrity upon which their original designation was based, and they have failed to comply with the statutory requirement,” Casey said. “If we do not make this lower classification change, we are not doing our job.”
Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said she was “very dissatisfied” that the district turned in its financial report late and thought about recommending to lower its accreditation. But she didn’t think the move would solve any problems.
Charter schools can open in areas where a school district has been provisionally accredited for three or more consecutive years. But state law already allows charter schools in St. Louis.
“The provisional tag on the school district is not going to make that big of a difference,” Eslinger said. “Why I did not make that recommendation is I’d rather have them at the table with me and working with me.”
A spokesperson for St. Louis Public Schools could not be immediately reached for comment on the board’s decision. 
State education officials have been working with the district, Eslinger said, and the department has convened a group of school leaders and local stakeholders to brainstorm solutions for St. Louis Public Schools and other underperforming districts.
“Putting those plans together, I see good things ahead for St Louis,” Eslinger told the board.
When she took office as commissioner in 2024, St. Louis Public Schools’ leadership did not return calls or emails, she said.
“We do now have a relationship, and we’re being very honest and upfront about the issues that they have,” Eslinger said.
Westbrooks-Hodge, whose district includes St. Louis, was the only board member to speak against Casey’s motion. She pointed out that the district had incremental growth in its annual performance reports, and she worried it was being singled out.
“Using reclassification primarily to send a message risks blurring the distinction MSIP6 intentionally draws between academic performance and governance or financial stress and risks, weakening the consistency and credibility of classification systems statewide,” she said.
Casey and the other five board members voted by voice in favor of the motion.
Last January, Casey made a similar motion but did not receive a second supporter to spur a vote. In reaction, the American Federation of Teachers St. Louis called for Casey’s resignation from the board. Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin shared her support for Casey’s decision on social media, saying: “This has long been needing to happen but for some reason hasn’t.”

(Photo by Will Jacott/Minnesota Reformer) Minneapolis Public Schools placed its top three finance department leaders on administrative leave more than a week ago — but the district has not provided any public explanation.
The district has communicated the personnel changes to a narrow group of employees, but has not shared the information with school staff. The district has declined to comment to the Reformer, citing state privacy law. 
The significant personnel moves come as the district, already facing fiscal uncertainty, grapples with an audit whose delivery to the Minnesota Department of Education is already late. The district has declined to talk about that, as well.  
The Reformer has reached out to all five school board members who sit on the finance committee: Abdul Abdi, board treasurer; Collin Beachy, board chair; Greta Callahan; Kim Ellison, board vice chair; and Joyner Emerick. None would comment on the record. 
The school board will meet in executive session, closed to the public, to “discuss potential litigation in an employment-related matter” and “preliminary consideration of charges and allegations against an individual subject to the Board’s authority,” at 4 p.m. Tuesday, according to the official meeting notice. 
It is not clear from the notice whether these topics are related to Ibrahima Diop, Tariro Chapinduka or Aaron Gilbert, the three employees placed on leave.
There is nothing on the agenda for the board’s public meeting Tuesday that indicates the district will provide information about why the finance department leaders were placed on leave.
The district has started assigning some of the senior finance officers’ roles to Senior Executive Officer Ryan Strack. The school board approved a series of annual financial authorizations that included transferring multiple authorities to Strack, which in prior years the board had assigned to Diop in his role as senior finance officer. By Friday, Jan. 9, the Minnesota Department of Education had changed its website to name Strack as the district’s business agent — a role previously assigned to Diop.
Strack has not previously worked in the district’s finance department. He started at the district as a social worker, and at least as far back as 2018, under former Superintendent Ed Graff, worked as a liaison between the school board and the superintendent. 
Diop was hired by Milwaukee Public Schools on Dec. 18, 2025, to serve as a deputy superintendent of operations, according to WTMJ in Milwaukee. This is the day before his departure from Minneapolis Public Schools was announced to district staff. On Jan. 8, Milwaukee Public Schools informed district employees that Diop would not be joining the district.
The people of Milwaukee — and, for that matter, Minneapolis — might want to know the cause of this notable development, but at this point, Minneapolis Schools has declined to tell the public anything.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:58:41.794281

Dan McKeon of Amherst speaking before deciding to resign moments before the floor debate and possible vote to expel him in the Nebraska Capitol on Jan. 13, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Instead of possibly becoming the first sitting senator expelled from the Nebraska Legislature, State Sen. Dan McKeon resigned minutes before floor debate was set to begin. 
McKeon faced expulsion following allegations he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer — allegations he denies. The Legislature’s Executive Board, which oversees the legislative branch’s internal discipline, introduced Legislative Resolution 282 for his expulsion. 
That resolution was up for floor debate Tuesday. Just before the debate began at around 10 a.m., McKeon took the microphone and resigned his seat representing Legislative District 41. 
“This last year has humbled me,” McKeon said tearfully. 
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, who vocally supported McKeon’s expulsion, said she believed there were enough votes to expel McKeon — it required 33 — after checking with lawmakers Tuesday morning. 
The staffer reported that McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to an investigative report from outside counsel Tara Paulson. 
A separate police report after the incident led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in October. Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace. McKeon pleaded not guilty after originally signaling his intent to plead no contest. His next court date is Jan. 26.

The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
McKeon’s varied responses to the allegation, as well as additional allegations against the senator that have surfaced since then, contributed to the Exec Board’s resolution, said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, the board’s chair. 
Paulson’s report concluded that McKeon’s actions did not constitute actionable sexual harassment under state or federal law. However, she said the actions may violate the Legislature’s own workplace harassment policy. That policy includes “sexually oriented jokes” in its definition of sexual harassment.
“Actionable is not tantamount to acceptable,” Paulson said.
Paulson added that she believes McKeon’s actions “should not be tolerated” by the Legislature, as it could foster a hostile work environment, which in legal circles could put taxpayers at risk of a state claim. Neary has said her client is considering filing a civil lawsuit, but hasn’t specified what parties would be targeted.

Bill Huizenga has become one of the few Republican members of Congress pushing back on the interventions of President Donald Trump’s administration in Venezuela following the United States’ capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3, which United Nations’ officials and Amnesty International say occurred in violation of international law.
The Holland Township Republican specifically expressed to NOTUS worries about the role of Delcy Rodríguez, who served as Maduro’s vice president, as the acting president of the country. Huizenga has repeatedly supported Edmundo González Urrutia, who ran against Maduro in the 2024 presidential election and was seen by many international leaders as the rightful winner of that election, as well as other Venezuelan opposition leaders like María Corina Machado, winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. 
“When are we going to get to either recognizing González or an actual free, fair election that the results will be recognized?” Huizenga told NOTUS that he had asked the administration.

In the immediate wake of Maduro’s capture, Huizenga expressed support for the mission and its outcome in a press release — adding his support for González Urrutia
“Anyone connected with Maduro should be viewed as illegitimate,” he wrote on Jan. 3. “The United States should recognize Edmundo González Urrutia, the rightful winner of the past election, as President and work with him in this time of transition until the Venezuelan people can hold a free and fair election.”
Huizenga also criticized Trump’s plans to have the United States establish control over Venezuela’s oil industry and reserves, asking in a classified briefing, according to NOTUS, what the administration’s plan to do so was, saying he had not received full or satisfactory answers to those questions. 
“If they [administration officials] hadn’t thought through all the details, let’s get them talking about those kinds of details, because those details are very important with the goal and objective that those proceeds are used properly,” he said, adding that oil proceeds should “not support the Maduro leftover regime.”
In criticizing the administration, Huizenga joins a small group of Republican colleagues who have broken with the Trump administration on the intervention in Venezuela, including the five GOP U.S. senators who voted to advance a war powers resolution that would halt U.S. military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Does one vote really make a difference in an election?


With mail-in voting starting this month for North Carolina’s 2026 Primary, a new report answers that question with a decisive “yes.”


Research from Common Cause North Carolina reveals how one person’s vote — or decision not to vote — made the difference in who won or lost in three dozen North Carolina elections last year. Seven contests for mayor or town council ended in a tie. In another 15 elections, the winner prevailed by just one vote. And in 14 other cases, a two-vote margin of victory would have vanished if one of the winner’s voters had chosen the losing candidate.


That’s 36 North Carolina contests with outcomes determined by one voter.


For example, out west, with the flip of a coin, John Shepherd won his 2025 race for a seat on the Jefferson Town Council. In the eastern North Carolina town of Whitakers, John Ford emerged the winner of a tie vote for a seat on the town board when his name was pulled from a cardboard box. In 2019, Ford lost a tied contest when his opponent’s name was drawn from a box.


It was the same story 10 years ago in the Sandhills town of Garland, when a tied race was also resolved “by lot” or chance, as required by state law. In that case, candidates put colored pens in a box, and the elections board chair picked the winner’s purple pen. In that same year, 69 North Carolina mayors or town council members won their election by five or fewer votes.
These types of results over the past decade aren’t a fluke. In a similar analysis of 2019’s local elections, in 39 cities, the decision of one voter could have turned a loser into a winner.
The winners of these local elections have a direct impact on our lives. They make decisions affecting community projects, public health and safety, taxes, and more. Local electeds can also use these positions as a steppingstone to gain even more power. In 2003, Thom Tillis tied for a seat on the Cornelius town council and went on to become a state legislator, then N.C. House Speaker, and now a U.S. Senator.


But local elections aren’t the only ones where a single voter makes a difference.


In 2020, incumbent N.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley lost her statewide race to opponent Paul Newby by 401 votes out of over 5.5 million votes cast. That means less than one vote in each of North Carolina’s 550 incorporated municipalities could have determined who would run our state’s highest court.
Similar to the stakes in 2026, the result of that single Beasley-Newby race would ultimately shift the trajectory of our judiciary. In the years since, the Newby Court has been responsible for reversing key decisions that protected voters from rampant gerrymandering, opened the door for more delays in long overdue education funding in the Leandro case, and driven “changes that have reverberated well beyond the borders of his state.”


As we look ahead to this year’s elections, it’s also worth mentioning that in the last midterm, only about half (51.14%) of the state’s registered voters (3,790,202 out of 7,412,050) cast a ballot. Those who chose not to vote had as much impact as those who did — determining everything from the balance of power of the U.S. Senate to how powerful county sheriffs enforce laws around everything from health access to immigration.


Just as your vote can be pivotal in any North Carolina election, sharing the power of that vote with others can help jumpstart a movement that could drive the millions who stayed home in 2022 to make a different choice this year.

New Mexico Finance Authority officials said on Jan. 12, 2026, that they’d approved nearly $75 million in housing loans, but mostly in urban areas. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Two years after the Legislature entrusted the New Mexico Finance Authority with $125 million to spur construction of middle-income and affordable housing, the authority has loaned out almost $75 million of it in support of roughly 700 new housing units.
But the majority of that funding has benefited urban areas, lawmakers on the House Appropriations and Finance Committee noted at a meeting Monday, despite lawmakers’ intent to boost housing development in rural New Mexico. 
“I definitely don’t want the money being unspent, but at the same time, we have an obligation to make sure that our rural communities have access to the funds,” said state Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque).
NM Finance Authority says it’s approved $52 million in housing loans

The Legislature in 2024 allocated $125 million for NMFA’s Opportunity Enterprise Revolving Loan fund and also amended the loan program to make developers and nonprofit organizations eligible to receive loans for housing projects. 
The low-interest loans are limited to affordable housing infrastructure, like sewer or electricity to an affordable housing project, or construction of “workforce” housing, designed for people who can’t afford housing but earn too much income to qualify for state and federal housing subsidies. 
During a presentation to the committee Monday, NMFA Deputy Director Fernando Martinez listed three infrastructure and seven housing projects the authority has approved in three funding rounds since September 2024. Three of the projects are in Santa Fe and four are in Albuquerque, both urban areas. The final three are in rural Taos, Alamogordo and Los Lunas. 
That mix of urban or rural housing projects appears to be right at the limit the Legislature contemplated when it created the housing loan fund. The fund requires at least 30% of projects to be completed in rural areas, and it prohibits more than 50% of projects from being within any one county. 
Martinez acknowledged the issue but said few rural organizations have expressed interest in the grants. 
“There’s not enough interested entities in the rural communities that can qualify at this time,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of problems with that.”
Dixon suggested the legislative NMFA Oversight Committee consider devising changes to the law that would encourage more rural organizations to seek  the loans, but also suggested possibly lowering the required percentage of projects that must go to rural areas. 
“I think the oversight committee needs to seriously consider modifying the legislation and the rural and frontier percentages, because if that money is not going to be able to be spent, we don’t want it just sitting there,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9539-1024x964.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:58:41.794281

Ben Albritton delivers opening day remarks ahead of the 2026 session. (Photo by Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton gaveled in the chamber Tuesday for 2026 legislative session, outlining his priorities of revitalizing rural Florida and cutting costs — while offering a tribute to Gov. Ron DeSantis.
It will be DeSantis’ final session as governor, whose tenure Albritton characterized as “unpredictable, surprising, energetic, trailblazing,” and, at times, “rough and tumble.” The Wauchula Republican acknowledged the “different” session experienced last year, but, he said “we completed our mission.”
“I’m not king of the Senate — collaboration and communication are the driving forces here,” Albritton told lawmakers, speaking to a chamber packed with senators’ families, the Cabinet, and Lt. Gov Jay Collins, himself a former senator. DeSantis, ahead of his State of the State address, was not present.
“I’m here to serve Floridians and each of you, in my own way, using Biblical principles,” Albritton continued.
The 2025 session was marked by an unanticipated rebellion against DeSantis by the GOP supermajority Legislature. Spearheaded by House Speaker Danny Perez — and briefly supported by Albritton — lawmakers insisted on asserting independence from the governor, a stark contrast to the domination DeSantis enjoyed for most of his administration.
The mass discord led to disagreements over the budget, the only measure constitutionally required to pass each year. It ended up being signed into law just days before the July 1 deadline.
‘Rural Renaissance’
Albritton, entering his second and final year as Senate president, launched into a salute to what he characterized as the Trump administration’s dedication to rural America. He described a discussion he had with U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who Albritton said plans to make his “Rural Renaissance” legislation a “national model across the United States.”
Last session, Albritton’s “Rural Renaissance” package died when the House refused to adopt Senate language. Its provisions — revitalized this year — include funding for rural roads, housing, education, healthcare, and business to the tune of $217.9 million.
Part of this rural focus will extend to citrus, a driving force in Florida’s agricultural economy, Albritton said. This will expand on last year’s “Make Citrus Great Again” and “Farmers Feeding Florida” initiatives.
“Citrus has been a pillar of our state since the 1500s and remains a key part of Florida’s Rural Renaissance,” Albritton said. “Research and new technologies offered renewed hope for the future of citrus in Florida. I’m keeping my foot on the gas — Florida Citrus is not going down on my watch.”
 Affordability and property taxes
The Senate president’s other priority this session is affordability. However, he cautioned that the Legislature’s ability to address skyrocketed costs is limited.
“We have to be honest with constituents. The ability of the Florida Legislature — in a 60-day session — to influence the price of goods and services within a state economy that is largely driven by national and international economic trends is pretty limited,” Albritton said, taking care to praise Trump’s tax cuts.
Costs have been a dominating issue in Florida politics in the past few years, most recently rearing its head in the form of property taxes. Soaring taxes on homes have sparked a GOP insistence on either eliminating the taxes or seriously slashing them.
The call first came from DeSantis ahead of the 2025 session, but fears of eliminating funding for law enforcement, schools, fire departments, and other public works has proven a hefty obstacle. This year, DeSantis has floated a late spring special session to solve the problem.
“I look forward to providing voters the opportunity to pass meaningful property tax relief,” Albritton said. “And, again this year, the Florida Legislature will pass a balanced budget that holds the line on state spending, pays down debt, cuts taxes, and saves for the future.
“That’s the strong fiscal-responsibility Floridians expect and deserve, and that’s the single best thing we in the Florida Legislature can do to keep our state on the right track,” he added.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0964-1024x935.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 11:13:12.840390

A jury in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, thought it had put the issue to rest.
In April 2025, after an 18-day trial, the group of south Louisianans awarded two coastal parish governments $744.6 million in damages, finding that Chevron had contributed to the decline of the state’s shoreline and wetlands.
In the face of that landmark ruling, Chevron and oil companies facing similar suits fought back.
On Monday, eight of the U.S. Supreme Court’s nine justices heard the companies’ appeal. Lawyers representing Chevron, Texaco and Exxon Mobil argued that the case should be litigated in federal, not state, court. Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from further consideration of the case, though he’d already participated in the court’s decision to address the issue.
Lawyers for Chevron argued that the company should be permitted to remove lawsuits against it from state to federal court because its actions, which stretch back to the World War II era, were at times done at the encouragement and direction of the federal government.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Paul Clement, a seasoned advocate before the nation’s highest court now representing Chevron, told the justices the controversy amounted to a “relatively straightforward case.” Because of the federal government’s outsized involvement in the oil market beginning in the 1940s, he argued, the court should require that suits over oil companies’ related actions should be heard by federal, not state, judges.
Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether the oil company’s suggested legal theory would lead to absurd outcomes, like requiring suits against vertically integrated producers to be heard in federal court while suits against oil refiners, for example, would remain in state courtrooms.
Clement suggested the court ignore the contradiction, calling it “a surface anomaly.”
Ben Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, told justices that Clement’s argument before the court, focused in large part on oil companies’ actions during the World War II era, strayed far from the on-the-ground, contemporary evidence that was presented during the state court trial in Pointe à la Hache.
“They do not dispute that they dumped billions of gallons of produced water from oil wells directly into our marsh,” he said of Chevron’s executives.
Aguiñaga pointed the court to its own decision in Watson, a 2007 case where the body unanimously decided that Phillip Morris, a tobacco company, could not remove lawsuits against it to federal court simply because it operated under the close supervision of government regulators.
The parishes’ successful lawsuit, which alleged Chevron had violated a 1978 Louisiana coastal management law, was rightly heard in state courts, Aguiñaga argued, because that’s where the expertise on the relevant law lies.
“We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get the Louisiana Supreme Court on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope,” he said.
Legal experts say the oil companies view the federal courts as a friendlier venue that will be more receptive to their arguments that they are owed some protection from liability because of their role in national security. The court’s decision will determine the venue for a slew of similar cases, including 40 lawsuits by Louisiana officials. It also could have bearing on litigation now underway around the country over oil company liability for the costs of climate change.
While the legal outlines of the Louisiana case don’t seem to fall along traditional political lines, the court’s liberal justices appeared more skeptical of the oil companies’ insistence that the cases be moved to federal courts during Monday’s arguments.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the companies’ suggested scope of when a case should be forced into a federal courtroom was too broad.
“They way you’re defining this, but for a nail, something could fall apart,” Sotomayor said.
But Clement told justices that federal law is broad in its categorization of cases that can be removed from state courts.
“If we are going to get into a big debate about exactly what happened in World War II, boy, I think that should take place in federal court,” he said.
The case puts lawyers for Republican-led Louisiana up against both Chevron and the Trump administration, which filed a brief in the case and delivered arguments at Monday’s hearing supporting the removal of the case to federal court.
The implications of the court’s decision could be significant, with both the $744 million judgement and future precedent at stake.
Whatever the court’s decision, Louisiana’s loss of coastline is likely to continue. The state has lost more than 2,000 square miles of land in the last century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, though Chevron maintains it has not caused the state’s coastal woes.
An environmental impact like that shouldn’t be ignored, Aguiñaga said. “That’s why this is such a massive deal for the state of Louisiana.”

During performances, white actors would blacken their faces with burnt cork and wear tattered and unkempt clothing to mock African slaves. Here, tropes like the Mammy, Jezebel, and untrustworthy criminals were constructed for a large audience, creating a false image of the everyday African American.
More than 150 years later, on TikTok, users see a woman depicted as a gorilla. She’s in front of a gas station and has on a pink wig, big fake pink eyelashes, and bright pink nails. While holding a gas station cup, she says with a blaccent, “So my probation officer called. Good news I ain’t gotta do no more community service, bad news it’s ‘cuz there’s a new warrant out for my arrest, teehee.”
Minstrelsy is back, and just like in the mid 19th century, we, the audience consume its contents without a second thought. Seemingly out of nowhere, hundreds of thousands of AI videos depicting Black people being “ghetto” or “ratchet” have flooded our timelines with no end in sight. For me and my peers at Farmington High, as well as other Connecticut schools, it can be hard to avoid.
Minstrel shows were American’s largest form of entertainment. As lower- and working-class whites were the target audience, performances encouraged them to feel superior in a time of financial struggle as the Great Depression left many of them unemployed. Shows were marketed as family-friendly and were often viewed by people of various ages.
The 20th Century saw a shift, as Black actors began to participate in shows as well. They too dressed up in scruffy garb, painted themselves as dark as they could, and portrayed their own people as slovenly and foolish. Minstrelsy opened doors that were previously closed for Black actors and musicians who struggled to make a name for themselves.
They cashed a check using damage to their own community as collateral. This phenomenon can be seen all throughout history; minorities aligning themselves with their oppressors in order to seek special treatment. Only with minstrel shows, this self-deprecating dynamic is broadcasted for everyone to see, having a lasting effect on people’s perception of who Black people really are.
Throughout the 1900s, Broadway minstrel shows died out and Race Films took their place. Due to the public’s newfound reliance on on-screen entertainment, Race films went where minstrel shows couldn’t —reaching the world on a global scale. The pattern of Black creatives pandering to a white audience is evident here, as Race Films succeeded at modernizing tropes of the last generation.
Bleeding into the 21st century, we see this reflected once again with AI. Only now, who receives compensation? Major software and AI database companies only stand to gain from this phenomenon. Programs like OpenAI’s Sora and Google Gemini’s Veo take faces and artwork from across the internet, then generate videos based on prompts imputed by users. It’s free and easily accessible to the public, making it extremely profitable.
This kind of content has made its way onto TikTok, one of the world’s largest social media platforms. With approximately 1 billion users worldwide, TikTok was taken by Sora 2’s launch in late September of this year. Users were bombarded with AI- generated videos, making it difficult to discern what was real from what wasn’t.

The woman in the gorilla video is meant to look absurd. Her excessive appearance followed by a ridiculous yet playful statement, invites viewers to laugh at such absurdity while reinforcing inherent biases. Through slavery, and later minstrelsy, Black women were frequently disparaged in the public eye, often overly masculine and seen as obnoxious or overly sexual. Portraying Black women as gorillas is not a new concept and is a direct reference to the pseudoscience of the 19th century.
Disgraced practices like phrenology, where scientists compare the size and shape of a person’s head to determine their personality traits, morality, and brain capacity, were used to enforce a racial hierarchy: one with white Europeans on top and Black Africans on the bottom. Phrenologists compared skulls of Africans to those of monkeys or gorillas and cited their research as a justification for enslavement.
But AI Minstrelsy doesn’t stop here. It can generate just about anything: A video depicting Black men as deadbeats, in which a Black man throws something at his girlfriend after she asks for child support. Or maybe another about young Black children —feeding the stereotype of Black boys being gangsters and Black girls being overly promiscuous. Anything and everything pertaining to Black people and “the Black experience” can be found here. Once again Minstrel tropes have been modernized for the public, placing an entire group of people in a box they can never seem to escape.
People laugh because they believe their acceptance has no impact on the world around them. Whether you overtly or covertly believe in racist tropes, engaging with minstrel content shows algorithms that this content holds the audience’s attention. It becomes a recurring loop: Someone creates an AI video, algorithms push it out enough to go viral, then someone notices that virality and decides that they want to go viral too. Passive engagement is now easier than ever; people aren’t using AI because they agree with the agenda being pushed, but because it’s an easy and free way to gain popularity and monetary advantage.
At the end of the day, artificial intelligence is only a tool; it can be wielded by many for various purposes. Someone making Minstrel content for free and posting it online with zero pushback is not only alarming but indicative of our political climate. Sora AI may have been the first social media platform to solely implement AI short-form content, but they won’t be the last.
 To some, this issue may seem trivial, but when thinking about the broader implications it has on our communities, the danger becomes apparent. Connecticut is home to over 360,000 black Americans, and this content is a reflection of the implicit biases held by our neighbors. A lack of race and class consciousness across our nation invites us to be susceptible to outside agendas. Comedy is used to validate racism, and that racism only stands to divide us from one another and distract us from reality.

The 60-day regular legislative session kicks off in Tallahassee today. What, if anything, the Florida Legislature does in the next two months to make health care more affordable and accessible to Florida residents remains to be seen.
Med mal and wrongful death of fetuses
Florida legislators are expected to once again look at killing a medical malpractice law that bars adult children of single parents and parents of childless adult children from pursuing negligence lawsuits if a family member has died.
The Legislature passed a similar bill during last year’s session, but Gov. Ron DeSantis — siding with medical malpractice insurers and medical providers — vetoed the measure. The House is poised to vote out the bill on Thursday. DeSantis has said he could consider approving the measure but only if legislators limit the amount of money recoverable in medical malpractice lawsuits.
The caps were previously ruled unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court but the business community is eager to have a largely DeSantis-appointed Supreme Court reconsider their legality.
The chamber also will vote this week on legislation to allow wrongful death lawsuits for the loss of developing fetuses.
Doubling down on doulas
The Florida Health Justice Project, arguing health care is a right, supports a spate of bills during the 2026 session including Medicaid expansion and proposals (HB 681 and HB 823) filed by Orlando Democratic Rep. Ana Eskamani to repeal existing bans on health care including eliminating the state’s six-week abortion ban and striking from statutes the prohibition on gender-affiming care to minors and limitations on that care for transgender adults.
Policy Director Melanie Williams said last week that the association hopes to see those proposals heard in committees this session.

“Expanding Medicaid is an economic, societal, and health win that would lower health care costs, strengthen Florida’s workforce and support hospitals and the health care system,” project policy director Melanie Williams said.
The group also hopes a pair of bills meant to improve maternal and child health by training more doulas will be considered. Doulas serve as birth advocates and coaches during labor and delivery and even after childbirth. 
HB 1043 and SB 1456 sponsored by Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Democrat from Miami, and Sen. Rosalind Osgood, a Democrat from Tamarac, respectively, would create a Doula Workforce Development Support Program at the Department of Commerce. 
The bills would declare that “persistent maternal morbidity and mortality disparities that disproportionately affect Black, Brown, rural, and low-income communities” exist in the state.”
The department would get $7.5 million to provide grants and technical assistance to doula-training entities to expand that workforce. The bill would direct grants to urban counties with high maternal morbidity disparities; rural areas with limited or no obstetric providers or maternity wards; and to communities affected by hospital closures or reductions in maternity services.
Nonprofit organizations, community-based programs, training collectives, academic institutions, and private educational providers that conduct doula training, mentoring, and continuing education would qualify for the grants.
“Florida continues to face unacceptable disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. Too many families lack consistent access to prenatal, postpartum, and infant care, especially in rural communities and in communities of color,” Williams said. “Addressing these gaps requires policies that prioritize continuity of care, workforce, support, and coverage that meets families where they are.”
Debt protections
The lives of Florida residents could also be improved if the Legislature strengthened oversight of Medicaid, Williams said, referencing a recent federal court finding that the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis sent Medicaid termination letters following the end of the COVID public health pandemic that were “vague, confusing and often incorrect and misleading.”
Court rules Florida Medicaid termination letters fly in face of federal law

Williams said the Health Justice Project supports HB 1271 and SB 1222, carried by Jacksonville Democrat Rep. Angie Nixon and Miami Republican Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez. The bills limit how far debt collectors can go to collect medical debt.
“Unfortunately, across Florida debt is not just a financial issue, it’s a health care one as well. Medical debt forces families to delay care; it drains household savings and pushes working people into long-term financial instability through no fault of their own,” Williams said. “When Florida and federal policies limit access to affordable, available medical services, we shouldn’t allow debt collectors to threaten people with their livelihood.”
Expand scope, not Medicaid
Ten states, mostly southern and including Florida, have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as “Obamacare,” to provide health coverage to childless, lower-income, working adults. 
While the Republican-led Legislature isn’t willing to expand the health care safety net to cover more people, top legislators, including House Speaker Daniel Perez, a Miami Republican, have championed bills that would expand services that health care providers may offer by altering their “scope” of allowable services.
Specifically, HB 693, filed by Miami Republican Mike Redondo, would authorize all advanced practice registered nurses to work independently of medical doctors. While some advanced nurses can do that today, it’s authorized on a limited basis and only for provision of primary care. Redondo’s bill would allow others, such as registered nurse anesthetists, to work independently of physicians.
The move to expand what advanced nurses can provide has put the bill on organized medicine’s radar, and Jacksonville health care lobbyist Christopher Nuland said quashing the scope of practice expansion for nurses, what he describes as a small part of a much larger bill, is a priority of his.
House Speaker Daniel Perez seeks cuts, restrictions, for safety-net programs

 
Expanding scope for advanced nurses has been a long-standing priority for the House. So has been eliminating certificate of need requirements for the construction of new health care facilities, which HB 693 also would do for nursing homes and institutions for the developmentally disabled.
HB 693 also would require people on food assistance who are not disabled and who don’t have young children to show they are working through age 64. Florida law now requires people to show they are working through age 59. The change is being made to conform with the provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Dental care
Another bill, HB 363, would establish a new health care category in the state called “dental therapists.” The Florida Dental Association does not support the idea, sponsored by Republican Rep. Linda Chaney of St. Pete Beach. The bill is being championed by a group called Floridians for Dental Access, led by dentist Dr. Frank Catalanotto. 
The Senate has rejected similar legislation in the past but advocates hope to enlist Senate President Ben Albritton, a Republican from Wauchula, who’s been keenly interested in investing in rural counties. Those are some of the hardest hit by dental shortages and cost increases, with nearly 41% of Florida’s 32 rural counties reporting a 77% increase in dental-related hospital and emergency room billings. 
The grassroots advocacy group Florida Voices for Health has made dental screenings at schools its top priority and is lobbying for SB 1136 and HB 1091. The bills would alter Florida’s “Parent’s Bill of Rights” to allow dental screening to be performed at schools after parents have been given written notice and reasonable opportunity to deny, consent, or opt their students out of the screenings. The screenings would be limited to noninvasive visual inspection for signs of dental disease or abnormality.

“Anyone who’s lived with dental pain knows what it’s like day-to-day, how hard it is to focus and stay on top of things when you’re living with like a pain in your mouth. And so this bill … clarifies school districts are allowed to use passive consent,” FVH Executive Director Scott Darius said. “And it feels like a small change, but one that’s happening in the context of, you know, the end of community water fluoridation, which is just going to impact low-income kids the most.”
He added that the legislation would give FVH a platform to talk to school districts about the importance of dental screenings and encourage them to start dental screening programs if they don’t already have them.
Safety net hospitals’ agenda
Safety Net Hospital Association of Florida CEO Justin Senior said his association will closely track House and Senate budgets and spending on Medicaid.
A top priority is ensuring the viability of an $86 million program meant to help train future physicians and to solidify Florida’s health care workforce. Passed as part of the 2023 “Live Healthy” proposal, the “Slots for Docs Program” requires the state to annually allocate to hospitals $100,000 for each newly created residency for a physician specialty or subspecialty for which there is a statewide shortage. 
The law lays out 29 specialities and sub-specialities experiencing a statewide “supply and demand deficit,”  including  obstetrics and gynecology; geriatric medicine; family medicine; emergency medicine; and cardiology.

The Slots for Docs Program is funded with state dollars that are coupled with matching federal Medicaid funds.
However, the program isn’t yet operational because the federal government, concerned that there was no mandate for the physicians to care for Medicaid patients, didn’t approve the plan. Senior said the safety-net hospitals have a two-fold goal for the 2026 session: 

Ensure the money in the current fiscal year budget for the Slots for Docs program that isn’t being spent isn’t raided for other purposes.
 Help work out the details of a graduate medical education program that the federal government could approve. 

“We’re hoping to find a way to maintain that $86 million in the system,” Senior told the Florida Phoenix. “And we’ll have to find a new distribution model for it.”
Senior said the hospitals — as of now — haven’t been harmed by the federal government’s decision to not approve the program. And, he said, as long as the Legislature agrees to revert the unused funds from the current budget and allow them to be used in the coming FY 2026-27 budget, his member facilities should be fine.
“There’s been no impact yet but I think the hospitals that were counting on this money and were responding to the incentives in the Slots for Docs program would really like to see a program, or whatever replaces it, drive the money in a very similar way.
To that end, Senior said the hospitals are on board with Gov. Ron DeSantis’ budget proposal to distribute the money, which essentially borrows from a different and already approved graduate medical education plan.
“It looks acceptable to us but we are hopeful that the House and Senate take up either that or something very similar to it,” Senior said.
In addition to the $86 million in funding, Senior said, his group will closely track the budget process and work to ensure Medicaid funding for hospitals isn’t cut.
“We hope there are no rate cuts. A lot of that is tied to the economy and the economic performance,” he said, noting that Medicaid is counter-cyclical. During recessions, when people lose their jobs, the number of people relying on Medicaid for health care security increases. The caseload increases come as the state has less money coming into its coffers to pay for the services.
“We’re not seeing that right now. Medicaid enrollment has dropped below 4 million in the most recent reading in Florida and we are seeing right now, if you look at the measure of gross domestic product and things like that around the country, the economy is still growing. So we are hopeful that there are no cuts to Medicaid rates.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1026036240-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:00:11.934329

Ned Lamont's reelection campaign reported raising $84,903 from contributors since mid-November. He chipped in another $105,000.","Gov. Ned Lamont still intends to largely self-fund his reelection campaign, but his first campaign finance filing had one surprise: Others gave nearly as much to the campaign in its first weeks as did the independently wealthy Democratic governor. 
“We’re trying to raise as many small dollar donations as we can to show we got broad-based support,” Lamont said Monday.
That was not a concern in 2022, when Lamont’s opponent was a wealthy Republican businessman, Bob Stefanowski, who also largely self-funded his campaign. Neither man tried to use the number of donors as a measure of support.
This year, all three of Lamont’s opponents are participants in the state’s revamped Citizens’ Election Program, which requires a broad base of small-dollar donors to qualify for public grants of about $3.2 million in a primary and $15.4 million in a general election.
“We have a lot of small money donations,” Lamont told reporters a few hours before his report was filed. “I have not done any fundraising. I got a day job. But we’re doing fine.”
His campaign reported raising $84,903 from contributors since his campaign’s launch in mid-November through Dec. 31, the end of the quarterly reporting period. 
His own contribution: $105,000.
“We are really proud of how many people have joined the campaign in just six weeks since the governor announced,” said Lauren Gray, a spokeswoman for the campaign. “We believe this surge of support is one indication.”
Not all the donors were small donors, at least as defined by the public financing law. A little less than half his outside money — $38,500 — came from 11 individuals who gave the legal maximum of $3,500.
Other contributions were as modest as $5.
In 2022, Lamont contributed $25.7 million to his own campaign. Others gave $564,164. Stefanowski gave $12.98 million and raised $1.5 million from others.
The report filed Monday by Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, who is challenging Lamont for the Democratic nomination, showed that his struggles to attract qualifying contributions are continuing. 
Qualifying for public financing requires gubernatorial candidates to raise at least $250,000 in donations ranging from $5 to $250. Elliott raised $39,918 in the three-month reporting period ending on Dec. 31. His total since opening his campaign in July is $85,082. 
Elliott opened the day with another fundraising appeal, saying Lamont is not aggressive enough to face the Trump administration and incidents like the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents.
“Ned Lamont is a decent person. But ‘decent’ isn’t what this moment requires,” Elliott wrote. “We need leaders who understand that dismantling unaccountable agencies isn’t radical — it’s the bare minimum. Leaders who will use the power of the office, not just occupy it.”
The two Republicans running for governor, former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain and state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, already have crossed the $250,000 threshold.
Stewart’s application for public financing was approved last week. Fazio has not yet filed his application.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9071-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 11:00:11.934329

Lower courts ruled for the transgender athletes in Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the state bans, but the conservative-dominated Supreme Court might not follow suit.
In just the past year, the justices ruled in favor state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youths and allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced.
The legal fight is playing out amid a broad effort by President Donald Trump to target transgender Americans, beginning on the first day of his second term and including the ouster of transgender people from the military and declaring that gender is immutable and determined at birth.
The culture war cases come from Idaho and West Virginia, among the first of the more than two dozen Republican-led states that have banned transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s teams.
The justices are evaluating claims of sex discrimination lodged by transgender people versus the need for fair competition for women and girls, the main argument made by the states.
In the first case, Lindsay Hecox, 25, sued over Idaho’s first-in-the-nation ban for the chance to try out for the women’s track and cross-country teams at Boise State University in Idaho. She didn’t make either squad but competed in club-level soccer and running.
Becky Pepper-Jackson, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, has been taking puberty-blocking medication, publicly identified as a girl since age 8 and has been issued a West Virginia birth certificate recognizing her as female. She is the only transgender person who has sought to compete in girls’ sports in West Virginia.
Pepper-Jackson has progressed from a back-of-the-pack cross-country runner in middle school to a statewide third-place finish in the discus in just her first year of high school.
Prominent women in sports have weighed in on both sides. Tennis champion Martina Navratilova, swimmers Summer Sanders and Donna de Varona and beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh-Jennings are supporting the state bans. Soccer stars Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn and basketball players Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart back the transgender athletes.
The high-court arguments are expected to focus on whether the sports bans violate the Constitution or the landmark federal law known as Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in education.
In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled LGBTQ people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace, finding that “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers’ decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.
But last year, the six conservative justices on the nine-member court declined to apply the same sort of analysis when they upheld state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender minors.
The states supporting the prohibitions on transgender athletes argue there is no reason to extend the ruling barring workplace discrimination to Title IX, which dramatically increased opportunities for girls and women in school sports.
Lawyers for Pepper-Jackson argue that the law protects people like their client from discrimination. They are asking for a ruling that would apply to the unique circumstances of her early transition. In Hecox’s case, her lawyers want the court to dismiss the case because she has forsworn trying to play on women’s teams.
Despite the small numbers of transgender athletes, the issue has taken on outsize importance. The NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committees banned transgender women from women’s sports after Trump, a Republican, signed an executive order aimed at barring their participation.
The public generally is supportive of the limits. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in October 2025 found that about 6 in 10 U.S. adults “strongly” or “somewhat” favored requiring transgender children and teenagers to only compete on sports teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with, while about 2 in 10 were “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed and about one-quarter did not have an opinion.
About 2.1 million adults, or 0.8%, and 724,000 people age 13 to 17, or 3.3%, identify as transgender in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.

Scholarships can be a great way to fund your future. It’s worth it to review VSAC’s Scholarships & Forgivable Loans 2026–2027 booklet—so you don’t miss out on the chance to receive free money. 
If you’re a high school senior or a returning college or training student, now is the time to apply for any of the 150+ VSAC-administered scholarships and forgivable loans. The VSAC scholarships booklet contains information about funding opportunities available whether you continue your education in Vermont or somewhere else. Application materials are due February 11.
VSAC-administered scholarships are managed by VSAC on behalf of other organizations. Scholarships—like grants—are financial aid that you don’t need to pay back. Scholarships are offered by an array of groups, organizations, and even individuals. They’re offered for all kinds of achievements—and to a wide range of students. 
They’re also usually competitive, with eligible applicants vying for a limited number of awards—but Vermont’s smaller communities may offer you a higher chance of winning a scholarship than if you were competing nationwide. 
What you’ll find inside: scholarships and forgivable loans 
VSAC’s 2026-27 scholarship booklet includes information on over 150 scholarships, interest-free forgivable loans administered by VSAC, and an additional 41 scholarships run by outside organizations. Here’s a peek at what’s inside.
Some scholarships offer one-time awards, while others are renewable, meaning the student can receive additional financial awards for each subsequent year of study. The annual award amounts generally range from $500 to $6,500, though there are some exceptions. In addition to achieving extraordinary academic and community service goals, many scholarship applicants are motivated to grow into careers that will help others—paying it forward with a lifetime goal that spans generations.
The scholarships booklet also covers VSAC’s workforce development funding, which are forgivable loan programs available for students studying in some trades, or to be a nurse, nurse faculty, or psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. These forgivable loan programs are structured as interest-free loans, but with a big difference: complete your program or service and work in Vermont in your field for a set amount of time, and your loan is fully forgiven. No repayment. No interest. Just the support to launch your future.  
 In addition, the Vermont National Guard Tuition Benefit Program pays for some or all the tuition for a student who enrolls in Guard service while in school.  
How to find the right VSAC scholarships for you—and what to expect next

Scholarships for a broad variety of fields of study, different interests, and financial circumstances
There are scholarship opportunities for a wide range of academic interests. Some of the more common fields include:

Business
Technical industries
Public safety
Agriculture
Health care
Education

Here are a few of the new scholarships designed for students pursuing specific interests:

The Michael E Bingham Vocational Scholarship was established by “Vermont Mike,” who had an exciting career that began in the Peace Corps and included seismic oil exploration and land surveying. The Bingham Scholarship offers $1000 to a student who lives in Addison County and wants to pursue a career in the trades.
The Alex Williams Culinary Scholarship was established to honor the memory of Alex Williams and his passion for cooking. Alex was a 2020 graduate of the culinary arts program at the Central Vermont Career Center. Alex was a free-spirit, avid “foodie,” and emerging chef who always aspired to help others. The Alex Williams Culinary Scholarship offers one or more students who are seeking a degree or certification in the culinary arts up to $1000 annually. 
The Brian R. Searles Memorial Scholarship was established to honor Essex High School alumni Brian R. Searles who died in 2024. Brian was a recognized role model epitomizing what it means to be a true public servant. He was a talented and humble leader who spent 40+ years serving the State of Vermont in many different positions. The Brian R. Searles Memorial Scholarship provides $1000 to a current high school senior graduating from a Vermont high school who has shown a commitment to public service, leadership qualities, academic achievement, strong work ethic, and financial need.

There may even be specific scholarships for your town, county, or high school. Here are a few scholarships that benefit students living in particular communities:
• The Newbury Alumni Memorial Scholarship was established in honor of all Newbury High School alumni, and supports a graduate from Oxbow High School who is pursuing college after high school.  
• The Early Childhood Educators Scholarship supports students who have a commitment to the education of young children, who reside in Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle or Lamoille County.
Also check for scholarships to help members of traditionally disadvantaged groups. For example, students who are single parents may want to check out the Bernice Murray Scholarship, which covers up to $4,000 in child-care expenses for single parents who continue their education.
There are many choices, all directed by the donors to honor the legacy of someone important to them, a cause or passion, or a business or organization. If you’re interested in funding your own scholarship, let’s connect!

Sarah Stevens, R-Surry. (Photo: NCGA video stream)An investigation by the North Carolina State Board of Elections found that two contributions by lobbyists to Rep. Sarah Stevens’ state Supreme Court campaign were illegal, but said they did not represent an “intentional violation.”
The board issued warning letters to the Stevens campaign as well as registered lobbyists Harold Brubaker and Andy Munn, who donated $6,800 and $1,500, respectively, according to a Jan. 9 notice obtained by NC Newsline. Those contributions have since been returned.
Under North Carolina law, it is illegal for lobbyists to donate to the campaigns of sitting state legislators. The unlawful donations were first reported by NC Newsline in August. Brubaker, a former North Carolina House speaker, claimed in a call with NC Newsline last year that the donation was “legal,” while Stevens argued  it was not inappropriate because “he gave to me as a judicial candidate.”
Stevens, a Surry County Republican, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the findings by the board of elections.
Bob Hall, a campaign finance watchdog who previously served as executive director of Democracy North Carolina, filed the initial complaint over the donations in August. He said he believes the Stevens campaign was trying to “capitalize on what they thought was a loophole in state law.”
“It’s good the state board has educated and warned all the parties involved,” Hall said. “But it is troubling that a legislator who chairs the House Election Law Committee and who seeks a seat on the Supreme Court did not understand the plain language of these statutes.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas schools that opt to use a gun detection software program supported by the attorney general could receive a cut of $10 million from the state.
Attorney General Kris Kobach promoted an artificial intelligence-driven, unconcealed firearm detection and situational awareness software that can be applied to existing security cameras. He announced Monday that his office is accepting applications to integrate the program into K-12 public schools.
AI gun detection software purports to halt and prevent gun violence. Its implementation in schools has grown in popularity as technology has advanced and school shootings and mass shootings have increased in frequency.
The attorney general uses a product from the Pennsylvania-based company ZeroEyes, which sent lobbyists to the Kansas Legislature in 2024 to push for a contract with schools. The technology can analyze more than 36,000 images per second from security camera video feeds, according to the company’s website.
If the software identifies a gun in school, images are immediately shared with the ZeroEyes Operations Center, an in-house hub staffed 24/7 by military and law enforcement veterans, according to ZeroEyes. The company claims security teams and law enforcement can be notified of a threat as quickly as three to five seconds from the point the software detects a firearm. Operation center staff review software images and determine whether a threat is valid. They can then send alerts equipped with information such as a description, gun type and last known location.
The chief strategy officer for ZeroEyes, Kieran Carroll, said in 2024 that installing the software in 1,300 school buildings in Kansas and enabling 24-hour surveillance of two dozen cameras per school would cost the state $8.5 million annually. That same year, Gov. Laura Kelly line-item vetoed a budget measure that allocated $5 million to a program that favored ZeroEyes. The governor called it “a no-bid contract,” criticizing the lack of consideration for other companies.
A $10 million earmark made it through the Legislature in 2025, and in November, the Legislature’s special budget committee said the state was considering three bidders for a gun-detection software contract. ZeroEyes beat out companies based in Wichita and Springfield, Missouri.
Funding will be dispersed equally across Kansas’ four congressional districts, and grants are available on a first-come, first-served basis, according to the Attorney General’s Office.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010107-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-13 09:57:41.387950

(Photo by Peter Griffith/NASA)The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the state of Alaska’s latest attempt to alter Alaska’s decades-old system of subsistence fishing management.
In a one-sentence order Monday, the court said it will not review a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in August that Alaska cannot manage fishing on a stretch of the Kuskokwim River that flows through the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.
If the Supreme Court had taken up the case, it could have redefined Alaska’s unique system of hunting and fishing management, which allows the federal government to restrict subsistence hunting and fishing on federal land to rural Alaskans. The state is forbidden by the Alaska Constitution from offering the same preference.
Alaska Native organizations, including the Alaska Federation of Natives, praised the court’s decision, but the commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said by email that it would continue to work with the federal government on the issue.
Monday’s Supreme Court decision ends a five-year dispute that began during a salmon shortage on the Kuskokwim River in 2021. The state of Alaska issued orders to open fishing that contradicted federal fisheries managers’ decision to keep it closed.
Salmon fishing is a critical aspect of Alaska Native culture, tradition and survival. Salmon returns have plummeted in recent years, straining managers who must balance the wants and needs of Alaskans and Yukoners pursuing the same fish.
On the Kuskokwim, the state claimed it was simply interpreting a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from 2019, but the federal government disagreed with the state’s interpretation and sued the following year.
Alaska Native groups sided with the federal government, and Alaska District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled in favor of the federal government in 2024. 
The state appealed to the 9th Circuit, which again ruled in favor of the federal government. That prompted the state to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Kuskokwim River Intertribal Fish Commission was one of the lead groups standing with the federal government. 
“Our Fish Commission is very pleased with this historic victory in favor of the people of the Kuskokwim River. The victory not only upholds rural subsistence rights in Alaska, but upholds the participation of local people, elected by the Tribes, in the co-management of Kuskokwim salmon,” said the group’s chair, Martin Andrew, in a written statement.
Attorney Erin Dougherty Lynch worked on the case for the Native American Rights Fund, which represented the Association of Village Council Presidents.
By phone, she noted that even though this case is over, the Bureau of Land Management is considering changes to the subsistence program. 
“What the state is seeking to accomplish now is basically the same thing through administrative processes. They’re definitely still going after subsistence. This won’t be the end, unfortunately, of their efforts to restrict subsistence,” she said.
Safari Club International, which petitioned BLM for regulatory changes, backed the state in the appeal that was rejected Monday.
In a written statement after Monday’s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, the group said it believes the federal government “has increasingly superseded Alaska’s wildlife authority” and that the state and federal government should continue to work on the issue.
By email, Alaska Department of Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang offered a similar comment and referred to the 1980 compromises between state and federal interests in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. 
“We will respect the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to not address the legal issues regarding fish and game management authorities over navigable waters belonging to the State of Alaska,” he said. “This said, we will continue to work with the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to ensure the rights Alaska was given under its statehood compact and envisioned under ANILCA are safeguarded.”

As Michiganders set their intentions for 2026, the state Legislature is setting its intention for the upcoming year by finalizing budget priorities for the 2027 fiscal year, which informally kicks off with the Census Revenue Estimating Conference (CREC) on Friday, Jan. 16. 
One priority lawmakers should include in the upcoming budget is adopting the framework for funding special education services detailed in the Michigan Special Education Finance Reform Blueprint. This legislative report, delivered in October 2025, describes longstanding flaws with our current reimbursement model for supporting students receiving special education services, and then it provides a solution: a weighted funding model tied to student need.
Today, nearly 16% of students in Michigan receive special education services, and the proportion of students who qualify for these services continues to grow. This increase underscores a pressing need for our funding system to modernize in response to the changing student population. Currently, most funding for special education services comes from the state in the form of a reimbursement for 28.6% of district expenditures. Local funds contribute to the rest of costs, but contributions vary widely by Intermediate School District (ISD). Additionally, most districts are forced to use general fund dollars to cover special education costs, creating budget constraints. The result is inequity that shows up directly in classrooms. 
The Blueprint highlights this inequity by pointing to two counties with similar student populations, but due to tax wealth, one county can spend $3,500 more per student on special education services. Essentially, our system has created a reality where two students with identical characteristics (academic achievement, family life, diagnosis, etc.) are receiving drastically different services simply because of the district they are assigned. This gap translates into fewer interventions, more students per teacher, and fewer supports for students who need them most. 
The Blueprint’s model solves these problems by tying special education funding to the needs of a particular student. The new model scraps the reimbursement format and provides each special education student with the foundation allowance (currently set at $10,050) and an additional percentage of the foundation allowance, as determined by their diagnosis. The change means that funding is tied to student needs, not ZIP codes.
Although it has been nearly a decade since I was a classroom teacher, the feeling of “if only” has not faded.
If only I could be in two places at once…
If only there were someone to provide the reading interventions…
If only we funded all of our students according to their unique needs…
For too long, these have been common realities in Michigan classrooms, but they no longer need to be hypothetical wishes for our educators.
​The Blueprint was developed by school finance experts and informed by hundreds of stakeholders across the state. Adequate and equitable funding will allow teachers to focus on teaching and will create classrooms where diverse needs are met with appropriate supports.
Importantly, adopting the Blueprint will not only improve outcomes for students receiving special education services; it will improve the educational experience for everyone. By strengthening staffing, reducing strain on general education classrooms, and stabilizing district budgets, the Blueprint will improve learning conditions for all Michigan students.
Now, at the start of a new year, lawmakers must take decisive action by adopting the Blueprint’s weighted funding model and redefining special education funding in Michigan. As we make our resolutions for the year ahead, let this be one we keep: a commitment to equitable, effective education funding that empowers every Michigan student to thrive.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Farm Bureau is scheduled to host meetings across Iowa to help farmers navigate challenges like tighter margins, high interest rates and market uncertainty as they financially prepare for 2026. 
The meetings will examine some of the current drivers in the markets and discuss crop insurance considerations, risk management tools and transition planning for farmers. 
Iowa Farm Bureau Farmer Education Program Manager Zach Brummer said the organization wants farmers to have a “relevant look” at how these challenges affect profitability. 
“Farmers are making decisions in an environment with a lot more unknowns than we’ve seen in recent years,” Brummer said in a news release. 
Brummer said the series will give farmers steps they can take now to manage risks in 2026 as rising input costs, tariff volatility and “global uncertainty” are expected to persist as challenges for farmers.

An early projection of net farm income predicted declines of more than 20% for farmers in 2026 compared to 2025. A survey of agricultural economists from December shows economists rate row crop sectors with overall poor financial health and 46% of agricultural economists expect the ag economy to stay the same in 2026 as it was in 2025. Fifteen percent of surveyed economists predict ag economy conditions will get worse over the next 12 months. 
A contributing factor, as noted in the release from Iowa Farm Bureau about the event series, is ongoing uncertainty with foreign trade partners. 
China, the largest global purchaser of soybeans, did not purchase from the U.S. early in the season due to ongoing tariff conflicts with the U.S. and Chinese goods. While President Donald Trump secured a deal with China in October to purchase U.S. soybeans, farm groups have said they still need expanded markets — domestically and in other countries — to be profitable.
The federal government announced in December it would send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to help alleviate some of the financial strain farmers have suffered from market disruptions. The farm payments are expected to reach farmers by the end of February.
The Farm Bureau meetings will take place between Feb. 16 and Feb. 25 at six locations across the state. Economists, financial service consultants and crop consultants with Iowa Farm Bureau will be at the events, along with representatives from several local banks.
The events are free to Iowa Farm Bureau members, who can contact Ashley Lennon to register.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)There is much about vaccines in the news these days. A great deal of it is thoroughly confusing. I would like to add a few comments — and hopefully not make a confusing situation worse.
I will say upfront  that I believe vaccines have provided a vitally important  contribution — perhaps the most important contribution — to the health of our population, especially the health of children.  Early in my career I saw children die or be left with lifelong disability from diseases that, for all practical purposes, are no longer a threat because of the availability of vaccines. Does that mean that vaccines are free of risks or that the threat of infectious disease has disappeared? Of course not. However, we must not allow anxiety resulting from some new questions to distract us from the fundamental importance of vaccines in dealing with the threat of infectious disease.
Among current infection threats, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and measles are all diseases of concern. Measles has probably gotten the most attention. The measles vaccine has been available for many years. It has been combined with vaccines for mumps and rubella (German measles) to produce the MMR shot. Widespread use of MMR has been highly successful, and in the year 2000, the elimination of measles in the U.S. was recognized by the World Health Organization. Until recently, the only outbreaks of measles in the U.S. resulted from cases brought in from other countries.










Because vaccine-preventable diseases are now rarely seen, the general public has largely lost appreciation for how dangerous these infections can be.


Now, however, questions have been raised about the safety of this vaccine, particularly questioning a possible link to autism. There has been a considerable increase in the diagnosis of autism. To a large degree, however,  this is due to a better understanding of the condition and expansion of the criteria for diagnosis.
No authentic scientific study has shown a link between vaccines and autism. In fact, over the last 25 years, more than 40 studies have looked for a link between vaccines and autism and have failed to demonstrate a connection. The publication which originally claimed a link between vaccines and autism was eventually shown to be based on falsified data. The study was retracted by the medical journal that published it, and the physician author had his medical license revoked.
Be that as it may, the questions raised have caused significant concerns, especially on the part of parents. As a result, the rate of measles immunization has declined significantly. That decline has led to multiple locally originated outbreaks. In 2025 in the U.S., there were more than 2,000 documented cases spread over 42 states. These have resulted in many hospitalizations with complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. Three deaths were attributed to measles. These are the first deaths from measles in more than a decade. Virtually all of the complications have occurred in unvaccinated patients.
Measles is one of the most contagious infections known. Even casual contact with an infected person can result in transmitting the infection.  To make it even more complicated, infected individuals may spread the virus even before they develop symptoms.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Required immunizations for school attendance and for some employment have created controversy. The issue is complicated and contentious. I certainly accept, and support, the concept of individual freedom and responsibility regarding health care decisions. Problems arise, however, when those decisions directly impact the health and safety of other people.
To a large extent, I believe current vaccines are victims of their own success. Because vaccine-preventable diseases are now rarely seen, the general public has largely lost appreciation for how dangerous these infections can be. I fear the threat of infection is not taken as seriously as it once was, or as seriously as it should be.
We need to continually work to respect the right of individuals to control their own decisions. At the same time, we must do all we can to see that our society is protected from these major emerging public health threats. It is a major challenge.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vaccinemeasles-1024x7181765533560-1-1024x1024.jpg,,,2026-01-13 09:11:44.284137

From CalMatters politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
State lawmakers are already taking legislative steps to “Trump-proof” California’s elections, starting with a bill designed to keep President Donald Trump off of California’s ballot in 2028.
The bill from Sen. Tom Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee, would make it illegal for the California Secretary of State to place on the ballot any candidate for president or vice president who does not meet the constitutional requirements of those offices. 
The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment already states that no individual can hold the presidency for more than two terms.
Senate Bill 46 would take that one step further and require any candidate to affirm under oath, and penalty of perjury, that they are indeed constitutionally qualified for the ballot. An elector could challenge the qualifications of a candidate by petitioning the Superior Court of Sacramento.
“Apparently there’s some cockamamie scheme that exists in the mind of the president, and Alan Dershowitz, that he can run for a third term,” Umberg said, referring to the Harvard scholar and former Trump legal advisor who suggested the 22nd Amendment did not provide an airtight ban on a third Trump term. “It’s a belt and suspenders approach to make sure that his delusion doesn’t become reality.”
Umberg said that although 2028 is still years away, it was important to get the ball rolling early so other states could follow California’s example. Plus, 2026 is Umberg’s final year in the Senate. 

Umberg: “I have a sell-by date on my head, so that’s important for me, personally, to leave this as part of my legacy.”

SB 46 will be heard in the Senate elections committee this morning.

Turning 80 is typically a big milestone for most people, but in California it could also include one more perk: Getting out of jury duty for good.
The Assembly’s judiciary committee is expected today to weigh in on a bill that would enable Californians ages 80 and older to opt-out of jury service permanently without needing a note from a health care provider. Seniors who still want to be considered for jury duty could still do so.
There is no current age exemption for jury service, though residents 70 years and older can be excused due to a medical condition without a doctor’s note. There is a chance, however, that they must seek exemption repeatedly if they’re selected for service multiple times after they turn 70. 
The bill is supported by the California Senior Legislature, an advocacy organization for senior citizens, and has no formal opposition as of date. Assemblymember Patrick Ahrens, a Cupertino Democrat who introduced the bill, argues that continuously seeking exemption under current law can be disruptive and puts significant stress on older individuals.

Ahrens, in an interview with CalMatters: “Older individuals may have chronic health conditions, physical limitations or lack of technical skills. … (But) we can make the lives of older Californians easier while maintaining a responsible, diverse and just jury selection process.”




Former Dem, current GOP members kicks off campaign

Former state Senate Majority Leader Gloria Romero kicked off her campaign for lieutenant governor Monday, unveiling her bid as a Republican candidate for the state’s second-highest office.
Romero was first elected as a Democrat to the Assembly in 1998 before serving in the California senate from 2001 to 2009 representing east Los Angeles. During her time in the Legislature, she became the state’s first female Senate Majority Leader and authored a controversial “parent trigger” law that enables parents to change a school’s administration if the school performs poorly.
After leaving office, Romero left the Democratic party and joined the GOP, endorsing a Republican candidate in the 2021 gubernatorial recall election and Trump in 2024. When she switched in 2024, Romero said her biggest gripe against Democrats was over “school choice, education freedom and the right to have quality schools for all,” reports Newsweek.
In her campaign video, Romero sought to reach voters of both parties.

Romero: “Maybe you’ve never voted for a Republican before, and maybe you don’t agree on all the issues. That’s okay. But we need to hold Sacramento Democrats accountable for their failures on homelessness, affordability, crime, education and housing. I’m going to hold their feet to the fire.”

Romero joins a race that includes Josh Fryday, California Chief Service Officer under Gov. Gavin Newsom, State Treasurer Fiona Ma and former Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-13 13:47:08+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Keolis was once on thin ice over commuter rail concerns. Now, it’s a finalist for another lucrative MBTA contract.",Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/keolis-was-once-on-thin-ice-over-commuter-rail-concerns-now-its-a-finalist-for-another-lucrative-mbta-contract/,"Better on-time performance and major ridership milestones have boosted the outlook for commuter rail operator Keolis, which early in its tenure faced major scrutiny from Beacon Hill.","POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS are usually circumspect when it comes to the future prospects of state contractors, especially when half a decade or more remains on an existing agreement.
That made it striking when then-Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack suggested in 2017 that Keolis, the French company in charge of running the MBTA’s sprawling commuter rail network, though not even halfway through an eight-year contract, was unlikely to earn an extension if the Baker administration had its way.
A few years later, though, the T changed course and kept Keolis in place. Then officials extended the contract again. And now, as the MBTA and the Healey administration prepare to weigh bids for the next lucrative, multiyear commuter rail operation contract, Keolis is still in the mix, tapped last month as one of three finalists in a joint bid with fellow French rail company Alstom.
It’s been a striking turnaround in reputation for a company whose first year in the role was marred by a disastrous winter and scrutiny over its management capabilities. And there may be a fairly straightforward explanation for it.
“Over time, they’ve become a much more competent operator,” said Pete Wilson, senior policy director at the advocacy group Transportation for Massachusetts. “Trains seem to be more on-time, the trains are clean when you ride them, you get a pretty good amount of communication from the engineers and conductors if something has gone awry.”
Former governor Deval Patrick’s administration picked Keolis in 2014 for an eight-year, roughly $2.7 billion contract. The deal, like others before it, outsources operations and management of the dozen commuter rail lines that collectively transport tens of millions of riders per year, though the T itself owns the trains and the tracks.
A good deal of the commuter rail’s dismal performance in the first year was, arguably, outside Keolis’s control. One storm after another slammed into the region in 2015, dumping a record 110 inches of snow that upended virtually every mode of travel.
It was also a different, pre-pandemic era. Most employees stranded by canceled trains and buses wound up missing work altogether, unable to pivot to a remote alternative.
“In 2015, there was no remote work. Most of us had never been on Zoom,” Pollack, who served as transportation secretary from 2015 to 2021, told CommonWealth Beacon. “If you didn’t get to work, you didn’t work. It wasn’t like you went home and turned on the computer.”
But some of Keolis’s issues lingered after the snow and ice melted. Insiders said Keolis in its first few years struggled with staffing, at times failing to have enough operators on the clock to run the full schedule of service laid out in the contract. Fare collection — before the installation of fare gates at North Station and South Station — was at times haphazard.
Plus, too many trains arrived late. The contract called for at least 92 percent of trips get to their final destination within five minutes of the scheduled time. Keolis missed that target by nearly 10 percentage points in its first, winter-obliterated year, and its on-time performance remained stuck below 90 percent from 2016 through 2019, according to MBTA data.
Beacon Hill did not hide its displeasure. Lawmakers warned of “management concerns” unrelated to the winter issues; in early 2017, Pollack publicly signaled that the Baker administration’s preferred approach would be to let the Keolis contract expire and go back to the market rather than trigger available extensions.
Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board watchdog group, believes Pollack’s skepticism pushed Keolis bosses into action.

“Stephanie Pollack, I think quite frankly, scared Keolis headquarters. That caused them to send more folks and invest more money into this,” said Kane, who was part of the massive selection team that picked Keolis in 2014. “The last thing they wanted for their global reputation was to lose this deal, so I think in the short term, they staffed up.”
After that, officials recall, the relationship — and the T’s satisfaction with Keolis — improved. The French operator seemed to communicate more with MBTA bosses, and addressed some of the staffing shortages that had been causing headaches.
Both parties agreed in 2017 to share revenues from boosted fare collections. Before that, all of the money from paying riders went to the T; the deal allowed Keolis to earn a share for itself if fare revenue increased, incentivizing the operator to boost its fare collection efforts.
The outlook was on the upswing when an inflection point arrived that no one expected: the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the time, Keolis was nearly six years into the original eight-year contract. Because operating the commuter rail network is such an enormous undertaking, state officials expected to need 18 to 24 months of lead time to prepare for another round of bidding.
Consensus quickly grew that, with the world upside-down in the early months of the public health crisis, the safest approach was to keep Keolis around, despite the Baker administration’s prior skepticism.
“Would you have tested the market in June of 2020?” said Pollack, who is now a senior fellow at MIT’s Mobility Initiative. “We don’t know when lockdown is ending, we don’t know when people are going back to work.”
The MBTA’s oversight board voted unanimously in 2020 to extend Keolis for up to four years beyond its original contract expiration in 2022. The T awarded another one-year contract extension in 2024, keeping the French operator locked in through June 2027.
Since that early-pandemic decision, the commuter rail has continued to improve. From 2020 through mid-2024, Keolis hit or surpassed the target on-time performance rate.
Meanwhile, ridership has rebounded more on the commuter rail than on any of the T’s four major subway lines or its buses, at times even recording more monthly trips than in February 2020, the last full month before the pandemic hit.
The commuter rail network has been a bright spot nationally, too. A report from the federal Government Accountability Office published in May examined the ridership changes at 31 commuter rail networks across the country from the second half of 2019 to the second half of 2024.
The MBTA commuter rail ranked sixth overall in bringing back passengers. All five networks that did better — TEXRail in Texas, SMART in California, MetroRail in Texas, Tri-Rail in Florida, and the Downeaster in New England — each transported only a fraction as many riders as did the T’s commuter rail.
Experts said credit should be shared between Keolis and the MBTA itself, which embraced major schedule changes to run less service at traditional peak hours and more service in the middle of weekdays or on weekends. Trips now are more predictable, with a so-called “clock face” schedule offering service in the same window every hour (think 6:15 p.m. and 7:15 p.m., rather than 6:23 p.m. and 7:31 p.m.).
That seems to be a better fit for a post-pandemic work habits, in which many employees head into offices for only part of the day a few times per week.
Since 2018, the commuter rail has also offered a $10 weekend pass that proved even more popular after the pandemic, contributing to growing ridership.
“No one side is getting all the credit here,” said Janet Cheung, regional rail lead for advocacy group TransitMatters, who said the T and Keolis both deserve praise.
Pollack thinks the decision to extend Keolis opened the door to those improvements.
“If the [MBTA board] and Keolis and the T had not agreed to the four-year extension in those early months, and given COVID time to run its course, and time for the regional rail thinking to advance, and time for at least some people to start to come back to the places that commuter rail runs, commuter rail wouldn’t have the ridership it has in 2025,” she said.
In a statement to CommonWealth Beacon, Keolis North America CEO Brad Thomas touted improved on-time performance in the past five years, more frequent service during the day, and better fare collection as markers of success.
“Our passengers have a safer, more frequent, and more reliable service than ever before, while momentum toward the MBTA’s vision for regional rail has never been greater,” Thomas said. “Keolis remains fully committed to realizing that vision.”
The company is not without problems today. Last spring, Keolis canceled or delayed trains on the new South Coast Rail expansion soon after it opened due to staffing shortages, prompting the T to issue fines. A report from state Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s office last year also found the T failed to assess more than $3.3 million in performance-based penalties against Keolis.
But Keolis has at least fared well enough to earn a spot on the shortlist for the next long-term contract.
MBTA officials last month named three “teams” that will be able to vie for operation of the commuter rail starting in July 2027: the joint group of Keolis and Alstom, a consortium known as Mass Regional Rail, and another consortium known as Transdev North America.
Leaders of the transit agency plan to talk with those three finalists over much of the coming year about what they want the next stretch of commuter rail improvements to look like. Bids will be due in the fall, and the T is likely to pick a winner by the end of the year.
Each bidder has a French connection: RATP Développement S.A. is part of the Mass Regional Rail team, and Transdev’s parent company is based in France.
Mass Regional Rail also features a noteworthy familiar face. One of its members, Alternate Concepts Inc., was founded by former MBTA general manager Jim O’Leary, who previously chaired the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad — which was replaced by Keolis as commuter rail operator in 2014, prompting a legal challenge.
Over the past decade, the MBTA has steadily increased its spending on commuter rail. In fiscal year 2015, the first with Keolis at the helm, the agency budgeted about $397 million for what it calls “total purchased commuter rail service.” The T’s current operating budget for fiscal 2026 allocates $599 million for that line item.
Much of the increase is a result of rising fuel prices. Other cost drivers have emerged over the decade, too, like the launch of service on the South Coast Rail extension, more frequent weekend service across the network, and new anti-collision technology.
Most experts agree the next commuter rail contract will be pricey. Kane expects it will surpass $10 billion, and so he wants lawmakers to take a more active role.
“This contract is too important and too big to be left to the MBTA procurement department alone to manage,” he said. “There need to be legislative oversight hearings of this entire process — not because anyone’s done anything wrong, I want to be very clear. It just is too big that it needs that next level of political scrutiny to make sure that the taxpayers of Massachusetts are getting a good deal.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/drawbridge1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-13 08:58:03.556720

Robert Howell
Robert Howell, a Republican running for Insurance Commissioner, is president of Exatron, a cybersecurity equipment manufacturer in Silicon Valley. 


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the fifth response. Read the other candidate responses here, here, here and here.
California’s insurance system is not working for regular people. Homeowners are losing coverage, premiums keep rising and the state’s safety net is under strain.
This did not happen overnight. It is the outcome of years of weak oversight and a government that has been too willing to look the other way. 
The first problem is accountability. Insurers are allowed to pick and choose how they participate in California’s market. They sell auto insurance and other profitable products, then walk away from homeowners insurance when risk increases. 
That is not a balanced system. If companies want to do business in California, they should share responsibility for essential coverage that protects people’s homes. 
One reform worth pursuing is tying homeowners insurance participation to broader market access. If an insurer operates in a region and sells other lines of insurance, it should also be required to offer homeowners coverage there, subject to reasonable standards. Allowing companies to profit from California while abandoning homeowners pushes risk onto families and onto the state. 
Stronger enforcement around cancellations and nonrenewals is also critical. Entire neighborhoods are being dropped with little explanation and little notice. Families who have paid premiums for years are left scrambling through no fault of their own. 
That is not market forces at work. It is regulatory failure. Insurers should be required to explain large-scale withdrawals, and homeowners who invest in mitigation and fire hardening should see those efforts count. 
The second problem is cost. Californians are paying more and getting less. Premiums are rising, deductibles are higher and coverage keeps shrinking. Too often, these increases are approved without explanations that consumers can understand. 
That is why California needs an Insurance Payers Bill of Rights. Homeowners deserve enforceable protections. They should know why rates are going up, what they are paying for and what policy changes are being made. They should receive meaningful notice before cancellations or reductions in coverage, along with a real appeals process.
Insurance should not be a black box.
Price increases do not always appear as higher premiums. Insurers shift costs through exclusions, higher deductibles and fine print that quietly reduces protection. Those changes deserve the same scrutiny as formal rate hikes. If insurers cannot justify them clearly and in plain language, they should not be approved. 
Competition matters too. A market with fewer insurers and fewer choices puts consumers at a disadvantage. California should encourage responsible new entrants and create a predictable regulatory environment. Competition alone is not enough, but paired with strong oversight and consumer rights, it helps keep prices in check. 
We also need to be honest about the California FAIR Plan. FAIR was never meant to be the primary insurer for large parts of the state. Today, it faces exposure in the tens of billions of dollars. There is no realistic way to stabilize FAIR while it continues absorbing risk the private market is allowed to shed. 
If FAIR runs into serious trouble, the state will pay one way or another. That means homeowners and taxpayers. FAIR can only function as intended if the private market is restored and insurers are held accountable. 
This crisis will not be solved by putting another insurance insider in charge. Californians need an Insurance Commissioner who understands what it is like to be on the receiving end of a cancellation notice or a massive premium increase. The job is to stand up for consumers and restore a system that works for the people it was meant to serve.

Chad Hanson
Chad Hanson, based in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains, is a wildfire scientist with the John Muir Project.


One year ago, in early January, the Eaton and Palisades fires devastated the communities of Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Driven by extremely dry, warm and powerful winds, the fires destroyed more than 10,000 homes and claimed at least 31 lives. 
How can we make sure it doesn’t happen again?
The good news is, science has provided a clear answer: The only effective way to protect homes and lives from wildfires is to implement direct measures to create fire-safe communities — including home hardening, defensible space pruning next to homes and businesses, and evacuation planning and assistance. 
This community-based approach is highly successful in saving towns from firestorms. 
Importantly, the evidence also indicates that vegetation removal and management beyond 100 feet from homes and other structures provide no additional safety benefit.
More bad news: State and federal politicians of both parties are supporting the wrong things.
At the state level, only 2% of all wildland fire funding is being allocated to the proven fire-safe community measures, while the other 98% is being spent ineffectively, mostly on activities in wildlands, such as logging and removal of chaparral, distant from homes.
And at the federal level, there are no requirements that any wildland fire funds be spent on fire-safe community measures. The Infrastructure Act of 2021 includes hollow language about community wildfire protection but focuses on logging in the “wildland urban interface.” 
The Act not only ignores many at-risk communities that are nowhere near forests — such as Altadena and Pacific Palisades — but it also defines the wildland urban interface so broadly that it allows backcountry logging on public lands, miles from the nearest home.
Even after the profound losses of homes and lives in the Eaton and Palisades fires, Congress’ response so far has been the so-called “Fix Our Forests Act,” proposed legislation currently in the Senate that would override environmental laws to expedite taxpayer-subsidized, backcountry logging of mature trees and clearcutting on public lands — in the name of wildfire management. 
More than 100 environmental groups strongly oppose it. Alarmingly and ironically, the act would eliminate the very environmental analysis that would inform land managers about whether a particular logging or chaparral removal project would worsen wildfires and increase threats to nearby communities.
This is not merely an academic concern. Many of the U.S. Forest Service’s own scientists are sounding the alarm, as evidence increasingly indicates “thinning” and other logging activities erode the natural windbreak that denser forests have, making fires spread much faster and more intensely. 
This means fires can reach towns more rapidly, giving people less time to safely evacuate and first responders less time to arrive and assist. 
Similarly, abundant science indicates that removal of chaparral — native shrub habitat— in the name of curbing wildfires tends to convert landscapes into far more combustible, invasive grasslands, which can carry flames more quickly toward nearby houses and businesses in southern California. 
As hundreds of scientists have warned, recent wildfires have raced through large areas of “thinned” forests and “fuelbreaks,” burning down entire communities.
The truth is, most people do not have the knowledge or resources to make their homes and communities fire-safe. Many people need assistance. Elected officials — Democrats and Republicans — must change course. Instead of advancing legislation that pleases logging industry campaign contributors, they should prioritize measures that directly help create fire-safe communities. Otherwise, the devastation of January 2025 is all but guaranteed to recur.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/011025_LA-Wildfires_JH_34.jpg?fit=1024%2C732&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-13 08:58:03.556720

“Man you get me excited with all those money bags,” former Mississippi Human Services Department Director John Davis once texted former WWE star Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr.
DiBiase is standing trial for his alleged role in a broader welfare fraud scandal that auditors found resulted in the loss of roughly $100 million in federal funds meant to assist the needy from 2016 to 2020. And Davis, who pleaded guilty in 2022 and is cooperating with the prosecution as he awaits sentencing, finished his second day testifying against the wrestler Monday.
The trial deals specifically with the charges against DiBiase – 13 counts ranging from conspiracy, wire fraud, theft and money laundering. The trial could last weeks. But five days in, testimony and exhibits have at times touched on the broader network of people at play.
“I have seen first hand with my own eyes what a letter with the state seal & endorsement from the Governor himself can do,” DiBiase texted Davis, according to a government exhibit displayed in court. “What’s crazy is when you put that letter in a quazi (sic) educated quazi (sic) celebrity’s hands who genuinely and sincerely wants to change the world. The doors of the decision makers and gold brick shares fly open off the hinges. Like a Baptist church when their 60min Jesus fix is up and they got football and chicken waiting at home.”
Several inquiries begged to be explored, such as when the prosecutor asked Davis to identify the eight different agency employees or attorney general’s office lawyers who reviewed and authorized one of the agreements used as a vehicle to pay DiBiase. 
Or when Davis explained that a federal director from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services traveled to Mississippi “all the time because he liked what we were doing.” 
Davis is set to return to the witness stand for cross-examination by the defense Tuesday.

The first day of Davis testimony lingered on the bizarre and sentimental relationship between the two men, who bonded quickly and intensely over their shared religiosity and elaborate plans for their futures. 
The second day, the prosecution kept pummeling the jury with text messages that suggested Davis and DiBiase aimed to use their access to the nation’s welfare delivery system to generate lifelong security for themselves and their families. 
While DiBiase was receiving large payments totaling more than $3 million from the state’s welfare and food assistance programs, the two men were discussing buying property and starting a compound together in order to “enjoy life the way it’s meant to be,” one text read.
Some seemed like passive fantasies, while others were more specific: Should Davis buy the orange Kubota or the green John Deere tractor? Had DiBiase seen this property for sale on Magnolia Drive? Davis said he’d give up the main house for a cottage in the lower 40.
Meanwhile, in one of the most poverty-stricken states in the nation, Davis’ department was denying up to 98% of people applying for cash assistance from the same pot of funds they were using. Out of the roughly $86.5 million Mississippi receives annually from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, it doles out about $4 million to families in need. 
Davis testified Monday that DiBiase was aware of the source of the funds he received.
“Fear is INEVITABLE,” reads screenshot from a power point former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis and wrestler Ted DiBiase Jr. used during their leadership training program called Law of 16.
Davis had worked for the department, starting out as a county-level eligibility worker assisting welfare applicants, for over two decades by the time DiBiase came along. When they met, Davis was also working as an adjunct professor and DiBiase was vice president of business development for a Christian insurance company called One Life America.
Both of their roles dealt with leadership development, Davis said. They texted about their desire to go into business together, combine the training concepts they’d devised and shop the product to businesses and other states as consultants. They pumped each other up.
“Your vision is so crystal clear and synergistic with mine that it’s got to be illegal,” DiBiase texted Davis.
When asked what DiBiase was doing alongside Davis on a da- to-day basis, Davis described him as “being a shadow and a person who could take notes and keep things straight.” 
“Taking meetings, going to things with the governor, the Governor’s Mansion, governor’s office,” Davis said. “… Anything I went to, he went to.”
While he was paid sporadically, DiBiase received an average of about $30,000 per week. 
Some employees at MDHS were earning annual salaries of $18,000, Davis testified Monday, about $350 a week.
Davis said his boss, then-Gov. Phil Bryant, had been receiving complaints about those workers delivering poor customer service, and that’s why Davis hired DiBiase to deliver talks to encourage them.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)When a legislative audit on the efficiency of the Utah System of Higher Education was first introduced to the public in 2024, it prompted cuts and reallocations for academic programs, but it also pointed to a longstanding frustration for higher education leaders — a lack of collaboration between public universities.
“We have exceptional institutions of higher education, really amazing leaders, amazing faculty, serving the needs of our regions, yet I watch them all competing against each other. And what I see is a lost opportunity,” Geoffrey Landward, Utah commissioner of higher education told lawmakers then.
Now, the Utah System of Higher Education is aiming for change, planting the seed to turn the group of institutions into a real unified system, potentially starting during the legislative session that begins Tuesday.
Audit: Could cutting low-performing college programs help Utah’s academic outlook? 

“There will be potentially legislation this session about it, but it will be a very bare bones bill,” Landward said on Monday. “The intent would be to essentially just set up the very broad infrastructure.”
The draft would essentially direct the Utah Board of Higher Education to organize the system into regions with “vertical integration,” or some streamlined operations. 
The makeup of those regions and how the institutions would collaborate is still undefined, Landward said. The idea is that the board will work over the next couple of years with all interested parties to start building on that structure. 
But, Landward already has a good guess about how the plans could end up looking. He visualizes a set of regions organized geographically. For example, he can see the Wasatch Front divided into three regions, with one encompassing Salt Lake County and Tooele, another grouping northern counties, and a third with institutions in southern counties. Rural areas may see other structures. 
“If we can develop the system in a way where we can get better access to programs and institutions in rural Utah through this, that’s the whole point, or at least one of the primary points of doing this kind of reorganization,” he said.

Each region would have a technical college, either a regional or research university, and in some cases, also a community college, Landward said. Within the regions, there are opportunities for integrated admissions, or academic advising, and also integrated degree and certificate programming, specifically designed for students to move through the system.
“So if you’re admitted into Tooele Tech, for example, or Salt Lake Community College, that means that there’s automatic admission pathways for you to the University of Utah, and that the advising is done in partnership with the University of Utah,” Landward said. 
There are currently partnerships between schools like Salt Lake Community College and the University of Utah that make transfers better, “but it’s not as seamless as it could be,” Landward added.
The system redesign could, for example, allow a community college to design associate degrees to align with a university’s bachelor’s degree program. And university students could take general education courses at community colleges at a lower cost. 
Landward described the current system as “a loosely affiliated group of institutions” that capture some benefits of being a unified system, “but just on the edges.” Without change now, the system could face a series of shutdowns and mergers in the coming decades, he said.
“I still have institutions trying to be all things to all students, competing for students trying to grow, and that’s the way the system operates right now. I don’t think that’s sustainable,” Landward said. “I think that we have to make some drastic changes over the next few years, because demographics will shift. There’ll be fewer students enrolling and fewer resources to go around, and we have to be more efficient and smart about how we’re operating.”

“We will continue building on our success in education, bolstering public safety, conservatively budgeting and preparing for Alabama’s strong future,” Ivey said in a statement last week, though the office did not provide details.
According to a press release, Ivey is expected to celebrate the semiquincentennial of the United States with Huntsville-based business owner Rodney Smith, Jr., who started a lawn service for veterans, and students from Booker T. Washington K-8 in Birmingham.
“An Alabamian who steps up to help veterans, talented students who share their gifts through music and young people proving what is possible in classrooms once written off – good things are happening across our 67 counties, and these guests help tell our success story in Alabama,” Ivey said in a statement Monday morning.
Ivey will serve through her record 10th legislative session as governor. Ivey has served the longest continual time as governor in Alabama history. She assumed the office in 2017, after Gov. Robert Bentley resigned following a plea deal over campaign finance violations. 
The session will likely go by quickly, with lawmakers looking to get back to their districts to raise money – which they are forbidden to do while the Legislature is in session – and campaign for re-election. 
Legislators’ single constitutional duty is passing the state’s Education Trust Fund and General Fund budgets, which each have their own demands. From rising health care costs to additional responsibilities from the federal government, lawmakers will have to find a way to meet the needs and fund public services. 
Lawmakers also have their own list of local legislation, which Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, wants to prioritize in order to avoid a rift between the two chambers that happened at the end of the 2025 session.

In practice, it’s more akin to voodoo.
It starts, as state law requires, with the governor’s introduction of a preliminary version in January, as Gavin Newsom did last week, unveiling a $349 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Theoretically, the Legislature will spend the next four months going through its details, Newsom will make some revisions in May, and he and legislators will finalize a version for adoption by the June 15 constitutional deadline.
A few decades ago, that’s what more or less happened each year. Over the last couple of decades, however, it’s gone off the rails.
As Democrats gained overwhelming control of the Legislature, they resented having minority Republicans having any input. Their allies in the public employee unions sponsored a 2010 ballot measure to lower the vote requirement for budgets from two-thirds to a simple majority, thereby eliminating the need for Republican votes.
Proposition 25 had another unspoken consequence. It allowed so-called “trailer bills” to be enacted with the same simple majority votes and take effect immediately upon signing. Originally, trailer bills were to make legal changes needed to implement budget allocations. But one year at a time it morphed into vehicles for major changes in state law that had little or nothing to do with the budget, often drafted in secrecy and passed in batches with little scrutiny.
Years ago, a reporter who covered the Legislature coined an apt name for such measures, calling them “mushroom bills” because they grew in the dark, nurtured by manure.
Newsom has been especially eager to exploit the trailer bill loophole, often packaging much of his agenda in such measures, making them subject to closed-door negotiations with legislative leaders and using the budget’s appropriations for leverage.
Some mushroom bills backfired when their true impacts became known, embarrassing legislators who voted for them, and forcing them to backtrack. Having been burned, legislators indirectly refused to allow some issues to be handled through trailer bills, forcing Newsom to deal with them more or less in public.
Two years ago, for example, they balked at Newsom’s effort to include an overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act in a trailer bill, leading to two years of negotiations that culminated last year in a CEQA reform measure.
Nevertheless, the trailer bill syndrome continues. The Capitol is waiting to see what Newsom has up his sleeve for the final budget of his governorship.
Even without the trailer-bill sideshow, forging a new budget will be difficult because Newsom has declared that the version he unveiled last week is basically a placeholder — an updated semi-clone of the current year’s budget — that must await more revenue data, particularly the all-important personal income tax returns due in April.
Newsom projects that the state will gain an extra $42.3 billion in revenue over three years, but faces doubt, especially from the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek. In an initial appraisal of Newsom’s budget Monday, he continues to warn that the state could take a serious revenue hit if the high-flying stock market stumbles.
“These risks are severe enough that not incorporating them into this year’s budget, as the governor proposes, would put the state on precarious footing,” Petek wrote. He also reminded the Legislature that even if Newsom’s rosy scenario comes to pass, the state sill still face hefty deficits, saying “the state’s negative fiscal situation is now chronic.”
With a dead-on-arrival draft budget, deep differences over revenues, chronic deficits and pressure on Newsom and legislators to offset the effects of major cuts in federal aid — not to mention looming trailer bill issues — it’s hard to even find a starting point.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010926-Budget-Presentation-FG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-13 08:12:19.513246

The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.
The Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”
U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.
“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.
The ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.
A spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.
Officials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”
Projects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.
The cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.
The city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.
Trump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.
Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”
The administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.
Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.
“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25364602346753-1024x685.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:58:41.794281

The utility, which originally intended to pay back customers for six months of overpayment, is offering to provide refunds back to June 2017, the last month for which it has records. If the PUC wants more, the utility says, it will have to go to court and in the process, delay reimbursements to customers.
“This approach substantially exceeds the Companies’ legal obligations and ensures prompt compensation for impacted customers,” the company said in a filing Friday. 
Regulatory staff for the PUC want customers made whole for all of the overcharges back to 2002, and with interest, by estimating the overcharges preceding 2017.
In a late December filing, staff maintained that NV Energy’s own Rule 5(H) on adjusting billing errors expressly requires NV Energy to “refund for overpayment…back to but not beyond the established date on which the error or omission commenced.” 
NV Energy argues no rule regulates how overcharges are addressed in the north, and that Southern Nevada customers are entitled to recoup overcharges going back just six months. 
NV Energy contends “punitive measures based on the mistaken belief that the Companies were unjustly enriched are neither appropriate nor necessary.”
 The Commission’s rate-setting process, “ensured that these errors did not result in a windfall to the Companies. While some customers paid more than they should have, others paid less, and the overall revenue requirements remained balanced.”
The utility argues the PUC’s authority is limited, and that it must file a contested case, which “would significantly delay compensation to customers.”
NV Energy argues the PUC lacks the authority to order a refund based on a finding that the company overcharged customers, adding “the appropriate forum for any such relief is in court.” 
The utility contends the Nevada Administrative Procedures Act requires “that any order that would determine the legal rights or duties of a utility be in a proceeding that is a contested case, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing. There is no question that this proceeding is only investigatory in nature.”
“It’s time for NV Energy to take responsibility and demonstrate good faith by making customers whole instead of continuing to delay and dispute what is rightfully owed to Nevadans,” said Camalot Todd, communications director for Nevada Conservation League. 
NV Energy maintains it’s identified almost all of the customers who were overcharged, but its estimates have varied during the last year.
The utility initially acknowledged overcharging some 60,000 customers by roughly $17 million, the Current reported in May, but the company later found through an audit it had overcharged another 20,000  “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.” 
The company now contends it overcharged 45,338 customers – 37,571 in the south and 7,767 in the north. A spokesperson did not respond to the Current’s request for clarification. 
It’s unknown how much of the estimated $65 million in overcharges has been paid back. NV Energy first attempted to reimburse a portion of customers a total of $2.5 million, based on what PUC staff alleged was an inapplicable rule limiting reimbursement of overcharges to six months. 
A law passed by the Legislature last year in response to NV Energy’s failure to make customers whole requires that utilities pay back all overcharges with interest. In the future, active customers will get a credit to their bills, while former customers will receive a refund, according to the new law.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NVEnergy_RC_003-scaled-e1683758765721-1024x629.jpg,,,2026-01-13 07:58:21.027573

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation requiring paid political influencers to report to Indiana lobbying regulators heads to the Senate floor after a Monday committee vote, despite major concerns from regulators and First Amendment advocates — and the author’s admission the bill was drafted in a rush.
A ban on ranked choice voting also advanced.
Indiana already governs professional lobbyists paid to influence the legislative and executive branches, but Sen. Scott Alexander sees a gap.
“It’s really the influencers that we’ve been seeing that are influencing politics outside of the parameters of, for instance, the lobbyists,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Monday, after his Senate Bill 267 squeaked through the Senate’s Elections Committee.
Alexander, R-Muncie, wants transparency for those “paid to influence (or) paid to protest.”
Sen. Scott Alexander, R-Muncie, asked his colleagues to get his bill, which would regulate paid political influencers as lobbyists, through committee, but promised he’d make changes. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
His legislation focuses on “influence campaigns,” defined as attempts to mobilize the public to take some action or contact state officials — including via protest.
Executive branch leaders like the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, comptroller, treasurer and attorney general count, and so would the legislative branch’s lawmakers. Also accounted for are candidates, employees, consultants and close relatives of both branches.
Someone who encourages another person to engage in an influence campaign — and pays that person at least $500 in a year — would be required to file with the Indiana Lobby Registration Commission within 24 hours of handing over the cash, beginning July 1.
They’d need to submit detailed information on themselves, their organization, others involved in the influence campaign, their goals and their expenditures, according to the proposal.
“We would like to support Senate Bill 267, because there is certainly a need for more transparency around money spent to influence the legislative process,” said Julia Vaughn, with elections watchdog Common Cause Indiana.
However, she said, the group is opposed “because we think it’s duplicative of current law for registered lobbyists, at least, and unworkable for those it would apply to.”
Vaughn observed, for example, that the giver of money would be responsible for disclosing how it was spent, although that duty is typically placed on the recipient.
Administrative, 1A concerns
Regulator testimony revealed deeper dilemmas.
The Lobby Registration Commission is one of just two legislative branch agencies, alongside the Legislative Services Agency, said Edward Ferguson, the entity’s executive director and general counsel.
“We question the wisdom of putting the ILRC in a position of having to deal with actions taken to influence executive branch members, especially since the executive branch has its own statute concerning lobbying,” Ferguson said, noting he’d been in touch with ILRC’s commissioners about the bill.

He testified on key concerns with a bill that would regulate paid political influencers as lobbyists. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Lobbyists who earn at least $500 annually to influence the legislative branch file with the commission. Those who make at least $1,000 annually to influence the executive branch register with the Indiana Department of Administration.
“The ILRC has never in its history regulated lobbying and influencing in the executive branch,” Ferguson told the committee. “I see a separation of powers issue here.”
Furthermore, the 24-hour deadline for reports “seems unreasonable and a bit confusing,” he added, because payments for lobbying services are often made weeks or months after.
He anticipated the ILRC would be “swamped” with reporting problems.
The agency has just one full-time employee — Ferguson — and a part-time employee, supplemented by an additional staffer during peak registration and activity reporting periods, he said.
“Our current staffing level is ultimately insufficient” to handle Senate Bill 267, Ferguson continued, in contrast to an LSA fiscal impact analysis that said increases in workload “are within the routine administrative function” of the agency and could be absorbed with “existing resource and funding levels.”
First Amendment advocates, meanwhile, warned the legislation could infringe upon constitutionally protected paid advocacy.

Samantha Bresnahan, with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, said while the group supports transparency in government, “it must be balanced against constitutional rights.” The bill could “chill” political association and participation, she said.
“If what the bill’s authors hope to accomplish is to squelch paid protesters … this bill is not a way to accomplish that,” agreed Barbara Tully, with the League of Women Voters of Indiana.
Paid protester perceptions
Outrage over allegedly compensated paid advocacy is growing nationwide, although fact-checkers like Politifact have repeatedly found such accusations aren’t supported by evidence.
“I know that some of my colleagues thought there were some paid protesters during the redistricting fight,” said Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis. Several demonstrations, both for and against President Donald Trump’s map-drawing push, were held before the campaign failed.
“Do you believe that … there are people that are being paid to protest?” Ford asked Alexander.
“Around the Statehouse? I would say there probably are,” he responded. “Yeah, yeah, for sure.”
Asked if his bill was aimed at paid protesters, Alexander told the Capital Chronicle, “No, not necessarily.” He acknowledged it could “catch” compensated advocates.
But, he emphasized, there’s “definitely not an intent to push down on free speech.”
Another colleague questioned whether social media influencers who are paid by political parties or outside groups would also have to report activity.

Lawmakers of both parties expressed misgivings following testimony, prompting Alexander to admit, “This is a bill that we got down to the wire on.”
Sen. Linda Rogers, R-Granger, asked if the bill could be held, but committee chair Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, noted the panel meets on Mondays and next Monday is a holiday. The deadline for bills to pass from committee is Jan. 26.
Legislative leaders plan to adjourn in late February, two weeks sooner than usual, to offset the cost of the two weeks they dedicated to redistricting in December — compressing the 10-week session into just eight.
“What I would like to ask the committee is that we go ahead and move the bill, if you think you can move it today with the promise from Sen. Alexander that he will work with us on a substantial revision on second reading,” Gaskill said. “I think that’s the only possibility at this time to give the bill the hope of moving forward.”
Several witnesses and committee members offered their assistance.
“I do think that it has potential,” said Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport. “But, again, I offer the help to get it in a good spot, because right now it’s not.”
The legislation advanced on a 6-3 vote. Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, joined two Democrats in opposition.
Ranked choice preemption moves
A prohibition on ranked choice voting was also voted out of committee.
Most elections use a single choice model. In a ranked choice version, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins a majority of ballots on which they are listed as the top choice, the other rankings are used to determine a winner.
“Part of the problem with ranked choice voting,” said Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Goshen, is voters who only wish to support one candidate either complete the ballot to “vot(e) against that person at some point” — or skip the rankings and don’t get counted in later rounds.
Jason Snead, executive director of the Honest Elections Project, testifies in committee on Monday, Jan. 12, 2026. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“That scares us,” Doriot said, noting that Indiana Code is silent on the issue, and could be impacted by the results of a federal lawsuit, for example.
Opponents of his Senate Bill 12 indicated the ranked choice  approach could help bridge the partisan divide.
Tully said the league in Indiana supports ranked choice voting to “reduce the toxicity of negative campaigning, to advance those candidates who have broad support, to keep candidates and campaigns issues-focused.”
Advocates of the ban, including the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office, said ranked choice voting is complicated to administer and creates longer ballots for weary voters to fill out.
Jason Snead of the Honest Elections Project said Indiana should outlaw the system even though it’s not currently used, adding, “You should not wait for the ranked choice voting lobby to make Indiana a target.”
Brad King, the Republican co-director of the bipartisan Indiana Election Division, said the state’s home rule law already bars local units of government from using election procedures like ranked choice voting, but that it doesn’t prevent all litigation.
The legislation advanced on a 7-2 vote, along party lines.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As Elle Neubauer drove before dawn past the darkened windows of the immigrant-owned businesses on Lake Street in Minneapolis, her co-pilot and friend Patty O’Keefe scanned the passing vehicles with binoculars, searching for signs of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
As the sun rose, more community patrollers arrived on Lake Street, keeping eyes on the Ecuadorean grocery stores, Somali restaurants and Mexican taco shops that line the street. With such a high concentration of patrollers and relatively few federal agents in the area that morning, Neubauer and O’Keefe decided to head south to the suburb of Bloomington, where O’Keefe said she had encountered ICE the day prior.
The goal is to “distract them, to occupy their time,” O’Keefe said. “The more time they’re trying to get away from us, the less time they’re spending searching for people to abduct.”
The pair quickly located and started following a white Ford Explorer they suspected belonged to ICE. The driver began weaving through suburban parking lots with Neubauer close behind, seemingly trying to confirm he was being followed.
“They do and will say anything to try to intimidate and scare people,” Neubauer said that morning. “One of their favorite lines recently is, ‘This is your one and only warning.’”
The Explorer came to a stop in a hotel parking lot, and Neubauer parked nearby. The driver of the Explorer then pulled his vehicle behind Neubauer’s car, blocking the exit.
A man with a black face covering and a tactical vest peeking through his flannel shirt exited his car and approached the passenger door, gesturing for O’Keefe to roll down the window.

“No, thank you,” Neubauer said, smiling and waving at the man.
“Stop following us,” he said, his voice muffled through the closed car window and the gaiter. “This is your first warning.”
Neubauer and O’Keefe started patrolling their south Minneapolis neighborhood recently as the Trump administration has ramped up its mass deportation campaign in Minnesota, sending in thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents, with more on the way. They are some of the many thousands of Twin Cities residents who have come together over the past year to protest ICE and divert the agents from their mission, often resulting in tense confrontations.
Minnesota has been the focus of President Donald Trump’s deportation efforts since December, when a right-wing media outlet published unsubstantiated allegations that Somali Minnesotans were funding terrorism with money stolen from government programs. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced “Operation Metro Surge” in December, which purported to target Somali immigrants, the vast majority of whom are citizens or legal permanent residents. 
The effort to disrupt ICE operations has only grown in the days after ICE agent Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good in her car in south Minneapolis, as Minnesotans look for ways to push back against what many view as an occupation of the city by unwelcome federal forces. There are now at least four times more immigration agents in the state than there are Minneapolis police officers. 
Citizen observers are gathering on street corners and posting on social media to connect with each other, and immigrant rights organizations are quickly reaching capacity at training sessions for people who want to learn how to support and defend immigrants.
ICE did not respond to the Reformer’s emails for comment for this story.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good was attempting to run over a federal agent in an act of “domestic terrorism.”Appearing on a Sunday morning Fox News show, Noem said her agency is investigating the funding behind anti-ICE operations, and claimed nonprofit organizations are training people to “distract them, assault them and do exactly what we’ve seen with these vehicle rammings.”
After the man finished talking to the patrollers and got back in the white Explorer, a second vehicle — a black GMC Yukon SUV— pulled in behind him, blocking in Neubauer’s car while the Explorer drove away.

Neubauer and O’Keefe followed the black SUV out of the parking lot.
“I wonder how many first warnings we can get today,” O’Keefe said, half-jokingly.
She evidently ran out of warnings two days later, when federal agents smashed in her car window, dragged her and her co-pilot out of the car, and held them for eight hours in the belly of the Whipple Federal Building.
Neighbors join forces to track ICE, warn potential targets
When Trump assumed the presidency for the second time, immigrant rights activists landed on a strategy to respond to the coming increase in immigrant arrests: rapid response networks. Grouped by geographic proximity, they would quickly arrive at the scene of an ICE raid to protest, warn nearby neighbors, tell detainees about their rights and convince agents to leave. A common tactic is pointing out that agents can’t enter private property without permission or a judicial warrant.
Around the country, as ICE deployments escalated in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, anti-ICE protesters have adopted and spread the tactics of honking horns and blowing whistles to alert entire city blocks to agents’ presence. The practice has become common in the Twin Cities, especially since “Operation Metro Surge” began in December.
Over the past year, immigrant rights groups have hosted “know your rights” trainings for immigrants and rapid responders, outlining the laws governing ICE and the protocols observers should follow to avoid arrest. At these trainings, neighbors meet each other and plug into their local rapid response networks. 
Following cars, making noise and filming law enforcement operations is legal, according to Tracy Roy of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota. Physically blocking ICE agents from making an arrest is not. (And getting arrested, Neubauer said, takes resources away from the movement, in addition to the high personal cost.)
Rapid responders have gathered en masse at protracted federal raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul in the past year, resulting in standoffs between protesters and ICE, in which ICE agents used physical force, pepper spray and tear gas on the demonstrators. 
But with the explosion in new agents arriving to the state, federal tactics seem to have shifted: ICE agents are conducting arrests quickly, in smaller groups than those that have provoked mass protest. By the time rapid responders arrive at the scene of a reported immigration raid or arrest — even if it only takes a few minutes — the ICE agents are often long gone. 
So, the rapid responders have gotten more proactive, setting off on neighborhood patrols, finding and following ICE agents to try to discourage them from making arrests. They also film the agents in action to document potential violations of the law.
“If they know that somebody is watching, they’re significantly less likely to stop somebody,” Neubauer said. “Often when they pull over and people hop on a whistle or on their horn, they’ll just leave.”

In group chats, neighbors using anonymous nicknames volunteer to assist with various aspects of the operation. No one assigns shifts or jobs; group members take on a needed role when they’re available, alert the group to their activities and let everyone know when they’re done.
The system is both highly organized and decentralized, with no clear leaders — just longer-time members of the network helping newcomers learn the communication style and security practices of the group.
As Neubauer drove on Friday morning’s patrol, O’Keefe monitored their local chat and listened to a group call. Both looked for what they’d learned were the hallmarks of ICE vehicles: out-of-state license plates, tinted windows, at least two people in the car — usually male, almost always masked.

When they spotted a suspicious vehicle in Bloomington, Neubauer maneuvered into position to follow it. An immediate giveaway that the vehicle belongs to federal agents, the patrollers said, is that the drivers quickly realize they’re being followed and start driving erratically. Early Friday morning, O’Keefe and Neubauer suspected a vehicle carried ICE officers; it aggressively accelerated towards Neubauer’s car while she made a U-turn at an intersection. Another vehicle they were following ran a red light, leaving the patrollers’ car behind.

“Well, if my plate wasn’t in their database, it is now,” Neubauer said Friday as she and O’Keefe followed the black SUV that had just boxed them in.
O’Keefe shared a description of the car and its license plate number so it could be added to the observers’ crowdsourced list.
As a countermeasure to the activists’ license plate tracking, ICE agents have been frequently switching license plates, drawing a warning from state regulators. 
Even after they lost the SUV — the driver cut abruptly across several lanes of traffic — the encounter was a successful waste of ICE resources, in the patrollers’ eyes. ICE had dedicated an entire vehicle to impeding the observers for several minutes, rather than conducting arrests.
“Deep breaths,” Neubauer said, reaching over to pat O’Keefe on the leg.

Managing one’s own emotions and staying calm is key to patrolling, because ICE agents are “emotional and not well-trained,” Neubauer said. 
‘I feel changed’
Neubauer and a different observer were following three apparent federal vehicles Monday when the convoy pulled onto a side street and came to a stop. Five agents hopped out of their vehicles, and one wearing a face covering and ICE vest approached the drivers’ side window as the others surrounded the car. 
As he approached the window, he greeted the driver with Neubauer’s wife’s legal name — the name on the car’s registration.
“If you keep following us…we’ll have to pull you out and arrest you,” the agent said. Neubauer and her co-pilot decided to keep following them — after all, they figured, they weren’t doing anything illegal.

The convoy took them straight to Neubauer’s house, where they stopped and idled for a few minutes before moving on. 
According to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ICE agents have routinely identified the drivers following them, then led them to the observers’ home — apparently using a law enforcement database to connect license plate numbers to drivers’ home addresses in an effort to intimidate observers.
On Monday, they took the intimidation tactics one step further. 
Two cars split off from the group, and Neubauer and her partner for the day decided to follow the third vehicle, a grey pickup truck. They stayed close behind for several minutes until they realized the truck was leading them towards the Whipple Federal Building. 
As Neubauer and her co-pilot followed the truck, agents returned to Neubauer’s house and banged on the front door. Her wife, who asked the Reformer not to publish her name out of fear of ICE, pretended she wasn’t home. The agents left after several neighbors stepped out of their houses and started blowing whistles.
When Neubauer realized what had happened, she called off the patrol and headed home.
“I feel changed, and afraid,” Neubauer’s wife said, looking at Neubauer. “I was very fearful — not for me, but for what could have happened to you.”
They set out on another patrol that afternoon, together.

Killed in the act
Since Ross shot and killed Good, immigrant rights activists and elected officials have referred to her as an “observer.”
When Neubauer saw video of the shooting, however, she noticed something that suggested Good may not have been trained, or experienced, in interacting with ICE: Her window was rolled down, and she was speaking to the agents, against the advice of many immigrant rights activists.
“The shooting on Wednesday was 1000% not Renee’s fault. It was an ICE officer panicking and shooting into her car,” Neubauer said. “If we can manage the emotions of ICE officers so they’re not panicking … they’re less likely to f*ck up and make a mistake and hurt someone.”
Several leaders of immigrant rights groups and members of Good’s local neighborhood rapid response network told the Reformer they did not know Good.
Even if Good were in the group chat, the people interviewed by the Reformer may not have known, because they use code names and generally do not know each other’s real identities.
Friday morning, one patroller spoke up in the group call to say their car had been boxed in and ICE agents were approaching.
Another group member repeated the collective mantra: Lock your doors, roll up the windows, do not engage.

Broken glass
Sunday morning, O’Keefe was patrolling south Minneapolis with her friend Brandon Sigüenza when they heard ICE agents had surrounded another patroller’s car and were deploying pepper spray. When they arrived at the scene, they saw two federal vehicles surrounded by people blowing whistles and honking horns, O’Keefe said.
The agents got back in their cars and drove away. O’Keefe and Sigüenza followed them down a residential street until the vehicles stopped in the middle of the road and agents came up to the car — again giving them a “final warning” to stop following the officers, O’Keefe said.
O’Keefe shouted through the closed windows that she wasn’t obstructing them and that they could move forward if they wanted to, she said.
Sigüenza, for his part, said he kept repeating Renee Good’s name.
As the agents were walking back to their cars, one turned around and sprayed pepper spray into the car’s intake vent, Sigüenza said. 
The pair continued following the convoy, O’Keefe honking her horn, until the agents stopped and got out of their cars again.
This time, they shattered both front windows and dragged Sigüenza and O’Keefe from the car, according to video captured by observers. Sigüenza said both of their phones flew from his hands, his landing in the frozen street. Agents handcuffed both activists and placed them in separate unmarked vehicles bound for the Whipple Federal Building, they said.
O’Keefe said the agents ridiculed her while she was in the backseat of the car. 
“You guys gotta stop obstructing us,” O’Keefe recalls one agent saying. Then, referring to Renee Good: “That’s why that lesbian b*tch is dead.”
O’Keefe became enraged, calling the agent a “f*cking bigot.” She committed his comment to memory and quoted it to everyone she could inside the Whipple Building, she said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment Monday.
O’Keefe’s partner, Mitch Ditlefsen, called her as he was leaving his job as a prep cook at around 9:45 a.m.

“Someone picked up and said, ‘The owner of this phone has been abducted by ICE,’” Ditlefsen said. 
“I showed up, and there was just shattered windows and pepper spray, and no indication of where Patty and Brandon were,” Ditlefsen said. 
The pair said they spent eight hours in custody, mostly in holding cells with other U.S. citizens who said they were also arrested while protesting ICE. O’Keefe said she was never provided a phone call; Sigüenza was able to call his wife. 
While in custody, Sigüenza said, agents suggested they would pay him or expedite immigration proceedings for his relatives if he provided the agents with names of undocumented immigrants or protest organizers. Both were released without charges. 
Sigüenza said he’ll take a short break from patrolling for his wife’s sake — she feared for his safety long before his arrest — but he’s ready to get back out there. 
O’Keefe said the experience has strengthened her resolve, but also ratcheted up her fear. 
“They don’t realize this is coming from a deep place of love and empathy and care for my community,” O’Keefe said. “And that is a stronger feeling that I have in me than fear.”
Feeling besieged, a neighborhood fights back
When thousands of people showed up to mourn Good at a vigil the night she was killed, organizers urged attendees to get connected to their local immigrant defense networks in whatever role they are comfortable with.
Everyone has different skills and risk tolerances, Neubauer said, so there’s a role for everyone. For example, going door to door to meet one’s neighbors is one important way to increase safety and support people who may be staying home for fear of ICE, Neubauer said. 
“But honestly, I have too much social anxiety,” she said. “It was just too much for me to do that. And for whatever reason, my brain works in such a way where (patrolling) is less anxiety-inducing than talking to my neighbors door-to-door.”
She wouldn’t be able to deal with the emotional toll of patrolling without support from her wife, she said. The movement needs all kinds of help; whistles and volunteers to distribute them; plate checkers and people to coordinate among different networks in various languages; food delivery for immigrants sheltering in place.
And, more people in more neighborhoods who are ready to jump into action when ICE shows up next door.

Schramm,,,,,https://missouriindependent.com/2026/01/13/what-is-the-chief-justice-signaling-in-his-year-end-report/,I was struck by the inspirational tone of the year-end report issued by Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts went back to basics with his review of the fundamentals spelled out by Thomas Paine in his “Common Sense” pamphlet and the principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence. Although the Declaration of Independence is not […],"(photo courtesy of C-SPAN).I was struck by the inspirational tone of the year-end report issued by Chief Justice John Roberts.
Roberts went back to basics with his review of the fundamentals spelled out by Thomas Paine in his “Common Sense” pamphlet and the principles laid out in the Declaration of Independence. Although the Declaration of Independence is not part of U.S. law, Roberts viewed the founding document as having “played a signal role in the nation’s constitutional, statutory, and common law.”
Roberts then highlighted points in U.S. history when the Nation made progress in vindicating the promise of the Declaration. He pointed to the abolition of slavery in the Thirteenth Amendment, the recognition of women’s right to vote in the Nineteenth Amendment, the recognition of equal rights in Brown v. Board of Education, and the adoption of the landmark civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Roberts saw these events as part of the “never ending quest to fulfill the Constitution’s promise of a ‘more perfect union’.”
Roberts wrote: “These national accomplishments illustrate that the responsibilities for livings up to the promises of the Declaration rest on all three branches of government as well as well as on each sucessive generation of Americans.”  Roberts placed particular emphasis on the critical role of federal judges in this process. Roberts wrote that the judges “must continue to decide the cases before us according to our oath, doing equal right to the poor and to the rich, and performing all our duties faithfully and impartially under the Constituion and laws of the United States.”
I consider the stirring words of this report to be truly inspirational. But what was the Chief Justice actually signaling to the nation with his words? Roberts devoted much of his leadership role as Chief Justice to undermining the “national accomplishments” he now celebrates. And in ruling on shadow docket cases, Roberts has repeatedly sided with the majority in undermining the role of lower federal court judges as bastions against abuses of executive authority.

Roberts wrote the majority opinion in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 181 (2023). Roberts in SFFA overruled decades of affirmative acton cases going back to the Bakke decision in the 1970s. The majority adopted what Roberts viewed as a “colorblind” approach to equal protection. Roberts rejected the theory that the Reconstruction era amendments, like the Thirteenth Amendment, allowed the government to give any affirmative relief to AfricanAmericans who had been subjected to the horrors of slavery. At the same time, Roberts ignored the key role Brown played in providing affirmative relief to African Americans by ordering the integration of public schools.
Roberts took an indirect swipe atBrown when he wrote a plurality opinion in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. 701 (2007). In a split decision, the Court found it unconstitutional for a school district to use race as a factor in assigning students to schools to achieve racial diversity, unless the district was remedying a prior history of de jure  Roberts wrote bluntly in his plurality opinion: “The way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”
Roberts wrote the majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). Roberts in Shelby County struck down the formula used for the preclearance requirement under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Under this formula in Section 4(b), those states with a long history of racial discrimination had to obtain preclearance from the Justice Department to make changes that might undermine the voting rights of African Americans. Roberts considered the formula in this landmark civil rights legislation to be outdated and no longer necessary.
In this term, the Roberts Court now has before it a case where the Court could strike down a more fundamental part of the Voting Rights Act – the Section 2 provision prohibiting racial discrimination in voting rights. See, Louisiana v. Callais, No. 24-109. The specific question presented in Louisiana is whether the Voting Rights Act still allows voters of color to challenge racially discriminatory voting maps in court.
On many questions associated with separation of powers, Roberts has consistently sided with the majority in using the Court’s emergency docket to give the Trump administration sweeping powers under its unitary executive theory. And in so doing, Roberts rejected the power of lower court judges to issue temporary injunctions to rein in abuses of executive authority.

So now, what are we to make of the Chief Justice’s inspirational year-end report? Is Roberts having second thoughts about his prior actions because of the imminent threat to democracy posed by Trump? The recent Trump invasion of Venezuala may feed that theory. If that is Roberts’ thinking, he could be signaling a change in course on how he approaches critical questions like tariffs, birthright citizenship, racial discrimination, or separation of powers.
The other possibility is that Roberts is presenting his inspirational theme just to placate an increasing angry public. Polling suggests the public no longer holds the Supreme Court in particularly high esteem. Roberts cannot reverse this trend with empty platitudes.
We should have some idea by the end of this term if the year-end report has any lasting significance.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/John-Roberts.jpg,,,2026-01-13 06:58:21.983621

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey legislators will have more to celebrate after swearing in Tuesday than their brethren of past years — they’re getting a giant pay raise.
A controversial salary hike that the Democratic-led Legislature passed on the last day of its 2022-23 legislative session takes effect Tuesday, when a new two-year legislative session starts.
Annual pay for the state’s 120 part-time legislators will jump 67% from $49,000 to $82,000, with the Senate president and Assembly speaker each getting roughly $27,000 extra a year for their leadership roles. Every legislator gets $150,000 annually to pay their staff.
Bill to limit plastic utensils in restaurants wins legislative approval

The legislative raises will cost taxpayers $9.8 million a year — $4 million a year more than previously.
Raises for New Jersey’s governor and lieutenant governor, which take effect with next week’s inauguration, are similarly eye-popping. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Lt. Gov.-elect Dale Caldwell will make $210,000 each, up $35,000 from the $175,000 annual salaries Gov. Phil Murphy and Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way made.
Supporters of the salary hikes said lawmakers’ pay had stagnated since 2002 and should climb to keep up with the cost of living in one of the nation’s most expensive states. Legislators also have said they sometimes work outside of scheduled legislative days because of constituent services and other duties.
The law also hiked the salaries for 22 executive-branch officials, as well as the state Board of Public Utilities’ five commissioners, from $175,000 to $210,000 — although those raises began soon after Murphy signed the law in January 2024.
Critics had complained that the bumps would make New Jersey lawmakers among the highest paid in the nation, at a time of growing deficits and other budget challenges. Lawmakers passed a record-high $58.8 billion budget in June that included controversial cuts and budget diversions impacting colleges and universities, affordable housing, harm reduction work, and more.
New Jersey legislators now make more than any other state lawmakers outside of New York ($142,000), California ($128,000), Pennsylvania ($106,000), Illinois ($89,000), and Alaska ($84,000), according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
New York, California, and Pennsylvania have full-time legislatures, while Illinois and Alaska are considered “full-time lite,” which the conference defines as having fewer session days and smaller districts and staffs than truly full-time legislatures.
New Jersey’s part-time legislators typically hold other jobs and logged just 89 legislative days in 2025 and 90 in 2024.
Sherrill will be the ninth-highest-paid governor nationally, according to Business Insider.

So far, the state has had little input on data center construction outside of a provision in the 2023-25 state budget which exempted data center construction projects from paying sales taxes. 
The Democratic bill, introduced last year by Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland), would require data centers to report the level of energy and water they’re using, fund the development of renewable energy projects and ensure the cost of increased energy demands aren’t passed on to regular consumers.
The Republican bill, introduced this month, also requires the Public Service Commission to prevent energy use and infrastructure costs from being passed on to consumers, requires the data center to use a closed-loop water cooling system to limit the amount of water needed and includes provisions that would require the data center company to cover the cost of restoring the land it’s built on if the data center is closed or unfinished. The bill also includes a provision that requires any renewable energy created to power the data center be sourced on site. 
Last year, the issue of data centers was a common theme on the campaign trail in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, as voters respond to the effects of hosting more of the centers than any other state. 
Here in Wisconsin, communities are grappling with how to make agreements with the big tech companies hoping to build the data centers, how to avoid the broken promises at the top of mind of many Wisconsinites after the Foxconn development in Mount Pleasant failed to live up to its lofty initial projections and how to manage the often huge demands the data centers make on local water supplies and energy. 
Despite those challenges, the construction of a data center can offer benefits to local governments — mostly by boosting property tax revenue from a development that won’t consume many local government services. 
Unlike many other issues, the question of data center development has not become politically polarized, with a range of positions among candidates of both parties. 
“Data centers are a new issue that has not taken on a partisan edge in the public mind,” Barry Burden, a political science professor at UW-Madison, said. “This is likely to change because among politicians Democrats are more skeptical about data centers and Republicans are more enthusiastic about them. If this partisan divide continues or even becomes sharper, the public is likely to begin mimicking the positions taken by party leaders. But at least for a while the issue is likely to cut across party lines.”
In Wisconsin’s crowded open race for governor, most of the candidates told the Wisconsin Examiner they were supportive of some level of statewide regulation on data centers. 
Democrat Missy Hughes’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article and Republican Josh Schoemann’s campaign did not provide a comment by publication. Their public comments on the issue are included below. 
Mandela Barnes 
The former lieutenant governor said in a statement to the Examiner that it’s important that data center construction not increase utility rates, not damage the environment and use Wisconsin union labor. He also said the companies developing the centers need to meaningfully work with the communities they’re trying to build in. 
“A lot of communities feel left out of conversations about what is going on in their own backyard and that is not fair,” Barnes said. “Any development of this scale must meaningfully engage local communities and address their concerns and input throughout their proposal. We must also ensure that data center projects do not drive up utility rates for Wisconsinites or contribute to harmful pollution, and that they invest in training and hiring Wisconsin workers to staff these facilities.”
Joel Brennan 
The former secretary of the Department of Administration said in a statement from his campaign that the desire of tech companies to move fast is in opposition to the government’s need to engage the public transparently. 
“Wisconsinites shouldn’t have to foot the bill for AI or data center projects, period. At a time when affordability is a challenge in every community, taxpayers shouldn’t be on the hook for construction, operations, or higher utility costs. No one should have to worry about affording their heating bill because a data center has driven up energy prices,” he said. “It’s reasonable for people to have concerns about AI, and I share those concerns. The technology is moving fast, and companies often prioritize speed. Government’s responsibility is different: transparency, accountability, community engagement, and coordination with local communities who stand to be impacted by these projects. Data centers can create jobs and support local economies, but only if they’re done right — protecting taxpayers and our natural resources, and ensuring that the benefits truly serve Wisconsin communities.”
David Crowley 
At a gubernatorial candidate forum in November, Crowley was mostly supportive of data center development, saying the government shouldn’t be picking “winners and losers” and instead “make sure that this is fertile ground for entrepreneurs and businesses to either stay or move right here to the state of Wisconsin.”
In a statement to the Examiner, a campaign spokesperson said Crowley wants to encourage investment in Wisconsin’s economy while enforcing stringent environmental regulations, making sure companies pay the cost of increased energy use and giving local governments the power to say no to a data center project. 
“Growth that drives up rates or drains local resources is not innovation. It’s a bad deal,” the spokesperson said. “Communities will have clear authority to condition or deny projects based on energy and water use, demand transparency, and community benefit agreements, because the people who live with these projects deserve the final say. Crowley’s approach is simple: Wisconsin will lead in technology and economic growth without raising utility bills, without sacrificing our natural resources, and without letting Big Tech write the rules. Development will be transparent, accountable, and judged by whether or not it delivers real benefits to the people who live in Wisconsin.”
Francesca Hong
In a policy framework released last week, the Madison-area representative  to the state Assembly called for a moratorium on the construction of new data centers while the state works out how to responsibly manage their effects. Hong also wants to end sales tax and use tax exemptions for data centers, require the construction of more renewable energy sources and increase environmental protections on data centers. She is also a co-sponsor on the Democrats’ data center bill in the Legislature. 
In an interview with the Examiner, Hong said Wisconsin’s political leaders have a responsibility to listen to local opposition to data centers. 
“Our communities deserve long-term investments and contributions to their local communities,” she said. “The bipartisan opposition that is building coalitions against AI data centers means that elected officials have a responsibility to get more data on data centers, which is what informed our decision to support a moratorium on the construction of new data centers.” 
Hong said that on the campaign trail she has heard from voters who want Wisconsin to be “a hostile environment for AI data centers.” She added that it’s a bipartisan issue, which presents an opportunity to her as a Democratic socialist running for governor.
“I think there’s an opportunity here, not only for us to engage the left and bring them into electoral politics here in Wisconsin, but actually build that coalition amongst voters who are across the political spectrum and recognizing that as working class people, they’re getting screwed and they’re stressed, and they’re right to demand that their government do more to hold corporate power accountable,” she said. 
Missy Hughes 
At the November forum hosted by the Wisconsin Technology Council, Hughes, who as the former head of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation was involved in efforts to build the Microsoft data center at the former Foxconn site, promoted their positive potential for the state. 
“To have some of these data centers land here in Wisconsin, provide incredible property tax and revenue for the communities that are really determining how to pay their bills, how to build new schools, how to build new fire departments, it’s an opportunity for those communities to access some of that investment and to benefit from it,” she said, adding that a data center isn’t right for every community and local pushback should be considered. 
Sara Rodriguez 
A spokesperson for the current lieutenant governor said that she would issue an executive order to freeze utility rates while state officials develop a long-term data center plan. 
That long-term plan would include ways to prevent energy costs from increasing while making sure local residents get a say. 
“Sara strongly believes data center projects should be developed collaboratively with local communities. That means early community input, clear communication, and transparent planning to reduce misinformation and ensure projects make sense locally,” the spokesperson said. “Data centers aren’t the right fit for every community, but when done right they can bring real benefits — including jobs, redevelopment of otherwise unusable land, and new revenue that can help local governments lower taxes for residents, as we’ve seen in places like Janesville.” 
The campaign added that agreements with local governments must include provisions to prevent developers from bailing out and abandoning communities. 
“Sara also believes all details must be negotiated up front in binding agreements. If utilities make grid investments or communities commit resources, developers must be on the hook if a project is delayed or canceled,” the spokesperson said. “Families and local governments shouldn’t be left holding the bag. Wisconsin can support growth and innovation, but only if it’s fair, transparent, and doesn’t raise costs for working families.” 
Kelda Roys 
The Madison-area state senator is a co-sponsor of the Democrats’ data center bill and in an interview with the Examiner, said that as governor she’d support regulation that follows a similar framework to the legislation. 
“I think there needs to be a statewide strategy with guardrails that protect our workers, our environment and our consumers from massive price increases,” she said. “I’m very skeptical of this idea that the biggest and richest and most powerful companies in the world should get to just come in and pick off local communities and local elected leaders one by one and make these sweetheart deals in the dark that screw over the public. And I think in the absence of statewide standards and transparency, that is what is happening.” 
She said the state should use its sway to insert itself as a negotiating party in agreements with data center developers in an effort to keep energy costs low, reduce environmental impact and protect Wisconsin workers. 
She also said that the state government doing something to ease the budget crunch facing local governments will put those local officials in a better position when deciding whether or not to allow a data center to be constructed. 
“Part of the reason that we’re having this problem is that we have put local governments in an impossible situation because of the fiscal mismanagement and the harm of Republican politicians,” she said. “Communities will have more bargaining power when they don’t feel like, ‘Gosh, we’re desperate for more revenue, and our hands are really tied by the state. This is the only option,’ right? They will be in a stronger negotiating position if this is a nice to have, but not a necessary to have. And that’s the position that we want communities to be in. I want Wisconsinites to be able to have a say in our communities’ future, to be able to have an open and transparent process where we can say, ‘actually, we don’t think that this site is an appropriate one for a data center.’”
Josh Schoemann
The Washington County executive said at the November candidate forum there is an “abundance of opportunity” with data centers but that the state needs to be “very, very strategic and smart about where” data centers are built. 
Tom Tiffany 
The Republican congressman and frontrunner in the party’s primary has often opposed the development of large solar farms in and around his northern Wisconsin district, arguing they’ve taken too much of the region’s farmland out of commission. 
In a statement from his campaign, Tiffany said the development of data centers should be handled “responsibly.” 
“As demand for internet infrastructure continues to grow, data centers present new opportunities for economic development, but like any innovation, they must be developed responsibly,” he said. “Wisconsin families and small businesses should not be left footing the bill for increased electricity demand, local residents deserve a seat at the table when decisions are made about these projects, and taxpayer subsidies should not be used to build data centers on productive farmland. Growth should be responsible and transparent, without shifting costs onto existing ratepayers.”

(Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)The Legislature approved a plan Monday to expand New Jersey’s corporate tax breaks by almost $3 billion and grant Newark’s Prudential Center up to $300 million in new tax subsidies.
The votes in the Senate and Assembly came during hourslong voting sessions in the Statehouse in Trenton as the two bodies met for the last time in the 2024-25 legislative session. A new session begins Tuesday at noon.
Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

Critics had blasted the bill as irresponsible during a time of fiscal belt-tightening and federal funding cuts.
Several Assembly Republicans slammed the subsidies as “corporate giveaways,” saying legislators should fund small businesses rather than billionaire sports owners and only add new spending that supports residents’ health, safety, and welfare instead of their entertainment.
Assemblyman Erik Peterson (R-Hunterdon) derided Monday — in which the Democratic-led Legislature approved multiple bills that included new spending and tax breaks — as “the majority party’s oligarch day, where we keep giving more and more money away.”
Supporters said the bill includes provisions to safeguard public money, while Prudential Center officials said the arena needs the subsidies to make $400 million in repairs and upgrades to a facility they say is a major economic driver for the city and state.
The Assembly passed the measure by a 49-22 vote, and the Senate, 31-6.
 Paid family leave
More small businesses would be required to offer paid family leave and temporary disability benefits to employees under a bill advanced in both chambers of the Legislature Monday.
The legislation would require employers with as few as 15 workers to offer paid family leave and cut in half the amount of time an employee would have to work annually to be eligible for the benefit. If signed into law, the bill would allow a worker to take paid family leave if they work for at least six months and 500 hours for their employer.
New Jersey law requires businesses to provide eligible workers with up to 12 weeks of paid leave to bond with a new child or to care for a loved one. Workers pay into the fund, and the benefits are based on a worker’s earnings.
The bill would also ensure that workers can return from paid leave to the same position they had before taking it. Advocates say it would include another 1.7 million workers who are not currently covered by the state’s family leave law.
In the Senate, the bill advanced by a vote of 31-7, and in the Assembly, 46-25.
 Magic mushrooms
Lawmakers also passed a bill to legalize therapeutic access to psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms. The bill, which would apply to adults over 21, passed by a 35-4 vote in the Senate and a 48-23 vote in the Assembly.
Supporters say the drug treats chronic mental health disorders more effectively than existing therapies. Critics have complained about the bill’s $6 million price tag (to implement a pilot program) and said state officials should wait for the federal Food and Drug Administration to act, as it’s expected to do this year to approve the use of synthetic psilocybin.
 Cyberharassment
New Jersey lawmakers approved heightened penalties for cyberharassment of elected officials and other public employees in nearly unanimous votes Monday.
Under the legislation, electronic threats and the posting of obscene or lewd material meant to emotionally harm a public servant or their family members could earn between one and five years’ jail time, rather than the 18-month sentence provided for by existing law.
The bill would require the attorney general to promote education and training on cyberharassment and calls on the office to work with social media platforms to tighten harassment policies and create or expand offices dedicated to combating cyberharassment.
The Senate passed the bill 39-0 and in the Assembly the vote was 70-3.

A bill to create an appointed board to oversee district and charter schools in Indianapolis would unfairly dilute electoral power, critics said during a House hearing Monday, while supporters said it would ensure shared accountability and transportation for all students.
House Bill 1423 largely adheres to recommendations the Indianapolis Local Education Alliance submitted in December that would give power over taxes, buildings, and transportation for IPS and charter schools to the Indianapolis Public Education Corporation, which would consist of nine members appointed by the mayor.
The alliance’s recommendations would drastically change Indianapolis schools and reduce the power of the elected IPS school board, and could be replicated in school districts across the state facing declining enrollment and logistical challenges.
The four-hour hearing before the House Education Committee hearing marks the latest phase of state and local officials’ push to remake Indianapolis education, which started with the creation of the ILEA last legislative session and continued with the task force’s meetings in the second half of 2025. While those meetings, especially the final vote, were at times heated, testimony during Monday’s hearing was routine.
The bill doesn’t specify how the new corporation will distribute property tax funds to districts and charter schools, or how it will gain control of buildings that are financed by debt. Lawmakers still have to work out those details, said Rep. Bob Behning the bill’s author and chair of the House Education Committee.

This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters

However, Behning said the corporation will control — and eventually own — all district and charter buildings. The corporation will also determine a formula to distribute property tax funding.
The bill also doesn’t act on a recommendation from ILEA to increase funding for students with disabilities whose education is provided by IPS at a budget deficit. Lawmakers are unlikely to address that issue in a short session when they don’t discuss a state budget.
At the House committee hearing, supporters of the bill said it would create a shared system of accountability as well as a shared transportation system that would allow students to attend the school of their choice.
“I see students spending hours commuting, families struggling to coordinate rides, and young people missing opportunities simply because reliable transportation is not guaranteed,” said Ma’at Lands, founder and executive director of Rooted School Indianapolis, a charter school.
But dozens of speakers on Monday said the bill would significantly dilute the power of the elected Indianapolis Public Schools board, and that the ILEA ignored overwhelming support for an elected body to oversee schools.
Courtney Hawk, an Indianapolis parent, said she did not vote for an appointed board.
“If they raise my property taxes, I can’t vote them out. I can only hope that the mayor replaces them,” she said of the appointed board. “This violates a fundamental democratic principle: No taxation without representation.”
Bill significantly increases Indianapolis mayor’s power
Should the bill pass, the Indianapolis mayor could begin appointing members to the new corporation board immediately, but would have to do so by June 1.
Rep. Vernon Smith, a Democrat, questioned the idea of giving the Indianapolis mayor the power to appoint all nine members of the corporation board — a comment that earned applause from several people signed up to testify.
The Indianapolis Public Education Corporation would not oversee township school districts. Critics of the bill also said it would leave Center Township families with less electoral power than those in the other 10 school districts in Indianapolis.
“We don’t have a performance crisis that justifies stripping power from voters,” said parent Megan Hise, citing academic growth and graduation rates. “We have a success story that deserves stability and investment.”
But ILEA facilitator Michael O’Connor, who presented the bill at the hearing, said giving the mayor power over transportation, facilities, and uniform accountability “gives people a place to hold them accountable.”
Under the bill, the mayor would also be one of only three entities with the power to authorize charter schools. That’s led to concerns from representatives of Education One, the authorizing arm of Trine University, as well as charter school leaders and GOP Rep. Becky Cash, who said during Monday’s hearing that schools serving students with disabilities often have outside authorizers.
O’Connor said the ILEA frequently heard criticisms that there are too many charter authorizers, contributing to a lack of coherence in the system of education in Indianapolis.
More funding for students with disabilities unlikely
In presenting the recommendations to the House Education Committee, O’Connor said the bill was a faithful reflection of the recommendations of the ILEA — other than addressing the organization’s request for additional funding for students with disabilities.
IPS currently operates its special education program at a deficit of tens of millions of dollars, officials have said. Charter schools would like to continue using district services for their students, O’Connor said.
“Charters would like to utilize what is a very well-run special education program within IPS,” he said. “We believe that it is fair and equitable that that be fully funded, and be a service that could be provided by IPS, but it needs to be better funded by the state.”
But since lawmakers won’t pass a state budget this legislative session, they might be reluctant to discuss such a funding change.
A bill by Democratic Rep. Tonya Pfaff, who sits on the House education committee, calls for a comprehensive study of special education service costs to the state, schools, and families. But it’s unclear if the bill will get a hearing, Behning said.
Supporters like shared accountability for schools, buses, taxes
Speaking in support of the bill, IU Indianapolis student Kelin Peraza-Argueta said the legislation would offer a shared accountability system for schools — something that was missing when she searched for a school for her nephews.
“There were so many questions we had and so many unanswered, and we had no clear way to see which school would be best for them,” she said.
Democratic Rep. Ed DeLaney said the bill also creates oversight for charter schools that now receive or will soon receive property tax revenue under recent legislative changes. It also limits the number of charter authorizers and exempts Indianapolis schools from the $1 building law.
“I don’t see it as a perfect solution, but you’ve got to get to the core problem that generates this bill,” DeLaney said.
During testimony, Democratic Rep. Cherrish Pryror asked whether the city of Indianapolis would now be liable when IPS or charter schools are sued. The new layer of government would make it difficult for parents to know who they should go to with concerns, she said.
“I fear that if this were to go into effect, what we’re really doing is setting up IPS for failure, and it’s going to artificially lead to IPS being worse,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor during testimony. “And if that happens, the legislature has to own it.”
Behning said the bill would not come back to the committee this week. The committee is meeting again Wednesday. The deadline for bills to pass the full Indiana House before heading to the Indiana Senate is Jan. 29.

The rule, put forward for public comment by the court in late November, would cover most ICE arrests, usually done under civil immigration warrants — which are administrative warrants, not judicial warrants. 
The proposal’s public comment period garnered a huge response, with over 2,500 comments posted to the court’s website over the course of just over a month. Most of the comments were submitted by individuals, but legal organizations such as the State Bar of Michigan Executive Committee and the Michigan State Planning Body also submitted comments in support of the proposed rule. Some elected officials also submitted comments in support, including Attorney General Dana Nessel and state Sens. Mary Cavanagh, Jeremy Moss and Stephanie Chang, all Detroit-area Democrats. 
“This rule update would align Michigan with other states to ensure that individuals conducting legal business at courthouses – regardless of their citizenship status – are able to do so without the concern that they will be subsequently arrested for a matter unrelated to their business at the courthouse,” says the statement from the senators. 
Nessel’s comments directly addressed the potential impact of such a rule on ICE enforcement. 
“The existence of, and ICE’s compliance with, its own prior policies shows that ICE can carry out its operations without making civil arrests in a courthouse. And there is nothing in the proposed amendment to suggest otherwise,” she wrote. “All told, the impact of the proposed amendment on ICE’s operations will be minimal, and any impact is far outweighed by the need to protect and preserve the people’s fundamental right to participation and accountability in the fair administration of justice.”
This rule would align Michigan with a number of other states that have enacted policies to limit ICE actions at courthouses, including New York, Connecticut and Illinois.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) A three-year analysis of Louisiana State Police data shows troopers use force against Black people at a rate that’s out of proportion with their share of the state’s population.
Black residents represent 31% of Louisiana population, yet they accounted for 902 use-of-force incidents involving state troopers from 2022-24, or 60.5% of all recorded, according to a data analysis report from Innocence and Justice Louisiana. White residents, who account for 61% of the state population, were involved in 341 or 23%. 
Another 11% of use-of-force incidents were reported with the race of the suspect listed as unknown, which could mean the disparities could be higher or lower, said Esme Lee, data and community coordinator for Innocence and Justice Louisiana.
“There was a high category of unknown citizen race entries in that incident data, so that does limit the precision of our analysis,” Lee said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Racial disparities were present across all 10 State Police regional troops, with the largest occurring in Troop D in Southwest Louisiana, according to the report. Black and Native American residents in that area were involved in use of force incidents at a rate three times higher than their population percentages.
Capt. Russell Graham, State Police public affairs commander, said the data provided to Innocence and Justice Louisiana doesn’t provide the complete picture. In response to questions about the group’s findings, Graham provided the Illuminator a breakdown for 2024 that separates LSP vehicle pursuit interventions, or how troopers ended chases, from other uses of force. He acknowledged these details were not provided to Innocence and Justice Louisiana for its data analysis.
“While the numbers are accurate, it’s not a fair depiction of our stats,” Graham said about the Innocence and Justice report.
Lee said her organization considered how the FBI collects and reports use-of-force data for its database. The bureau does not exclude vehicle pursuits, listing them as a “reason for initial contact.”
“LSP’s current practice of including pursuits in its use-of-force data is therefore not inconsistent with national standards; rather, it reflects a more granular, tactic-level approach to capturing high-risk enforcement actions,” Lee said. “Reclassifying pursuits outside of use-of-force reporting would reduce transparency and break continuity with both LSP’s historical data and broader accountability norms.”
The State Police breakdown shows troopers ended 303 vehicle pursuits in 2024 with “termination techniques” such as stop spikes and other tire deflation devices. At the end of those pursuits, troopers used their stun guns 33 times, were “hands on” with suspects in 26 incidents and used firearms twice. 
Graham said the vast majority of Louisiana State Police pursuits are related to speeding motorists.
“We’re not looking at anything besides speed,” he said. “You’re not looking at the color of someone’s skin, whether they’re male or female or even what they’re driving. It’s troopers running down the road in one direction, catching somebody speeding in the opposite direction.”
Whether race is a factor in pursuits is analytically distinct from whether their impacts are racially disparate, Lee said. The Innocence and Justice report does not assert Louisiana State Police’s use of force is racially motivated, she stressed. Instead, it documents the disparate outcomes of such incidents.
“The analysis evaluates how policing is experienced and distributed in practice — not the subjective intent of individual officers,” Lee said. “Even when pursuits are initiated for speeding, repeated exposure to police contact, including pursuits, systematically increases the likelihood of escalation, serious use of force and harm. This distinction between causation and impact is intentional and central to the analysis.”
Separate from its vehicle pursuits, State Police reported 73 more “hands on” use-of-force incidents, 20 Taser incidents, two firearm discharges and one use of a chemical agent in 2024. 
After reviewing the data compilation from State Police, Lee noted it includes the same racial discrepancies as her report. It shows 307 Black suspects (64%) were involved in use-of-force and pursuit incidents, compared with 102 white suspects (21%). 
Public has struggled to access police discipline data
Lee’s data work will be uploaded to the Louisiana Law Enforcement Accountability Database, or LLEAD for short. The project that is independent of any policy agency will allow the public to search online for officers with a history of infractions.        
“The genesis of LLEAD was really wanting to be able to track officer histories of conduct and identify those patterns and practices of misconduct in order to aid our own case review,” Lee said, “but also to provide a public resource to individuals to hold officers accountable.” 
The organization, which focuses on post-conviction relief for the wrongly incarcerated, is gathering information from more than 600 police agencies across the state to catalog complaints and use-of-force incidents. 
A state law approved last year requires police departments statewide to report all use-of-force incidents that result in bodily injury. The impetus for the Shantel Arnold Act was a 2021 incident in which a Jefferson Parish sheriff’s deputy was captured dragging the law’s namesake, a Black woman, by her hair and slamming her into the ground. The sheriff’s office settled a civil lawsuit Arnold brought for $300,000, but the agency continued to employ her assailant, Deputy Jose Alvarado, despite a lengthy record of excessive force complaints.
Innocence and Justice is seeking all complaints against law enforcement officers for its database, including those deemed unsubstantiated through internal investigations to avoid instances where departments opted against discipline or dismissal for problem officers, Lee said.
The group has also requested full officer history reports from the Louisiana Peace Officer Standards and Training Council, the state body that certifies police. Lee said the council wants to charge Innocence and Justice $30,000 to fill its public records request, a cost that’s too pricey for the nonprofit. 
Reached by phone, POST Council executive director Jim Craft, a former Lafayette police chief, could not confirm or deny the cost of records provided to Innocence and Justice. He did say a request of that scope would create a tremendous workload for his staff, who he described as “very small and very busy.” The council tracks the status of some 28,000 law enforcement officers in Louisiana. 
State law requires police departments to notify the POST Council in instances of officer misconduct. The council, composed of police chiefs, prosecutors and the state attorney general, can revoke an officer’s certification, often a requirement to hold a job in law enforcement.
The disciplinary reporting also allows police departments to research a job applicant’s work and disciplinary history when hiring. New hires, retirements, resignations and deaths must also be reported, but Craft said not all police agencies provide this information on a timely basis. 
He expressed reservations about the Innocence and Justice LLEAD project because it will include unfounded complaints, resulting in some officers being wrongly “branded.”    
Graham said recent technology upgrades for Louisiana State Police will allow the agency to dive deeper into its use-of-force data so that it could inform training and practices for troopers. An online dashboard to make the information available to the public might also lie ahead, he added. 
Lee said she is encouraged that State Police “is investing resources in transparency and data accessibility.”

Some legislators are questioning the role and necessity of the state's top economic development shop ahead of the budget session.
The post Gov. Gordon asks lawmakers not to defund Wyoming Business Council appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon is asking the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee to continue funding the Wyoming Business Council, as some on the panel question whether the state’s chief economic development office is necessary.
“I understand, it may be time for the Business Council to benefit from more careful scrutiny from the Legislature in how it goes about the tasks assigned to it,” Gordon wrote in a Jan. 7 letter to the committee. “A course correction may be warranted, but a wholesale defunding of the [Business Council] would be counterproductive.”
The letter was sent the same week the committee quizzed Business Council Chief Executive Officer Josh Dorrell about the organization’s successes and shortcomings. Committee members also pondered whether economic development is an appropriate use of state funds.
Appropriations Co-chair John Bear, a Gillette Republican and Wyoming Freedom Caucus member, asserted that offering businesses incentives to come to the state only makes them perpetually reliant on state help, using the analogy of a “self-licking ice cream cone.”

“I don’t think that’s the way free markets were ever intended to work,” Bear said. “My belief is the government has a responsibility to keep taxes and regulations low. That’s it. And that makes an environment where businesses can flourish.”
Sheridan Republican Ken Pendergraft said the Business Council’s mission inherently amounts to “flat out interference” with a free market by picking winners and losers.
It’s true, Dorrell told committee members, that the council discerns between applicants and says yes to some and no to others. It’s also the case, he said, that prior to 2020, it was probably too easy to get a grant from the council. But for the past five years, the council has self-imposed reforms to ensure that it is only “investing” in companies and publicly owned infrastructure that are self-sustaining and fit Wyoming’s economic priorities. 

Wyoming Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell.

“We’re not creating a self-licking ice cream cone where we’re propping businesses up,” Dorrell said. “In fact, if you look at the rule changes that we’ve made and the statutory changes that we’ve requested [from the Legislature], they are actually for self reliance. So what we are doing is in line, in a lot of ways, with what you’re saying.”
The council’s current roster of investments generate an estimated $30 million in annual “economic impact,” according to the organization. The council has also drawn attention over the past year to what it considers a damaging trend of “out-migration” among Wyoming’s youth. Fully addressing Wyoming’s economic development needs, Dorrell has said, might require an investment of up to $1 billion over several years.
The Business Council requested a budget of $112 million for the next biennium, or two-year budget cycle. But Gordon, in his recommendation to lawmakers, trimmed the request to $54.6 million. The governor did not include nearly $50 million for an ongoing broadband buildout effort.
Dorrell noted that in addition to his agency’s budget request, it is also asking lawmakers to join the council and its stakeholders in a longer discussion about how to realign the organization with a changing economic and political environment.
“We are very willing to not defend our programs, or to defend the efforts that we’ve taken so far, but rather to seek out the problem and address it with the right statutes and the right investment mechanisms. That’s what you have in front of you,” Dorrell said.

The question of whether economic development is the proper role of state government, Dorrell added, makes for a good discussion. But it doesn’t change the fact that Wyoming is in stiff competition with every state in the nation, he said, because they all heavily invest in economic development strategies that include business recruitment.
“You have to be able to compete. And the way you compete is interesting and it’s hard to explain. But you at least compete,” Dorrell told the committee.
Laramie Democrat Trey Sherwood said she likes the idea of a coordinated effort between the Legislature, Business Council and stakeholders to fully examine the organization and potentially craft reforms.
“It’s something I’m definitely interested in as an interim topic,” Sherwood said, “to really do a deep dive into your statutes and figure out what is no longer serving our businesses and our communities and where there’s programs that we could align with our shared values — to really build out strong communities and let the world know that we are absolutely open for business.”
Gordon, in his letter to the committee, implored committee leaders to examine, but not defund, the council.
“Throwing the baby out with the bath water would be short-sighted and significantly diminish Wyoming’s ability to compete successfully in President Trump’s considered efforts to bring industry back to America,” he wrote. “Wyoming always sought to get to ‘yes’ with the private sector. Defunding the state economic development agency is a flashing neon sign that Wyoming is ‘closed.'”
Though the Appropriations committee holds sway over budgeting decisions, the fate of the Business Council’s budget won’t be known until the full Legislature takes up the issue in February.

Special general council meeting Saturday to address “nepotism,"" ""conflict of interest"" and ""removal of 6 current business council members” resulted in standstill of all business. 
The post Eastern Shoshone Business Council upheaval closes tribal government office appeared first on WyoFile .","FORT WASHAKIE—Closure notices were posted on the darkened Eastern Shoshone Business Council office doors Monday, two days after a special tribal council meeting threw the leadership panel into upheaval.
“The Eastern Shoshone Business Council (ESBC) is shutting down the tribal offices effective on January 12th, 2026, until the Non-Sanctioned Eastern Shoshone Council Meeting Actions are resolved through tribal court,” the hot-pink notice read. 
The business council governs the tribe, one of two on the Wind River Reservation, overseeing tasks such as enacting tribal law and managing resources for the Eastern Shoshone people.

Because the office was closed, no individuals were available to answer questions. 
But notices and comments posted on the tribe’s Facebook account indicate all six members of the business council were removed by a vote of the general council during Saturday’s special meeting. The validity of that meeting and vote are now being challenged.  
Going into the meeting, current members on the panel included Chairman Wayland Large, along with Clinton Glick, Gloria St. Clair, Gus Thayer, Stanford Ware and Latonna Snyder. 
An agenda shared on the Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s Facebook Page on Dec. 30 listed as business items: “nepotism,” “mismanagement of Shoshone Rose Casino & Hotel” and “removal of all (6) current Shoshone Business Council Members.”
General council meetings are open to all enrolled members who are 18 or older. A quorum of 75 must be met within a certain time and all members vote. Roughly 4,000 enrolled Eastern Shoshone tribal members live on the reservation, according to the Interior Department.

According to Facebook chatter on Monday, a quorum did indeed vote to oust the panel and replace it with six new individuals. 
However, Monday’s notice on the office door — as well as prior public notices the tribe released — indicate challenges to the procedural validity of the petition at the center of the conflict and describe Saturday’s meeting actions as “non-sanctioned.”
All finances and business will be at a standstill as the offices are closed, according to the notice. 
“We apologize for any financial inconvenience this may cause you at this time,” the notice read. “We want to reassure you that we are working diligently to resolve these matters in a timely manner.”

Wyoming voters already amended the state constitution to guarantee residents' right to make their own health care decisions, columnist Kerry Drake writes.
The post Freedom Caucus, Gordon need to accept abortion bans’ overturn appeared first on WyoFile .","When far-right legislators who crafted and passed two laws banning abortions in Wyoming learned that those laws were declared unconstitutional by the state’s Supreme Court last Tuesday, I wondered what their next move would be.

Opinion

It didn’t take long to find out. The Joint Appropriations Committee, with six of its seven House members aligned with the Freedom Caucus and a senator who sponsored one of the bans, hid from the public that afternoon in a private meeting where they discussed how to punish the high court.
Fortunately, several people with direct knowledge of the meeting disclosed to WyoFile that the JAC talked about shrinking the Wyoming Supreme Court from five members to three.
Rep. Abby Angelos, R-Gillette, who called for the executive session, later told WyoFile that such a closed meeting is allowed under state law for members seeking legal counsel on an issue — in this case the judiciary’s budget. But it doesn’t take a lawyer to know that the Wyoming Constitution says the state’s high court can operate with three to five members. What did they need legal counsel for?
If the discussion was about the state budget, which the committee oversees, it should have been open to the public so everyone can hear why members think the court and budget should be shrunk. Whenever a Freedom Caucus member repeats its leadership’s claim that it wants to improve government transparency, raucous laughter is an appropriate response.
The official Freedom Caucus take on the ruling called it “a stain on the Wyoming judicial branch.” 
“After decades of liberal leadership in the governor’s office, the State Supreme Court has been filled with jurists who reject basic biology and human dignity,” the statement said. 
In the nearly six decades I’ve lived in Wyoming, we’ve never had what I would call a liberal governor. The majority of justices during that time have focused on what the law says, not a political ideology.
The current court interpreted a 2012 amendment to the state constitution to mean exactly what the majority of voters approved: “Each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.”
Ironically, the idea for the amendment was the work of right-wing lawmakers trying to undermine the Affordable Care Act, which they derisively called Obamacare. 



The strategy backfired for them on abortion. Today’s Freedom Caucus and other anti-abortion advocates in the Legislature should have learned a lesson from their predecessors, who wildly ran down the railroad track to repeal Roe v. Wade at any cost and didn’t foresee that their own amendment was the train that would eventually run them over.
This coalition will keep blaming Wyoming’s fictitious “liberal leadership” for their court loss on the ill-conceived abortion bans, but if they want to know who’s really responsible, they should look in a mirror.
When the two abortion bans were immediately challenged in a lawsuit filed by OB-GYNs, a Casper women’s clinic, a pro-choice organization and women of childbearing age, the state argued that abortion isn’t health care. 
It’s a patently absurd position. A procedural or surgical abortion can only be obtained from a licensed physician, and a medication abortion must be prescribed by doctor and the medication dispensed by a certified pharmacy. Abortion care is included in medical training, clinical practice, and continuing medical education.
Here’s part of what the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says:
“Induced abortion is an essential component of women’s health care. Like all medical matters, decisions regarding abortion should be made by patients in consultation with their health care providers and without undue influence by outside parties.”
Here’s more common sense advice from the group: “Like all patients, women obtaining abortion are entitled to privacy, dignity, respect and support.” The Legislature’s bans stripped all of these from women.
As much as anti-abortion advocates demand the authority to tell women what reproductive health choices they must make, the Wyoming Constitution tells government officials and others to butt out because it’s none of their business. I’m grateful the state has a Supreme Court that stood up and upheld women making their own decisions about their bodies.
The JAC made no changes to the composition of the Wyoming Supreme Court last week, but that doesn’t mean the panel or individual legislators won’t try during the upcoming budget session. But I doubt they’ll get very far with reducing the size of the court, and there’s no guarantee it would change the court’s ruling on abortion.
What appears most likely to happen during the 20-day budget session that begins Feb. 9 is an anti-abortion constitutional amendment called for by Gov. Mark Gordon. Two legislators he’s often at odds with, House Speaker Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, and Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Lingle, are already drafting a resolution to put the issue on the 2026 general election ballot.
I’m disappointed in Gordon’s response to the ruling. It may not have the clueless outrage that Secretary of State Chuck Gray expressed when he said it was a “left–wing activist decision totally out of touch with the Wyoming Constitution,” but it’s not far off.
Gordon called the decision “profoundly unfortunate” and said it “sadly serves to only prolong the ultimate proper resolution of this issue.”
Even more concerning was the governor’s statement that the legal question may be settled “for the time being,” but it doesn’t settle “the moral one, nor does it reflect where many Wyoming citizens stand,” including himself.
No one gets exactly the government he or she wants. Even the governor only gets one vote (and the power of the veto), and it’s not good public policy to keep demanding voters be asked the same question until the outcome meets someone’s personal moral code.
A 1994 ballot initiative banning abortion in Wyoming was soundly defeated, and the 2012 amendment guaranteeing citizens the right to make their own health care decisions was overwhelmingly approved. Now the Supreme Court has voted 4-1 to overturn two abortion bans.
Wyoming doesn’t need to give anti-abortion zealots another bite of the apple. But if lawmakers insist on it, voters need to say loud and clear that it’s not the government’s business to interfere with rights guaranteed in our state’s constitution.

It’s no longer about restraint, sovereignty or minding our own business. Under Donald Trump—and with Sen. Steve Daines cheering from the cheap seats—it’s now “War First, Diplomacy Last,” with the Constitution treated like a suggestion, not a rule.
Consider Venezuela. Trump orders a military strike, bombs Caracas, captures the country’s leader, seizes oil reserves, and then casually announces the United States will “run” the country. You know—just a light, totally-not-a-war war. Nothing to see here.
When the Senate finally did what the Constitution explicitly requires—voting to reassert Congress’s authority over war—every senator in the chamber made a choice.
Every senator, that is, except one.
Five Republicans—Rand Paul, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Todd Young, and Josh Hawley—voted with Democrats to advance a bipartisan war powers resolution blocking further U.S. military action in Venezuela without congressional approval. They did so knowing Trump would attack them for it. He did. He said they should “never be elected to office again.”
They voted anyway.
And Sen. Steve Daines of Montana?
He was the only U.S. senator who did not vote.
Not “no.” Not even an “I support war but own it” vote. Just absent. Missing. Vanished. When the Constitution called roll, Steve Daines was nowhere to be found.
That matters. This wasn’t a symbolic gesture or a messaging vote. It was Congress asserting its Article I authority—the power to decide when America goes to war. The very power the Founders withheld from kings, emperors, and presidents who wake up feeling decisive.
Everyone else showed up. Daines alone chose not to.
This is especially rich given that Daines has been perfectly comfortable praising the operation afterward. He applauded “peace through strength,” because nothing says peace quite like bombing a capital city and announcing you’ll “run” another country. He eagerly echoed Trump’s language about Nicolas Maduro being a narco-terrorist—perhaps true, but also completely beside the constitutional point.
The Senate vote wasn’t about whether Maduro was a bad guy. It was about whether one man gets to drag the United States into open-ended conflict without congressional approval.
Five Republicans answered that question with courage.
Steve Daines answered it with silence.
This isn’t an accident or a scheduling mishap. Daines has a record. He has previously voted against war powers limits and consistently sides with expanding presidential authority over Congress’s role. When it came time to put that position on the record—when Montanans could clearly see where he stood—he opted out.
That’s not leadership. That’s political cowardice dressed up as absence.
Montanans deserve better. They deserve a senator who shows up for the hardest votes, not one who hides when the Constitution becomes inconvenient. Daines owes this state an explanation—why he alone failed to vote, why he ducked accountability, and why cheering war is easy but defending Congress’s role is apparently too much trouble.
America First has become War First.
Diplomacy last.
And Steve Daines?

The colorless gas seeped from relatively few industrial facilities and commanded little public attention.
All that changed in 2016, when the Environmental Protection Agency completed a study that found the chemical is 30 times more carcinogenic than previously thought.
The agency then spent years updating regulations that protect millions of people who are most exposed to the compound. In 2024, the EPA approved stricter rules that require commercial sterilizers for medical equipment and large chemical plants to slash emissions of ethylene oxide, which causes lymphoma and breast cancer.
It was doing what the EPA has done countless times: revising rules based on new scientific knowledge.
Now, its ability to do that for many air pollutants is under threat.

In government records that have flown under the radar, President Donald Trump’s EPA said it is reconsidering whether the agency had the legal authority to update those rules.
Chemical companies and their trade organizations have argued that the EPA cannot reevaluate hazardous air pollution rules to account for newly discovered harms if it has revised them once already.
It doesn’t matter if decades have passed or new information has emerged.
If the EPA agrees, environmentalists fear that the decision could have wide implications, significantly curbing the EPA’s ability to limit nearly 200 pollutants from thousands of industrial plants. The next time new science reveals that a chemical is much more toxic, or that the amount of pollution released from a factory had been underestimated and would cause legally unacceptable health risks, the agency would not be able to react.
“It’s a poor reflection on this administration’s claim that they are actually interested in clean air,” said Ana Baptista, a professor of environmental policy and sustainability management at The New School. “By saying we’re no longer going to consider science, it’s abdicating your mission.”
The EPA didn’t address ProPublica’s questions about the ethylene oxide reevaluation or its broader implications. Instead, the agency pointed to a March press release about how it was reconsidering multiple air pollution rules issued by President Joe Biden’s administration, including the ones for chemical plants and commercial sterilizers. “EPA is committed to using the gold standard of science during these reviews,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Since day one, EPA has been clear that providing clean air, water, and land for all Americans is a top priority.”
The EPA’s reconsideration focuses on the Clean Air Act, the country’s most powerful air quality law, which regulates hazardous air pollutants for different types of industrial operations. There’s a specific rule for oil refineries, for instance, and another for steel mills. Within eight years after each rule is published, the EPA is required to conduct an assessment, called a residual risk review, to decide if an update is necessary.

These assessments use detailed data on the quantity of emissions coming from each facility, the toxicity of each chemical and other information on how the chemicals are released and dispersed in the air. The combined data reveals how the emissions put local residents at risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, reproductive harm and other health problems.
If the EPA determines the overall risks exceed what’s allowed under the law, the agency must tighten the rules.
The Clean Air Act doesn’t say whether the EPA is required to conduct additional residual risk reviews after the first one. Nor does it specifically prohibit the agency from doing so.
As far back as 2006, the EPA under President George W. Bush asserted that the agency had the right to revisit and revise the rules based on risk.
The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide. The office estimated that nearly half a million Americans were exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from industrial emissions by chemical plants, commercial sterilizers and other facilities pumping out ethylene oxide.
In its report, the inspector general’s office advised the agency to “exercise its discretionary authority to conduct new residual risk reviews” as needed when “new data or information indicates an air pollutant is more toxic than previously determined.” (The inspector general was a Trump appointee.)
The EPA had already conducted the first, mandatory risk reviews for large chemical plants and commercial sterilizers in the early 2000s. In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide. Ultimately, the EPA determined the health risks were unacceptable and revised the rules to lower them. The agency asserted that the Clean Air Act “does not limit our discretion or authority to conduct another risk review should we consider that such review is warranted.”
Louisiana’s LNG export boom will fuel higher electricity costs, report finds

According to the EPA’s estimates, the new regulations for chemical plants under the 2024 revised rule would cut the number of nearby residents who are exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from 90,000 to 3,000.
But the chemical industry opposed the stricter rules. Industry representatives disagreed with the EPA’s new assessment of ethylene oxide, contending that it overestimated the risk the chemical posed, and argued the agency didn’t have the authority to conduct those risk reviews. In a 2023 letter, the American Chemistry Council said “the Agency has erred in conducting a new risk review,” as “the plain text” of the Clean Air Act “indicates that EPA actually lacks this authority.”
Similarly, the Louisiana Chemical Association submitted public comments on the chemical plant rule stating the “EPA has no statutory authority to conduct a second risk review” and that doing so was “arbitrary and capricious.”
David Cresson, president and CEO of the association, told ProPublica that the trade group supports “protecting the public’s health through regulatory frameworks that are lawful, while remaining based in sound science.”
Brendan Bradley, a spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, said the organization had no further comment on the issue.
After Trump was inaugurated, one of his appointees to the EPA let the industry know the agency was conducting a “reconsideration” of the two rules focused on ethylene oxide emissions. Last spring, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator Abigale Tardif, a former oil and gas lobbyist, hinted at how the EPA might challenge those rules.
In letters addressed to trade groups representing commercial sterilizers and chemical plants, Tardif said the agency was reconsidering multiple issues related to the rules, including the “EPA’s authority and decision to undertake a second residual risk review” under the Clean Air Act, as well as “the analysis and determinations made in that review, and the resulting risk standards.”
Tardif didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Lawsuits over Ascension economic records challenge secrecy of industrial deals

The agency also filed a regulatory notice about its plans to revise the 2024 chemical plant rule. Citing the part of the Clean Air Act that deals with the updated rule assessments, the notice said the EPA had “identified items for reconsideration around its CAA section 112(f)(2) residual risk review authority.”
While the stricter ethylene oxide rules are technically still in effect, the Trump administration has exempted dozens of large chemical plants and sterilizer facilities from following them as the agency works through a formal process that is widely expected to result in watered-down standards.
If the Trump EPA does decide it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, the agency might still have the authority to strengthen hazardous air pollution rules by using a separate part of the Clean Air Act, said Abel Russ, a senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group. That section of the act allows the EPA to update a rule if agency scientists conclude that better pollution-control technology is affordable and available. But limiting the agency’s ability to conduct residual risk reviews would be a serious blow to the act, Russ said, “kneecapping” the agency’s authority over these toxic pollutants.
Environmental groups will almost certainly sue if the EPA concludes it does not have the legal authority to revise hazardous air pollution rules more than once based on risk. Russ called industry’s comments absurd and said they don’t account for the reality that our knowledge of industrial pollution is changing all the time.
As ProPublica reported in October, the agency recently received clear evidence that many industrial facilities are leaking far more pollution than the companies that own them previously reported. In 2023, researchers who conducted their own air monitoring in the industrial corridor of Louisiana known as Cancer Alley found much higher concentrations of ethylene oxide than expected. For more than half the areas they sampled, the local cancer risk from ethylene oxide would be unacceptable if residents were exposed to these concentrations over a lifetime.
If the EPA decides it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, it would find itself in the position of not being able to take action even if the agency confirmed similar results.
“The whole premise of risk assessment is that it’s based on the best available science,” said Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at the Environmental Integrity Project. As our knowledge grows, researchers tend to find that chemicals are linked to additional health effects, she added, so blocking these updates “pretty much ensures” the EPA is underestimating the risks.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Republicans will be taking orders from the White House when they unveil a slate of bills to crack down on undocumented immigration as the 2026 legislative session opens.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton told reporters the House Republican Caucus will roll out a package of legislation on immigration this week after he made several trips to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Trump administration.
With the Tennessee legislature set to convene Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Randy McNally also said Republicans will work closely with the president to protect people from an “illegal immigration scourge.” 
Sexton declined to detail the set of bills, but Tennessee is expected to be a model for the rest of the country, according to a report by Knox News. It published a video of Republican Rep. Jason Zachary of Knoxville telling a group that Sexton had been working with the White House for six weeks on immigration policy.
“It is strong legislation,” Zachary said on the video. “The president’s behind us. The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.”
Zachary confirmed Monday that Sexton met with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, believed to be largely responsible for the zealous efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport immigrants without permanent legal documentation. 










Now that we have a willing federal partner in this fight, the legislature will be working hand in hand with the Trump administration to protect our citizens from the illegal immigration scourge that has gone on far too long.


– Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge


Massive deployment of ICE nationally has led to at least five deaths, including the shooting of 37-year-old Rene Nicole Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week, sparking protests nationwide. 
The Trump administration claims the shooting was justified, while critics of ICE deployment say it was avoidable and want the agency to stop its operations.
Immigration traditionally has fallen under the purview of the federal government. But Tennessee lawmakers have grown more active on immigration restrictions, last year creating an immigration enforcement bureau whose operations are exempt from the Public Records Act. 
In addition to setting up an immigration czar and division, the bureau makes grants to local law enforcement agencies for immigration enforcement.
Zachary, a Knoxville Republican, said Tennessee House and Senate leadership met four to five weeks ago and discussed plans for immigration bills.
“Everybody is on board,” he said on the video.
Lawmakers are likely to bring back a bill that passed the Senate requiring school districts to check students’ immigration status and either charge tuition or block enrollment. The House version of the bill ran into constitutional problems and the possibility it could cost the state $1.1 billion for violating laws against discrimination.
McNally, an Oak Ridge Republican, said Monday, “Tennessee has long been a beacon for state-led immigration restriction and this session will be no different. The federal government under President Trump has put a priority on sealing our borders and hastening the return of illegal immigrants to their native lands. We will do all we can to assist in that effort.”
None of the bills have been filed yet, but the Republican-led legislature will work to “aggressively enforce” and strengthen laws against undocumented immigration and improve cooperation with federal authorities, McNally said.
Legislation is expected to ensure no immigrants without legal documentation receive public benefits and that people who live in the state, including students, are in the country legally, McNally said. He added that legislation will target those who interfere with ICE enforcement to punish them “severely.”
“Now that we have a willing federal partner in this fight, the legislature will be working hand in hand with the Trump administration to protect our citizens from the illegal immigration scourge that has gone on far too long,” he said in the statement.
Tennessee law already prohibits immigrants without legal documentation from receiving public benefits. It also requires students without documentation to pay out-of-state tuition at public universities.










When the majority signals yet another round of 'crackdown' legislation, we should be honest about what this is: not a thoughtful public safety strategy, but a political strategy — one that targets immigrant families to score points while working people are struggling with rising costs.


– Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis


Local officials and governments that decline to participate in immigration actions could be a target.
Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell caught the ire of key lawmakers and federal officials this summer because of an executive order requiring city employees’ interactions with immigration officials to be reported promptly. He was also accused of “doxing” federal agents in publishing several of their names on a public website, though those were said to be inadvertent and then redacted.
Scrutiny of the Nashville mayor started after he made critical comments about immigration stops by ICE and the Tennessee Highway Patrol over two days in May in South Nashville, home to many immigrant residents.
Democrats are not expected to support the bills, saying lawmakers should focus on kitchen table issues such as cutting the cost of living.
Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat, said immigrants are being forced to bear the brunt of a Republican agenda.
“Tennessee Republicans have already made life extraordinarily difficult for undocumented people in our state. So when the majority signals yet another round of ‘crackdown’ legislation, we should be honest about what this is: not a thoughtful public safety strategy, but a political strategy — one that targets immigrant families to score points while working people are struggling with rising costs,” Lamar said.
Memphis lawmaker wants to make safe havens from ICE

Democratic Rep. Gabby Salinas has filed a bill that would prohibit ICE from going into public schools and churches, creating a safe haven for immigrants.
The Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition criticized the plan, saying lawmakers are avoiding important matters such as fully funding schools, reducing the sales tax on groceries and making health care more affordable.
“This reveals how desperate these elected officials are: they’re collaborating with Stephen Miller, a known white supremacist, to distract us from their failure to help our families put food on the table or fully fund our schools,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of TIRRC.
Luna said Miller has “proudly” separated families as part of the administration’s deportation policy and stated that he wants “zero” refugees or immigrants in the country regardless of legal status.
She predicted more people than ever will be ready to turn out at the Capitol and contact representatives in protest of the legislation.
TIRRC reported a new national poll shows 42% of Americans want to abolish ICE amid grassroots support for removing the agency from the state. More than 1,100 people signed a letter calling for ICE to leave Tennessee, and nearly 1,000 residents attended Nashville and Memphis vigils to mourn Good’s death and seek accountability. 
ICE is playing a key role in the Memphis Safe Task Force where federal agencies are combining with state and local law enforcement, as well as the Tennessee National Guard, for suppression of crime and undocumented immigration.
Fifty percent of those surveyed by Civiqs opposed abolishing ICE, led by males at 58% and Republicans at 85%.

Bryan Smith, R-Taylor, will return to the West Virginia Capitol for the 2026 legislative session in a wheelchair after numerous surgeries in the last year left him partially paralyzed. (Photo by Amelia Ferrell Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia House member Bryan Smith will return this session in a wheelchair after numerous surgeries in the last year left him partially paralyzed.
Smith, 55, will reside in a medical facility during session and be transported to the state Capitol for the 60-day legislative session, which begins Wednesday. 
“My number one motivation is I didn’t want to feel that I was letting my county and my district down,” said Smith, a Republican who was sworn in last year to represent Taylor County and a sliver of Marion County. He replaced long-time House member and Republican Amy Summers, who retired from the Legislature.
“I want to do the very best I can for Taylor County and District 73,” Smith said. 
His medical emergency began last May, not long after the 2025 legislative session ended. Smith underwent a surgery that resulted in serious complications, including internal bleeding. It prompted an emergency surgery.
After returning home to Grafton, West Virginia, Smith said that in late July, his dog kept whining while putting her paw and head on his stomach where he felt pain.
“She kept continuing on, so finally I said, ‘Hey, if you’re if you’re this concerned, then we were having it checked out,’ and I’m glad we did, because when we finally got down to down to the emergency room at Ruby Hospital, come to find out that I had an internal hernia,” Smith said. 
After a series of other medical issues and surgeries, including having part of his bowel removed and a back operation, Smith woke up Dec. 2 without feeling in his legs.
Smith said medical professionals have “no idea what caused me to be paralyzed.” He has since regained some feeling in his toes and legs but remains dependent on a wheelchair. 
Medical staff will assist Smith during his day at the state Capitol, where he serves on numerous committees.  Smith works as an administrative assistant at West Virginia University Medicine; he said his work is providing his medical assistance during this time.
“I do have a little bit of movement in both my legs so that’s one reason [WVU Medicine] transferred me down here, because I’m not ready to resign because I didn’t want to leave Taylor county unrepresented,” Smith said.
“If I could find a way to make it happen, I wanted to, and if I couldn’t, I was willing to step down,” he added.
The state Capitol, completed in the 1930s, can be difficult to navigate in a wheelchair due to its layout and tight spaces. 
“There’s a lot of tight spaces, especially getting out of the offices is very, very tight … and getting through security and through the metal detectors, I about took one out the other day,” he said.
Smith’s desk was moved in the House Chamber to accommodate his wheelchair. 
In his first year, Smith sponsored or cosponsored 57 pieces of legislation, including a bill that will enact stricter voter ID requirements this year. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Patrick Morrisey, requires a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. It eliminated several previously accepted options at polling places that can validate identity, including a Medicaid card and utility bill.
Smith joined other House Republicans last year to sponsor a bill that would prohibit homeless people from camping on public property throughout West Virginia. The measure sought to impose fines of up to $500 and up to 30 days in jail for homeless people who use camping paraphernalia, including tarps, cots, beds, sleeping bags, blankets or portable cooking facilities and similar equipment on governmental or public property, grounds or lawns. It passed the House but the Senate did not take the bill up for a vote.
This year, he plans to focus on an anti-spoofing bill to protect residents and developing what he called a comprehensive approach to helping West Virginians who are facing homelessness and substance use disorder.
“We need to get them help, true help, and give them an opportunity to get back on their feet,” Smith said. “So that’s something that’s very dear to me.”
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw has told reporters that the Republican-led House will be focused on economic development and job creation during the upcoming 60-day session. As part of a focus on workforce development, Hanshaw said lawmakers will be eyeing another pay raise for the state’s teachers and school service personnel.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Gov. Tony Evers, who is entering his final year in office, is calling on lawmakers to help him accomplish some of his priorities in 2026 including providing property tax relief and taking action to blunt the effect of cost-shifting from the federal government to states by the Trump administration.
Evers decided to not run for a third term last year, leading to the first open race for governor since 2010. During a press briefing Monday, he told reporters “nope” when asked if he had thoughts on who in the crowded Democratic primary field could best build on his work.
While he wouldn’t comment on the field, Evers said that working on affordability in Wisconsin would be one of his top priorities — and likely one of the top issues in the 2026 campaign cycle. 
Evers said he is focusing on what can be accomplished in the final year of his term rather than what he and his wife may do once he retires from office. 
“We’ve worked hard for seven years and… we have a year left and it’s not all about me. All of the things that need to be addressed, many of them can be. I feel very strongly that legacy is just doing the right thing for the people of Wisconsin,” Evers said, adding he wants to leave Wisconsin in “a better place.” 
The Wisconsin Legislature has work days scheduled through March, though Evers said work may need to go into April to get the state’s business accomplished. He said lawmakers could run for office and work at the same time. 
“I think it will help no matter who is running for reelection, both the Republicans and Democrats, actually spending some time not getting out of town as early as possible and let’s do some things for the people of Wisconsin,” Evers said. “It’s bad politics to say we’re done in February, we’re done in March and we’ll see you at the polls.” 
Evers said 2026 is starting after a year of “historic and bipartisan wins” for Wisconsinites. He highlighted actions taken in the state budget including providing state funding directly to child care centers, increasing school funding and investing in the University of Wisconsin system, and said he wants to build on that work in the rest of his term. “Our budget was a win for Wisconsin kids, families and our state’s future, but there’s no denying the final budget looked different from what I proposed,” he said. 
Evers noted that the state ended the fiscal year with nearly $4 billion in reserves and $2 billion in a rainy day fund. He said projections from the Department of Revenue that will be released soon show that the state could also bring in as much as $1 billion more than this year. 
Tax relief, school funding
Evers said one of his top priorities is taking action to soften the impact of property tax increases. He called on lawmakers, again, to pass a slate of policies he has proposed that could result in $1.3 billion in tax relief. 
Wisconsin taxpayers’ December bills included the highest increase since 2018 — the result, in part, of Evers’ controversial 400-year line-item veto, which extended a two-year increase in the amount of money districts can raise from local property taxpayers for centuries into the future, as well as lawmakers’ decision to not provide additional state aid to schools, pushing many districts to use their additional taxing authority and others to go to referendum, asking local residents to pay more.
“Look, I get it: Republicans love to blame my 400-year veto for property taxes going up,” Evers said. “The problem with that is Wiscosinites were going to referendum before increasing the number of years — long before. The question would be why? Because of a decade of Republicans consistently failing to meaningfully invest in our kids and K-12 schools. That has consequences including forcing Wisconsinites to raise their own property taxes.” 
Evers said that he wasn’t saying relief needs to be accomplished in one particular way, but that the state will be in a “world of hurt” if nothing is done about property taxes.
Proposals on the issue that he has suggested include a state program to encourage local governments to freeze property taxes, increasing state aid to public schools to help reduce tax levies and increasing the school levy tax credit. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has also named lowering property taxes as one of his top priorities for the year, though he and other Republicans have focused on the school revenue limit increases that are in place due to the partial veto Evers issued on the 2023 state budget. Evers brushed off the criticism, saying school districts were seeking property tax increases through referendum way before his veto.
“Before that 400-year veto, we were going to referendum all the time, so they can use that as an excuse if they want but let’s just get this done,” Evers said. 
Evers also called on lawmakers to provide additional funding for special education. He and lawmakers put funding in the budget they calculated would bring the state’s share of special ed costs to 42% of districts’ expenses in the first year of the budget and 45% in the second year, but the Department of Public Instruction has issued revised numbers showing that the funding allocated in the budget likely won’t be enough to meet those rates.
“This has to be fixed before the Legislature goes home this year. I’m calling on the Legislature to invest the necessary funding to ensure the agreed upon percentages… are met — or better yet, make the appropriation sum sufficient,” Evers said. Sum-sufficient appropriations are not fixed amounts of money but cover costs for programs even if they fluctuate.
Evers also said lawmakers should take action to exclude certain items including diapers, toothpaste and over-the-counter medications from the state’s sales tax. 
Evers said he is also open to looking at Republican proposals to eliminate taxes on overtime and tips but wants to consider more “universal” forms of tax relief. Republican lawmakers have been working to advance proposals that would align state tax policies with the new federal policies that were adopted last year.
Dealing with the Trump administration  
In his letter to lawmakers, Evers told them they may need to take action to blunt the effects of Trump administration policies. 
“With more chaos being created every day in Washington, new challenges continue to emerge and evolve that deserve our immediate focus and attention,” Evers wrote to lawmakers. “This includes responding to President Donald Trump’s and Republicans in Congress’ ongoing efforts to shift hundreds of millions of dollars in federal program costs to Wisconsin taxpayers and our state’s future budgets.” 
A recent change to federal law means that the state could be at risk of losing more than $200 million annually in federal funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program if the benefit payment error rate climbs above a certain level.
Evers told reporters that he is in conversations with lawmakers about a potential investment to ensure that the error rate for the state’s Foodshare program remains low. The state Department of Health Services has said that $69 million would help implement quality-control measures and cover the cuts the federal government has made to administrative costs.
The Trump administration has also recently frozen funds to five Democratic-run states, including Minnesota, due to child care fraud while also increasing reporting requirements for states receiving child care funds to cover services for low-income kids. 
Evers said Wisconsin, not one of the five, is in a good position to ensure accountability in the system as the state already made significant changes after a fraud scandal like Minnesota’s was uncovered in Wisconsin more than 15 years ago.
A 2009 Pulitzer prize-winning investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel uncovered significant fraud within the state’s WisconsinShares program that led to criminal indictments and prompted the state to implement protections. 
“We’re making sure we’re doing everything and we are in a good place,” Evers said. “There’s lots of auditing going on… so I think we’re in a great place.”
ICE shooting in Minneapolis
Evers told reporters that it is a “huge mistake” by President Donald Trump to exclude Minnesota from the investigation into the death of Renee Good at the hands of an ICE agent last week.
“Should the people of Minnesota or Minneapolis be a part of that investigation? Hell yes,” Evers said. “When the federal government comes in and talks about things in terms of you’re going to do this or that… you want to be part of the conversation and there’s none of that going on.” 
Evers said in response to a question about whether ICE was welcome in Wisconsin, “We can handle ourselves, frankly. I don’t see the need for the federal government to be coming into our state and making decisions that we can make at the state level.” 
However, Evers stopped short of endorsing a proposal from Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez that would bar ICE from certain areas.
Rodriguez, who is running in the Democratic primary for governor, proposed on Monday that the state ban ICE from courthouses, hospitals and health clinics, licensed child-care centers and daycares, schools and institutions of higher education, domestic violence shelters and places of worship unless there is a warrant or an imminent threat to public safety.
Evers said when asked about the proposal that he would look at it, but that “banning things will absolutely ramp up the actions of the folks in Washington D.C.”
Evers on what else might get accomplished in 2026
Evers said he is “confident” there will soon be a proposal to release $125 million in state funds to fight PFAS contamination that members from both sides of the aisle can support. He said his administration has spent the last several months in conversation with Republican lawmakers on the issue to try to reach a compromise.
Evers said that he hopes they will be able to do the same for the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program, which is set to expire this year. 
Evers said he is open to exploring options for getting WisconsinEye, the nonprofit that provided livestream coverage of state government similar to C-Span until it went dark last month, back online, but said he isn’t supportive of just giving the nonprofit state funds without a match requirement.
WisEye  went offline  Dec. 15 due to financial difficulties. There is $10 million in state funding for the organization that was set aside by lawmakers and Evers for an endowment, but the organization has to raise matching funds to access it.
“I think there has to be some skin in the game,” Evers said of WisEye. 
The organization launched a GoFundMe on Monday to help raise $250,000, which would cover its expenses for three months. By the end of the day, the organization had raised more than  $4,000.
Evers also called on lawmakers to pass legislation that would extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers from 60 days to a year. Vos has opposed the bill and stopped it from receiving a vote in the Assembly, even as it passed the Senate with only one opposing vote and has more than 70 Assembly cosponsors.
“I’m hoping 2026 will be the year that the Speaker finally decides that bill will make it to my desk,” Evers said.
Evers also outlined his hopes that lawmakers will take action to help lower the cost of health care and prescription drug prices including by capping the price of insulin at $35, passing legislation to audit insurance companies when their denial rates are high and creating new standards to increase the number of services health insurance companies must cover. 
Evers also called on lawmakers to provide funding for two sites that closed last year, one in Green Bay and the other in Chippewa Falls, that housed homeless veterans. He said ideally the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program would receive the nearly $2 million  as he proposed last year.  
Evers said he hadn’t seen the GOP-authored bills that passed the Assembly unanimously that would create a new state grant program that would go to organizations that serve homeless veterans. 
“Whatever we can do to solve that issue,” Evers said. “Any of the things I’ve talked about today, if something happens individually, great. We have to get that done, so if they come up with a plan that I feel confident it’s going to work… then I’d sign it.”

“The Rural Health Transformation Program is intentionally structured as a time-limited, performance-driven initiative, not a permanent expansion of state government,” Gailyn Markham, communications director for the state Department of Health, told West Virginia Watch in an email. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s office announced Dec. 29 that West Virginia had secured $199 million for 2026 from the Trump administration’s Rural HealthTransformation Fund. 
“The $199 million investment for 2026 provides a transformative foundation to improve health outcomes, expand access to care, and strengthen families and communities throughout West Virginia,” Morrisey said in a news release at the time. “This award positions our state to deliver better care closer to home and build a healthier future for generations to come. It is also the highest per capita award of any state that West Virginia touches.”
The federal fund is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law July 4, 2025. The program will dole out $50 billion fund to approved states over the next five years, with $10 billion distributed each year starting fiscal year 2026. 
Congress added the rural health fund to the legislation as concerns were raised that Medicaid funding cuts in the bill could lead to the closures of rural hospitals. The Republican megabill will cost state hospitals $1 billion per year when it’s fully implemented, according to the West Virginia Hospital Association. 
In a news release last month, hospital association president Jim Kaufman said the organization is thankful for Morrisey’s “visionary leadership” in securing critical resources for the state’s rural health care system. 
“This nearly $1 billion investment over five years represents a transformational opportunity to address longstanding challenges in rural health care delivery,” Kaufman said in the statement. 
The same day Morrisey announced federal funding for the year, the state Department of Health announced it would hire a team of nine staff members for the positions of director and deputy director, along with seven program managers to oversee different aspects of the state’s plan. 
The positions are not listed on the West Virginia Division of Personnel website. In each of the job listings on the job search site Indeed.com, the positions are described as an “at-will” for up to five years, depending on continued funding through the Rural Health Transformation Program.
“Compensation will be commensurate with executive-level public service, experience, and qualifications,” the job listings say. “This position includes full state benefits and travel reimbursement for statewide engagement.”
For the director position, the state seeks someone with a master’s or doctoral degree in public health, health administration, business, medicine or a related field along with a minimum of 10 years of senior leadership experience in health system transformation, public health administration, or large-scale program management, among other qualifications. 
Under Morrisey’s plan for the federal program, schools, libraries and other community institutions in rural West Virginia would be outfitted for use in telemedicine. The state also plans to use the funding to address the state’s health care worker shortage by recruiting high school students to health care careers, adding health care faculty at regional and technical colleges and using financial incentives to attract and keep providers in rural areas. 
Another of the initiatives, the Rural Health Link, would provide patients access to transportation to medical appointments using public buses, rideshare services and volunteer drivers.

(Photo by Annie Flanagan/The Hechinger Report)
About two dozen second graders sat on the carpet at the front of Jacquelyn Anthony’s classroom, reviewing how to make tens. “Two needs eight!” the students yelled out together. “Six needs four!” 
“The numbers may get a little trickier,” Anthony told them next. “But remember, the numbers we need to make 10 are still there.” The students then turned confidently to bigger calculations: Forty-six needs four ones to make a new number divisible by 10; 128 needs two to make 13 tens. 
At the end of the hour, the second graders slung on their backpacks, gathered their Chromebooks and lined up at the door before heading to English and social studies class across the hall. While most schools wait until middle school to transition students from one class to another, kids at the Baton Rouge Center for Visual and Performing Arts do so starting at age 6 or 7. It’s part of a strategy known as departmentalizing, or platooning. 
Anthony, rather than teaching all four core subjects, specializes in math. The school’s new facility, built in 2025, was designed with departmentalizing in mind: The classrooms have huge glass windows, so teachers can see their next class preparing to line up in the hallway.
“Teaching today is so different than it was a long time ago, and there are so many demands on them. And the demand to be an expert in your content area is very high,” said Sydney Hebert, magnet site coordinator for the art-focused public school in the East Baton Rouge Parish school district. “We want to make sure that our teachers are experts in what they’re teaching so that they can do a good job of teaching it to the kids.”
As schools contend with a decades-long slump in math scores — exacerbated by the pandemic — some are turning to this classroom strategy even for very young students. In recent years, more elementary schools have opted to departmentalize some grade levels in an attempt to boost academic achievement. The share of fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms operating on this schedule has doubled since the year 2000, from 15% to 30% in 2021. Often, that means educators will specialize in one or two subjects at most, such as fourth-grade English language arts and social studies, or fifth-grade math and science. The theory is that teachers who specialize will be more familiar with the content and better able to teach it. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That may be particularly important for math: Studies have shown that some early elementary school teachers experience anxiety about the subject and question their ability to teach it. Educators also say that the curriculum and standards for math and English in the early grades are changing rapidly in some districts and have become more complicated over time. In a departmentalized setup, it’s also far less likely that math instruction will get shortchanged by an educator who prefers spending time on other subjects.

But while some schools swear by this model, the research on it is mixed.
One prominent 2018 study on the practice in Houston public schools found it had a negative effect on test scores, behavior and attendance. The study doesn’t explain why that was the case, but the researcher said it could be because teachers on this schedule spend less time with individual students.
Another study published in 2024 analyzing Massachusetts schools had different outcomes: Researchers found moderate gains in academic achievement for ELA and a significant boost to science scores for students in departmentalized classes. The results in math, however, showed few gains. 
Generally, teachers specialize in the subject they are most comfortable teaching. When a school departmentalizes for the first time, principals typically look at each educator’s test score data over time to determine whether they should specialize in math or reading.
“There are some arguments that, at least if it’s someone who likes the subject, who is passionate about the subject, you have a greater chance of them doing a better job of delivering instruction,” said Latrenda Knighten, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. “But you’ll find mixed reviews.”

Yet there are a few reasons why the strategy is typically reserved for students in older grades, according to school leaders: Spending all day with one teacher increases the bond between the teacher and student, which is important for younger children. In Baton Rouge, Anthony teaches 50 students throughout the day instead of the same 25 students all day.
“Teachers want to get to know their students,” said Dennis Willingham, superintendent of Walker County Schools in Alabama. The district departmentalized some fifth grade classrooms decades ago, but recently added third and fourth grade classes on this schedule. “You tend to see less departmentalization below third grade because of the nurturing element.” 
It’s also generally more challenging for young students to quickly change classrooms, even for electives, which means lost instructional time. Smaller elementary schools may also struggle to hire enough teachers to schedule all of them on a departmentalized setup.

But increasingly, schools that are satisfied with this approach for older grade levels are trying it out with their younger grades, too. 
After the pandemic, the San Tan Heights Elementary School in Arizona changed its curriculum to one that was more rigorous, and it became harder for the third-grade educators to master the standards of all four subject areas, said Henry Saylor-Scheetz, principal at the time.
He proposed that third graders be taught by separate math, English language arts and reading teachers. “I told them, let’s try it for a semester. If it doesn’t work at the end of the year, we’ll go back,” Saylor-Scheetz said.
Ten days into the experiment, teachers told him they never wanted to return to the old schedule. In the subsequent years, the school added more classrooms on this model until, by 2023, all K-8 students were departmentalized. For the last few years, teacher retention at the school was 95%, according to Saylor-Scheetz.
Saylor-Scheetz, who last year became principal of a nearby middle school, credited the change for helping the school improve from a C rating on its state report card — a rating it had stagnated at every year since 2018 — to a B rating as of 2022. Since then, more schools in his Arizona school district have shifted to this schedule. 
“I’d love to see this become something we do as a nation, but it is a paradigm shift,” Saylor-Scheetz said. “There’s merit in doing it, but there has to be a commitment to it.”
At Baton Rouge Center for Visual and Performing Arts, students in first through third grades have two partner teachers, one for math and science and another for ELA and social studies. The school has been operating on this schedule for third- through fifth-grade students for more than a decade. Eight years ago, its leaders decided to try it for first- and second-grade students, too, and were pleased with the results. 
On a December morning at the school, young students talked quietly with each other in the hall as they lined up to go from math class to English language arts. All told, the switch took less than five minutes. “We’re at the end of the second nine weeks, so we’ve had a lot of practice,” said GiGi Boudreaux, the assistant principal. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The strategy has not always been successful, though.
During the pandemic, administrators also attempted to departmentalize its kindergarten classes. It didn’t work as they’d hoped: It was a challenge to get the 5-year-olds to quickly change classes and focus on classwork again once they did. Parents also didn’t like it. The school then tried moving teachers from classroom to classroom instead of moving students, but the educators hated it. 
“It was too much, so we didn’t do it after that,” said Hebert.
The Baton Rouge school doesn’t have comparison data to show that students perform better in a departmentalized setup, but most educators in the school prefer it, Hebert said. Third-grade test scores from 2015 — before the school departmentalized its younger grade levels — showed 73% scored “advanced” and “mastery” level on the state ELA test, and 56% scored advanced or mastery on the math test. In 2025, 80% of third-grade students scored advanced or mastery in ELA and 55%t in math.
“I know that the teachers like it better, and the kids have adapted to it,” Hebert said. 
Teachers meet weekly with their partner teachers and grade-level counterparts to discuss their classes and progress on the state standards. Once a quarter, all of the math teachers across the grades meet to talk about strategies and student performance.

At Deer Valley Unified School District in Arizona, departmentalizing some classrooms has helped reduce teacher turnover, said Superintendent Curtis Finch, particularly for early career educators, who can find it challenging to master the content and standards of all four subjects.
“If you’re not confident in your subject, then you don’t have good examples off the top of your head. You can’t control the room, can’t pull the students in,” Finch said. 
There are drawbacks though, Finch acknowledged. In a self-contained classroom, teachers can more easily integrate their different lessons, so that a math lesson might refer back to a topic covered in reading.
And even though Anthony, the second-grade math and science teacher in Baton Rouge, loves teaching math, she also misses the extra time she could spend with each student when she had the same 25 children in her class all day for the entire school year. 
“It was a joy for me to be self-contained and to build that little family,” Anthony said. “I think the social emotional needs of students are best met in that type of environment. But being solely a math teacher, I do get to just dig in and focus on the nuance of the content.” 
For Anthony’s partner teacher across the hall, Holley McArthur, teaching 50 students ELA and social studies is easier than having to teach 25 students math. 
“This is my thing: reading books, comprehending and finding answers, meeting their goals,” said McArthur, who has taught in both kinds of classrooms over three decades in education.  
While McArthur’s kids were at recess this mid-December day, the veteran teacher was grading their reading worksheets. A new student had transferred in from out of state midyear, and she was still evaluating his reading skills. 
“I think you still get to know the kids, even if you just have them for three hours a day, because I’m not doing the hard math with them.”

Forever War, Part 3: This story is the third in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina.
FORT FISHER, N.C.—On a sunny, brisk afternoon in mid-December, Kerri Allen peers from the deck of a ferry, crossing the Cape Fear River from Fort Fisher, on a coastal barrier island, to Southport, a small town on the mainland, near where the river meets the sea.
Allen has lived near the water all of her 30-plus years. She competes in outrigger canoe races and calls herself an “East Coast mermaid.” She knows how to read a river, and at times her life has depended on that skill. She has paddled this rugged stretch of the Cape Fear River when winds were wailing and whitecaps were walloping her boat. She now works as coastal management program director for the N.C. Coastal Federation.
On this day, from the port side of the ferry, the river looks as deep and dark as midnight. A light southwest wind pushes serrated waves against the hull.
“There is a lot going on under the water,” Allen says, as she scans the horizon. “Tidal currents, river currents, basin currents.”

Allen is taking the 35-minute ride with her fellow environmental advocates: Lindsay Addison, a coastal biologist with the Audubon Society, and Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper. They’re showing me the potential impacts of a proposed federal dredging project: Shorelines and beach spits that are buffeted by wakes of enormous container ships, and vulnerable bird habitats on barrier islands that could be coated with PFAS-contaminated silt.
And, of course, the Cape Fear River itself. It’s a repository for industrial chemicals and fertilizers that have drained from farms and lawns, and microplastics that have invaded every aspect of human existence, even our brains.
The advocates have spent the last year fending off myriad environmental assaults under the Trump administration, including the loss of wetlands protections, the weakening of the Endangered Species Act and the rollback of PFAS regulations in drinking water.
These threats—and many others—are now weighing on the advocates’ minds as they fight a different battle, the billion-dollar, six-year dredging project proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
To accommodate larger ships heading up the Cape Fear River to the Port of Wilmington, the Corps would dredge 28 miles of the river up from its mouth near Bald Head Island, north along the Fort Fisher ferry route and upstream to the port. The dredging would deepen the shipping channel to 47 feet, from its current depth of 42 feet, federal records show, and widen some segments by as much as 500 feet—equivalent to one and a half football fields.
By the time the Corps is finished, 35 million cubic yards of silt and sand, plus the creatures that live in it, would be scraped and slurped from the riverbed.
The Corps would dispose of roughly half the material at a permitted ocean disposal site; the rest—sand and silt likely contaminated with PFAS—would be slathered on hundreds of acres of public beaches, bird-nesting islands and imperiled wetlands.
From the ferry deck, the Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point comes into view across the vast river expanse. Operated by the U.S. Army, it is the world’s largest military terminal. It stores and ships explosives, artillery shells, Howitzers, grenades and other ammunition. If the United States is embroiled in a conflict—or assisting with one—the weapons likely ship from Sunny Point.





Parts of the terminal are contaminated with toxic PFAS found in firefighting foam, military testing has shown. Studies have also found contaminants from terminal seeping from the groundwater into tributaries of the Cape Fear.
University scientists and state environmental regulators have also found the forever chemicals in river water, fish, birds and alligators, as well as in sediment north of the port.


Despite the likelihood of contamination, the Corps doesn’t intend to test the dredging material for PFAS, according to a Draft Environmental Impact Statement released in September. In fact, the 260-page document doesn’t mention PFAS at all.
Even if the Corps did find PFAS in the dredging material, it’s unclear if they would be prohibited from disposing of it. There are currently no federal standards or regulations to guide decisions related to PFAS contamination in sediment, a Corps spokesman said.
Because sediment tests have a limited shelf life, the spokesman said, samples collected now would be outdated by the time the Corps would begin dredging the river in five to 10 years.
If the dredging project comes to fruition, the spokesman said, the Corps would test the sediment in the engineering and design phase “to meet all applicable requirements” and guide decisions about where to place the material.

Burdette has battled for PFAS regulations since the compounds were detected in the Cape Fear River in 2017. He’s from Wilmington and unknowingly drank contaminated water much of his life. His two children, now in their teens, drank it. His father drank it and died of kidney cancer, which research has linked to exposure to GenX, a PFAS compound.
Burdette has wrestled alligators so scientists could take their blood. His organization, Cape Fear River Watch, sued the state and Chemours, the chemical manufacturer responsible for discharging GenX and other forever chemicals into the Cape Fear. The state and Chemours agreed to a consent order that required the company to stop its contaminated discharges into the waterway.
Last fall, Burdette paddled an aluminum rowboat to Chemour Fayetteville Works on the river to test whether a PFAS compound called TFA was in water outfalls from the plant. He found disturbingly high levels of the ultra-short chain compounds.
Now Burdette is again fighting for the river he knows so well, and on behalf of the people who depend on it.
A Gritty, Loud, Noxious Port
The ferry turns gently toward the west as the advocates aboard rattle off additional probable harms from the dredging: The increased wake and wave action from the enormous ships would erode shorelines and drown bird eggs and chicks in their nests. Roughly 1,000 acres of wetlands would be permanently lost. Endangered Atlantic Sturgeon, which live on the river bed, would be dismembered by the ships’ sharp keels.
Allen is concerned that there is no monitoring plan for the environmental impacts. The Cape Fear River is so impaired, she says, that crabbers describe the river as dead.
Allen, in her mid-30s, is blond and athletic with a wide smile. She was born in Raleigh, but moved to Wilmington as a teenager. She originally planned to become an artist, and her creative streak manifests in her Coastal Federation office at Wrightsville Beach.
Not only does she have a graceful array of seashells, but also a collection of sand: Black sand, white sand, sand from Hawaii, sand from San Francisco, sand from Costa Rica, sand with large grains, sand with small grains, even sea glass, all housed in 100 small antique bottles with cork stoppers.

Had it not been for a high school oceanography class, Allen could be painting ocean scenes. But as part of the class, she visited a marsh where she retrieved the shell of a tulip mollusk, a type of large sea snail. She was hooked. Now she’s a coastal geologist.
Allen and her fellow advocates have scrutinized the economics of the proposal. Federal documents show the financial benefits of the $1.2 billion proposed project are few and barely meet the Corps’ benefit-cost threshold for reasonableness. The state legislature would have to appropriate $339 million to cover a quarter of the costs.
The total cargo volume flowing through the port is expected to remain steady with or without a harbor improvement project, according to the Corps’ analysis. Yet, the Corps, and before it, the State Ports Authority, justified deepening the shipping channel to accommodate larger vessels. Otherwise, ships would have to “light load”—carry less weight to the port, which could entail more river traffic.
In other words, fewer trips, but bigger ships.
The 284-acre Port of Wilmington lies just two miles south of downtown. Unlike the city’s waterfront promenade, restaurants and tourist shops, the port is gritty, loud and noxious.
Along Burnette Boulevard, Kinder Morgan, the Houston-based pipeline company, operates a chemical, petroleum and asphalt storage terminal. EcoLab injects shipping containers with the neurotoxin methyl bromide to fumigate logs. In the backyards of Sunset Park residents looms Enviva’s dome of wood pellets, sourced from North Carolina forests and bound for Europe to be burned as fuel.
The port is crucial to Wilmington’s economy, but receives just 1.3 percent of the nation’s marine shipping traffic. It handled about 7 million tons of cargo in 2022, most of it container shipments, according to State Port Authority figures.
In February 2020, the State Port Authority released a feasibility study about improving the shipping channel, which, unsurprisingly, found it would benefit the port.
The findings have since prompted accusations of self-dealing, especially in light of an eviscerating federal review. After the state submitted it to the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works, that office identified more than two dozen major weaknesses and unresolved issues.
The state Department of Transportation, which oversees the port, did not respond to emails from Inside Climate News seeking comment.
The Port Authority underestimated the project’s impact on river flooding associated with sea-level rise, failed to account for the effects of climate change, and claimed, without evidence, that unless the shipping channel was deepened and widened, the port would close.
“As written, the planning objectives are unclear and could potentially lead to the pre-selection of an alternative plan,” Corps documents read. “In many cases, the report uses qualifying words, such as may, potentially, and just, to lessen the description of project impacts.”
Nonetheless, Congress authorized more than $839 million for the project, but with a caveat: The study’s shortcomings had to be fixed before lawmakers would consider releasing the funding.
In 2022, the task fell to the Corps.
PFAS in the Fish
The ferry docks at the Southport terminal after crossing the river in about 35 minutes, and the trio of environmental advocates heads for the fishing pier. It’s nearly empty in December, but during high season, the pier is jammed with anglers eager to catch a red drum or Atlantic croaker for dinner.
Those fish are among seven saltwater species that contained PFAS in their tissues, according to sampling conducted by the state Department of Environmental Quality.
In 2023 and 2024, DEQ tested 77 fish caught between Wilmington and Southport—the same stretch of the river that the Corps would deepen and widen—for the compounds. DEQ presented preliminary data to the state Secretaries’ Science Advisory Board last October that showed PFAS were present in all seven saltwater species sampled, as well as in river water.
The agency found 13 types of PFAS disbursed among the fish. PFOS, which the chemical industry phased out in 2002, was detected in all of the samples.
Two compounds found in several fish, PFMOAA and PFO5DA, can be traced back to Chemours, 100 miles upstream.
The saltwater fish findings build on previous DEQ sampling that detected high levels of PFOS in eight species of freshwater fish commonly caught in the river segment upstream of Wilmington, between Chemours and the Bluffs on the Cape Fear.
The results compelled state health officials in 2023 to issue a fish consumption advisory for those species, recommending that pregnant women eat none and that others limit their intake to no more than seven meals in a year.
The state health department is evaluating options for future fish advisories, including consideration of guidelines proposed last September by the Great Lakes Consortium for Fish Advisories.
Research on PFAS and Birds
Addison is in her 40s and, in the winter, wears flannel and a knit toboggan to protect against the wind. She has been a coastal biologist with the Audubon Society in Wilmington for 15 years and grew up in Florida, surrounded by nature and books. Her father was a biologist, and she spent her childhood playing outside, roaming the woods behind her elementary school while she waited for her mother, a teacher, to finish working.
“Outside, you might go to the same place over and over,” she says, “but you don’t know what you’re going to see or what’s going to happen. It’s never the same.”
Even her hobbies dovetail with her professional life. Like the protagonists in the British mysteries she reads, Addison observes the natural world, what belongs and what seems out of place.
“Birds are a thing everyone can get behind,” says Lindsay Addison, a coastal biologist with the Audubon Society. Credit: Lisa Sorg/Inside Climate News
Addison loves birds. She has a figurine of a killdeer in her office—but if she had to name a favorite shorebird, it would be the American oystercatcher. (The Carolina wren, a yardbird, is second, Addison says. “They’re pert.”)
“Birds are a thing that everyone can get behind,” she says. “They are a great uniter.”
American oystercatchers live on coastal salt marshes, mudflats, and islands. They are sociable introverts who are loyal to their mates and will return to the same spot to nest every year. If an island were a parking lot, Addison says, an American oystercatcher would return not just to the same lot, but “to the same parking space.”
American oystercatchers, as their name suggests, eat oysters. And scientists have found oysters contaminated with the compounds along the Southeast Atlantic Coast..
Some birds living along the Cape Fear River have also been contaminated with PFAS. In 2017, Addison, EPA scientists and University of Rhode Island researchers tested chicks that had died of natural causes from three locations: Massachusetts Bay, Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, and the Cape Fear River Estuary in North Carolina.
They found 16 types of PFAS in the livers of royal terns, sandwich terns, laughing gulls and brown pelicans from the Cape Fear River Estuary. These included PFOS and two compounds associated with Chemours.
Chicks from the Cape Fear Estuary contained significantly greater concentrations and numbers of PFAS than juveniles from Massachusetts Bay or Narragansett Bay, researchers found. A royal tern chick from the estuary had the highest total of PFAS of all the birds tested: 390 parts per trillion.
Over the past two years, Addison, along with the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, conducted a second study. They took blood samples from living brown pelican chicks to see if their immune systems have been affected by exposure to PFAS. The results are pending.
If the Corps places contaminated dredge material on the bird nesting islands, that could further expose them to compounds. The “likely presence of PFAS is a major concern” for DEQ, according to an agency spokesperson.
“We need to find out before we do it,” Addison says. “You can’t un-ring the bell.”
Back Before the House
Emily Donovan, co-founder of the environmental group Clean Cape Fear, couldn’t make the ferry trip. Instead, she prepared to testify before the U.S. House Environment Subcommittee.
Donovan routinely speaks in public; sometimes it seems like she’s on tour. Seven years ago, she first appeared before the House Environment Subcommittee, where she pleaded with federal lawmakers to authorize and fund a comprehensive, nationwide PFAS Human Exposure Study and to regulate all of the compounds, not piecemeal, but as a class.
Last May, she addressed 100 people from the pulpit of Ocean View United Methodist Church in Oak Island, North Carolina, to unveil findings about PFAS in sea foam along the state’s beaches. Coincidentally, that was the day EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced he would roll back drinking water regulations for GenX and four other PFAS chemicals—regulations Donovan and other North Carolina environmentalists had fought for more than a decade.

This time, though, Donovan felt nervous. She had little time to finesse her remarks. House Democrats had contacted her on short notice to appear before the committee about proposed PFAS exemptions under the Superfund law, which governs hundreds of sites nationwide that are contaminated by hazardous waste.
The hearing at the Rayburn Building in Washington, D.C., was on the 18th of December: A week before Christmas, in the middle of Hanukkah and on the final day of Congress in 2025. She wondered if anyone was listening or even cared.
Clad in a black turtleneck sweater, Donovan sat at a hearing table with three other witnesses, all of whom represented industries that favored the Superfund exemption.
The Trump administration had kept the hazardous materials designation for PFOA and PFOS, enacted under President Biden. That classification places those compounds under the purview of the Superfund program, which allows the EPA to force polluters to pay for cleanups, rather than taxpayers.
Now, Congress was weighing a legal exemption for “passive receivers,” entities that didn’t produce the compounds but had unknowingly accepted contaminated material: farmers, wastewater treatment plants, even seaside beach towns.
Initially, the proponents’ arguments seemed reasonable. But as the hearing wore on, observers learned the EPA already absolves passive receivers from governmental liability. However, proponents say that without the exemption, they are still vulnerable to third-party lawsuits.
Those claims are disingenuous, Donovan told the committee, whose Democratic members agreed. The passive receiver exemption could shield polluters from accountability, she said. For example, in North Carolina, the state regulates water and wastewater utilities. In turn, the utilities often end up processing discharges of toxic chemicals from industries like plastics manufacturers and textile companies,
This gives polluting industries cover: the utility is on the hook to DEQ, not them, Donovan said.










“Our beaches are coated in an atrocious amount of PFAS in sea foam.”


–   Emily Donovan, Clean Cape Fear


“Yet here we are debating whether to weaken accountability for two types of PFAs that haven’t been in commercial use for over a decade,” she said.
Donovan was part of a research team that found PFAS-contaminated sea foam along several Brunswick County beaches in southern North Carolina. Of the 12 sea foam samples, Caswell Beach and nearby Oak Island had some of the highest levels. These are the same places where the Corps could soon place 2 million cubic yards of dredge material from the Cape Fear River.
“Our beaches are coated in an atrocious amount of PFAS in sea foam, the highest ever recorded in literature to date,” she told the committee. “The discovery of these toxic levels of PFAS contaminating our local beaches is yet another public health threat lawmakers and regulators have no idea how to address.”
Seaside Towns Divided on Dredging 
Sand is existential for coastal communities. Without a steady replenishment, the sand is carried to sea by storms—some of them supercharged by climate change—and the constant barrage of wakes and waves. Without sand, there are no tourists. And without tourists, the coastal economy folds like a beach chair.
Beach renourishment can cost seaside towns tens of millions of dollars. This is why the prospect of the Corps delivering free sand from the dredging project is nearly irresistible.
The Corps is required under federal law to evaluate whether to test dredge material for contaminants of concern, such as pesticides, metals and PCBs. If the material is in an area with a history of spills or known contamination, the Corps is required to test it for a list of chemicals before disposing of it either inland or at a designated ocean site. PFAS are not on that list.
In the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, the Corps bases its conclusions that sediment contains “acceptable concentrations” of toxic contaminants on tests conducted from 2013 to 2016. Those tests did not include PFAS; not until 2017 did the public know PFAS had contaminated the Cape Fear River.
Scientists have already shown that PFAS can settle in sediment in rivers and lakes worldwide, from Michigan to China. Ralph Mead, a scientist at UNC Wilmington, found the compounds in sediment samples in the Cape Fear River at the dam 39 miles north of Wilmington. Eleven PFAS were found in estuarine sediments in Charleston, S.C.
Erin Carey is the deputy director and conservation policy lead for the North Carolina chapter of the Sierra Club. She lives in Wilmington with her husband and stepson, and grew up in rural Vermont, where, as a child, she became an environmental advocate.
In third grade, she started a petition to bring a rock, about the size of a loaf of bread, into the classroom where she could store it at her desk. All of her classmates signed the petition, which did not sway the teacher. “Not only did it not work,” she says. “But I didn’t get the rock and I had to stay in for recess.”



In sixth grade, she started a boycott to advocate for dolphin-safe tuna. Carey wanted to “save the world” and become a marine biologist. She moved to Wilmington, where she earned two degrees in environmental and marine science.

But “there weren’t a lot of ‘save the world jobs’ out there,” Carey says, so she took whatever science job she could.
She worked at the microbiology lab at Wilmington’s Sweeney water treatment plant years before scientists discovered PFAS entering and leaving the facility. In Carteret County, she inspected small wastewater treatment plants, where her job entailed peering into vats of raw sewage. At DEQ’s shellfish sanitation program, she pureed oysters to test them for E. coli bacteria.


Finally, one day when she was surfing in Costa Rica, she got the call that she’d been hired at the Sierra Club in North Carolina. Since then, she’s seen some environmental victories—state rules on emissions of methyl bromide, a neurotoxin—and losses. Under Trump, millions of acres of wetlands, including thousands in North Carolina, are losing protection. “The wetlands fight will be, [and] is, the most daunting and most terrifying change we’ve seen come out of the Trump administration.”
Polling shows that the environment falls below the economy in importance, she says. “It may, but I don’t think that that’s a full picture of how emotionally connected people are to the environment. Despite the body blows that we take, the energy from the public, love for the environment and for nature, the need to protect it, that seems intrinsic to being human. That makes it worth it.”
Carey says environmental groups have spoken with the Corps about their PFAS concerns, but “they’re taking the stance that it’s not regulated and we don’t have to do anything about it.”
“No, you don’t have to,” Carey says of the Corps, “but you could do your job and protect people.”











“Despite the body blows that we take, the energy from the public, love for the environment and for nature, the need to protect it, that seems intrinsic to being human.”

Caswell Beach Mayor George Kassler said he is unaware “that anyone is concerned with PFAS from material placed on the beach.” He said the town is relying on the “Corps’ assurance” that chemical testing of the material would occur as outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement.
In Oak Island, elected officials haven’t taken a public stand on whether it would accept sand from the dredging project. The Town Council “has not yet had the chance to discuss this topic in an open meeting,” a town spokesman said.
Other municipalities, though, have either opposed the project or asked for concessions similar to those made when the Georgia Ports Authority expanded the Savannah Harbor.
The Southport Board of Alderman passed a resolution earlier this month that urged state and federal policymakers to require a “comprehensive, long-term, and fully-funded environmental mitigation and adaptive management plan.”
This would require the State Port Authority to deposit $500 million in an escrow account to fund future mitigation projects to address as-yet-unknown environmental harms caused by the dredging.
Kure Beach officials passed a similar resolution. They also urged the relevant agencies to protect Battery Island and the surrounding Cape Fear River islands “as irreplaceable ecological assets,” ensuring that mitigation measures “fully safeguard the habitats supporting nearly a third of North Carolina’s coastal shorebird population.”

The Village of Bald Head Island, a wealthy enclave in and near a maritime forest four miles from the mainland, would receive 1.6 million cubic yards of dredged sand. But that offer isn’t enticing enough to counter the potential environmental and property damages; in mid-December, village officials voted unanimously to oppose the project.
Bill Cary, an attorney with the powerful law firm Brooks Pierce, which is representing Bald Head Island, wrote to the Corps that the village is still recovering 25 years after the previous dredging project. It has spent more than $2.8 million a year addressing the damages, including shoreline erosion.
Brooks Pierce also hired ports and shipping expert Asaf Ashar, a University of New Orleans research professor emeritus, who, in 40 pages of analysis, concluded that the Corps’ economic projections are incorrectly calculated and unsupported.
“Considering the size of the projected expenditures, the environmental impacts, the prior criticisms and the time and expense of the new analysis,” Cary wrote, “one would expect the 2025 economic considerations to be thorough, well-documented, supported by available data, and based on sound, consistent analytical principles. It is none of those things.”
What’s Next
A motorboat passes by the Southport pier. Its wake travels beneath the pilings and thwacks the stone rip-rap that protects the waterfront from flooding. Multiply the power of that wake by 1,000, even 10,000, from ships traveling the river, and the force of the water can annihilate a shoreline.
Addison points out Battery Island, which lies about a half mile across the river from the Southport pier. At 100 acres, it is one of the largest wading-bird areas in the state, as well as a sanctuary for chicks because no mammals, other than the occasional unfortunate deer, can swim there.
Many of the birds “read” the island for the high tide line and build their nests above it, she says. But sometimes the incoming water, whether from gusty winds or big boats, tops the line and drowns birds in their nests.
When ferries and ships pass the island, they create a tsunami effect: Water is sucked from the shore, but then slams back and gradually sloughs off the shoreline. The birds are running out of higher ground. Thirty-year-old cedars are falling into the sea.
“It’s one of the islands we’re most concerned about,” Addison says. “There’s a pretty wicked current. It’s striking how far a boat wake can travel.”
The state Wildlife Resources Commission owns many islands near the river, which the Audubon Society manages. The commission is also concerned about the damage wakes could inflict on birding islands from large ships, especially on Battery Island.
“There was no information on wave heights and how far wakes would progress onshore,” the WRC wrote in its public comments to the Corps. “A single overwash causes a nest to be lost. This permanent loss of nesting and roosting habitats along with potential site abandonment by birds should be considered and mitigated appropriately.”
The project would alter 1,000 acres of wetlands from freshwater to saltwater, which supports entirely different ecosystems. The Corps would be required to mitigate those impacts at other locations within the river subbasin, but the harm—including inundation of some wetlands and wake erosion of others—would be extensive and permanent.
“This project will increase salinity up the river,” said Carey of the Sierra Club. “It will change the nature of ecosystems and forests. The idea of killing off wetlands and then just assuming that they will become just a different kind of wetland—eventually—there’s no analysis behind that. It’s just an assumption.”
Carey likens the project to a scene in the film Jurassic Park: “Jeff Goldblum says, ‘your scientists were so focused on whether they could do something, they didn’t think about whether they should.’”
An Uncertain Fate 
On the pier, Burdette scrolls on his phone, searching for photos of Atlantic sturgeon. They are endangered in North Carolina and, because they live on the river bottom, can be mowed down by the sharp keels of ships.
He points to the shoreline where the boat’s wake just dissipated. “This one I found right over there,” he says, having found the photo of a sturgeon on his phone. “And this one—is missing part of himself.”
Cars and trucks line up to load onto the ferry back to Fort Fisher. It is mid-afternoon but already the sun is nodding toward the horizon. Burdette glances at his watch, 30 minutes until high tide. The ferry heads up and then back across the river to Fort Fisher. Even though the advocates know the area by heart, there is always something beautiful to see.
“Wow, look at that boat,” Allen says, pointing ahead.
The long fingers of the sun have bathed the vessel in hues of butter.
The conversation turns to what could happen next. Under state law, DEQ must conduct a consistency review for federal projects that could affect the coastal zone. The agency’s Division of Coastal Management analyzes the project to evaluate whether it complies with the state’s approved coastal management program, including the dredge and fill law.
Coastal Management officials are expected to complete the review by Jan. 20.
The division has three choices: It could issue a letter of “concurrence,” which allows the project to continue. A letter of “conditional concurrence,” requires changes to the project for it to proceed. An “objection” cancels the project unless the Corps appeals to federal court or enters into mediation with the state.
The Corps could issue its Final Environmental Impact Statement as early as next spring. Even if the project clears the regulatory hurdles, it’s unclear if Congress and the state legislature will appropriate the funds—and when.
The ferry heads north and east. From the starboard side, Burdette points to a dredging barge, slouched in the water, laden with dirt. The barge is headed south, and likely out to sea, to dump it.
Out here on the water, I feel small, humble, inconsequential. “Ecosystems, the ocean, the tides, hurricanes, these are not things you can negotiate with,” Addison says. “We can, we can observe them and appreciate their beauty, but we do not control them. The forces are big and impersonal, and that, to me, is comforting instead of intimidating.”
Ten minutes after sunset at Kure Beach, just north of Fort Fisher, the skies have turned from indigo to lilac. The sand is damp and cold. A half dozen hardy tourists take selfies against the backdrop of ocean waves breaking on the shore.
Those forces require beaches to be routinely smoothed and mended. Behind the orange snow fence, slumps a backhoe and a heap of sand.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Tribal leaders in North Dakota are urging their citizens to carry tribal IDs and other forms of identification amid reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detaining Native Americans in Minnesota. 
At least five tribal citizens were reportedly detained by ICE last week in Minneapolis, reported ICT, an Indigenous news organization. Four are citizens of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the fifth is a descendant of the Red Lake Nation, the news organization reported. 
Reports of Indigenous people being targeted by ICE agents prompted Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear to issue a public safety alert on social media Friday.

Standing Rock is working on a designated telephone line to ensure tribal members know their rights if they come into contact with immigration agents, Sitting Bear said in a statement.
“Our Nation is a sovereign government and our members are not immigrants,” he said. “We are not subject to immigration enforcement on our own lands.”
The Spirit Lake Nation and Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate in a joint statement with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe said ICE’s activities in Minnesota have “caused fear and uncertainty” among their citizens.
The joint statement also condemned the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent on Wednesday.
“As Dakota people, we are reminded of the sacrifices of our ancestors and the enduring impacts of displacement and violence experienced by our Nations,” the tribes said.
Tribal governments have advised tribal members to carry tribal identification cards, certificates of degree of Indian blood or other official documentation.
The warnings come as at least 2,000 ICE agents are in neighboring Minnesota, with Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem reportedly ordering additional federal agents to the area.

“As tribal nations, our fundamental rights are not granted, they are inherent and written in our treaties, our sovereignty, and our laws,” North Dakota Native Vote Deputy Director Kendyl Harrison said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. “Any attacks or discrimination on any Indigenous person is a clear violation and intrusion upon those rights.”
Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure in a Facebook post also denounced ICE’s activity as “divisive and abhorrent.” He told tribal citizens that ICE cannot go on tribal land without the consent of the tribe. 
In addition to the incidents in Minneapolis, ICE reportedly detained multiple Arizona tribal citizens last year, with one woman nearly being deported in November, according to the Arizona Mirror.
Tribal leaders also urged citizens who are approached by immigration agents to contact their respective tribal governments, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Native American Rights Fund.
“We’re seeing the same reports that Native people are being unlawfully detained as U.S. citizens,” said Matthew Campbell, deputy director of the Native American Rights Fund. “It appears that there is certainly unlawful force and violence being used in these detentions.”
He said the organization is investigating the reports. Campbell invited any tribal citizen who has been detained by ICE to contact his organization.
“We certainly welcome speaking to them to understand the issues and what has been happening, and looking at what a lawsuit may look like,” he said.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
This article is part of a collaborative investigation into Mississippi’s Deadly Prisons.
An investigation by The Marshall Project-Jackson, Mississippi Today and other local reporting partners found that understaffing and gang violence in Mississippi’s prisons led to dozens of incarcerated people being killed in the last 10 years. Their killers seldom face consequences, and their families are often left without answers. 
Of the nearly 50 homicides we identified, just eight killers have been convicted.
Over the course of a year, reporters from The Marshall Project, Mississippi Today, the Clarion Ledger, the Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link reviewed thousands of pages of court records, incident reports, and federal and state government death records. We interviewed families who have lost loved ones behind bars, formerly incarcerated people, former guards, attorneys and corrections experts.
Following our investigation, Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain said in October 2025 that the department would review unprosecuted homicides and deaths ruled to be of undetermined causes. 
Yet three months later, there have been no additional indictments or convictions in open homicide cases.
The 2026 legislative session began Jan. 6. So far, House Corrections Chair Rep. Becky Currie stated that she plans to introduce legislation to advance prison health care reform. No legislation addressing prison violence, understaffing or homicides has been introduced. 
Here are five key points from our investigation — and what the federal government and other states have done to stem their own prison violence:
1. Prison homicides are not isolated incidents. They are the result of long-documented failures of the state to protect those in its custody. 
Many of the violent, preventable deaths we investigated showed the same factors: Chronic understaffing, lax oversight and gang control. These issues have been documented for decades in civil lawsuits and in investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
2. The killings have not stopped. 
After the stories were published in September, our reporting team identified three additional men who were killed behind bars in 2025. At East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Meridian, 41-year-old Aaron Harrison was killed in July. According to an incident report, Harrison was receiving medical treatment after appearing pale and yellow. A nurse practitioner observed bruising on his lower abdomen. The incident report stated that Harrison’s cause of death was unknown, but the state medical examiner later determined his death to be a homicide caused by blunt force trauma. 
Three months later, 23-year-old Cameron Roby succumbed to injuries following an assault at the same facility. Also in October, 29-year-old Donald Jones was beaten to death by his cellmate at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility, according to prison incident reports. No one has been criminally charged in connection with any of these deaths. 
3. The chief problem is prison understaffing.
Most of the documented killings were beatings or stabbings that occurred when staff were either absent, outnumbered or poorly trained to handle the violence. 
From 2015 through 2025, we discovered multiple accounts of a victim being beaten, killed and not found until hours later. In February 2025, officials at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility received a call that an incarcerated person had died in the prison. They found Jonathan Havard strangled to death in his cell, according to an incident report.
In December 2021, Ronnie Graham was beaten in the early hours of the morning. He spent nearly five hours passing in and out of consciousness before being found foaming at the mouth, according to prison incident reports and a Justice Department investigation. He died shortly after. 
When there is not enough staff in a prison, functions like security counts are neglected. Gangs and violent individuals take advantage of these security gaps. 
Deputy Corrections Commissioner Nathan Blevins told lawmakers in September that about 30% of the funded corrections officer positions were vacant. 
“No prison can operate safely with that kind of staffing,” said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project.
4. Investigations into prison killings are shrouded in secrecy.
Families are often left without answers. When they did get answers, they typically learned details about their loved ones’ deaths through a whisper network of incarcerated people, insiders, advocates, and, in some cases, from journalists. Family members report little communication with state prison officials. 
Mississippi’s public records law also makes it difficult to find out what happened. The Mississippi Public Records Act exempts law enforcement investigative documents. It is up to the law enforcement agency — in this case, the Department of Corrections — to decide if a document is investigative. MDOC officials used this exemption broadly throughout our investigation, but reporters were able to obtain information through other sources.  
5. Official accountability is elusive. The federal government and other states enacted more oversight. 
Mississippi prison death investigations are handled internally. The corrections department ultimately decides whether to pass its investigation to the local district attorney’s office for prosecution. 
An individual who kills another incarcerated person can either be held accountable through a criminal charge or an internal prison write-up called a rule violation report. Often, they receive neither. Of the 42 homicides examined in our investigation, just eight cases led to suspects pleading guilty in criminal court. A few received a rule violation that led to a loss of privileges, including the use of the phone and buying items from the commissary. 
Outside of the prison system, there is scant oversight to hold corrections officials accountable for misconduct, root out corruption and investigate allegations of abuse. In some states, there are independent oversight bodies or officials who handle these tasks.
For example, Virginia created an ombudsman’s office to inspect its prisons and investigate complaints. The office received more than 500 complaints from June through August last year, which included excessive force, prolonged isolation and delayed medical care. 
New York’s prisons are monitored by an independent agency. The Correctional Association of New York conducts inspections and interviews with incarcerated people and prison staff. The organization publishes reports and maintains a public dashboard with data on staffing, deaths, suicide attempts and more. 
In 2024, the Federal Prison Oversight Act was enacted, creating an ombudsman office and granting the Justice Department’s inspector general office authority to inspect federal prisons. The legislation comes after investigations found rampant sexual abuse, preventable deaths and neglect in federal prisons. 
In Mississippi, the Legislature established a Corrections and Criminal Justice Oversight Task Force in 2014, but it has virtually no authority, said André de Gruy, the state public defender and a task force member. The task force offers criminal justice policy recommendations to the Legislature that are focused on reducing the prison population.
De Gruy said he often receives calls from former clients and their family members about the dangers in prison.
“Not everybody has that ability to call and have a connection to somebody who can actually look into something, and put (it) on the commissioner’s radar,” he said. 
He proposed the creation of an ombudsman’s office for Mississippi, similar to those for Virginia and federal prisons. 
Victims’ families in Mississippi have also sued the prisons. However, such cases are difficult to win, civil rights lawyers said. There are legal protections like qualified immunity, which can shield officials from being held responsible for the deaths.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09160431/260113_JAC-MS-PRISONS-5-TAKEAWAYS-v2.jpg,,,2026-01-13 06:12:28.055757

(Getty Images)The federal government has drastically scaled back the number of recommended childhood immunizations, sidelining six routine vaccines that have safeguarded millions from serious diseases, long-term disability, and death.
Just three of the six immunizations the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it will no longer routinely recommend — against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rotavirus — have prevented nearly 2 million hospitalizations and more than 90,000 deaths in the past 30 years, according to the CDC’s own publications.
Vaccines against the three diseases, as well as those against respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease, flu, and covid, are now recommended only for children at high risk of serious illness or after “shared clinical decision-making,” or consultation between doctors and parents.
The CDC maintained its recommendations for 11 childhood vaccines: measles, mumps, and rubella; whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria; the bacterial disease known as Hib; pneumonia; polio; chickenpox; and human papillomavirus, or HPV.
Federal and private insurance will still cover vaccines for the diseases the CDC no longer recommends universally, according to a Department of Health and Human Services fact sheet; parents who want to vaccinate their children against those diseases will not have to pay out-of-pocket.
Experts on childhood disease were baffled by the change in guidance. HHS said the changes followed “a scientific review of the underlying science” and were in line with vaccination programs in other developed nations.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, pointed to Denmark as a model. But the schedules of most European countries are closer to the U.S. standard upended by the new guidance.
For example, Denmark, which does not vaccinate against rotavirus, registers around 1,200 infant and toddler rotavirus hospitalizations a year. That rate, in a country of 6 million, is about the same as it was in the United States before vaccination.
“They’re OK with having 1,200 or 1,300 hospitalized kids, which is the tip of the iceberg in terms of childhood suffering,” said Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a licensed rotavirus vaccine. “We weren’t. They should be trying to emulate us, not the other way around.”
Public health officials say the new guidance puts the onus on parents to research and understand each childhood vaccine and why it is important.
Here’s a rundown of the diseases the sidelined vaccines prevent:
RSV. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants in the U.S.
The respiratory virus usually spreads in fall and winter and produces cold-like symptoms, though it can be deadly for young children, causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths a year. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, roughly 80% of children younger than 2 who are hospitalized with RSV have no identifiable risk factors. Long-awaited vaccines against the disease were introduced in 2023.
Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccination, which was phased in beginning in the late 1990s and recommended for all toddlers starting in 2006, has led to a more than 90% drop in the disease since 1996. The foodborne virus, which causes a wretched illness, continues to plague adults, particularly people who are homeless or who abuse drugs or alcohol, with a total of 1,648 cases and 85 deaths reported in 2023.
Hepatitis B. The disease causes liver cancer, cirrhosis, and other serious illnesses and is particularly dangerous when contracted by babies and young children. The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and can survive on surfaces for a week. From 1990 to 2019, vaccination resulted in a 99% decline in reported cases of acute hepatitis B among children and teens. Liver cancer among American children has also plummeted as a result of universal childhood vaccination. But the hepatitis B virus is still around, with 2,000-3,000 acute cases reported annually among unvaccinated adults. More than 17,000 chronic hepatitis B diagnoses were reported in 2023. The CDC estimates about half of people infected don’t know they have it.
Rotavirus. Before routine administration of the current rotavirus vaccines began in 2006, about 70,000 young children were hospitalized and 50 died every year from the virus. It was known as “winter vomiting syndrome,” said Sean O’Leary, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado. “It was a miserable disease that we hardly see anymore.”
The virus is still common on surfaces that babies touch, however, and “if you lower immunization rates it will once again hospitalize children,” Offit said.
Meningococcal disease. Vaccines have been required mainly for teenagers and college students, who are notably vulnerable to critical illness caused by the bacteria. About 600 to 1,000 cases of meningococcal disease are reported in the U.S. each year, but it kills more than 10% of those it sickens, and 1 in 5 survivors have permanent disabilities.
Flu and covid. The two respiratory viruses have each killed hundreds of children in recent years — though both tend to be much more severe in older adults. Flu is currently on the upswing in the United States, and last flu season the virus killed 289 children.
What is shared clinical decision-making?
Under the changes, decisions about vaccinating children against influenza, covid, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, and hepatitis A and B will now rely on what officials call “shared clinical decision-making,” meaning families will have to consult with a health care provider to determine whether a vaccine is appropriate.
“It means a provider should have a conversation with the patient to lay out the risks and the benefits and make a decision for that individual person,” said Lori Handy, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
In the past, the CDC used that term only in reference to narrow circumstances, like whether a person in a monogamous relationship needed the HPV vaccine, which prevents a sexually transmitted infection and certain cancers.
The CDC’s new approach doesn’t line up with the science because of the proven protective benefit the vaccines have for the vast majority of the population, Handy said.
In their report justifying the changes, HHS officials Tracy Beth Høeg and Martin Kulldorff said the U.S. vaccination system requires more safety research and more parental choice. Eroding trust in public health caused in part by an overly large vaccine schedule had led more parents to shun vaccination against major threats like measles, they said.
The vaccines on the schedule that the CDC has altered were backed up by extensive safety research when they were evaluated and approved by the FDA.
“They’re held to a safety standard higher than any other medical intervention that we have,” Handy said. “The value of routine recommendations is that it really helps the public understand that this has been vetted upside down and backwards in every which way.”
Eric Ball, a pediatrician in Orange County, California, said the change in guidance will cause more confusion among parents who think it means a vaccine’s safety is in question.
“It is critical for public health that recommendations for vaccines are very clear and concise,” Ball said. “Anything to muddy the water is just going to lead to more children getting sick.”
Ball said that instead of focusing on a child’s individual health needs, he often has to spend limited clinic time reassuring parents that vaccines are safe. A “shared clinical decision-making” status for a vaccine has no relationship to safety concerns, but parents may think it does.
HHS’ changes do not affect state vaccination laws and therefore should allow prudent medical practitioners to carry on as before, said Richard Hughes IV, an attorney and a George Washington University lecturer who is leading litigation against Kennedy over vaccine changes.
“You could expect that any pediatrician is going to follow sound evidence and recommend that their patients be vaccinated,” he said. The law protects providers who follow professional care guidelines, he said, and “RSV, meningococcal, and hepatitis remain serious health threats for children in this country.”

(Getty Images)As we transition from the glow of the Christmas tree and Hanukkah candles into the cold reality of a new tax year, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) tucked a little something extra into our financial stockings — a way to turn 2026 charitable giving into something extra for the causes we care about.
When the OBBBA emerged, debate first centered on its potential to weaken the safety net for vulnerable families. Those concerns remain valid. But the law also raises practical questions like “how can households use the available tax benefits beginning in 2026 to help backfill community services and nonprofit missions harmed by the OBBBA?”
The new Section 70424 advantage
Starting for the 2026 tax year, Section 70424 of the OBBBA allows individuals who claim the standard deduction to also deduct charitable contributions of up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers. By allowing everyday Kentuckians to claim charitable deductions without sacrificing the standard deduction, the OBBBA rewards community-minded giving in the same way it has long rewarded sophisticated tax planners. 
The result is a simpler, fairer system that empowers Kentucky’s teachers, tradespeople, factory workers and retirees to more easily support local causes, keep more of what they earn and play a direct role in strengthening communities we call home. It also moves charitable tax incentives beyond a system that long favored those with accountants tasked with finding the newest, trendiest tax shelters.

For a couple filing jointly in the 22% federal tax bracket, a $2,000 deduction results in about $440 in federal tax savings. Rather than directing those dollars through government programs, the deduction allows households to decide where their support goes. In practical terms, the OBBBA shifts some spending discretion from government to individuals, giving Kentuckians greater flexibility to support the causes and organizations they value most.
 Converting tax relief into civic insurance

By allowing Kentuckians to direct more of what they earn, the OBBBA shifts some power from Washington to households. Beginning January 2026, families can redirect a portion of their tax savings to “qualified organizations,” generally 501(c)(3) nonprofits, creating a form of civic insurance against federal budget reductions. Rather than government-directed spending, this approach allows private generosity to partially backfill or strengthen important services, ensuring that individuals and families, not just government, play a direct role in deciding which missions matter most. In Kentucky, here are some ideas how that choice can be put into practice:

Supporting food security: Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) shift the burden to local food pantries and church-based shelters like God’s Pantry, the Kentucky Food Action Network and the Kentucky Association of Food Banks. Small donations pooled across a community allow food banks to purchase in bulk and maintain operations precisely when demand for services is anticipated to rise.
Shoring up health care: Reductions in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funding create tighter margins for Kentucky’s nonprofit hospitals and rural health clinics. Kentucky taxpayers can help sustain the health care safety net for the uninsured. Organizations like the Kentucky Rural Health Association, the Kentucky Primary Care Association and ARH Foundation for Healthier Communities would certainly welcome the added charitable support, especially given the current environment where the amount of federal support is uncertain.
Sustaining independent media: As the OBBBA renders federal support for public broadcasting more vulnerable and local newsrooms shrink, supporting entities like Kentucky Educational Television (KET), local NPR stations (such as Louisville Public Media, WEKU in Richmond or WKMS in Murray), and nonprofit news outlets like the Kentucky Lantern ensures that educational programming and nonpartisan statehouse reporting continue outside of federal funding cutbacks and corporate media consolidation.

A cultural shift toward generosity
The OBBBA, despite its valid criticisms, encourages a culture of charitable giving rooted in the libertarian idea promoted by economist Milton Friedman that lasting social progress comes from voluntary exchange rather than government mandate. 
By also establishing a minimum threshold for high-income itemizers, the OBBBA ends a longstanding imbalance in which the wealthy received tax benefits for modest contributions relative to working families who received none for their sacrifice. The result is a more level playing field, one that allows households of modest means to support the causes closest to them while accessing deductions once reserved almost exclusively for the wealthy.
Perhaps the most significant practical benefit, the deduction offered in the OBBBA allows individuals to claim charitable gifts of up to $1,000 for individuals or $2,000 for joint filers without having to give up the standard deduction. For the first time, families can support their communities with benefits previously available only to those who itemized their deductions and still enjoy the simplicity and tax advantages of the standard deduction. 
The 70424 provision turns individual tax relief into a form of civic insurance: year-end bonuses, holiday gifts or even personal savings can be directed to civic-minded nonprofits, helping backfill gaps from federal retrenchment and ensuring that Kentucky’s communities remain strong long after the holiday decorations are stored.

(Thomas Cooper/Special to Colorado Newsline)2026 is a big year for Colorado voters. The midterms will require Coloradans to weigh in on a new governor and a U.S. senate seat, in addition to 20 state Senate elections and the usual U.S. and state House of Representative elections.
Messaging from all candidates — especially Democrats — is increasingly focused on affordability, leaving some issues, like climate change, in the dust. Yet political candidates that neglect to include climate change in their messaging and policy platforms are making a mistake.
Affordability and climate change are inherently and intimately bound; climate issues are kitchen table issues and Colorado’s 2026 candidates should not forget it.

There is no topic more fitting for the kitchen table than food. According to a Politico poll, the rising cost of groceries is more concerning to Americans than even housing and health care. And for good reason: In the past five years grocery prices have increased by an estimated 25% to 29%, a price hike that low- and middle-income Coloradans feel acutely. And while there are a medley of reasons that food prices are rising (inflation, bird flu, corporate consolidation, the Trump administration’s tariffs), climate change is a leading cause.
Affordable food prices depend upon consistent food production, which is exactly what is at stake as the climate warms and erratic weather like droughts, floods, freezes, heat waves and hurricanes become more common. In 2024 alone, extreme weather events in the U.S. caused $20.3 billion of losses for farmers. Climate change is expensive for farmers and consumers.
 Extreme wildfires
It’s widely known that climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires by exacerbating droughts and lengthening the fire season. Twenty of Colorado’s largest wildfires ever recorded have occurred since 2001. And these wildfires don’t just pollute the air and traumatize nearby residents — they impact many Coloradans by driving up home insurance prices.
Between 2018 and 2023, Colorado’s home insurance premiums increased by 58%, elevating the state to the unfortunate rank of No. 6 in the country in terms of the most expensive home insurance market. In an already undersupplied housing market, in an economy with chronic inflation, climate change’s impact on the cost of owning or renting a home only adds fuel to the fire.
Energy bills are another classic kitchen table issue interconnected with climate change. The greater temperature extremes arising from climate change force consumers to use more energy to cool and heat their homes. Beyond that, utility providers increase energy rates when they have to make large investments — such as upgrades to make their infrastructure less likely to spark wildfires on dry, windy days.
Climate change creates dozens of other direct and indirect burdens on society that taxpayers must bear. Wildfires and air pollution exacerbate and cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, leading to higher health care costs that eventually impact insurance premiums. Extreme disasters and heatwaves lead to fatalities and expensive infrastructure damage. A study by the World Economic Forum estimates that climate change will cost the world between $1.7 trillion and $3.1 trillion per year until 2050, considering damages to infrastructure, property, agriculture and human health. Another study estimates that damages from climate change will cost the global economy $38 trillion per year.
 Cheaper energy
Common sense solutions to mitigate the cost of climate change deserve the attention of Colorado’s aspiring lawmakers. For example, renewable energy sources are cheaper over their lifetime compared to natural gas and are getting cheaper each year. Supporting and speeding the state’s transition to renewables will pay off for consumers in Colorado, much as it did for Texans: Between 2010 and 2022, wholesale electricity costs decreased in Texas cumulatively by $27.8 billion due to the production of wind and solar energy. Similarly, helping consumers electrify their vehicles and appliances will decrease individual energy costs in the long-term.
Supporting Colorado’s local food systems, including local distribution and processing centers, can undermine corporate consolidation that prevents price competition. A stronger local food system could also protect consumers from volatile grocery prices by eliminating reliance on global supply chains vulnerable to natural disasters.
There are also many strategies that can benefit communities and the climate while also mitigating the costs of climate change. Conserving old-growth forests and wetlands can safeguard carbon sinks while also providing natural resiliency to floods and wildfires. Urban design that prioritizes trees, parks, bike lanes and pedestrian access not only encourages car-free transit but also lessens the intensity of heatwaves, improves air quality, and beautifies neighborhoods.
Many Americans already understand that climate change is a kitchen-table issue. Climate change costs Coloradans money, but decisive action can reduce the harm and cut some costs drastically. As the midterms creep nearer, voters should recognize that any candidate ignoring climate change is leaving one of the best policy frameworks for achieving affordability on the (kitchen) table.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)As state lawmakers trek to Richmond for the 2026 General Assembly session that begins Wednesday, some state senators sought more answers from the University of Virginia at a hearing on Monday. 
The hearing, hosted by the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee’s Education Subcommittee, built on a December meeting with the institution’s leadership about the governing board’s search for a new president and its decision to sign a controversial agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The DOJ agreement and the naming of Scott Beardsley as the institution’s new president last month capped a tumultuous year for UVA, which, along with other colleges, faced public scrutiny over their leadership boards after Senate leaders rejected several of outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointees. Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger had urged UVA to hold off selecting a president until she took office and all board vacancies could be filled.
Monday’s discussions were held ahead of the General Assembly Session so the subcommittee could better understand the UVA board’s decision-making process and address concerns raised by state leaders.
Rector Rachel Sheridan told lawmakers Monday that waiting for the full complement of the board to be filled before selecting a new president would have taken too much time, as the board was also balancing calls for the institution to have stability and leadership.
“Our view is that the board needs to act in the best interest of the university, and every decision that we have made, the board has tried to act in the best interest of the university,” said Sheridan. “Whether that was under Rector Hardy’s leadership or under mine. I truly believe that the board and every individual have operated in the best interest of the university.” 
Sheridan said with that reasoning in mind, the board ultimately decided to hire Beardsley as the institution’s 10th president. who also attended the subcommittee hearing. Beardsley, who also attended the subcommittee hearing, is the former dean of the UVA Darden School of Business and his tenure there was defined by record academic rankings, expanding student access, and strengthening faculty excellence, the university stated.
In November, Spanberger also said the board members “severely undermined” public confidence in their abilities amid the DOJ agreement. Lawmakers, UVA faculty, and community organizations echoed her sentiments.
In April, the DOJ claimed UVA’s admissions, hiring, diversity, equity and inclusion programs violated federal civil rights laws and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students. The federal government’s investigations, seven in total at UVA, were part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to align colleges and universities with its views and to crack down on DEI policies on campuses nationwide. UVA leaders refuted the claims but in October signed an agreement with the federal agency to suspend the probes.
The subcommittee questioned Sheridan on the institution’s decision to enter into the agreement amid concerns by some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, that alumni and faculty opposed it and said it opened the school up to legal liability, conflicted with existing law, and infringed on state sovereignty. Two of the seven civil rights investigations were closed as of Dec. 1, 2025. 
Sheridan pointed to a December testimony by then-interim president Paul Mahoney, who said the agreement suspended costly and disruptive investigations and preserved institutional autonomy and academic freedom. Mahoney called the DOJ agreement the “best option available to us.”
UVA interim president to senators: Agreement with DOJ to pause probes was ‘best option available’

“I do think that the agreement with the DOJ was very fully explained to the committee,” Sheridan said. “If it’s necessary to discuss it again, the interim president would be the best person to do that. He negotiated that agreement. The board does not approve settlement agreements or litigation settlement agreements, but we were aware and supportive of the decision to enter into the agreement.”
The DOJ investigations also prompted the departure of the university’s former president Jim Ryan, who resigned in June..
Ryan wrote in November that Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the DOJ and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to resign.
Senators asked Sheridan if she agreed with Ryan, noting possible differences. Sheridan neither disputed nor endorsed Ryan’s account, focusing instead on her own memory of the proceedings and a forward-looking approach.
“I’m only going to comment on my recollection of events,” Sheridan said. “I have not now, nor will I ever say anything about Jim Ryan’s recollection of events. Those are his recollections of events. They’re not mine, and … I think that the tone of this conversation … is about how UVA needs to move forward. And at this juncture, I’m not going to have a ‘he said, she said,’ over what Jim Ryan put in the letter.”
On Monday, Democratic senators expressed concern that the governing board and the institution must demonstrate a genuine commitment to fostering a diverse and equitable campus culture amid legal and political pressures. Additionally, they urged the board and institution to rebuild trust with the UVA community after recent events.
“We will continue to aspire to be the best public university in the country, and to be all about excellence and to deliver the best we can,” Beardsley responded to the subcommittee.
Presidents Gregory Washington from George Mason University and Michael Rao from the Virginia Commonwealth Institute were also in attendance to address the subcommittee on similar challenges and priorities at their respective universities, including funding, student diversity and sustaining institutional success. 
Over the next few months, lawmakers will discuss higher education funding in Virginia to address costs for students and institutions.
The General Assembly is also expected to consider changing how governors appoint members to public college and university boards in Virginia, a matter that reached the Supreme Court, and Spanberger is expected to fill several board vacancies after taking office on Saturday.

(Photo by Evan Visconti/Virginia Mercury) President Donald Trump’s administration has set in motion efforts to repeal the Roadless Rule, a 2001 administrative mandate that put 45 million acres of the least developed forest land under protection from logging and construction of roads. As the nation observes the rule’s 25th anniversary, Virginia’s federal lawmakers and advocates are calling for its preservation and say hundreds of thousands of acres of forests could be at stake if it is axed.   
The federal government has framed the proposed repeal as necessary for forest management against wildfires.
“This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation’s forests. It is abundantly clear that properly managing our forests preserves them from devastating fires and allows future generations of Americans to enjoy and reap the benefits of this great land,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a June meeting of the Western Governors’ Association when the proposed rule change was announced.

Environmental advocates have said since last summer that repealing the rule will lead to land degradation, sediment pollution, and create risks to clean water sources. It would also open up large swaths of the 400,000 acres of the protected forestland in Virginia to logging and potential new roads.
“The Forest Service is ignoring the fact that most wildfires are caused by humans and start within 50 yards of a road,” said Sarah Francisco, director of the Virginia office of the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Roadless Rule protects national forests from being developed in an effort to maintain clean water, habitats, recreation and old-growth forests. Virginia has a total of 1.6 million acres in the National Forest System, while only a fraction is protected under the rule.
Hundreds of thousands of public comments have been posted since the proposed change was announced, the overwhelming majority of which oppose repeal.U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, and U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, are working to gather more public input to potentially stop the U.S. Forest Service from changing the rule – or bring legislation to codify the protections in law.
“They could undo 85% of that nearly 400,000 acres,” Kaine said in a press conference on Monday.
The senator, joined by McClellan and representatives from the Southern Environmental Law Center and Virginia Wilderness Committee, explained that the water that comes from the forests in the Shenandoah mountains, where the majority of Virginia’s protected forests are, is critical to clean water downstream of the Potomac and James Rivers.
“This administration will literally pave the way towards an increased oil and gas leasing, mining, and other harmful development that would cause us to lose what makes these protected lands so special,” McClellan said.
Members of the logging industry have viewed the Roadless Rule as an anti-logging regulation that they feel limits where the industry can work. Scott Dane, the Executive Director of the American Loggers Council, told the Virginia Mercury in June that more has to be done to maintain the health of the forests. However, the rule already has carve outs regarding forest and wildfire management. 
Kaine has been working to pass legislation to add more Virginia land to the Roadless Rule protections. He explained that the U.S. Senate will often package public lands bills together to be passed all at once, which has led to delays for his proposed legislation to advance. 
But with U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina retiring at the end of the year, who also has proposed public lands legislation, Kaine hopes they can move the bills forward as part of senate tradition to honor retiring lawmaker’s legislative goals.
When Kaine was lieutenant governor and then governor of Virginia, the Roadless Rule faced challenges from the Bush Administration that were ultimately fought off in court. 
Portions of the protected lands across the country that haven’t been given additional congressional safeguards would be at risk for development, should the Forest Service finalize the repeal of the rule. Kaine said that Congress can either pass legislation to codify the protections for all 45 million acres, which would hinder the administration from repealing or changing the rule without an act of Congress, or lawmakers can demand a congressional review  to challenge the rule change.

Virginia joins Chesapeake Bay states, D.C. in new watershed agreement

In December, Virginia, five other states, Washington, D.C., and federal leaders committed to an update of one of the most influential drivers of policy across our region: the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Now the new Spanberger administration and General Assembly have a golden opportunity to make a lasting impact on the livability of our communities, Virginia’s economy and our quality of life.
The agreement guides an unparalleled federal-state effort to clean up the Chesapeake Bay over the next 15 years. But its impact reaches beyond the Bay. It is an effective tool to advance climate resilience, conserve farmland and forests, upgrade infrastructure, manage valuable fisheries and reduce pollution in rivers and streams. 
These are not only environmental issues, but cost of living and quality of life issues, too. 
Industries ranging from tourism to seafood to outdoor recreation are vital to Virginia’s economy. They all depend on clean water. The closure of beaches and rivers, or the loss of shellfish harvests to pollution, have real costs to businesses. 
Furthermore, as we saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the rising costs to both lives and livelihoods from intensifying flooding and storm damage are undeniable. 
The solutions to these problems are not radical, but they do require forward thinking. With smart decisions and investments now, policymakers can set Virginia on a path to not only meet the commitments it made in the Bay Agreement, but also lay the foundation for a more prosperous future for all Virginians.
One of the first ways leaders can make an impact is by ramping up programs that have already demonstrated success and promise the greatest return on investment. 
In 2025, Virginia celebrated the completion of oyster habitat restoration in six rivers, part of one of the largest oyster restoration projects in the world — exceeding goals of the previous Bay Agreement. By funding a long-overdue oyster stock assessment, Virginia will have the knowledge to build on this success, optimize its oyster recovery efforts and aid the growth of the oyster industry.  
Similarly, Virginia should increase funding for the Virginia Conservation Assistance Program. This program has shown success again and again, supporting private property owners, schools, and community organizations in installing nature-based projects that reduce stormwater pollution — one of the biggest challenges to improving our rivers and streams.  
At the same time, promising initiatives like the Pay-for-Outcomes program are ready to scale up. By incentivizing innovation and only paying for results, the program means taxpayers are getting guaranteed reductions in water pollution for their money. And it’s popular; in its first year, demand outpaced allocated funding by nearly six to one, according to data from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. 
This session, legislators should also support proactive policies that save the commonwealth money by investing in the future. 
First, they can ensure Virginia rejoins the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Not only does this multi-state program help combat climate change, it also generates funding for energy efficiency projects that alleviate electric costs for vulnerable Virginians. Critically, it also pays for projects that protect homes and businesses from flooding. 
Getting these funds flowing again as soon as possible is essential for Virginia’s economy. According to a recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, every $1 not invested in resilience today can cost communities up to $33 in lost economic activity down the road. As the federal government pulls back support for climate resilience and disaster relief programs, state action is even more urgent. 
Policymakers can also protect our most cost-effective buffers against storms, pollution, and heat: our trees and wetlands. Virginia is losing both at alarming rates. Identifying and protecting corridors where wetlands can migrate to avoid rising sea levels, and giving local governments the authority to protect their tree canopy, are two basic steps to begin reversing these trends.
Bills that change how localities can conserve trees amid development await Youngkin’s approval

Finally, legislators can make a true investment in Virginia’s future prosperity by increasing environmental education opportunities statewide. Not only will this help equip students with the critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that are necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing economy, it will also help Virginia address the complex environmental challenges of the 21st century. 
There’s an old adage that the best time to plant a tree was yesterday; the next best time is today. By enacting forward-thinking policies and smart investments now, Virginia’s leaders will put us on a path to not only meet environmental commitments, but also plant the proverbial trees that will bear fruit for all Virginians long into the future.

(Photo by Scott Housley/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)New federal guidance to reduce the number of vaccines recommended for all children from 17 vaccines down to 11 comes as states already are charting their own courses on vaccine policy.
The new federal guidelines mention a directive issued by President Donald Trump in December calling to align the U.S. vaccination schedule with “peer” countries, including Denmark, that recommend fewer childhood vaccines — even though those countries provide more robust government-funded health systems.
At stake are requirements for attending public schools, where most states have seen lower vaccination rates since the pandemic, as well as insurance coverage that makes vaccines affordable. At least 17 states have announced they will disregard the new federal guidance.
Many have created formal alliances to share health information. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative, composed of Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York state, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and New York City, announced Monday it will continue following guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics.











Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake.


– Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on infectious diseases



“The science is clear. Vaccines remain the best protection for keeping children and communities healthy,” the collaborative said in its announcement. “The vast majority of American adults and parents believe routine childhood vaccines are important for public health.”
The American Academy of Pediatrics held a news conference this month to denounce the changed recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the association’s committee on infectious diseases, said at the Jan. 5 event. “There’s no evidence that skipping or delaying certain vaccines is beneficial for U.S. children. What we do know is that whenever children go without recommended vaccinations, they’re at risk for these diseases that we can prevent.”
And governors of 14 states have formed another alliance to share public health information, including on vaccines. The updated CDC guidance “creates confusion and introduces unnecessary barriers for families who want to protect their children from serious illness,” said the Governors Public Health Alliance in its Jan. 6 news release. The governors are all Democrats, though the group says it is nonpartisan.
New Jersey moves
One of the states rejecting federal guidelines is New Jersey.
Jeffrey Brown, the acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, issued an executive order in December opting to keep older federal recommendations for a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, despite changes in federal guidelines from the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Brown also urged state lawmakers to pass a bill formally decoupling state recommendations from federal rules on Jan. 5, the same day the new federal guidelines were released. The legislation would allow independent action on vaccines without such orders and would also require insurers to cover the vaccines, Brown said.
States break with FDA restrictions on COVID vaccines, ensuring broader access

The legislation “makes it very clear that the department of health can rely on expert bodies outside the ACIP when making vaccine recommendations that make sense for public health,” Brown said in his testimony before the Assembly health committee.
Novneet Sahu, the state’s deputy health commissioner, also testified and said federal changes reflect a dangerous “adoption of conspiracies and conjecture” about vaccines.
“When federal leaders fail and misinformation spreads, state policies and practices must empower New Jerseyans to receive accurate, evidence-based information about infection disease prevention tools like vaccines,” Sahu testified.
The bill, which passed in the state Senate in December, was approved by the committee in a 6-3 vote. The bill was passed by the state Assembly Jan. 12 and now heads to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk.
One of the “no” votes in the health committee was Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, who said at the hearing that he distrusts the state health department because of decisions about nursing homes during the pandemic.
“You have a lot of derogatory things to say about the federal government. But some of us have no faith in the health department here in the state of New Jersey,” Peterson said.
Changes elsewhere
Similar changes to vaccination policy are happening this year in the 23 states and the District of Columbia where vaccine recommendations that govern schools are tied to federal guidelines, said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The association is tracking the new and proposed changes in 14 states and the district.
Many are setting up their own advisory committees or task forces to make vaccine recommendations. In many states, the guidelines are tied to school vaccination requirements, insurance coverage of vaccinations and rules allowing pharmacists to give vaccinations.
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Brown, the New Jersey acting health commissioner, said in his testimony that insurance requirements are an important part of the state’s bill, saying it “would make sure that people can continue to get reimbursed for vaccines even if ACIP [the federal advisory committee] removes vaccines from the schedule or changes those recommendations.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in its announcement, said there would be no changes in insurance coverage for any of the vaccines, even though some are no longer recommended for all children.
AHIP, a health insurance trade group, said there had been no coverage changes and that all vaccines recommended as of September would be covered at least until the end of this year.
Florida has held public hearings on Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposal to remove a requirement that children receive the hepatitis B, varicella (chickenpox) and haemophilus influenza B (Hib) vaccines in order to attend public school.
In Louisiana, there was an unannounced policy change in 2024, forbidding health workers from holding vaccination events or promoting COVID-19, flu or mpox vaccinations. That has made it hard for mothers like Crystal Rommen, director of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, an advocacy group that supports timely vaccinations.
Rommen said she had to organize other mothers of small children this year to make sure they got a COVID-19 vaccine.
“We have these policies that create more hesitation or doubt for parents,” said Rommen, a social worker with a 10-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter. “I rallied my mom friends together, got a list of parents and children that wanted their child to get the COVID vaccine before my pediatrician could justify ordering enough doses. I’m kind of a bulldog. I’m gung-ho.”
The new federal guidelines continue to suggest 11 vaccines for all children, including measles, mumps and chickenpox. In announcing the guidelines, the CDC said reducing vaccinations aligns with “international consensus” while “strengthening transparency and informed consent.”
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

But experts said Denmark is not the right model for American policy.
Denmark has fewer undetected cases of some diseases, partly because of more access to health care and testing, so vaccinating large numbers of children doesn’t always make sense, a Danish specialist told Science magazine in a Jan. 7 article.
“The United States is not Denmark, and there is no reason to impose the Danish immunization schedule on America’s families,” Dr. Andrew Racine, president of the AAP, said in a statement.
The new guidelines have “more flexibility and choice” for six vaccines, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said, recommending them only for high-risk groups or for “shared clinical decision-making” rather than for all children: rotavirus, COVID-19, influenza, hepatitis A and B, and meningococcal disease.
That term means that doctors and parents should decide together, but it has caused confusion and reduced use in the past when applied to COVID-19 vaccines for all ages, according to a University of Pennsylvania survey.
“Expecting parents to engage in shared decision-making with health care providers about routine, thoroughly studied childhood vaccinations suggests that the public health community has doubts about the safety and efficacy of these vaccines when it does not,” said Patrick E. Jamieson, director of the university’s Annenberg Health and Risk Communication Institute in a statement.

Gov. Mandela Barnes (left) and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley (right) in a post to X on Monday. The Republican Party of Wisconsin mixed up the two Black Democratic candidates for governor in a social media post on Monday before deleting and reposting it.
Wisconsin’s open race for governor has led to a crowded Democratic field in the primary, and the state’s Republican party sought on Monday to call out two of those candidates by name in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. 
“[State Rep.] Francesca Hong, [former Lt. Gov.] Mandela Barnes, and other radical progressives are trying to destroy our state. From wanting to defund police, raise property taxes, and bring socialism to Wisconsin, it is clear that they are out of touch with the needs of Wisconsin families,” the post states. 
However, the initial post made by the party included a graphic of Hong and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, not Barnes. A screenshot of the original post was posted by Civic Media Political Editor Dan Shafer on X.
Crowley is the first Black person to serve as Milwaukee County executive and Barnes, a former candidate for the U.S. Senate, served as the first Black lieutenant governor in the state of Wisconsin. The two Democrats are the only Black candidates in Wisconsin’s race for governor. There are no Black candidates in the Republican field.

That’s not Mandela Barnes… pic.twitter.com/Rqxj1NBvZE

The post was pulled down and reposted with a photo of Barnes in the graphic alongside Hong, who is the only Asian American in the race.

Henry McMaster releases his 2026-27 budget recommendations at the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday, Jan. 11, 2026. (Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Raising teachers’ salaries by $2,000, ensuring all students can eat breakfast for free, and expanding 4-year-olds’ access to full-day kindergarten are among Gov. Henry McMaster’s recommendations for the 2026-27 budget.
The $14 billion proposal he released Monday marks the last of his 10-year tenure. The 2026 session that kicks off Tuesday marks his final chance to persuade the Legislature to meet his longstanding funding goals, continue priorities they’ve approved in the past, and pass items they’ve ignored.
The governor’s executive budget is only a proposal. McMaster has had more success with his recommendations than previous GOP governors, largely because he works with legislators through the process.
The release of his entire plan came a week after he previewed requesting $1.1 billion in additional money for roadwork to counteract inflation that’s driving up construction prices.
SC governor asks legislators to spend $1.1B more on roadwork as inflation drives up costs

The additional $150 million he suggests putting toward teacher salaries would set the pay floor statewide at $50,500 for teachers’ first year in the classroom. Four years ago, he set a goal of reaching $50,000 by 2026.
“Well, it’s 2026 now, and we’re almost there,” said the Republican governor, noting teachers’ minimum starting pay was $30,113 when he took office in January 2017.
An additional $2,000 boost this year would represent a 68% increase over a decade. The governor’s recommendation would boost state-funded minimums by $2,000 across the so-called teacher salary schedule, which pays teachers according to their years in the classroom and level of college degree.
Most school districts use local property taxes to pay more. Charleston County pays the most, with teachers there starting at nearly $67,400 this school year, followed by Beaufort County, where the salary floor is about $60,100. On average, the minimum starting pay across all districts is already $50,430, according to an analysis of districts’ salary schedules.
Under the increased flexibility that legislators gave local officials several years ago, only the 21 school districts that pay the minimums would be required to increase salaries by the full $2,000. The other school districts could use their share of state aid however they choose, but districts generally have used it to keep boosting their pay scales higher as they compete for teachers.
Free breakfast
McMaster pointed to Arkansas in pitching another recommendation: Last year, that GOP state began providing free breakfast for all K-12 children in public schools, regardless of their parents’ income.
South Carolina should too. Children who start their school day with a meal can better concentrate and pay attention in class, McMaster said.
Roughly 60% of South Carolina’s public school students live in poverty. Many schools already offer free meals to all students under a federal program.
Extending that to every school for breakfasts only — not lunches — is expected to cost $8.7 million, according to the state’s fiscal experts.
Since 2018, legislators have encouraged participation in the federal program for universal cafeteria meals but balked at using state taxes to close any gaps.
McMaster would eventually like for lunches to be free too. But his office did not have estimates on that cost.
Asked about Republicans’ prior opposition to the idea, he said, “We’re trying to fill their minds. We ought to fill their bellies so we can fill their minds more easily.”
Universal 4K
The GOP governor said the state should also make full-day preschool available to all 4-year-olds regardless of their parents’ income.
“We should go to universal. We will one day. I think it’s just a matter of time,” he told reporters. “The more you help the younger children, the more you help them up to where they can learn, the better they’ll be. I’m hoping it won’t be long before 4K is universal.”
But completing that goal would have to come under a future governor. His budget recommends spending $10 million to expand access in private preschools to the children of parents making up to 300% of the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that’s $96,450, according to the latest federal guidelines.
His proposal comes 20 years after the Legislature created a state-paid, full-day program for 4-year-olds in response to a Circuit Court ruling that the state did not do enough to help poor children succeed. Legislators initially limited the program to at-risk children in districts that sued the state 13 years earlier. Eligibility wasn’t expanded statewide until 2021, though legislators didn’t require school districts to participate.
In South Carolina’s dual 4K system, the state Department of Education oversees public school programs, while First Steps — a separate agency tasked with preparing children for school — oversees state-paid classes in approved, private schools and child care centers. Parents can choose either option, where slots are available.
This year, 18,411 children are enrolled statewide, a 30% increase since 2021. Just one district, Greenville County, continues to opt out, according to the governor’s office.
Private centers have nearly 1,900 unfilled slots this year, according to First Steps. McMaster believes making more parents eligible for the program would fill them. The state’s education oversight agency would determine availability in public schools.
“I believe that is the key to the future,” he said of the 4K program.
Other scholarships
Under his proposal, more students in kindergarten through college would also qualify for state-paid scholarships.
The law McMaster signed last year to reinstate K-12 scholarships for private tuition requires the Legislature to fund at least 15,000 slots for the upcoming school year. Both McMaster and state Superintendent Ellen Weaver recommend providing 20,000 scholarships instead, which would double this year’s enrollment cap and cost an additional $61.4 million.
The scholarship itself will rise from $7,500 this school year to $7,634 in 2026-27, as per the law’s required annual adjustments.
New additions in McMaster’s budget request include $15 million for Meeting Street Scholarships, expanding on a privately funded program started by Charleston businessman and philanthropist Ben Navarro. The state aid would not replace what he and other private donors have funded since 2020. Instead, more high-achieving, low-income students statewide could go to college for free, according to McMaster’s office.
The program provides each participating student up to $40,000 over four years to cover tuition, housing, food or other expenses not covered by federal Pell grants and other scholarships, allowing them to earn a degree without racking up debt.
College spending
For all in-state students, McMaster wants public colleges to keep tuition rates frozen for a seventh consecutive year. His budget recommendation would collectively provide an additional $39.2 million in exchange for that guarantee. His office’s formula for divvying out that money rewards colleges with higher numbers of South Carolina high school graduates.
Last year, college presidents sought permission to raise tuition through a staggered system that would keep rates steady for students while they’re in college, while allowing rates to increase with each freshman class. McMaster promised to veto the idea, and legislators squashed it.
$2.3B more sought by SC colleges includes extraterrestrial request

“We have to educate our young people and college tuition is getting so high, some can’t go,” he told reporters.
As for college construction requests, McMaster recommends providing $115 million to the Medical University of South Carolina for a top-tier cancer hospital. That’s about a third of what the college is asking for the project.
MUSC estimates that new cancer cases in South Carolina adults will rise 18% between 2023 and 2028, then jump by 30% over the next 15 years.
“That’s a lot of cancer. That’s a lot of worry,” McMaster said. “If you catch it quickly, it’s better. Everyone, don’t forget to have your checkups regularly.”
The hospital will “deliver best-in-class cancer care and cutting-edge clinical trials for all South Carolinians,” reads his executive budget.
That’s the only specific college construction project his budget would fund. All colleges and universities would get a share of $82 million for maintenance, renovations or new builds. Technical colleges would split $40 million total. Each college would decide how to spend their share.
McMaster renewed his request for a study of South Carolina’s 33 two- and four-year public colleges. He wants the state’s employment agency to contract an independent analysis of the state’s higher education system. Legislators have ignored that request since he first recommended it in 2024.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Weeks before a lawsuit against a recent New Hampshire voting law goes to trial in federal court, state lawmakers are pushing to tighten voting requirements further.
The House passed a bill this month that would eliminate the ability for high school or college students to use their student identification cards to vote. Instead, under the proposed law, those students would be required to present an ID issued by the federal government or any U.S. state, such as a driver’s license, government ID card, or passport.
The Republican-led chamber also advanced legislation to end the ability for local election officials to personally identify voters they know and allow them to vote without identification.
The two bills — which will both need approval from the Senate — were passed on Jan. 7, the first day that lawmakers returned to the House after a monthslong break. And they highlighted an ongoing push by Republicans to impose no-excuses laws requiring proof of residency, citizenship, and identity in order to vote and register to vote in New Hampshire.
Rep. Ross Berry, a Weare Republican and the chairman of the House Election Law Committee, argued the state has made major strides toward building trust in elections through a series of recent laws requiring more documentation and verification to vote.
To Berry, the previous voting process — in which people could register without showing citizenship documents and could vote on Election Day without showing identification — was a “farce.” In both cases, voters were required to sign legally binding affidavits stating they were qualified to vote on penalty of perjury. But Berry said because their ballots were accepted after they signed the affidavits, the process left the possibility of fraud. 
“In order to have the general will of the people, you have to know who’s voting in your elections,” Berry said, addressing the House Wednesday. 
It’s a contention at the heart of the yearslong partisan war over elections. Democrats and voting rights groups say the instances of voter fraud are vanishingly small and that the affidavit system still allowed for the prosecution of illegal voters. Imposing stricter requirements, on the other hand, could bar otherwise eligible voters from being able to vote, impeding on their rights, they argue. 
The political fight has persisted through the recent passage of state laws requiring IDs at the polls with no exceptions, and mandating that people newly registering to vote in the state provide hard-copy proof of their U.S. citizenship via a birth certificate, passport, or other document.
That latter law, passed in 2024 under House Bill 1569, is the strongest proof-of-citizenship statute in the country, and is currently being challenged by a number of voting rights groups. Those groups, which include the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and the progressive Elias Group, allege that the laws are unconstitutional. A multi-week trial in that case is scheduled for February. 
Addressing House Bill 323, the legislation to bar student IDs as forms of identification, Democrats have denounced it as an unnecessary barrier to voting. Rep. James Newsom of Hopkinton dismissed concerns that people are using fraudulent student IDs to vote, noting that there have been no known examples in the state. 
Newsom argued that the process to obtain a student identification card from the University of New Hampshire — which requires fingerprints — is robust. 
“With zero cases of voter fraud of this type, this bill will not improve election security,” he said. “Zero minus zero is still zero.”
Instead, Newsom and other Democrats said the law would have the effect of turning away legitimate voters who live in New Hampshire from being able to vote in the state. And they have charged that Republicans are targeting students in college towns, which tend to vote for Democrats. 
“The reality behind this bill is a blatant attempt to unconstitutionally prohibit students who are already registered and qualified voters in New Hampshire from exercising their undeniable constitutional right to vote,” Newsom said. 
Berry and other Republicans reject the charge that the laws impose major barriers to vote, and compare the documentary requirements to those needed to drive a car. Berry argued all the recent stricter voting laws strike a balance between accountability and ease.
Republicans have made a mission of “trying to get to a system where it’s easy to vote and it’s actually not easy to cheat, and that you know who’s voting in your elections,” Berry argued. 
And he said it is necessary to ban student ID cards because it is too easy to forge student ID cards.
“This is kind of the last buttoning up of five years worth of work,” Berry said. Five Democrats joined Republicans to vote for the bill last week. 
House Republicans continued that effort by passing House Bill 317, which bars election officials from personally identifying voters. Republicans had argued the process was impossible to verify and was vulnerable to abuse; Democrats called it another “roadblock” to voting. 
“It is the classic bill that is a solution in search of a problem; it also takes a needless swipe at the integrity of our outstanding election officials,” wrote Rep. Gerald Ward, a Portsmouth Democrat, in a written argument ahead of the vote. 
One Republican effort fell short last week: an attempt to amend the New Hampshire Constitution to require that voters “actually reside” in their place of domicile to vote failed to get a three-fifths supermajority vote in the House necessary to advance. 
But as lawmakers hurtle into the 2026 session, the efforts to tighten voting laws are continuing. Lawmakers will consider Republican bills to prohibit voters who are legal residents of other states from registering to vote in New Hampshire; to allow the Secretary of State’s Office to conduct random audits of voters’ citizenship status; and to require stricter identification requirements for people voting by absentee ballot and for overseas voters. 
Not all proposals are partisan. Rep. Matt Wilhelm, a Manchester Democrat, and Berry are co-sponsoring House Bill 1600, which would allow New Hampshire residents to register to vote when renewing their driver’s license at the Division of Motor Vehicles. New Hampshire is one of a handful of states that do not provide that service; past efforts to pass it have run into opposition from Senate Republicans, who cite cost concerns.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nashuavoterID-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 05:11:48.687731

Without access to timely care, people’s mental health can worsen, said Becky Carroll, the study’s author and director of policy research and analysis at Health Policy Institute of Ohio.   
“We also did some focus groups with parents and caregivers of children needing mental health services and just asked about their experiences and some of them talked about wait lists two years long to get into a certain provider,” she said. “It’s problematic and it’s widespread.” 
But there’s no data to show where those wait lists are the longest, Carroll said. 
There are only 11 facilities in Ohio that offer youth inpatient services, according to the study.
“Eleven around the state is just really not many, and when the workforce gets more specialized, the provider has to be more specialized,” Carroll said. “It makes sense that as you get more and more specialized, there are fewer providers that can provide that care.” 
There are 53 counties that do not have a child psychiatrist and only seven counties had more than 10, according to the study. 
Ohio had 365 child and adolescent psychiatrists in 2024, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. 
Ohio had a 353% surge in demand for behavioral health services from 2013 to 2019, but the behavioral health workforce expanded only by 174% during that same time period, according to the Ohio Council of Behavioral Health & Family Services Providers. 
It’s a math problem, said Ohio Council CEO Teresa Lampl. 
“We just simply don’t have enough people to provide care for the people that need care,” she said. “When people have to wait, they do deteriorate. Sometimes they end up in the hospital. Sometimes they need a higher level of care, and then we end up treating them maybe longer.”
This may cause patients to be referred to their primary care provider as a short-term intervention until they can see a mental health professional, Lampl said.
There are workforce shortages among all levels of mental health care for kids and the worst shortages are for clinicians trained to care for children with the most intensive needs, Carroll said. 
“We’re seeing a lot of turnover in mental health professionals and burnout,” she said. 
That turnover can be especially hard on a child who has developed a relationship with a provider who leaves.  
“There’s also the aspect of when the child or the family starts with a new a new professional, they have to tell their story over again, which is problematic in terms of just taking the time to do that, and that may be traumatic to relive the story that they’re telling,” Carroll said. 
“It kind of takes a while to find a person that you click with sometimes, and if there are only a few options … then I think that can be pretty problematic.” 
Mental health reimbursement rates are lower than physical health practice areas, Carroll said. 
“That is a major deterrent for people going into the field when they’re not going to end up making much money,” she said. 
Ohio families looking for mental health services for children ages 6-11 report having a harder time than for older children, according to the study. 
Families with private insurance experience report having a harder time finding treatment for their children than families with public insurance, like Medicaid. 
“One of the key challenges ultimately ends up being an insurance parity issue,” Lampl said. “… It’s much harder if you have private insurance than it is if you have Medicaid, because Medicaid recognizes a wider range of professionals and recognizes a wider range of services.”

(Photo by Evan Popp/ Maine Morning Star) Political activity is creating conflicts at Maine polls at the same time federal funding cuts are hindering election security training. Amid this, voter turnout in the state has reached new heights.
These are among the conclusions of the state’s latest reports on election procedures presented by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows during the session’s first meeting of the Maine Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs committee on Monday. 
“If people want to have their minds and hearts open to the accuracy and the safety and security of our elections, they simply have to look at what’s in front of us this morning,” said committee co-chair Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec).
The reports together paint a picture of heightened political tension and opportunities for conflict at polling places, but also demonstrate the staying power of the checks and balances in Maine’s election procedures.  
“People are not trusting our elections based upon narratives,” Hickman said. “These are the facts.” 
More Mainers participated in the November 2025 election than any other referendum election in the last 15 years. A total of 492,008 voters cast ballots, which amounts to about 47.4% of registered voters.
As of the latest available data from Jan. 1, Maine had 1,038,603 active status voters, comprising 90.6% of Maine’s voting age population. With 217,262 records cancelled after required voter list maintenance activities, the state recently underwent the largest list maintenance initiative since the establishment of the central voter registration system 19 years ago. That means Maine has a 99.93% active status for all its registered voters.
President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has questioned Maine’s high voter participation in its requests for sensitive voter information, now understood as a means to carry out citizenship probes.  
Bellows twice rejected these requests, which demanded Maine’s full voter registration list, along with names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and voter registration applications from specific time periods, among other information. 
Maine asks court to throw out DOJ lawsuit seeking access to sensitive voter data

The DOJ has since sued Maine and roughly half a dozen other states for not turning over the information. 
Political activity
The majority of complaints received by the Department of the Secretary of State on Election Day were about political activity at polling places, with a couple resulting in law enforcement getting involved, according to the latest Biennial Election Transparency Report.
Bellows’ department received several complaints from voters and poll workers about aggressive behavior by petitioners collecting ballots for a conservative group’s citizen’s initiative to roll back Maine’s inclusive policies, which for two decades have guaranteed transgender students the right to participate on teams and use school facilities aligned with their gender identity under the Maine Human Rights Act.
“There were petitioners who were very assertive in trying to collect signatures and following people to their cars or using strong language to criticize them for failure to sign the petition,” Bellows said.
A previous working group established under Bellows’ predecessor, now-State Auditor Matt Dunlap who is running for Congress in the second district, examined political activities at the polls and recommended further limiting it. Prior legislators decided not to move in that direction. Currently, the political activity ban is for a 250-foot radius around a polling site.
“This election, the level of political activities at the polls certainly led to some significant challenges and administration of the elections for the clerks to maintain calm and order at the polling place itself,” Bellows said.
Election clerks have repeatedly told Bellows’ office that they don’t feel comfortable reporting threats because statewide right to know laws make their personal information public and open them up to threats.  
As a result, Bellows recommended the committee consider making those reports confidential or allowing for personally identifying information to be redacted.
Early last year, the Trump administration cancelled federal funding for election security, including threat reporting and security training. In Washington, D.C., last week, Bellows said she spoke with other state leaders about how states and localities can fill the gap, such as pooling resources to do their own national Tabletop the Vote exercise, where election administrators discuss hypothetical security threats, which has previously been hosted by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
Checks and balances
The legislative committee will send a letter to the Maine Attorney General’s office requesting an update on its investigation into the mishandling of absentee ballots last election cycle, members decided on Monday.  
In September, 250 Maine absentee ballots were allegedly delivered to an unnamed person’s Amazon delivery box in Newburgh, outside the chain of custody. 
Based on the state’s absentee ballot tracking procedures, the number of ballots missing in Ellsworth corresponded to the number of ballots received in Newburgh. In response, the Secretary of State’s Department decided not to use UPS or the U.S. Postal Service to deliver the remaining 2025 ballots and instead used Vital delivery, a company that typically delivers medical supplies and requires more extensive background checks for employees.
Bellows defended Maine’s absentee ballot process, stating that its redundant checks and balances prevented fraud in this case. 
“I have friends who don’t trust our elections and I don’t really pin it to what just happened,” said Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor). “I pin it to a larger national conversation and what happens on social media, on TikTok, Facebook, that is putting out paranoia and weakening our trust.” 
Supica said this instance underscores the importance of Maine maintaining paper ballots. 
But other legislators remained skeptical of election security. Rep. Quentin Chapman (R-Auburn) asked what Bellows is doing to ensure the citizenship of voters who register at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, a process that began under Bellows’ tenure. 
“Only citizens are offered the opportunity to register to vote,” Bellows said, with proof of citizenship coming from a birth certificate, U.S. passport or naturalization paperwork. On the back end, municipal clerks check that those obligations have been met when completing the registration, she said. 
The Trump administration began repurposing a data tool to identify noncitizen voters at the same time the DOJ started asking states for copies of their voter rolls. 
Federal officials acknowledged that the DOJ shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens, and Bellows and other secretaries of state have raised concern about the federal government using voter records for citizenship probes.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Web_Photo_Editor-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 05:11:48.687731

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In late December, The Washington Post reported that Merrimack is one of 23 sites across the United States where the Trump administration plans to build a new ICE detention facility as part of its aggressive deportation campaign, citing a leaked document from the Department of Homeland Security. The local response over the ensuing weeks has been intense.
“I’m almost 70 years old,” Mike Tranchemontagne, of nearby Nashua, said. “I never thought I’d be living in a police state, and that’s what we’re turning into.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, is seeking contractors to help convert industrial warehouses into a network of detention centers across the country to hold immigrants the federal government wants to deport, the Post reported. Under the plan, seven new facilities would hold 5,000 to 10,000 people each and 16 new smaller feeder facilities would hold up to 1,500 people each. Detainees would be booked and held at the smaller facilities for a few weeks before being transferred to one of the large facilities. The administration plans to put one of the smaller facilities in Merrimack, according to the newspaper’s reporting.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte, speaking to reporters last week, said her administration has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential ICE facility in New Hampshire.
“This whole discussion about it, to me, is, at this point, a speculative discussion,” Ayotte said. “I would expect, if this were a real plan, which I don’t know yet because it’s been media speculation at this point, that there would be a process in which members of the local community would have an opportunity to weigh in, as, I would think, at some point the state would be consulted. But none of that’s happened yet.”
Ayotte also questioned who would staff a Merrimack facility given the fact there is already an ongoing staffing shortage in New Hampshire state prisons.

Tranchemontagne was one of hundreds who gathered outside Merrimack Town Hall Thursday protesting the plans. While the demonstration began as a reaction to the news of a potential detention center in Merrimack, it grew to become a protest about ICE action across the country and the Trump administration’s actions writ large. The protest came one day after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis, and many protesters held signs referencing the shooting or wore stickers bearing Good’s name. 
“I love my country and I disagree with just about everything that’s happened in the last year,” Tranchemontagne said. “Just total lack of concern about law and order, the Constitution, due process, on and on and on. I mean, it’s unfathomable.”
State Rep. Wendy Thomas, a Merrimack Democrat, believes such a facility would be both a moral and practical issue.
“ICE is a lawless, thug-ridden agency that is not following procedure,” Thomas told the Bulletin. “They’re not following laws. They’re terrorizing people around the United States. We don’t need people like that in our town. They violate human rights on a regular basis.”
Thomas argued “building this facility would make Merrimack complicit in those abuses.”

However, she also pointed to planning and zoning concerns.
“Even if you set aside the moral crisis, and we shouldn’t, this proposal is still a terrible deal for our town,” she said. “Detention centers are often exempt from local property taxes or generate far less revenue than traditional commercial development. That means lost property-tax income for Merrimack, while the costs fall squarely on our residents, our fire department, police and emergency medical services would be expected to respond to a high-risk facility.”
She also worries about the traffic a facility could add to the Daniel Webster Highway, Merrimack’s main artery.
Max Goddard grew up in Merrimack. He worries the former Anheuser-Busch plant — which the multinational beer company announced would close sometime in early 2026 — would be the chosen site for a detention center. (The Trump administration has not publicly specified where any detention center might be located or publicly confirmed or denied the Post’s reporting.)
“I took prom pictures at the Anheuser-Busch plant,” Goddard said during the protest, “which might be the site of this future concentration camp. And I think it would be a tragedy to take what is formerly an icon of this town, and a thing that everyone goes to, and to turn it into something so sickeningly horrible.”
Merrimack Town Hall closed early Thursday in anticipation that more people would show up than it could handle, and Merrimack Police Department officers and Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies were on scene. Protests against ICE activity in general and the Merrimack plans specifically also took place in Concord and Manchester. Other towns identified in the Post’s reporting, such as Roxbury, New Jersey, and Jefferson, Georgia, also saw resistance and demonstrations.
Erin Walthour, who travelled from Grantham to the Merrimack protest Thursday, said she was horrified reading the federal government’s plans to create a network of detainment centers.
“​​That’s what the Nazis did,” she said.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Ohio Supreme Court is considering the meaning of probable cause when it comes to inspections of rental homes, in a case that could have major impacts to Ohio tenants and landlords alike.
The state’s highest court heard arguments last week from CF Homes, LLC, and the Department of Development Services for the City of North Canton, on an appeal from the Fifth District Court of Appeals.
The city enacted laws in 2022 establishing a rental registry, which it argues is a way to keep rental properties in compliance with health and safety standards, including the presence of things like smoke detectors and proper ventilation.
The case centers on whether or not North Canton had the right under Ohio’s probable cause standard to inspect a rental property, despite the fact that the owner, CF Homes, declined the inspection.
Probable cause is a legal standard to which officials like law enforcement must adhere in order to search premises or arrest someone for a particular charge, for example. Often, probable cause is noted when police want to enter a home where criminal activity is alleged.
In this case, the city of North Canton said they had probable cause for an “administrative inspection,” in order to determine a six-unit rental property’s compliance with health and safety standards.
The Stark County Common Pleas Court approved a warrant for the inspection, leading to an appeal by CF Homes to the Fifth District Court of Appeals. The appellate court agreed with the trial court, leading the company to take the case to the Ohio Supreme Court.
The appeals court cited a U.S. Supreme Court case from 1967, in which “inspection programs” were aimed at “securing city-wide compliance with minimum physical standards for private property,” unlike in a criminal investigation, according to court documents.
Attorneys representing CF Homes said the city needed more proof of the need for an inspection than they were given, especially considering the company said no allegations of hazardous conditions were made.
Legal aid groups across Ohio have jumped in on the case, supporting the city ordinances as ways to help “ensure that the rental housing stock in North Canton meets minimum safety requirements,” and also allow the city to protect low-income tenants.
Attorney Maurice Thompson, on the side of CF Homes, asked the court to “leave undisturbed” the original public meaning of probable cause, meaning the government would be required to provide evidence that an inspection was needed, not just the potential for a hazardous situation.
“Because the protections of the home are so important and are so strong in Ohio, I don’t think we should leave this issue twisting in the wind,” Thompson said. “The government has to justify getting into a home.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBrendan Heil, an attorney representing North Canton’s Department of Development Services, argued probable cause standards could be met by showing that the property “may become hazardous,” not just in a situation when a hazard already exists.
In the case of CF Homes, Heil said the inspection was deemed necessary partly because “the property was aging” and because the building had not been searched before.
Arguments on the North Canton side met with many questions and challenges from Ohio Supreme Court justices.
Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer went back and forth with Heil and an attorney from the Ohio Attorney General’s Office also on the side of the city government, to question the standard of a potential hazard as meeting probable cause.
“Unless ‘may become hazardous’ is just something that applies to any property over a certain age, it seems kind of a meaningless standard,” DeWine said.
Fischer contended that any apartment could become hazard, though some may not, an argument Heil acknowledged as true.
“And so the tenants are going to be invaded whether there’s probable cause or not,” Fisher responded. “Is that what you’re saying?”
The North Canton attorney said showing that the apartment is aging and had never been searched before “is the showing that it may become hazardous.”
“We’re merely saying that as long as you’re promulgating a reasonable legislative reason to inspect for health and safety, you can satisfy the ‘may become hazardous’ under the statute,” Heil said.
He further argued that proactive inspection of a home can be an “excellent tool” in protecting tenants from having to go through tedious court proceedings, like withholding rent through municipal court action, to force problem landlords to fix health and safety problems.
“This prospective inspection would be much quicker because it would happen before the violations would even get to the point of the tenant withholding the rent,” Heil said.
Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy took hold of that argument, pointing out that proactive inspections would circumvent the need for probable cause actions.
“You just said that there’s no violation, so there no probable cause … there’s no reason to enter the premises because the government has no knowledge that there is actually a violation,” Kennedy said.
Samuel Peterson, of the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, further argued the standard to warrant an inspection can be met in the belief that things “may pose a hazard.”
“You don’t have to have an objective belief that there is an existing hazard,” Peterson said.
Kennedy posed a hypothetical situation to Peterson in which she received a certificate of occupancy for a building, proof she was compliant with the law up to that point.
“What you are now saying to me is the government has the right to enter my premises any time they want to inspect anything they want if I’m renting my premises, even though I’ve complied with everything under the law when I built my structure,” Kennedy said.
Peterson doubled down, arguing that to ensure health and safety, “there are certain times that it would be appropriate.”

Bottom Row: Ohio Democratic U.S. Reps. Emilia Sykes, Marcy Kaptur, Greg Landsman, Shontel Brown and Joyce Beatty. (Graphic by Morgan Trau, WEWS from official congressional photos.)With all five Ohio Democratic U.S. representatives supporting a bill to restore expired Affordable Care Act subsidies, last week 3 of 10 Ohio Republican U.S. representatives defied President Donald Trump and voted with Democrats to restore them as well.
The clock has been ticking for Congress to address the rising health care costs as insurance premiums are already increasing for some Ohioans on ACA, or Obamacare, plans.
Despite Democrats fighting for the subsidies, which led to the government shutdown in the fall, Congress let them expire at the end of 2025.
But on Thursday evening, a group of Republicans broke with Trump and helped pass a Democratic bill that would revive the tax credits for three years.
“I’ve been telling our House leadership that we need to address this because this is gonna be a problem, and they refused to address it,” Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Joyce, OH-14, said.
Joyce, from Geauga County, was one of the seventeen Republicans across the country who joined Democrats. It wasn’t his ideal plan, he said, but he wanted to help provide stability.
“All we’re doing is kicking a failed system down the road for a little bit longer, but we can’t punish the people at home just because the people in D.C. can’t come to a decision and fix the problem,” Joyce said.
Republican U.S. Reps. Max Miller, OH-7, and Mike Carey, OH-15, also broke ranks.
“The partisan Obamacare system as it exists has raised costs for everyone, but I want to give Ohioans certainty as we work to unravel the higher costs Americans face from the failed policies of the past,” Carey, representing parts of the Columbus suburbs, said in a statement.
Miller, from the western suburbs of Cleveland, helped push the legislation to a vote. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson had refused to bring the bill to the floor, but Miller signed the Democrats’ discharge petition prior to his yes vote on the legislation.
“Obamacare has failed, but pulling the rug out from under Ohio families without an alternative would be irresponsible,” Miller, who was traveling and couldn’t do an interview, said in a thread on X.
But U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, OH-5, and the other six remaining Ohio Republicans held the party line and voted against extending the benefit.
He was traveling on Friday, but previously, he told us that he knew the system had to change, but said that what the Democrats want was too expensive.
“They want $1.5 trillion, and now they’re saying the federal debt’s gonna be going up to $38 trillion,” Latta, who represents much of Northwest Ohio and also Lorain County, said in November.
We reached out to each Republican representative; many were busy, but the team of U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, OH-4, sent along an interview he did with Newsmax. In it, he said he thought it was a bad deal and didn’t make sense financially.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes, OH-13, was grateful to her colleagues for their support.
“The majority of the Ohio delegation in the House voted for this, and so hopefully that helps our senators support this as well, but this is just the first step,” Sykes, from Akron, said.
We reached out to the Democratic representatives, as well. U.S. Reps. Joyce Beatty, OH-3; Shontel Brown, OH-11; and Marcy Kaptur, OH-9, all applauded the vote.
“I hope that with my vote, assuming the Senate can pass something, half a million people will find their lives less burdened with worry about health insurance cost,” Kaptur, from Northwest Ohio, said.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where Republicans have been more vocal against it.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted’s team told us that he “remains willing to consider any good faith negotiations that include a crackdown on the fraud in the system that is wasting taxpayer dollars.”
Joyce told us that Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, who didn’t respond to request for comment, was working on a deal.
Kaptur said that the GOP “better not” force a government shutdown if they can’t come up with an acceptable plan, but she is hopeful a deal can be reached.
“I’m looking for some senators that actually care about the country… Don’t hold this up anymore,” she said. “It’s been too worrisome for people who are hanging in the balance.”
She is also concerned about her three Republican colleagues, ones who helped pass the bill.
Joyce was asked if it was worth it to break from the president if the plan does not end up passing the U.S. Senate.
“I represent the people of the 14th district proudly, and I will continue to do that,” Joyce said. “And people of Northeast Ohio know that I’ve got their backs.”
As for GOP leadership?
“I don’t work for leadership, they didn’t put me in,” Joyce said. “The people in the 14th District put me here, and I represent them, and I’ll do it to the best of my God-given ability until they tell me no more.”
When asked about facing backlash, the representative said that he needed to vote the way he did.
“This is real… This is a big problem, and they didn’t want to address it,” Joyce said about House leadership. “And if this is what it takes for them to finally dunk their head in the water and realize, ‘We got a problem here,’ well, then, I’m glad I did it.”

Ohio’s drive to boost reading scores using the science of reading has had a rocky start in the two years since Gov. Mike DeWine fought for the change, with scores going the wrong direction.
Even with millions spent on new textbooks, and teachers required to take online science of reading training, third grade English Language Arts proficiency fell from 62% in spring of 2023 to 61% earlier this year.
A jump in 2024 to 65% proficiency turned out to be a mirage, as third graders fell right back again last school year.
It’s still unclear whether the scores are cause for alarm or just a natural part of the transition as Ohio joins the flood of states shifting to phonics-heavy lessons to help students decode and understand words better. Some supporters of the science of reading believe small gains should happen almost immediately, even if it takes longer for large improvements statewide.
“We haven’t seen much progress yet,” said Chad Aldis of the Fordham Institute, one of the advocates of adopting the science of reading. “This is disappointing.”
Others urge patience, with some districts that adopted the science of reading early, saying they are on the verge of students showing improvements.
In the Elyria school district about 30 miles west of Cleveland, educators are hoping their patience will soon pay off.
Andrea McKenzie, Elyria literacy specialist acknowledged that scores haven’t improved since the district switched to the science of reading in 2022. But she said this year’s third graders, the first to be using the new curriculum since kindergarten, are on track for an 11 point jump in proficiency rates, according to scores on standardized progress tests.
“This is the moment I have been waiting for,” McKenzie said. “I’ve been waiting for these students to get to third grade to see this through, so I feel like this is the year.”
Though most schools adopted the science of reading right after DeWine started his push early in 2023, Ohio law gave schools until this fall to fully make the switch. Teachers need time to adjust and embrace a new approach. And even Mississippi, whose “miracle” reading gains are the model for Ohio and other states, took a few years before making gains that caught notice.
“Last school year, we had districts who were in very different places in their implementation of science of reading,” said Chris Woolard, chief integration officer of the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce. “We had some of those early adopters that have been doing this for a few years. We had others who are (still in) early stages.”
He stressed that this ongoing school year is the first that all schools must be fully using the science of reading, a “really important” consideration when evaluating results.
Melissa Weber-Mayrer, Ohio’s chief of literacy, said this year is “pivotal” since schools now have to be fully using science of reading, but she also cautioned that it could be three to five years before scores grow statewide.
“Looking locally, we will see things start to move,” she said. “But it might be in a grade level, in a school, maybe in one elementary building within a larger district.,” she said.
Elyria, a district of just under 6,000 students, could be one of those pockets. The district’s four elementary schools were named Science of Reading Champions by DeWine last spring for quickly adopting materials and instruction, even as that district’s reading scores are still not rising.
Third grade reading proficiency in that district fell from 45.8% of students in 2023 to 43.8% on state tests this spring.
But the district has been pushing hard to adopt the science of reading, with the school board voting in 2022 to shift to the Core Knowledge Language Arts curriculum and start using it that fall.
The district had 34 teachers start two-year Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading (LETRS) training — a program many consider the gold standard of science of reading — in 2022, with 30 more starting in 2024 and another 22 starting this school year.
The district also hired two literacy specialists in 2022 to help the one already there work with teachers on reading lessons and with students that need extra help.
The change now has kindergarten teacher Lindsay DeCoster giving students focused lessons on letters, their sounds and how to move their tongues and teeth to pronounce them.
“In the past, we have been skipping over this part… like they don’t need to know how to rhyme, they don’t need to know initial sounds and things like that,” DeCoster said. “If you don’t understand how your mouth needs to look and what your mouth needs to do to make those sounds, then you’re not gonna be able to.”
Lindsay DeCoster, a kindergarten teacher in the Elyria schools in Ohio, helps a student use a mirror to look at how her lips, teeth and tongue move to pronounce different sounds. (Photo by Patrick O’Donnell, The 74.)
DeCoster, now in her 17th year as a teacher, said LETRS training improved her teaching immensely.
“I just didn’t know what I didn’t know as far as everything that really goes into teaching a child how to read,” she said. “We’ve now broken it down to the smallest, smallest component.”
With so many states adopting the science of reading in just the last few years, experts were unable to point to many strong studies showing how fast scores change after adopting the science of reading. That’s partly because districts and schools adopt new curricula, add coaches, and train teachers at different speed and intensity, often varying within a single school, as in Elyria.
But Stanford University professor Thomas Dee, who studied how low-performing schools in California improved using that state’s Early Literacy Block Grants, said changes can happen quickly if classroom methods truly change too.
He found that low-performing California students improved by about a third of a year’s worth of learning over two years, after changing the curriculum, training teachers, and adding tutoring and afterschool programs using the grants..
“I think it’s reasonable to expect measurable improvements in student literacy to follow fairly quickly on the heels of evidence-aligned changes in teacher pedagogy,” Dee told The 74. “The major concern I have is that state declarations for the Science of Reading may not translate quickly—or indeed ever—into responsive changes in classroom practices.”
Teachers, he said, can fall back into old practices of having students “guess” at words using context or pictures – practices that Ohio banned in its 2023 state reading law – but which can’t be tracked.
Aldis also noted that Ohio is not gaining in another important way that can show progress — whether lower-scoring students are doing better and closing the gap to becoming proficient.
Fordham reported last month that the opposite is happening. More third graders are scoring as “limited,” the state’s lowest rating, an equivalent to an F, than before — 20.9% this year compared to 19.1% in 2023.
One factor, Aldis said, could be Ohio dropping its requirement in 2023 that third graders must read well to advance to fourth grade, which motivated students and teachers to show gains on a deadline.
Casey Taylor, the literacy policy director for ExcelinEd, the education advocacy group formed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, worked on reading efforts in the early days of Mississippi’s shift, as well as in North Carolina, which started a similar push in 2021.
She said Mississppi saw some gains in schools that used literacy coaches extensively within two years, but she cautioned, “It still took several years before we really started to see those performance levels shift at a broad, systemic approach.”
Mississippi, the second-worst worst state in reading when its literacy campaign launched in 2013, didn’t really excel for six years, she said.
“We saw some gains in the 2015 NAEP, but it wasn’t until 2019 that the nation really took note, because that was the first time we reached the national average on fourth grade reading,” she said.
North Carolina, she said, has started seeing gains on standardized progress tests teachers give their students, but not on tests like the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) yet.
Though he wants to see faster improvement in Ohio, Fordham’s Aldis agreed with Taylor in one major way — making real gains takes a long-term commitment.
Ohio, Aldis said, has a history of abandoning improvement projects that don’t show quick results and moving on to something else.
“These reforms are just too important to follow that same path,” Aldis said. “We need to stick with it.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)On Dec. 18, the arts world was shocked by news that the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts had voted to change the name of the world-famous institution to The Trump-Kennedy Center, effectively immediately.
The new title in full is the “Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”
As explained by the public relations office for the center, the unanimous vote by the board “recognizes that the current Chairman (President Trump) saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction.” The office continued by saying “The new Trump-Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America’s culture center for generations to come.”
It remains to be seen whether renaming the Kennedy Center will require formal approval by Congress. In the meantime, new signage has been mounted on the building’s exterior.
This episode is of great interest to me as the author of “The Real Ike: Eisenhower Fact and Fiction.” In my book, I make a strong case for renaming this cultural center on the banks of the Potomac River as the Dwight D. Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts. (See Chapter 16 — “Ike the Cultural Warrior: The Eisenhower Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC.”)
Let me explain.
Washington, D.C., had venues for theater and music when President Eisenhower took office in 1953, but no facility in D.C. compared with the best in other world capitals. Especially lacking were theaters designed for ballet and grand opera. Ike had growing concern that Washington’s inadequate cultural life did not promote the proper image for the great power that the United States had become. This issue was especially concerning at this point in the Cold War, when a positive image of the U.S. abroad was paramount.
In July 1955, Eisenhower signed Public Law 128 creating the “D.C. Auditorium Commission,” which included planning for the design, location, financing and construction in the District of Columbia of a civic auditorium including an Inaugural Hall of Presidents and a music, fine arts and mass communications center. This was the origin of the concept of a future national center for the performing arts.
Eisenhower had personally experienced patronizing comments from foreigners about his country’s lack of culture: “Many years ago when we were in Europe, it was not too rare at all to hear our country spoken of as another colony. When a European spoke of coming to America, he would say, ‘we are going out there next year to see you people,’ and it was in sort of a condescending tone.”
On September 2, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Cultural Center Act — Public Law 85-874. His dream was now definitely on its way to becoming reality. Ike’s message to the nation was clear: “The cultural center belongs to the entire country. The challenge of its development offers to each of us a noble opportunity to add to the aesthetic and spiritual fabric of America.”
In February 1960, during his last year in office, Eisenhower called for a “President’s Commission on National Goals.” This nonofficial body’s purpose was to develop a broad outline of national objectives and programs for the next decade and even longer. The commission’s final report was issued in late November 1960, just a few weeks before Eisenhower left office.
This 32-page document could rightly be viewed as a philosophic think piece meant to accompany his now famous televised “Farewell Address” to the nation given Jan. 17, 1961, warning of the dangers of a “military-industrial complex.” The report included a strong statement about the critical importance of the arts and surely reflected Ike’s own personal views.
“The arts are a vital part of human experience,” the report read. “In the eyes of posterity, the success of the United States as a civilized society will be largely judged by the creative activities of its citizens in art, architecture, literature, music and the sciences.”
In March of 1969, Eisenhower was in Walter Reed Hospital dying of congestive heart failure. Just four days before he passed away – and against his doctors’ wishes – Ike took the time to dictate and signed a letter to composer Irving Berlin.
Berlin had written patriotic songs for World Wars I and II and many other popular songs such as “White Christmas,” “There’s No Business Like Show Business” and “God Bless America.” He had even composed Eisenhower’s “I Like Ike” election campaign song in 1952. The former president’s admiration and affection for Berlin was longstanding. The letter to Berlin was the last written by Ike.

Dear Irving:
I have cajoled my doctors and nurses into letting me dictate this letter — it is a brief but very sincere note of thanks to you for the wonderful melodies you have created over the years.
A good part of my days here at Walter Reed are occupied with expert treatment by attentive doctors and nurses and some reading, but always with background music. I have wanted you to know what pleasure you have brought to me not only during my recovery but for so many years. No music has meant so much to me as yours.
I hope all is well with you and yours — please do not bother to respond.
With warm regard to you and Mrs. Berlin in which Mrs. Eisenhower joins.
Cordially,
DDE

The national cultural center in Washington, D.C., was begun by Eisenhower and then pursued by Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon before opening in 1971. We owe a debt of gratitude to all four of these presidents. But if not for the fateful events in Dallas in November 1963, future audiences might have been enjoying opera, concerts and theater in the grand “Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts.”
A soldier, politician, writer, painter, music lover: Ike was a true Renaissance Man.
Perhaps upon learning of Ike’s historic role in the creation of the center, President Trump might be persuaded to give this national treasure the name it deserves: the Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts. If not, I would be open to a compromise with new signage declaring it the Trump-Eisenhower Center for the Performing Arts.
Alas, dream on.

(Getty Images file photo.)Bill Gates recently made headlines by suggesting that climate change is no longer a priority, but the American public begs to differ.
No matter how much tech billionaires try to distract us, increasing power costs and our worsening climate are directly connected to corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon racing to dominate the AI landscape.
It’s an issue well known to Ohioans. Ohio is home to over 200 data centers, one of the highest figures in the country, and recent reporting has tied that growth to rising utility prices in the state.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the price of energy has risen at more than twice the rate of inflation since 2020, and Big Tech’s push for more power-hungry data centers is only making it worse.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The data centers proliferating across the country drive up energy costs by powering energy-ravenous generative AI, cloud storage, digital networks, and other energy intensive programs — much of it fueled by coal and natural gas that exacerbate climate change.
In some cases, data centers consume enough electricity to power the equivalent of a small city. The wholesale price of electricity in areas housing data centers is up a whopping 267 percent from five years ago — and everyday customers are eating those costs.
Americans are also shouldering increasing costs of an extreme climate.
The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard noted that insurance prices rose 74 percent between 2008 and 2024 — and between 2018 and 2023, nearly 2 million people had their policies canceled by insurers because of climate risks.
Meanwhile, home prices have gone up 40 percent in the past two decades — meaning the cost of home repair and recovery from climate disasters has also grown, all while wages remain stagnant.
Data centers aren’t just putting our wallets at risk. Power grids across the country are already strained from aging infrastructure and repeated battering during extreme weather events.
The additional pressure to feed energy-intensive data centers only heightens the risk of power blackouts in emergencies like wildfires, deep freezes, and hurricanes. And in some communities, people’s taps have literally run dry because data centers used all the local groundwater.
Worse still, Big Tech’s AI energy demand has triggered a resurgence in dirty energy with the construction of new gas-powered energy plants and delayed shutdowns of fossil fuel-powered plants. The tech industry is even pushing for a revitalization of nuclear energy, including the planned 2028 reopening of Three Mile Island — site of the worst nuclear power plant disaster in U.S. history — to help power Microsoft’s data centers.

Everyday people bear the costs of Big Tech’s hunger for profits. We pay it in rising energy bills, our worsening climate, our lack of access to safe water, increased noise pollution, and risks to our health and safety.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Instead of raising our bills, draining our local resources, and destabilizing our climate, Big Tech could create more energy jobs, lessen our power bills, and sustain communities.
We can demand that tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon uphold their commitments to use 100 percent renewable energy and not rely on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to power data centers. We can insist that data centers only go where they’re wanted by ensuring communities are given full transparency and protection in how they’re affected by power usage, water access, and noise pollution.
The current administration is ignoring its obligations to the American public by refusing to rein in Big Tech. But tech billionaires still have a responsibility to the very public they depend on for their existence.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Heading into the Florida Legislature’s 2026 session, quashing illegal immigration remains a headlining agenda item for Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-dominated state House and Senate.
Here are some of the bills to keep an eye on.
SB 1380/HB 1307
Sponsored by Sen. Jonathan Martin and Rep. Berny Jacques, these bills represent the largest immigration package filed so far for this session.
The provisions include:

Fines for employers who ignore their workers’ documentation status.
Criminal charges for hiring more than 50 undocumented immigrants.
Rebuttable presumption that undocumented out-of-state drivers are at-fault in car accidents.
Denying undocumented immigrants bank loans.
Requires law enforcement investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.
Bans translators or interpreters in licensing procedures.
Creates penalties for failing to use E-Verify ahead of submitting worker compensation claims.

SB 1542
Very similar to Martin’s  and Jacques’ legislation, this bill was filed Friday by Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent. His bill would create fines for employers who fail to use E-Verify at all — not just those who don’t do so in filing workers’ compensation claims.
It would also require law enforcement to use E-Verify to investigate a detained person’s immigration status, and bans businesses that have violated the bill from ever receiving any public contract in the future with any public agency in this state.
SB 1052
Filed by Sen. Erin Grall, this bill instructs public colleges and universities to exclusively admit students who are “citizen[s] of the United States” or “lawfully present therein.”
It would prevent migrants illegally in the country from participating in state-funded adult general education programs, which include classes for GED and English as a second language that help “adult learners gain the knowledge and skills they need to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.”
HB 197/SB 1278
Proposed by Rep. Berny Jacques and Sen. Jonathan Martin, these bills require every business to use E-Verify, a federal database verifying a worker’s immigration status.
This expands a 2023 law that mandated E-Verify for public employers and businesses with at least 25 employees. Now, all businesses regardless of private/public status or number of employees must use the database, the bill says.
HB 991
Sponsored by Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka and Rep. Dana Trabulsy, this bill would require new Florida voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship.
The measure also:

Requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote.
Mandates that the Florida Department of State review existing voter registrations for citizenship status and forward names to supervisors of elections to request proof of eligibility from voters.
Requires driver’s licenses and state ID cards to display citizenship status.
Expands information-sharing on citizenship status between the Department of State, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), and jury coordinators.
Creates a new post-election audit process.
Makes changes to the recount process.
Makes new restrictions on campaign contributions from foreign nationals

HB 985
Filed by Rep. Berny Jacques, this bill is very similar to Persons-Mulicka’s bill.
The measure:

Requires election supervisors to verify citizenship status by using the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements or “SAVE” program administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Mandates election supervisors “who have determined that false affirmations have been made on a voter registration application” to refer the application to the Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security.
Information received by the DHSMV indicating that a registered voter has received a driver’s license in another state “shall be considered a written request from the voter to have his or her name removed from the statewide voter registration system.”
Narrows the list of IDs that can be used at the polls.
Adds new requirements for voters who registered using a Florida ID.
Expands the use of provisional ballots for voters whose citizenship can’t be verified.
Creates additional steps for vote-by-mail requests.
Florida IDs and driver licenses issued to non-citizens must be marked “NC” on the front.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5753-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-13 02:12:19.721501

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Legislative leaders kick off the 60-day session Tuesday with an eye toward school funding. 
Here are just a few of the matters that lawmakers have put forward.
The Senate released its plan to address “a myriad of accountability problems” in the school voucher system. After the program opened to all students, it became apparent that administrative and statutory problems needed to be addressed, lawmakers discussed during early pre-session committee hearings. 
That bill, SB 318, unanimously approved by the Senate appropriations committee, would:

Create a dedicated fund for the scholarship programs as opposed to the existing practice of lumping those funds together with all school funding.
Require a minimum $250 million fund to offset unexpected costs related to school choice scholarships.
Establish scholarship clear application and acceptance deadlines for distributing scholarship money. The old system led confusion over whether to send the money to private or public schools.
Provide the state access to scholarship funding organizations’ databases.
Require the Department of Education to investigate written complaints from parents, students, and schools regarding school choice laws and investigate fraudulent activity and overpayment. 

The House is yet to propose any fix to the system.
Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed creating guidelines that scholarship funding organizations must meet to remain eligible to administer the program.
DeSantis also would require uniform paperwork for withdrawing a student from public school, as well as verifying the location of a student before dispersing funds. 
Also, DeSantis proposes a declining enrollment supplement, to support schools that experience decreasing enrollment. 
This could be an issue negotiated during the last days of session, given that in 2025 leaders could not reach a budget agreement on time. 
Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, is sponsor to a bill, SB 896, that would permit professors, university faculty, and teaching assistants to openly carry firearms on campus through the guardian program.
Similarly, the governor proposes including the Florida college and university systems in the guardian program, allowing qualified school personnel to carry firearms for security. 
‘Harmful to minors’
Sen. Stan McClain, a Republican from Ocala, is taking another run, along with Rep. Doug Bankson, a Republican from Apopka, to create more aggressive standards in determining what books in school libraries can be considered “harmful to minors.” 
McClain presented the matter last session, but it only made it through one of its three committees amid First Amendment concerns.
More bills

Rep. Tom Fabricio, a Republican from Miami Lakes, and Sen. Clay Yarborough, a Republican from Jacksonville, proposed bills in their respective chambers requiring teachers and personnel to swear an oath to the Constitution and nonpartisanship. Those bills have been referred to committees.
Another bill, proposed by Republicans Sen. Danny Burgess and Rep. John Snyder, would require portraits of former Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in classrooms across the state. The Senate version has its first committee hearing this week. 
Lawmakers proposed renaming a road at each public institution of higher education after conservative activist Charlie Kirk. 
Republican Rep. Paula Stark of St. Cloud and Democratic Sen. Kristen Arrington of Kissimmee proposed requiring recess for students in grades 6-8. 
Republican lawmakers Yarborough and Rep. David Borrero of Hialeah proposed prohibiting schools from discriminating against students or personnel based on political or ideological viewpoints. 
Sen. Alexis Calatayud, a Republican from Miami, proposed a policy that would place, upon the request of parents, cameras in classrooms.

Ron DeSantis, speaking at Grace Christian School in Valrico on Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)After seven productive years in office, Ron DeSantis will give his final “State of the State” address as Florida governor Tuesday morning at the Florida Capitol.
Mainly because he’s already achieved so much during his two terms in office, this session isn’t expected to be a legislative blockbuster — certainly, nothing along the lines of 2023, when the governor was coming off a 19-point re-election victory and was just a few months away from entering the 2024 presidential race. The Legislature enacted a smorgasbord of conservative policies. “I don’t know that there was any meat left on the bone after this legislative session,” DeSantis summarized afterward.
This year, two of the biggest issues he wants to tackle may not  move at all before lawmakers gather for the traditional “sine die” hanky drop on Friday, March 13, ending the regular session.
The governor’s office declined to comment for this story.
Property Taxes
Take his proposal to substantially reduce if not outright eliminate property taxes for homesteaded properties. Even DeSantis doesn’t want the Legislature to act yet.
“I don’t know that it necessarily is something that you do in the regular session,” DeSantis said last week during a press conference in Steinhatchee.
It wasn’t an off-the-cuff remark. Speaking in Jacksonville in October, the governor floated the idea that lawmakers could “potentially have a special session on property tax right in the middle of the Republican primary season in July or August.”
Senate President Ben Albritton appears in synch with the governor, saying last week that he was “certainly open” to addressing property taxes later in the year.
The House, led by Speaker Daniel Perez, has other ideas. Members have already held committee meetings advancing four joint resolutions that could end up on the ballot for voters to consider later this year. Tension between the two chambers on policy emerged last session, when Perez pushed for a permanent reduction in sales taxes but Albritton walked away from the deal after DeSantis said such a plan would be “dead on arrival.”
University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett thinks the Republican Party ultimately will come together on a plan to reduce property taxes later this year.
“I think that tax cuts are still largely the glue that holds the Republican Party together, and so this thought of offering a big property tax cut in some ways will be a litmus test for Republicans,” Jewett told the Phoenix.
“It doesn’t matter if you’re a Trump Republican, if you’re a DeSantis Republican, if you’re a libertarian Republican — the thought is, you’re going to get behind this.”
DeSantis has already set aside $300 million in his proposed 2026-2027 state budget to support “ongoing policy considerations,” arguing any statewide property tax relief framework must be implemented in a “fiscally sound manner” for all of the state’s counties, including its 29 fiscally constrained counties.
Congressional Redistricting
DeSantis has already called a special legislative session for April to concentrate on redistricting Florida’s 28 congressional seats. Albritton has said that timing works for him, but the Florida House has already held two committee meetings on the issue — opening another fissure with the upper chamber.
“He’s now explicitly pointing toward an April special session after the regular session ends,” said former St. Petersburg Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes, now president of the nonprofit Florida Policy Project, which he founded. “That tells you it’s not a side issue, it’s a priority with national implications.”
Democrats insist any redistricting plan would constitute an “illegal” gerrymander in violation of the Florida Constitution. The governor disagrees, maintaining the state “will be forced to do it” because of an expected U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act that could ban districts based on race.
One potential problem with that theory is the timing: DeSantis has called the special session for April 20-24. However, the high court might not rule until it concludes its annual term in late June.
AI
One legislative proposal the governor has been pushing for hard is an AI “Bill of Rights” for Floridians regarding artificial intelligence, which among other things would ensure they don’t get hit with massive electric utility price increases to run AI data centers.
Even after Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a uniform national policy on AI to deter state-level regulations, DeSantis said it wouldn’t stop Florida. “You should read it and see. First of all, an executive order can’t block states,” he said last month. “You can preempt states under Article 1 powers through congressional legislation on certain issues, but you can’t do it through executive order.”
A proposal filed by in the House by Rep. Philip Griffitts Jr., R-Panama City Beach (HB 1007), would create a new regulatory framework for data centers.
Another bill (SB 482), sponsored in the Senate by Tom Leek, R-Ormond Beach, would create the “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.” The legislation includes the right to pursue civil remedies against use of artificial intelligence to “slander, libel or defame.”
Banning vaccine mandates
Another goal that DeSantis set forth months ago is to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida statutes. The governor and Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made the announcement in eastern Hillsborough County in September, before conferring with legislative leaders. Five months later, it’s not certain whether rank and file legislators have bought into the concept.
As of this past Friday, no bills had been filed by legislators addressing the issue. Legislation (HB 917) filed by Rep. Jeff Holcomb, R-Spring Hill, would require every licensed health care provider authorized to vaccinate children to advise parents and legal guardians of the “unique risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy of each vaccine included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.”
Everglades restoration and water quality
DeSantis has boasted of his financial support for Everglades restoration and water projects during tenure in Tallahassee. In his proposed 2026-2027 state budget, he recommends more $810 million toward Everglades restoration on top of nearly $8 billion overall during his administration to that end.
However, construction of the immigrant detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz” atop a mostly idle airstrip in the Everglades prompted a federal lawsuit by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians, who said it was constructed without environmental reviews as required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
A federal judge in Miami last summer ordered the facility to wind down operations but a federal appellate panel put a temporary hold on that decision.
Legacy time
DeSantis goes into this year with his political future uncertain. Whether he intends to run for president again, he’s certainly young enough (47) to try. Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio lead in most early GOP public-opinion surveys.
A Cabinet seat might be available in the second half of Donald Trump’s term — either at the Department of Defense, where public speculation suggested he might have subbed in for Pete Hegseth when his confirmation was looking fuzzy a year ago) or attorney general. And there’s always the possibility of a Supreme Court appointment.
UCF Professor Jewett thinks the congressional redistricting and property tax efforts indicate the governor wants to close his tenure with a bang.
“He can already take some credit with adding four more Republican seats [in the 2022 congressional redistricting.] Florida’s responsible for the current congressional majority and, by redistricting again, if he could get, two, three, four, and maybe five more seats — just really gerrymander like crazy — that could help his political future,” he said.
The bid for property tax reduction in particular would be a big-ticket win to take on the road for a future national candidacy, Jewitt said.
“If he could oversee the first state to actually eliminate property taxes for homeowners — all of those things are not just about policy, right? To me, they’re about him solidifying his legacy as a conservative governor who got a lot of things done and who has a future as a presidential candidate.”
DeSantis technically may be a “lame duck,” said Tara Newsom, a political science professor at St. Petersburg College, but his actions in recent months suggest he has a lot of juice left.
“Floridians and everyone else with their eyes on the White House are watching whether DeSantis can take on property tax reform and mid-decade redistricting. With the setting of the special session in April, it looks like he is still a force to watch,” she said.
“If I were advising him as a legacy play, I’d also put ‘pay down debt, build reserves, and keep the state’s balance sheet strong’ at the top of the list,” said Brandes. “Use this final year to bank wins that look responsible in hindsight, not just loud in the moment. In other words, a victory lap that doesn’t leave the next administration with a structural hangover. This is all setting up for a 2028 run for presidential run.”
Former Hillsborough County Republican Rep. Mike Beltran, who wasn’t shy in opposing DeSantis at times when he served in the Florida House from 2020-2024, believes DeSantis missed his best opportunity to stay active in federal politics when he opted not to appoint himself to succeed Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate a year ago.
“He does these bold things like sacking [former Hillsborough County State Attorney] Andrew Warren, what he did with the congressional maps [in 2022]. Nobody thought we could have gotten a six-week abortion bill through in 2023. He does a lot of bold stuff — I thought he could sit around in the Senate, fundraise, hang out for 10-12 years and then make another run for president.”
Veteran political strategist Barry Edwards agrees. DeSantis’ decision not to appoint himself to succeed Rubio (instead of choosing Ashley Moody) will likely hurt his prospects for higher office, he said. He suggested the governor use his final last year in office to shore up relations with Republican lawmakers, who won’t be nearly as deferential to him once he signs his final budget later this year.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-1-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 00:11:42.881854

(Here is Part One.)
Here we review the new Council on Housing Development; revised parking rules; conversion of commercial and mixed-use zones to middle housing; transit-oriented development; priority housing development zones; and the Connecticut Department of Housing’s new role as a developer as well as funder.
Council on Housing Development
Critics of the new Act have already started to bemoan a new housing bureaucracy created by the Act, and the new Council on Housing Development is one of the focal points (Section 14).
The Council will have 18 members, starting with the Governor, the State’s Responsible Growth Coordinator (an Office of Policy & Management employee), the OPM Secretary, the Department of Housing Commissioner, the Commissioners of Environmental Protection and Economic Development, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority Director,  the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority Director, and legislative leaders.  The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House act as chairs.  
The Council’s stated duty is to advise the Responsible Growth Coordinator about regulations and guidelines, funding decisions, and approving municipal and regional housing growth programs.  Other roles assigned by the Act include acting as a board of appeals if the OPM Secretary rejects a housing growth plan or regulations drafted to carry out other Act initiatives.
Again, candidly, it is difficult to envision the members of this Council carrying out meaningful reviews of housing growth plans and proposed zoning regulations.  Moreover, if the Council evolves into an active, hands-on housing agency, the Act will be a far cry from “towns take the lead” in promoting affordable housing proclamation.
Parking
Excessive parking requirements are a well-known exclusionary zoning technique. 
Parking spaces consume land and therefore restrict density.  The Act modifies the power of local land use commissions to require parking spaces and deny applications based on parking (Sections 18-21).  A confusing feature of the parking sections is that although they focus on required parking spaces in residential development, a traditional zoning topic, the Act toggles between “zoning commissions” and “municipality” as the implementer, for no apparent reason.
First, the Act states that no commission shall reject any application for residential development “solely on the basis” that it fails to meet off-street parking requirements, unless the commission or its zoning officer finds that a lack of parking “will have a specific adverse impact on public health or safety that cannot be mitigated through approval conditions. . . .”
But then the Act retreats from this broad statement, providing that “a municipality” may require minimum parking for a residential development of more than sixteen dwelling units, but the developer must be allowed to submit a “parking needs assessment,” and the commission or zoning officer – another switchback from municipality– “shall condition the approval” on parking not exceeding one space for each studio and one bedroom units and two spaces for all larger units, or the number of spaces recommended by the needs assessment, “whichever results in the least required number” of off-street spaces. An implication is that a commission may not deny any development plan of less than 16 units based on inadequate parking.
The Act then explains the required elements of a parking needs assessment: existing available spaces, public transit options, projected needs, and any other relevant studies.
The Act allows a municipality to adopt one or two “traffic mitigation districts,” not more than four percent of the total land area, where minimum spaces can be specified for residential developments of fewer than 16 units, provided that the needs assessment process described above must be an administrative option.  The purpose of this provision is not clear.
In addition, the Act extends General Statutes § 8-2c, which allows payments of a fee-in- lieu of parking requirements, to any residential or mixed-use development with 16 or more units “or any commercial development.”
In one of its few direct mandates regarding zoning regulations, the Act repeals the 2021  provision allowing an opt-out from parking standards stated in the Zoning Enabling Act and thus establishes the parking rules outlined above as the required statewide system.
Transit-oriented communities and developments
Another program in the new Act establishes standards and incentives (Sections 11, 12) for “qualifying transit-oriented communities,” which are municipalities that are home to rapid transit facilities or regular bus service, or border such a municipality.  (We note that while train stations are essentially fixed for the long term, bus service is easily changeable.)  A qualifying municipality may establish, with OPM approval (based on a lengthy list of considerations), a “transit-oriented district,” which must allow as-of-right:

Transit community “middle housing” development, defined as nine or fewer units;
Developments of ten or more units that meet § 8-30g set-aside (30 percent) affordable standards; and
Developments on land owned by the municipality or its public housing authority, “any not-for-profit entity” or any “religious organization” as defined in General Statutes § 49-31k.

All units in these developments must remain affordable for at least 40 years at rents or prices equivalent to not more than 30 percent of the annual income of households earning 60 percent or less of the statewide or area median income, whichever is less.  It should be noted that this income qualification standard is close but not identical to § 8-30g, creating another point of confusion.
A qualifying transit-oriented community must also allow as-of-right the conversion of any residential or commercial development into any of the three types of developments listed above.  “As-of-right” means approvable based on objective regulatory standards rather than a discretionary permit, and without a public hearing.
A notable feature of this section is that it directs the transit-oriented regulations to allow  § 8-30g set-aside developments of ten or more units to be approved as-of-right, which presumably means without the zoning commission evaluating whether the development will create a substantial public health or safety concern that clearly outweighs affordable housing need.
Developments of ten or more dwelling units may allow “ground level commercial uses,” excepting developments by religious organizations (we assume because religious organizations cannot claim commercial use as part of their mission).
Developments of more than ten units that are not allowed as-of-right must still meet affordable percentage requirements stated in the “Connecticut Housing Finance Authority’s Housing Needs Assessment.”  This introduces yet another unclear metric.
We believe there is a significant typographical error in the Act’s § 11(i) on page 48, which appears to say that a qualifying transit-oriented community will be eligible for additional OPM funding if it adopts “zoning criteria” whose affordability rules exceed the CHFA Needs Assessment, develop public land or public housing, or encourage homeownership.  Section (i) and (j)(2) refers back to subsection (h), which should be subsection (g).
Following a pattern in the Act that, in over view, undermines the enforceability of proposals, the transit-oriented provision ends with a statement that communities seeking OPM approval of transit-oriented districts may seek exemptions or may opt out of the program entirely.
Middle housing and mixed-use development
Separate from transit-oriented districts, the Act (Section 16) amends General Statutes § 8-2s by requiring each municipality’s zoning regulations to allow, by a “summary review” process, transit community middle housing development or “mixed-use development” on “any lot that is zoned for commercial or mixed-use development.”  In addition, the “TOD” regulation “may allow” transit community middle housing “on any lot that allows for residential use subject only to summary review.”  
In other words, the Act, in another confusing twist, allows transit-oriented middle housing as a development type on any lot zoned commercial or mixed-use, even if not located within a transit-oriented district.
“Summary review” means that a zoning application is approvable based on standards in the regulations such as setbacks, lot size, and building frontage without a public hearing and without “discretionary zoning action” such as a variance, special permit, or special exception.  However, the commission or zoning officer must make “a determination that a site plan conforms to the regulations” and “public health and safety will not be substantially impacted….”  Two pertinent questions about this provision will be whether the requirement of conformance to the zoning regulations could essentially nullify the goal of a non-discretionary approval, and whether a public health and safety determination can be made without a public hearing.
While the more streamlined approval process is enticing, a transit community middle housing development is limited to two to nine units –which in our experience is well below what most developers would consider economically viable.  
Also, the phrases “zoned for commercial use” or for “mixed-use development” are unclear at best.  “Commercial” is a term of art.  If a zone allows some uses that could be considered commercial but the zone has some other name, is it a “commercial zone?”  And “mixed-use” is not defined.  Moreover, does the final sentence about “a residential use subject only to summary review” refer to the middle housing/commercial/mixed use or the residential use?  This is another example of unclear drafting that vetting could have resolved.
Priority housing development zones
The Act contains a voluntary program, to be administered by the Department of Housing, for “priority housing development zones” (Sections 8-10).  Such zones must:

Be located within an existing “residential or commercial district” that is “suitable” for the type of development the PHDZ program allows;
Be consistent with the state plan of conservation and development; and
Encompass no less than ten percent of the “developable land” within the municipality.

The zone’s regulations must:

Be consistent with the municipal or regional housing growth plan;
Be “likely to increase production of new dwelling units” (note “affordable” not specified);
As required by General Statutes §§ 8-2 (b)(4-6), provide housing opportunities including multi-family for all residents of the municipality and the region;” promote housing choice and economic diversity; and “expressly allow the development of housing” identified in the state’s “consolidated” housing plan and the State Plan of Conservation and Development;”
Permit multi-family housing “as of right;”
Allow single-family houses at a minimum of four units per acre, townhouses and duplexes at six per acre, and multi-family at ten per acre; and
Require only a site plan or subdivision approval, no special permit or special exceptions.

However, a zoning commission may “modify, waive, or eliminate dimensional standards” such as building height, setbacks, lot coverage, parking ratios, and road standards to support the minimum densities.
PHDZ regulations may allow a mix of business, commercial, and non-residential uses if such uses are “consistent” with the as-of-right residential uses and required densities.
A PHDZ may overlay an historic district unless the historic district’s requirements render the PHDZ “out of compliance” with what PHDZs require.  The Act does not state how this relates to the historic district “certificate of appropriateness” requirement.
A PHDZ must be approved by the Commissioner of Housing, who may, one year later, rescind the approval based on a “lack of building permits or other indications of progress toward construction of dwelling units. . . .”
The PHDZ rules are borrowed in part from the Incentive Housing Zone program adopted in 2007 and still on the books at General Statutes §§ 8-13m to 8-13x.  That program largely fizzled in the 2008-2011 recession when the General Assembly declined to appropriate financial incentives that were a quid pro quo for amending regulations.  
As will be discussed in Part Three of this series, under Housing Growth Plans, the requirement that PHDZ regulations must be “consistent” with municipal or regional growth plans is problematic because the Act does not contemplate the adoption of housing growth plans until 2028 and 2029.  In addition, the ability of zoning commissions to modify or eliminate enacted regulations, and of the Commissioner of Housing to rescind a PHZD approval after one year based on lack of progress, will have a chilling effect on use of this program.  
Respectfully, it is difficult to envision a municipality utilizing this program.
Department of Housing powers
The Act (Section 48) grants the Department of Housing a package of new powers by which the DOH may not only fund development but act as developer and manager, akin to what public housing authorities may do.  
DOH must report its activities under this new program to the new Council on Housing Development.  It is not clear if this section replaces the existing statutes regarding the Connecticut Housing Authority, General Statutes §§8-119ZZ to 8-122.
Tweaks to § 8-30g moratorium rules
The Act slightly modifies the point system by which municipalities subject to § 8-30g may achieve a four-year moratorium (Sections 16, 41).   
It awards an additional one-quarter (0.25) point for units in a transit community middle-housing development.  If a municipality has adopted a priority housing development zone and received DOH approval of that zone, its moratorium points threshold is reduced from the greater of two percent/75 points to the greater of 1.75 percent or 65 points.  
In the case of a municipality that has adopted a municipal or regional housing growth plan, has more than 20,000 dwelling units, and has previously obtained a moratorium, its required points for a next moratorium are reduced to 1.5 percent of its total housing units, with no alternative minimum.  Units constructed by or in conjunction with a housing authority achieve an additional 0.25 points per unit.
Tim Hollister and Andrea Gomes are land use attorneys at the Hartford office of Hinckley Allen.  They both work regularly on affordable housing development.  
In 2022-23, Hollister co-chaired a statewide working group tasked by the legislature with reviewing all of the affordable housing plans (so-called “§ 8-30j plans”) prepared by nearly all municipalities and providing recommendations on how such plans could be improved.  In September 2024, he published here a five-part series about affordable housing reform and in July 2025, a two-part series explaining House Bill 5002, the one vetoed by the governor in June 2025, and what could be done to fix it.
Gomes regularly represents clients before local and state agencies and in state court. She has assisted with obtaining municipal approvals and litigating affordable housing matters and property disputes such as quiet title actions, easement disputes, nuisance actions, and adverse possession cases. 
Attorney Raphael Podolsky also contributed to this series.

Wes Moore to a second term, even as the first-term Democrat's job approval numbers continue a downward trend, according to a new poll.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) talks to reporters in November. A new poll shows the governor is still popular, but his popularity continues to wane. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Roughly half of Maryland voters said they would vote to reelect Gov. Wes Moore to a second term, even as the first-term Democrat’s job approval numbers continue a downward trend.
The poll released Tuesday by Annapolis-based Gonzales Research & Media represents a mixed bag for the governor.
“If the election were today, Moore would be reelected, but the election isn’t today,” said Patrick Gonzales, a veteran state pollster. “It’s 10 months away. We have a session that is going to be rather problematic, I suspect, for the governor. Where we are six months from now, where we are on Labor Day, that’s going to matter. That’s how I see it.”
The poll of 808 registered Maryland voters who said they were likely to vote in 2026 was conducted between Dec. 21 and Jan. 6. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5%.
Gonzales also asked who voters would support if the 2026 election were held today.
Moore, with 49.9%, tops a generic Republican and third-party candidate. The number is driven by nearly 76% of Democrats who said they would give Moore a second term.
Democrats hold a 2-1 registration advantage over Republicans in Maryland, making up slightly more than 50% of all registered voters in the state.
Predictably, 81% of Republicans said they would back a Republican candidate. Unaffiliated voters are more evenly split, with 35% saying they would vote for Moore and 32% favoring the unnamed Republican.
Gonzales noted that polling data suggests voter discontent over pocketbook issues: affordability, the economy and taxes. Nearly six in 10 voters who responded said they believe they are paying too much in taxes.
“They’re paying too much for their electricity,” he said. “They’re paying too much in taxes and people are [angry].”
All of which is a harbinger for a potential pocketbook election, he said.
Gov. Wes Moore has seen a narrowing of the separation between voters who approve of his job performance and those who disapprove since entering office. (Gonzales Research & Media Services)
Gonzales noted that of those who said they pay too much in taxes, “a hypothetical Republican candidate bests Moore by 13 points, 47% to 34%.”
Another 41% said they believe they pay “the right amount” in taxes. Just 1% said they believe they should pay more.
Last year, Moore and the General Assembly increased taxes by a projected $1.6 billion,  part of a plan to close a projected $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.
The expectation was that the tax increase, coupled with one-time fund shifts and some cuts, would fill the spending gap and leave $300 million for the fiscal 2028 budget year.
Those expectations fizzled. The state faces a $1.5 billion projected structural deficit for the coming budget year. Officials point the finger at federal actions including the loss of 25,000 federal jobs since President Donald Trump took office.
Republican candidates in recent history enjoyed late election year surges tied to one or more so-called pocketbook issues. In 1994, Ellen Sauerbrey lost to Parris Glendening by just 6,000 voters. In 2002, Robert Ehrlich became the first Republican elected governor in nearly four decades. In 2014, Larry Hogan won the first of two consecutive elections. He was the first Republican to do so since Theodore McKeldin.
Downward job approval trend continues
Moore entered office in 2023 enjoying approval of roughly six in 10 Marylanders. He peaked in Gonzales’ September 2024 poll, when 64% of those surveyed approved of his efforts. The gap between those who approved and those who disapproved in that poll was 35 points.
Since then, there has been a downward trend. Last March, there was a 19-point separation. In Tuesday’s poll, 52% said they approve of the job Moore is doing compared to 41% who disapprove, three points lower than a Gonzales survey in March 2025. The governor has performed similarly in other surveys, including the Institute for Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
Beneath those top-line numbers in the Gonzales poll, the survey shows a continuing trend of voters who are changing their minds about Moore’s efforts.
The current poll shows an 11-point separation between those who approve and those who disapprove. And for the first time since Gonzales asked about Moore’s job performance, the number of those who said they strongly disapprove is larger than those who strongly approve.
Roughly one voter in three said they strongly disapproved of Moore’s job performance heading into the final session of the current term — a 7-point change from March.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore lost ground with Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters. While 73% of Democrats approved of Moore’s performance, that was down from 83% in March 2025. At the same time, those who disapproved increased five points, to 18%.
In March, one-fifth of unaffiliated voters declined to offer an opinion on Moore’s job performance. Now, just 10% declined to answer: 41% of independent voters approve of the governor’s performance — a 7-point increase from March — but 49% said they disapproved, also an increase of seven points.
Democratic optimism
Moore’s job approval numbers come even as the Gonzales poll shows an uptick in overall sentiment about the direction of the state.
Of those surveyed, 47% said the state is moving in the right direction compared to 44% who said the state is on the wrong track.
The results are an improvement from last March when 50% said the state was on the wrong track and 41% said things were moving in the right direction.
The results don’t track directly with Moore’s job approval numbers.
“It’s not solely tied to whether people think taxes are too high,” Gonzales said. “There are other factors that play into what seems like a contradiction in the poll. I wouldn’t get all bollixed up on that.”
Instead, Gonzales said national politics and the impending midterm elections — a referendum on Trump — may be in play. Democrats nationally are eying the potential to retake a majority in the U.S. House in November.
“When we did the poll in March, Trump had just taken office and Democrats were a bit demoralized,” Gonzales said. “Now they’ve got that eye of the tiger, Rocky and Apollo Creed running on the beach mentality back and 70% of Democrats see things moving in the right direction for them.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_4543-1024x681.jpeg,,,2026-01-13 00:11:42.881854

The federal government swiftly filed an emergency request for the judge in Owens’ federal bribery case to permanently seal the motion and the attached exhibits, claiming it violated a protective order in the case and could “influence the jury pool.” 
Owens is charged with eight criminal counts, including conspiracy, bribery, racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty, and his 68-page motion points to his likely defense — entrapment. 
“In its unrestrained zeal to ‘get something’ on Owens, the Government made material misrepresentations in the indictment; concealed evidence; lied to the Grand Jury; induced Owens after he rejected criminal overtures and exhibited reluctance; strategically used alcohol to target Owens, who is a diagnosed alcoholic, to break down his resistance, overcome his reluctance, and elicit incriminating statements,” the motion reads.

Former Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and former Jackson City Councilman Aaron Banks have also pleaded not guilty, and a trial is scheduled for July. 
The FBI sting began in 2023, when agents came to Jackson impersonating wealthy, out-of-state developers seeking to invest in downtown. 
In the course of their operation, Owens allegedly helped the developers bribe Lumumba by translating the agents’ cash into checks from multiple supposed campaign donors, and forking over the funds while on a yacht in south Florida. According to documents obtained by Mississippi Today, the fictitious developer group had invited Lumumba to Fort Lauderdale, just outside Miami, under the guise of a fundraising event, including a sunset cruise.
Lumumba then allegedly called his planning and development director in exchange for the money and asked him to move up a deadline in a bid for proposals, theoretically giving Owens’ new developer friends an advantage. Photos of Lumumba talking on the phone and Owens handling cash appear inside the indictment.
The federal government also accused Owens of bribing Banks with $10,000 for his future vote on the project.
The federal indictment is chock full of quotes from Owens, taken from hours of tape the undercover agents recorded during their conversations with the district attorney. Owens’ brow-raising remarks – which he described as “cherry-picked” and “drunken, locker room banter” – extend to topics far beyond the alleged bribery scheme. 
“We can take dope boy money,” Owens is quoted in the indictment as saying, “… but I need to clean it and spread it.”
The indictment alleges Owens told the agents he was mixing their cash with “dope money and drug money and more than a million dollars” and storing it at the district attorney’s office. 
But the indictment does not include charges related to these comments. This is another thing Owens’ motion challenges. 
“The Government intentionally used a ‘speaking indictment’ to foment public anger and acrimony toward Owens resulting in widespread conclusions of guilt with no regard for due process,” the motion reads.
Owens’ motion includes similarly detailed descriptions of the FBI’s attempts to learn about his activities, despite the government’s claims in grand jury testimony that Owens “inserted” himself into its investigation. 
Months before the real estate developers came to town, the motion claims, the FBI had set its sights on broaching Owens’ network by turning a law enforcement officer and former candidate for Hinds County Sheriff, Torrence Mayfield, who was also working as the district attorney’s bodyguard. 
With the help of a jailhouse informant and a convicted felon who runs a Jackson nightclub, Owens’ motion claims the feds indicted Mayfield on federal firearm charges in 2022 after he bought a rifle for the nightclub owner. In 2025, Mayfield pleaded guilty to one charge of making false statements to a gun dealer. 
Owens’ motion says the feds sat on the indictment until they got to town. Then, Owens claims they used it to pressure Mayfield, arranging a SWAT team to arrest the unsuspecting man in April 2023 as he was “leaving a health club wearing a plastic suit to help him lose weight.” 
For more than three hours, the motion says agents interviewed Mayfield as he “sat handcuffed in the backseat sweating profusely in his plastic suit.” He told them about his suspicions of corruption in city government and local law enforcement. 
“And you got to understand, we have heard all those things from the County, the City, like everything,” one of the agents told him. “We just are now hearing a position where you could get something.” 
The motion repeatedly cites this interaction, claiming it shows the government wanted to “get something” on Owens. The motion also alleges the federal government concealed this transcript from the defense. 
“To coerce Mayfield, the FBI agents repeatedly reminded him that prison was in his immediate future unless he could ‘come up with something,’” the motion reads.
Owens’ motion lingers on a paragraph from the indictment in which the government asserts the undercover agent initially made contact with the district attorney after casually happening on his lounge, Downtown Cigar Company.

The government claimed a lobbyist the agent was meeting with while in town recommended the establishment. The inclusion of that detail puzzled some onlookers when the indictment was unsealed in November 2024.
And Owens alleged in his motion that it was a misrepresentation by the government. Instead, his lawyers assert that the informant knew what he was doing when he stepped into Owens’ establishment.
The motion claims the FBI began investigating Owens long before the cigar shop scene. Specifically, it pointed to a September 2022 email in which a local FBI agent discussed Owens’ businesses and wrote, “Also, we are getting Jody added as a subject to one of our investigations but that hasn’t happened yet.” 
But when a U.S. Department of Justice lawyer asked FBI special agent Lawrence Correll during an October 2024 federal grand jury proceeding whether Owens had been a target of the FBI “as somebody that had been previously mentioned as somebody who was taking bribes” at the launch of the investigation, Correll said Owens was not, according to the transcript reviewed by Mississippi Today. 
Correll answered affirmatively when the attorney asked whether the initial FBI agent had “just happened to kind of run into Owens.”
“And is it accurate to say that Owens kind of then inserted himself into this bribery scheme?” the attorney asked, and Correll responded, “That’s correct.”
The filing includes several images of Owens with a beverage in his hand, including one in which he appears slumped over, holding his head in his hand, and two with his face on the table. 
The undercover sting carried out in Jackson from 2022 to 2024 resembled FBI operations that ensnared public officials in other cities. The agents treated a councilman from Cincinnati to the same treatment, a yacht ride and an outing to a Miami cabaret club, according to news reports.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/07003728/829A5237-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-12 23:12:15.515789

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)After a marathon voting session marked by tense debate, the Legislature Monday night sent a package of bills that would limit local police cooperation in immigration enforcement to Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk.
The trio of bills includes a bill that would codify the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, a 2018 order from the state attorney general that restricts when state and local law enforcement can aid federal immigration agents.
NJ lawmakers pass bill to expand protections for women in prison

Activists who packed the rafters in the Assembly chambers in Trenton’s Statehouse cheered loudly after the bill’s passage, hailing it as a landmark moment for immigrant rights at a time when the Trump administration is pursuing an aggressive mass deportation policy. The bill passed the Assembly 46-26 and the Senate 23-13.
The Legislature’s action comes less than a week after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, leading to widespread condemnation from Trump critics.
“I, myself, was an immigrant who came here in 1978 at the age of six, and never in a million years did I ever think that we would be in a place like this today,” said bill sponsor Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Bergen). “It really breaks my heart because I feel that my family has achieved the American dream.”
Provisions of the bills would:

Prohibit law enforcement from engaging in “racially influenced policing,” like stopping someone based on their suspected immigration status and asking someone’s immigration status unless relevant to a criminal investigation.
Mandate that prosecutors inform criminal defendants of immigration consequences, limit prosecutors from telling a jury about a defendant’s immigration status in certain cases, and prevent prosecutors from assuming a non-citizen defendant is a flight risk when assessing whether they should be jailed before trial.
Bar government entities and health care facilities from collecting private information — like place of birth or social security number — in certain instances.
Direct the attorney general to develop policies for some locations — hospitals, public schools, shelters, places of worship, and courthouses — where assisting federal civil law enforcement would be prohibited.
Prohibit a government entity from selling, sharing, or transferring license plate information unless required under a warrant or required by law, and require any entity that shares records to provide notice to the person whose information was shared.
Require state officials to develop training programs explaining the legislation and mandate all state, county, and local law enforcement officers to complete the training within 60 days.
Mandate annual reporting to the attorney general about when police officers aided federal immigration agents, to be posted online.

The bills were introduced less than two weeks ago and must be signed or vetoed before Murphy leaves office Jan. 20.
While Murphy has not said whether he would sign the bills, he conditionally vetoed the bill addressing data collection, requiring both chambers to reconvene on the measure and make minor edits before passing it again (the final version passed the Assembly 45-21 and the Senate 24-12).
“I commend the sponsors for their commitment to protecting the privacy rights of all people present in this State, who might otherwise be deterred from applying for government benefits and services, or seeking needed health care or other assistance out of fear that this information could be used against them and their families by the federal government,” Murphy wrote in the conditional veto. 
Immigrant advocates have been urging the Legislature to codify the directive for more than a year. Amy Torres, executive director of New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, called Monday’s votes a “hard-earned win.”
“As these bills move to the Governor’s desk, New Jersey is one step closer to becoming a place where fear no longer dictates people’s lives,” Torres said in a statement. “This legislature has made it clear: the answer to this world’s uncertainty can be found by leading with our values. While this isn’t a finish line, it is long-awaited steady ground. These protections are a leg up on the chaos and confusion that have controlled immigrant lives for too long.”
Republican opponents of the legislation contend it creates “sanctuaries” for criminals, hinders law enforcement operations, and undermines federal immigration laws.
Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)
Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) said New Jersey has “already seen what happens when that system fails.” Fantasia noted that a Red Bank man who entered the United States illegally was charged with killing a mother and her child in an alleged drunk driving crash last year.
“That tragedy did not happen in a vacuum. It happened because of an enforcement breakdown,” she said.
Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson) said it’s a different time in America, citing the Minneapolis shooting that left Renee Good dead. The Trump administration says the agent who shot Good was defending himself from her attempts to drive her car into him.
Mukherji, who was born in India and has lived in the United States nearly his entire life, said the New Jersey legislation would restore trust between communities and law enforcement that has dropped as a result of the federal government’s actions.
“My kids and my wife and I are of a color where I wonder if I should be carrying around a passport card or a copy of my passport, because Americans are being detained and even deported by this ICE,” he said.

Voters could put a member of a state-recognized Connecticut tribe in the General Assembly, apparently for the first time, or a Republican in the 139th House District seat for the first time. It was held exclusively by Ryan since its lines were drawn after the 1990 Census and took effect in 1992.
And, just to add a little spice, there is at least an outside chance the results will be thrown out and a second special election ordered in the district, which spills across portions of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich.
The Democratic candidate is Larry Pemberton Jr., a member of the Eastern Pequot tribe, and, until very recently, an unaffiliated voter, an element of his bio that might not have been widely known on Dec. 3, the night he won the Democratic endorsement on a 9-3 vote in Montville.
The Republican nominee is Brandon Sabbag, a businessman who struggled with homelessness as a young man. And, as was disclosed Monday afternoon by The Day of New London, he also has a criminal record, with convictions for misdemeanor assault and felony witness tampering in 2018.
There is a third candidate whose name is not on the ballot but still is playing a role in two ways: Mark Adams, a Republican endorsed by the local Independent Party, is suing over his exclusion, and he is campaigning as a write-in candidate. He was the GOP nominee in 2022 and 2024.
A Superior Court judge declined to last week to dismiss Adams’ lawsuit, which claims the secretary of the state’s office wrongly refused to accept his Independent Party nomination papers over a technicality — a missing signature. Should he succeed, the remedy could be a new election.
“There is a lot of drama, a lot of expense for an election that only is going to have a 10-month impact,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
The prize in the special election is completing the remainder of Ryan’s term. In 10 months, the seat will be on the ballot again, with a full two-year term at stake. Given the hard feelings surrounding each party’s endorsement, the winner could face a primary this summer.
Neither Sabbag nor Pemberton could be reached for comment Monday.
Online court records show Sabbag was arrested in February 2016 and charged with the misdemeanor crimes of third-degree assault and third-degree strangulation. A year later, he was charged with witness tampering, a felony.
He pleaded guilty on Feb. 13, 2018 to the charges in both cases and was sentenced to probation. In a text message to The Day, he indicated the charges arose from a dispute with his romantic partner.
“There was a time when we were homeless and in a bad way,” he wrote. “Faced with those dire circumstances, we fought as many couples do.”
He told The Day they remain a couple.
“Since then, we have pulled our lives together with God’s help,” he wrote. “We all have a past. I am thankful that God’s grace is sufficient for me and he has saved me from the man I once was.”
Candelora said that Sabbag addressed the episode forthrightly.
Sabbag had previously spoken publicly of his homelessness, including in remarks to the Connecticut Mirror, but not his criminal record.
On the Democratic side, Pemberton won the endorsement over Billy Caron, a member of the Montville town council for 20 years and a long-time friend of Ryan’s. Caron was a pall bearer at the funeral.
Pemberton, who also lives in Montville, is the treasurer of the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation, which is recognized by the state but not the federal government. His brother in law is Rodney Butler, the tribal chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots, the owner of the Foxwoods Resort and Casino. 
He was backed by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, whose district includes Ledyard, Norwich and a portion of Montville. Osten is a long-time ally of the Pequots and Mohegans, and she is confident that if Pemberton is elected, he will be the first tribal member to serve in the General Assembly.
Osten’s role is a source of some hard feelings.
Caron complained that Osten interfered, lining up delegate support for Pemberton at a time when he was not yet was a registered Democrat. 
“I’ve never seen a state senator get this deep in something like this,” Caron said. “At this point, it’s kind of crazy how it went about. The delegates, none of them knew he wasn’t a Democrat.”
Caron said he has heard from some voters who intend to write in his name as a protest. Caron has not filed as a write-in candidate, so those votes will not be counted.
Osten acknowledged encouraging Pemberton to run, but she said she was not responsible for delivering delegate support.
“I didn’t have to. He called all the delegates himself,” Osten said. “Some people like to give me credit for things I didn’t do. If If they want to give me credit for it, fine.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_067-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 22:58:25.843263

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland Public Defender Natasha Dartigue stressed that the launch Monday of a new partnership to change the state’s criminal justice system is not just another “task force.”
“This launch is a call to action,” Dartigue said at the public defender’s training center in Linthicum Heights. “The work will be difficult at times, and it will be long. We won’t solve the problems in weeks or even months, but as long as we stay committed and keep impacted communities at the center of every decision … we can make significant change in Maryland.”
The launch of the Maryland Justice Partnership, which will be led by the public defender’s office, comes two days before the General Assembly convenes Wednesday for the 90-day legislative session in Annapolis. The timing is intentional: Dartigue said the launch was scheduled now “because we need coordinated implementation as bills move through committee.”
The partnership aims to implement recommendations of the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative, a historic alliance between the public defender and the Maryland Attorney General’s Office that dissolved Nov. 26, after two years of work.
The group presented 18 recommendations to end mass incarceration that include decreasing use of excessive by police, increasing mental health services in jails and improving the parole process. About three dozen groups of state agencies, law enforcement personnel and nonprofit and community organizations, among others, were part of that collaborative.

Some of those same individuals, such as Gordon Pack, traveled to Linthicum Heights Monday to join the new partnership.
“The beautiful thing about collaboration and having the state involved in these things is that you can see things from every perspective,” said Pack, a formerly incarcerated individual who now does advocacy work focused on reforms to probation, parole and reduce recidivism in jails and prisons.
At least one state official who joined Pack and dozens of other criminal justice reform advocates was Betsy Fox Tolentino, acting secretary for the Department of Juvenile Services.
“We’re going to be able to hear from lots of different stakeholders, really listen closely [and] understand how everyone’s experiencing the system,” she said in a brief interview after the launch Monday.
“When we understand that, then we can come together and come up with real solutions that get the outcomes that we want to see for all our young people, all our communities,” Tolentino said.
Some work will focus on youth, according to a partnership summary, calling for the state to institute restorative practices, expand graduation pathways to complete GED programs without leaving school and strengthen judicial training for judges to understand adolescent brain development, implicit bias and trauma.
Another push is to for the state to stop automatically charging youth as adults, legislation that is scheduled to be reintroduced this year and sponsored by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery) after failing in the 2025 session.
The bill last year would have raised the age at which a youth could be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with certain crimes, including first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Two other pieces of legislation the collaborative did support passed in the 2025 session: the Second Look Act, which gives those incarcerated for at least 20 years the ability to petition for a sentence reduction, if they met several other criteria; and medical and geriatric parole, whih requires parole hearings for those over age 60 who are incarcerated with severe medical conditions.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Similar to the collaborative, the new partnership will comprise six implementation hubs: community safety and crisis response; pretrial justice and diversion; behavioral health justice; fair sentencing and parole reform; community reintegration and stability; and youth justice and educational equity.
A main statistic the partnership likes to cite about the importance of its work: Blacks account for about 30% of the state’s population, but make up about 71% of the state’s prison population.
Terri Collins-Green, director of social work in the public defender’s office, said work to reduce mass incarceration must also include assessing mental health.
“When mental health services are inaccessible … [they] are too often met with law enforcement rather than care,” she said.

On the opening day of what promises to be a 10-day trial over which regulations should remain in place under Missouri’s voter-approved abortion rights amendment, lawyers for Planned Parenthood argued the restrictions were “petty, demanding and increasingly aggressive,” and became increasingly so as more anti-abortion lawmakers were elected to the statehouse.
“The most consistent thing about abortion provisions in Missouri is that it’s been inconsistent,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates clinics in Columbia and the Kansas City area, testified Monday. 
As the trial kicked off in a Jackson County courtroom, the Missouri Attorney General’s Office renewed its plea for access to abortion patient records, including patient complaints and ER transfers. So far, a judge has denied the state’s attempt to access these records.
“We’ve had to fight tooth and nail to find smoking gun evidence,” Peter Donohue, an assistant attorney general, said Monday after appealing the court’s decision to allow Planned Parenthood to submit a summary chart of patient complications rather than records.
Vanessa Pai-Thompson, an attorney with Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the state’s continued efforts “a last-ditch attempt to find a there there.” 
Abortion rights returned to Missouri one year ago. Access never did

Assistant Solicitor General Alexandria Overcash painted for the judge a picture of a hypothetical woman faced with an unintended pregnancy. Maybe she’s young and lacks a strong safety net. Maybe she can’t afford a baby, or is unsure if she is ready to be a mother.
Then Overcash detailed a world where the woman goes to an abortion provider and is shown an ultrasound. A state-mandated informed consent booklet is handed to her with other options and she is required to wait 72-hours before she can get an abortion. 
This scenario, Overcash said, exists if the state’s current abortion regulations are upheld as part of a system designed to protect women in “emotionally fraught and medically-risky circumstances.” 
But the first two witnesses in the case, called by Planned Parenthood, said dozens of unnecessary restrictions ensure access to abortion remains limited, if not impossible. As a result, only a few dozen in-clinic abortions were performed in recent years, as restrictions continued to pile up, compared to more than 20,000 a few decades earlier. Medication abortion remains inaccessible.
These restrictions came to a head in 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion and Missouri’s trigger law banning nearly all abortions went into effect. 
Two years later, 52% of Missourians voted to add reproductive health care protections, including access to abortion up to the point of fetal viability, into the state constitution. The amendment prevents the state from denying, interfering with or otherwise restricting abortion. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri sued the state a day after the vote, asking that a few dozen abortion regulations, commonly referred to as “targeted regulation of abortion providers” or TRAP laws, be struck down as unconstitutional under the new amendment.
The regulations, which will be dissected in court over the next two weeks, include: 

The state’s near-total abortion ban, as well as gestational limits on abortion.
The required distribution of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion.
A 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion.
A requirement that the same doctor who saw the patient at the initial appointment also provide the abortion.
A ban on prescribing medication abortion to patients via telemedicine.
A requirement that only doctors be able to provide abortions.
Abortion facility licensing requirements, including building specifications.
Mandatory pelvic exams prior to the administration of medication abortion.
Admitting privileges and a written transfer agreement at a nearby hospital.
Complication plan for medication abortion that must be approved by the state health department. 
Providers who prescribe medication abortion must carry tail insurance that is effective for 21 years after the abortion takes place. 
All pregnancy tissue removed during procedural abortions must be submitted to a pathologist for review.

If the courts decide to strike down these regulations, Missourians will be able to access abortion closer to home and earlier in pregnancy, Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, based in eastern Missouri, Springfield and Illinois, testified Monday.
The regulations being challenged in the lawsuit caused frustration for patients and made it difficult to hire and retain staff, Wales testified, especially for providers under the threat of criminalization. 
“I felt under a microscope. I felt targeted. This is nothing like what I’ve experienced in a nursing home or hospital,” Wales recalls clinic staff saying.

(Courtesy of City of Omaha)OMAHA — The publicly funded Omaha Inland Port Authority has taken new strides — including hiring three more top managers and greenlighting the purchase of long-awaited business park property — to help attain its goal of creating jobs and economic prosperity in one of Nebraska’s poorest areas.
Authorized by a 2021 state law, the port authority essentially launched in mid-2024 when the Omaha City Council confirmed its nine-member governing board. The entity is empowered with economic development tools, including the ability to issue revenue bonds for construction in a district spanning roughly 3,000-acres of northeast Omaha near Eppley Airfield.
In recent weeks, the board and Garry Clark, who was installed last summer  as OIPA’s inaugural executive director, assembled the economic development team to guide an initial $120 million investment into the district by the state.

Public records show the three new hires, who bring a combined five decades of experience, earning salaries ranging from $135,000 to $165,000 a year. Clark’s salary is $210,000. 
Another person is likely to be hired to coordinate a planned “innovation district” within the boundaries, said Thomas Warren, an OIPA board member who is also Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr.’s chief of staff.
“We are at a critical juncture,” said Warren. “It’s important we establish the proper foundation … and we have leadership in place now to administer the funds and to carry out the goals and objectives defined in the legislation.”
Key tasks before the group include oversight of about $90 million the Legislature directed from pandemic recovery funding to create a shovel-ready industrial business park. The board is working with a private developer selected by the state to carry out that project, which is supposed to draw jobs and economic vitality. Another major undertaking is establishment of an “innovation district” for tech  jobs and housing, launched with another $30 million allocated by the Legislature.
 Pivotal step

At its monthly meeting last week, the OIPA board took a significant step in what has been a tumultuous and yearslong process toward producing the business park.

While Gov. Jim Pillen in January 2024 awarded the funds to a development team led by the Omaha Economic Development Corp., Burlington Capital and Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, a tweak in state statute required the developers to get buy-in from OIPA. The board had withheld the release of all but about $7.4 million from the developer until certain assurances were met.
Board action last week released roughly $40 million more of the grant, allowing the development group to potentially acquire three sites on which to develop the business park. The remainder will be disbursed in monthly installments over the next year, Warren said. 
OIPA board members and the development team declined to disclose one of the three locations, saying it was premature and could jeopardize the transaction. The other sites are 5906 Abbott Drive, a 13-acre site with a new 150,000-square-foot warehouse and 148-stall surface parking area; and Enterprise Industrial Park, near 16th and Locust Streets, which has about 41 developable acres and environmental cleanup costs.
It is possible that not all three purchases become final. Developers say they’re still exploring other sites as well.
The development team has scheduled a public meeting for 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Venue at the Highlander in North Omaha to discuss progress, including “news about land acquisition.”

“We want to keep the community informed and involved every step of the way,” said Michael Maroney, CEO of the Omaha Economic Development nonprofit. A news release asks that community members come to share ideas and give input. 
George Achola, a Burlington spokesman, said splitting the business park project into multiple sites — rather than a single 160-acre tract earlier pursued as a priority — should not deter from the original mission. 
“I don’t think it changes the original objective,” he said. “The whole North and South Omaha recovery plan was about how to put into place activities that will generate jobs, be economic drivers for the community and improve the aesthetics. Those objectives are still there.”
Execution of the park grant has been delayed by factors including OIPA demands that the developer be clearer with financial details and more transparent with area residents. Early on, the proposal was mired in controversy over potential displacement of longtime homeowners to make way for the industrial-focused project at the sprawling tract west of the airport and north of Carter Lake, which  has since been eliminated from consideration. 
Current sites do not call for residential relocation, officials have said. Clark said one could become home to a hub where creative and cutting-edge forms of housing are built for distribution.  
 Innovation District update 

 

OIPA sends letter to state, demands balance of funds 
The Omaha Inland Port Authority has upped its demand for the remainder of $11.2  million it believes it is due from the state.
An attorney for the OIPA sent a Jan. 7 letter to State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg, asking that the $8.9 million balance be released by Wednesday.
Levy thanked Spellerberg for the $2.3 million released in December but said the port authority is due the remainder of state interest funds.
“This timeline should allow ample time to respond and avoid further delay and unnecessary action,” said the letter by David Levy of Baird Holm Law. 
State officials have denied transferring any more funding, saying that after the end of fiscal year 2025 budget reconciliation, the interest amounts in the applicable fund and available to the port authority was $2.3 million.
Reached Monday, a Treasurer’s Office spokesperson that it was preparing a formal response and had no other immediate comment.


Also new at the port authority is the completion of a roughly 100-page consultant’s report on the planned innovation district, in which the state has invested $30 million. Legislation approved in 2024 called also for at least 150 new apartments and 20 new houses in the district.
Led by HR&A Advisors, the consulting team including local partners Lamp Rynearson and Vireo, was paid $546,000 and worked several months, including holding community input meetings, on producing a “roadmap” to building wealth and opportunities. 
The report said the first phase of the district should deliver the mandated 170 residential units and a dedicated innovation building of about 100,000 square feet for retail, office and flexible space. 
Other sources — including discounted or free land, tax-increment funding and low-income housing tax credits — are likely to help subsidize the first phase, consultants said. Their report said other public funding options such as the Port Infrastructure Development Program and Omaha’s Capital improvement plan and philanthropy should be pursued.
Clark said the goal is for the port authority district to be self-sustaining in the future, with operational revenue envisioned from sources such as rents, events, corporate and philanthropy sponsorship and private investment. 
The board has yet to review the HR&A report and determine how to implement the consultant’s findings. 
Among report highlights:

Community workshops revealed a preference for the district to follow a “re-imagined urban area” model without homeowner displacement. That means a mix of uses that “embraces the reuse of existing buildings, preserving the neighborhood’s historic architecture while creating new investment opportunities.” 
Top programming areas sought by community members included an entrepreneur revolving loan fund, homeownership assistance programs and funding for owner-occupied home repairs.
Top industries to focus on included construction, agriculture, financial, bio-based manufacturing and media/entertainment technologies. Another idea was health innovations that could involve institutions like Nebraska Medicine and University of Nebraska Medical Center.




 Team expands at Omaha port authority 

The new year starts with three additional economic development experts hired to help build and operate Omaha’s Inland Port Authority district. The area is one of five such districts across the state designed to help increase jobs and economic development.

A news release said she brings more than 30 years of experience, served as past president of the Nebraska Economic Developers Association and received the distinction of Nebraska Economic Developer of the Year. Her salary is $165,000. 
“This is a pivotal moment for north and east Omaha and for the region as a whole,” said McKeone, who holds a master’s degree in economic development and entrepreneurship from Peru State College. “I look forward to partnering with community members, industry leaders and local stakeholders to help drive long-term, meaningful impact.”
Myah Lanoux-Nguyen, chief of staff, previously served as senior director of strategy and operations at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where she oversaw workforce development, micro-credential expansion and online learning strategies to meet the state’s evolving talent needs.

She will work to strengthen the port authority’s organizational infrastructure and help ensure cohesion among its growing projects. Her salary is $145,000.
A first-generation college graduate, Lanoux holds a master’s degree in healthcare administration from Des Moines University and a bachelor’s from Metropolitan State University.   
James Caraway II, senior director of real estate and industry, most recently served as senior economic developer at Omaha Public Power District, where he worked on business recruitment and major industrial and technology-focused projects.
In past roles with the Greater Omaha Chamber and Sarpy Economic Development Corp., Caraway contributed to some of the region’s “most transformative economic wins” including Meta’s Papillion data center campus and expansion of LinkedIn, Clark said. His salary is $135,000 a year.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A divided Legislature approved a bill Monday that would limit restaurants’ ability to provide their customers with plastic utensils and condiment packets.
The bill, if signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy, would require full-service restaurants to provide dine-in customers with only washable, reusable utensils, and it would bar them from giving takeout customers single-use cutlery unless the customer asks for it.
Casual dining restaurants, like fast food restaurants, would be able to provide disposable utensils or single-use condiment packets to all customers only upon request.
In all cases, restaurants would only be able to provide customers with single-use utensils and condiments in the amounts a customer requests.
Sen. Bob Smith (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)
“We have the single-use bags under control in New Jersey. Literally billions of bags are being taken out of the environment. I’m hoping with the utensil bill that we’ll greatly reduce the amount of plastics that are out in the environment,” said bill sponsor Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), who chairs the body’s environment committee.
The Senate approved the measure in a narrow 21-15 vote (21 votes are needed to pass). It passed the Assembly 43-24.
School cafeterias, health care facilities, and correctional facilities would not be subject to the bill’s restrictions, and it would not apply to food court restaurants until two years after it goes into effect.
Smith said he hopes changes in how the public views plastics would eventually end the need for those exemptions, which he said helped secure the bill’s passage.
“I’m hopeful that there’ll be an evolution. The truth of the matter is that the reasons for the requests for exemptions are pretty weak,” he said.
The bill would also permit casual dining restaurants to make single-use utensils available through self-serve dispensers, a provision key to winning support from some of the bill’s one-time opponents.
“We appreciate Senator Smith’s willingness to work with us and to incorporate several of our proposed amendments to improve the bill’s workability, including allowing utensils and condiments to be made available in open, self-service trays,” said Amanda Stone, vice president of public affairs for the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association. “We believe collaboration is essential to reducing waste without placing unnecessary burdens on small businesses or their customers.”
The measure won little support from Republican lawmakers.
Assemblyman John Azzariti (Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)
Assemblyman John Azzariti (R-Bergen) said the ban would boost costs for New Jersey businesses and inconvenience consumers even before considering the fines that would enforce the prohibition.
“People by and large do not like the plastic bag ban, and they will not like the limitations on plastic utensils and micromanagement of condiments by this legislation,” he said on the Assembly floor.
All food service businesses would be barred from dispensing packets containing multiple disposable utensils or condiments 12 months after the bill goes into effect. The bill goes into effect at the start of the seventh month following its signing.
Prepackaged food items that come with a disposable utensil or single-use condiment would be exempt from the bill’s restrictions, and the bill would not bar restaurants from providing single-use cups for condiments.
Restaurants that violate the bill’s limits would first face a warning. On a second offense, they would face a $100 fine, which escalates to $250 for subsequent offenses. Money collected by those fines would flow into a state fund that pays for litter pickup, recycling grants, and graffiti removal.
The move to limit the use of disposable utensils is the latest in a series of moves to lessen the amount of plastic waste in New Jersey.
The state has barred grocery stores and food service businesses, among others, from dispensing single-use plastic bags and some polystyrene foam packaging since May 2022, and stores have been barred from providing plastic straws absent a customer request since late 2021.
Smith said he hopes to pass legislation requiring packaging producers to incrementally reduce their use of non-recyclable packaging and phase out certain hazardous packaging materials.
“Not that I’m happy with any plastics, but you shouldn’t be using plastics with toxins in them. That’s like a double or triple hit. That will be the next step, I hope, in the next term,” Smith said.

It’s unclear how much federal funding will be available to cover those costs. Gov. Bob Ferguson will ask President Donald Trump for a major disaster declaration to open up funding. 
The most notable example of infrastructure damage from the December storms is U.S. Route 2. 
The highway, a major east-west crossing in Washington over the Cascades, was closed for over two weeks along a nearly 50-mile stretch between Skykomish and Leavenworth. Parts of the roadway collapsed entirely.
But the state has since reopened the highway on both sides of Stevens Pass for limited travel with temporary fixes. Permanent repairs will take months.
Specifically, work on the stretch of Highway 2 from milepost 58 to milepost 70 on the east slopes of the pass likely won’t be done until July. 
The still-closed segment through Tumwater Canyon near Leavenworth could reopen by March. That work includes rebuilding the roadway embankment. Further work will then be needed over the summer when the weather is warmer. Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith has said there are more than 16 washed-out or damaged areas in Tumwater Canyon.
There’s currently a detour around this area using the Chumstick Highway, but officials caution that this is a rural county road and not a recommended route for cross-state travel.

On the western end of Highway 2, near Skykomish, the state is developing plans to replace a culvert and make other permanent repairs.
Repairs on other highways will also take a while.
On U.S. 12 near Naches, the “roadway was gone,” Roark said. He hopes to have the highway repaired by the end of the month.
Repairs to U.S. 101 south of Forks on the Olympic Peninsula are anticipated for the summer, at earliest. It’s an area prone to landslides. About 20 years ago, the state built a retaining wall to support the highway embankment. 
“And we’re going to get to do it again,” Roark said, noting a “big section of roadway is moving into the Bogachiel River.”
U.S. 101 is open to alternating one-way traffic.
And similarly, on State Route 542, also known as the Mount Baker Highway, one-way traffic is getting drivers up to the ski area. 
“There’s quite a bit of work to do here to restore the drainage and repair the roadway,” Roark said. “We anticipate getting that contract underway soon. I don’t have an estimated date I can give you for repairing the roadway, but the work’s going to get underway fairly shortly.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/State-Route-542-damage-december-flooding-1024x771.jpg,,,2026-01-12 20:57:25.135347

Hershey, Jr. (R-Upper Shore) says lawmakers should restrain spending to address the state's $1.5 billion budget deficit in the 2026 legislative session. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)For the second straight year, Maryland legislators are arriving in Annapolis with a budget shortfall of more than $1 billion.
In the eyes of the GOP, the minority party in both House and Senate, the deficit presents a new opportunity to hone a small-government message.
“Government has out-sized itself,” said Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R- Upper Shore). “We’ve gotten to the point where there’s more government than people need.”
Because Democrats hold commanding majorities in each chamber, and a Democrat sits in the governor’s mansion, Hershey acknowledges that his party’s role will be a “responsive” one.
“We are going to take a good look at the type of legislation that comes in from the majority party and see the issues that they think are important,” Hershey said. “Because we know what’s important to Marylanders, and that’s the affordability, energy and accountability of government.”
To resolve last year’s budget woes — to the tune of $3.3 billion — lawmakers enacted a combination of budget cuts and tax and fee increases. Then came Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) announcement of a buyout offer for state workers and government-wide hiring freeze.
But the arrangement didn’t provide a lasting fix. In November, state officials told lawmakers that they were projecting a roughly $1.5 billion deficit for the 2027 fiscal year — five times more than what was predicted at the end of the last legislative session.

And from there, matters may only get worse, said state officials, who noted that pressures such as inflation, Medicaid costs and the consequences of tariffs were all to blame for the worsening deficit picture.
“When we talk about the budget this year … It’s about the $3 billion deficit next year and a $3.5 [billion deficit] the following year,” Hershey said. “We want to address not just the structure, but the symptoms. Why are we getting to that point?”
Ask Republican leadership, and the medicine might be paring back state spending, including on the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a costly “unfunded mandate” for the state’s education system, in Hershey’s words.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said that the Blueprint money is well-intentioned, and some elements are worth keeping, but “we just can’t afford it.”
“Spending money is not necessarily the immediate pathway towards success in education,” Buckel said. “You also have to be fiscally responsible to your taxpayers. You can’t just simply say the answer is always more.”
On Thursday, Moore announced a $10.2 billion allocation for education in his proposed budget, a $373.8 million increase over the previous fiscal year. His proposal includes $480.5 million for school construction.
“Maryland has the talent and the drive to have the best schools in the country, but that requires more than just high standards — it requires us to continue making historic investments,” Moore said in a statement.
Buckel said that the legislature should halt raises for some state employees, while ensuring that law enforcement and mental health services are properly staffed and funded.

“We have to hire more people in corrections, public safety and the sort of mental health professions, because if you let those things go, it has deleterious effect on all of your society,” he said. “We have to restrain the growth in state employment. We have tremendous state employees — I think they have been the recipient of quite a bit of raises over the last four or five years.”
During an election year, legislators on both sides of the aisle seem intent on avoiding tax increases, and focusing on pocketbook issues, though with vastly different approaches.
Energy bills, for instance, are once again likely to draw significant debate. And while many Maryland Democrats have put blame onto regional grid operator PJM — arguing that it failed to plan for massive surges in demands primarily caused by data centers — Republicans have argued that the state’s climate mandates have made matters worse.
By law, the state must reduce its carbon emissions 60% below 2006 levels by 2031. Moore has also previously touted his goal for the state to rely entirely on clean energy by 2035.
Hershey argues that observers need not look any further than the recent ballooning of the Strategic Energy Investment Fund. Fueled by utilities, that can make alternative compliance payments in lieu of purchasing renewable energy, the fund has grown exponentially in recent years. The General Assembly tapped into the fund, which pays for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, last year to provide ratepayers with an $80 refund on their utility bills, and to help balance the budget.
“Generators can’t get enough renewable energy. Our goals are too high,” Hershey said. “As soon as Gov. Moore takes overpayments from electric bills and puts it into the general fund, that’s a tax.”
This General Assembly session is also likely to feature sparring between Constellation — which already owns several power plants in the state and has proposed a new natural gas plant — and Exelon, its former parent company that by law can’t build and operate generation, but wants to.
Hershey, for one, is open to the idea of allowing Exelon to build generating plants, though with guardrails. Constellation is a private company, meaning its power plant would be funded by investors, whereas Exelon can use ratepayer funds.
“There’s a way to take a look at it,” Hershey said of Exelon’s proposal. “It’d be very specific on making sure that this is not rate-based, and at the same time making sure that customers aren’t paying for anything until electrons are being generated.”

Amid President Donald Trump’s (R) widespread immigration crackdown — which doubled the number of arrests by immigration enforcement in Maryland last year — the issue is also likely to feature prominently in this year’s legislative session.
In some Maryland counties, the sheriff’s departments enter into agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let deputies take on certain immigration enforcement abilities. In Maryland, those partnerships, called 287(g) agreements, are largely restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.
Lawmakers are expected to take up legislation in the 2026 session that would ban such agreements, after Democrats’ unsuccessful attempt to do so last legislative session.
Buckel calls the effort is performative “virtue signaling.”
“If you’ve taken the right to be here unlawfully – and I understand that — I couldn’t imagine growing up in Ecuador and wanting a better life and you can’t get into the United States. I might take that chance too,” Buckel said during a December interview. “But if you came in illegally and did the best you can, and then it turns out you’re a member of MS-13 and you’re dealing drugs and you get thrown in the Montgomery County jail, I don’t understand why we wouldn’t allow the law enforcement officials for those individuals to work with the federal government.”
Hershey, who argued that Maryland should “let the feds continue to do their job,” with regard to immigration, said he believes that 80% of Marylanders wouldn’t list immigration issues as their biggest concern — even though Democrats will focus on it closely.
“This will be just used to take the focus off what the real important issues are — and that’s whether or not the Democrats are going to raise taxes this year,” Hershey said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_jan12_hersh_sitdown6-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 20:57:25.135347

Lindstedt was tapped to replace former Sen. Faith Winter in the Senate following Winter’s death late last year.
Nguyen was elected to the Broomfield City Council in 2023. He previously worked for Lt. Gov. Dianne Primavera for about five years. He is the first Vietnamese American in the Colorado Legislature.
“We face an uncertain future right now, but I promise to be a leader that bridges the gap. We need more young people. We need more people of color,” he said ahead of the vote.
“I value effective government and practical solutions, so it is my mission as a state representative to give us all a fighting chance to succeed, regardless of our background,” he said.

(Photo by Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)As Idaho lawmakers convened Monday for the beginning of a legislative session that will be marked by spending cuts, Republican and Democratic party leaders were in stark contrast regarding the budget situation. 
Republican legislative leaders in the House say the projected budget deficits faced by the state are a good opportunity to trim the fat on state budgets, while Democrats point to large income tax cuts approved over the last few years that have created a “self-inflicted budget crisis.” 
“This isn’t a big deal,” House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said Monday at a press conference. “It’s going to be easy to get through.” 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

The latest state reports show an estimated $40.3 million state budget deficit by the end of the current fiscal year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. That deficit has been projected to grow to between $555.2 million and $1 billion for the next fiscal year. 
“The Idaho Legislature blew it,” Assistant Minority Leader Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said Monday. “It voluntarily reduced revenue year after year for five years.”
The non-partisan, nonprofit the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy issued a report in November showing that the state Legislature’s income tax cuts over the last five years have reduced state revenue by a total of around $4 billion, the Sun reported. 
Idaho Gov. Brad Little in his annual State of the State address put forth his plan to balance the budget, and said Idaho was well-positioned to “weather the revenue challenges ahead.”
 Republicans eye tax relief, potential cuts of Medicaid 

Within the first few weeks of session, lawmakers must decide whether or how to conform to federal tax changes made under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress. Those changes will reduce state revenue by over $100 million — although estimates vary widely.
“The Big Beautiful Bill has 39 components that deal with taxes, and I firmly believe the Legislature is going to conform with most, if not all of them,” Moyle said. “And that’s good, because it’s tax relief for all Idaho citizens. So we’re in good shape that way, and we will do that one first, and then we might look at some other stuff, but make sure that we conform to as many of those 39 as we can.” 
Little on Monday proposed $45 million in Medicaid cuts, but not a full repeal of Medicaid expansion — the program approved in 2018 by voters through a ballot initiative to expand coverage to those who fell in the gap between traditional Medicaid coverage and those who qualified for subsidies to afford health care through the state health insurance marketplace. 
Moyle signaled support for a potential repeal, saying its costs have increased. 
“If we keep dumping all that money in the Medicaid hole, it’s going to have an effect on those other budgets,” he said. “So I hope we look at it, hope we discuss it, and maybe in those discussions we can come up with a path forward.” 
 Democrats call for repeal of school choice tax credit, use of rainy day funds, protecting expansion

The Idaho legislative Democratic leaders argued that the state’s budget concerns could be fixed by eliminating the $50 million school choice tax credit, a program approved last year that makes available $5,000 grants to be used for educational expenses such as private school tuition. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said the state should also consider using state reserves, known as the Rainy Day Fund, and postponing the $400 million total tax cuts approved last year until “we can afford it.” 
The Democrats opposed cuts to Medicaid expansion because it would remove health care coverage for around 90,000 people, and that it would negatively impact the economy by removing the federal funds that go to the program.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A state board governing charter schools has decided it’s seen enough from Proud To Partner Leadership Academy and voted Monday to “pull the plug” on the school.
The Statewide Charter School Board made the rare decision to issue a notice of termination to the charter high school in southwest Oklahoma City. Seven board members voted in favor and two abstained.
The decision sets in motion the process of closing the school once the current academic year ends and voiding its charter contract. The 100 students attending the school, known as PTPLA, then would have to return to their neighborhood school districts or find another educational option.
The board placed PTPLA on probation in November over financial, operational and academic quality concerns. Members of the state board grew frustrated with what they considered to be an uncooperative response from the school’s leadership. 
“That’s what we always ask for is a spirit of cooperation and desire to work together to improve the outcomes at the school,” board Chairperson Brian Shellem said after Monday’s meeting. “As it continued to progress, it seemed like it got harder and harder.”

State officials said they still had more questions than answers after three months of probation and multiple meetings with PTPLA.
The board’s staff made three visits to the school this fall and reported seeing only one teacher giving instruction. PTPLA leaders contend the report is inaccurate.
Rebecca Wilkinson, executive director of the state board, said she observed students with a computer open but not logged in, others not completing any work, seven who were sleeping or had their heads down, and some who were unable to say what course or topic they were studying, all of which raised concerns about the school’s educational quality.
PTPLA, which opened in 2024, faced scrutiny over weak finances, as well. It laid off four teachers in October and finished the previous school year in a budget deficit. 
State officials also complained of missed deadlines and other unfulfilled obligations by the school’s administration.
“My opinion is it’s time to pull the plug,” statewide board member William Pearson said before the vote. “It’s time to move to termination.”
Despite the school’s struggles, PTPLA leaders told the state they had “nothing to fix.”

School founder and Superintendent Dawn Bowles said her students now face the prospect of returning to “schools that were not serving them in the first place.”
“Our next feat will be, what is our next move to make sure that we don’t drop the ball on the ones that we’ve committed to serving,” Bowles said. “We will continue to serve them. We will continue to educate them. We will continue to provide opportunities outside of education, and we will continue to be their village as we move forward because this is what we consider to be the greater way.”

Josh Shapiro. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)With months to go before November’s gubernatorial election, state Treasurer and Republican frontrunner Stacy Garrity used her first candidate appearance of 2026 to repeatedly attack Gov. Josh Shapiro at a Pennsylvania Press Club event on Monday in downtown Harrisburg. 
Garrity took her first shot at Shapiro 15 seconds into her half hour speech, painting him as someone “who talks to the national press first” rather than state-level media. She mentioned the sitting governor by name at least 30 times. 
She earned the state GOP’s endorsement in September, but still must secure her spot in the general election by winning the May primary. She is currently running unopposed. Garrity first won her state row office position in 2020 and was reelected in 2024. 










We will utilize the God-given resources under our feet to fuel the technological revolution of the 21st century.


– Stacy Garrity, Republican candidate for governor


Reflecting on her three decades of service with the U.S. Army Reserve, where she rose to the rank of colonel, Garrity shared the story of an abused Iraqi woman and her children who she said she helped secure a divorce. 
“I’m pretty sure that I am the only American to get an Iraqi woman divorced,” she quipped. “(She) was one of the individual tragedies of war that’s too often lost in the shuffle … Today, all across Pennsylvania, there are individual crises that go unacknowledged and unknown every day.”
These crises included steep electricity bills, struggling to afford food and fatal drug overdoses — all issues Garrity pinned to Shapiro.
“The hard truth is that Josh Shapiro has failed all of them. Poverty, abuse, addiction — they’re not just an inner city issue. These are cancers plaguing every one of our communities,” Garrity said. “Those aren’t statistics; those are individual lives failed by Josh Shapiro.” 
Garrity campaign tries to walk back election denial

She accused Shapiro of blaming Trump for the state’s problems and not taking responsibility. Recognizing the pushback she received after calling Pennsylvania “mediocre” last month, Garrity said, “Pennsylvania is not reaching our potential, and the buck stops at Josh Shapiro’s desk.”
“Pennsylvania has, can and should lead, But Josh Shapiro’s failure has driven us into mediocrity,” said Garrity. “I don’t accept mediocrity and I don’t believe Pennsylvanians do either.”
Rather than suing the Trump administration — as Shapiro has repeatedly done — Garrity said she would “ work with President (Donald) Trump to make sure that Pennsylvania gets back on the right track.“ 
Several Democrat-led states have utilized the legal system to retain federal funds or defend state laws. For example, Pennsylvania joined a litany of states that sued over food assistance funding cut by the Trump administration during last year’s federal shutdown. 
When asked, Garrity declined to identify any areas where she disagreed with Trump. It’s something the state Democratic Party condemned in a statement alongside criticism of her views on abortion and prior statements questioning the results of the 2020 election. 
“Stacy Garrity’s flailing campaign was on full display as she doubled down on her extreme, toxic positions,” said a party statement. “Garrity made it clear Pennsylvanians cannot trust her to do what’s right for working families.” 
 A Garrity administration

Garrity briefly touched on her achievements in office, including investments in college savings plans and tripling assets under PA ABLE, a program that benefits Pennsylvanians with disabilities. Additionally, her office has prioritized returning millions of dollars to taxpayers and distributing state-held military decorations — including Purple Hearts, Bronze Stars and one Gold Star — to veterans.
“I guess you could say we’ve gotten stuff done,” panned Garrity, invoking Shapiro’s administrative catchphrase. “You see, getting stuff done is not a catchy political pathway. It’s something I’ve prided myself in accomplishing at every point in my life — because I believe actions speak louder than words.”
Shapiro’s version often includes the explicative, or “Get s*** done.” He has used that wording, for example, to describe the rapid rebuilding of a damaged bridge outside of Philadelphia. 
“My question for Josh Shapiro: What about 3,000 deficient bridges found in nearly every community across our commonwealth?” Garrity said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She pitched ending “wasteful” turnpike transfers, adding accountability for transit agencies — a reference, perhaps, to the evergreen debate about SEPTA funding in Harrisburg — and prioritizing freight. Additionally, she said artificial intelligence would be used to “predict maintenance needs, reduce congestion, prevent waste, and deliver projects faster and cheaper.”
Despite public skepticism over the deployment of AI and the resource-hungry data centers that power it, Garrity enthusiastically shared her vision for growing its development by tapping into the state’s natural gas stores.
“We will utilize the God-given resources under our feet to fuel the technological revolution of the 21st century. Pennsylvania can power the world, but only if the Shapiro administration stops its moratorium,” said Garrity. 
Former Gov. Tom Wolf signed a moratorium on new drilling leases for oil and gas in state parks in forests prior to Shapiro taking office. Natural gas prices are currently sinking to new lows and eating into profit margins. 
Noting that nearly two-thirds of the state’s 67 counties are rural, she said there were “a lot of areas where you can put data centers” in welcoming communities. Grassroots groups have popped up across the state opposing such efforts. 
Garrity also vowed to improve the state’s education rankings, specifically by addressing reading achievement in third grade and making sure students were proficient in math and reading before entering high school. 
 Garrity campaign positions

The gubernatorial candidate briefly touched on a bevy of issues, including the following:

Lieutenant Governor: Citing the recent news of state Sen. Doug Mastriano’s (R-Franklin) decision not to run against her, Garrity said there’s been “renewed interest” in the competition to be her running mate. “I know that we will have the absolute best partner as lieutenant governor when the time’s right,” she told reporters in a brief scrum following the luncheon. 


The 2020 election: When asked if Trump won the 2020 election, she said “absolutely not,” though in 2022 she said otherwise. “Just to be clear, that was at a Trump rally and … it’s easy to get caught up in a Trump rally. But I have to tell you that, after the 2020 election, I know Joe Biden was the president. I was painfully away of it.” At a separate 2021 rally, Garrity said the previous November’s election would be “tarnished forever.” She later told the Capital-Star her comment was about just one state Senate race, not the overall outcome. 


Property taxes: Garrity called the state’s property tax rate “one of the highest in the nation” and vowed to lower bills for seniors. The Tax Foundation ranks the Pennsylvania rate as the 13th highest in the country. 


Abortion: “My position on abortion has never changed: I am pro-life, but I am for exceptions.” She didn’t list those exceptions at Monday’s event.


Recreational marijuana legalization: Garrity said she didn’t believe there was “as much revenue in the legalization of marijuana as you would think,” instead advocating for natural gas drilling to bring more revenue to the state. She mentioned Ohio. In that state’s first full year of marijuana sales, it netted over $700 million in its first year, though Garrity said she thought it was “under $300 million a year.”


Voter rolls: Garrity said she would comply with the Trump administration’s request for the state’s voter rolls, which the commonwealth has resisted so far. Democratic critics and groups like the Committee of Seventy have criticized the push by the Department of Justice. 


On potential ICE enforcement: Garrity indicated she would be “cooperative” with a goal to have safe communities. “You can see how states that cooperate, the results are far different than states that have not been cooperative.” Last week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis while federal agents shot two other people in Oregon. 

Taxpayer upgrades to Shapiro’s private home: “Everybody wants the governor and his family to be safe.” Rather than criticizing the security improvements made following the firebombing at the Governor’s Residence last year, she said she supported a legislative proposal to put a lien on the property to recoup taxpayer dollars if Shapiro ever sold the home.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8232-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 19:58:11.083828

“Each of these leaders has a proven track record – from empowering vulnerable communities and serving in vital county government roles to protecting our state and nation,” Moore said in a statement. “These are dedicated public servants, and I am grateful that they each raised their hands to represent their districts in Annapolis.”
Odom and Coley served on the central committee in Prince George’s.
The Prince George’s committee overwhelmingly chose Odom on Dec. 31 to replace Harris, who held the seat until he was elevated to the District 27 Senate seat, which also includes a portion of Calvert County. But four days later, on Jan. 3, Charles County Democrats selected Yanelle Moore, who chairs the county’s school board.

	Moore eventually chose Odom, who served 31 years in the Army and Coast Guard. He also worked as an acting fire chief in Prince George’s.
The committee unanimously selected Coley to replace Lewis, who stepped down to accept a job as a lobbyist for his alma mater, the University of Maryland, College Park. Coley works as a deputy director in the county’s Department of the Environment.
On Wednesday, Howard County Democratic Central Committee selected Moreno to replace Atterbeary, who stepped down to focus on her race for Howard County executive. Moreno, who served as a member of the central committee, becomes the first Latino to represent the county in the General Assembly. Moreno is an attorney who works as the CEO of the Luminus Network Inc., a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of the immigrant community in Howard County and across the state.
The three appointments mean both the 141-member House and the 47-member Senate begin the 2026 session at full strength.
Musical chairs for the chair
Moore also announced Monday that Maryland Public Service Commission member Kumar Barve is swapping seats with PSC Chair Fred Hoover, who resigned as chair.
The switch means Barve’s term, which would have ended in 2029, will now end on June 30, 2028, and Hoover, whose term would have been up in 2028, is not extended through 2029, a PSC spokesperson said.
Both appointments still have to be approved by the Senate, but the governor’s office said the switch takes effect immediately.
No reason was given for Hoover’s resignation, but Moore said in a prepared statement that Hoover “exemplifies what it means to be a public servant and has been a tremendous partner in our efforts to build a cleaner, more reliable, more affordable energy system.”

“I’m grateful for the work Chair Hoover has done for our state, and I have full confidence in Commissioner Barve, who understands the importance of energy sustainability and grid reliability,” his statement said.
Hoover, in the same statement from the governor’s office, said it has been an honor to serve as PSC chair “during such a transformative time for Maryland’s energy sector. I am proud of what we have achieved over my past three years as chair of the commission to modernize our energy system and advance our State’s clean energy goals.”
Before being appointed to the PSC in 2023, Barved served 32 years representing Montgomery County in the House of Delegates, serving as the Democratic majority leader from 2003 to 2015, and as chair of the Environment and Transportation Committee from 2015 to 2023.
In a statement from the PSC, Barve thanked Moore for the opportunity to lead the commission “during this extraordinary period of energy transition in Maryland and in our nation.”
He said he, Moore and Hoover “agree that this moment in history requires an assortment of new policy and legislative approaches – to control energy bills and to build a more stable and sustainable energy grid. I will boldly collaborate with the Maryland Energy Administration, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Maryland General Assembly,” Barve’s statement said. “I look forward to continuing our advocacy on behalf of Maryland ratepayers before the regional grid operator, PJM, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration to stop its latest immigration enforcement surge, alleging that the increased federal actions are unconstitutional and a violation of federal law.
Attorney General Keith Ellison at a Monday press conference called the immigration enforcement surge an “invasion.”
“The deployment of thousands of armed, masked (Department of Homeland Security) agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop,” Ellison said.
Tensions between federal agents and protesters continue to escalate following the Wednesday killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross.
The suit alleges that the influx of federal agents under the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge” harms Minnesota’s police powers and violates state sovereignty, according to the lawsuit. These rights are guaranteed under the 10th Amendment, the lawsuit states.
(The 10th Amendment argument was once used by Jim Crow states that resisted civil rights laws, but Ellison and the cities are seeking to use the oft-derided 10th as a tool to protect civil rights.)
Ellison and the cities are also alleging that the federal agents are using unreasonable force against Minnesotans and arresting people without warrants, regardless of their immigration status and based on their perceived race  — violations of the federal Administrative Procedure Act.
Illinois and the city of Chicago on Monday also filed a similar lawsuit against the Trump administration. Illinois is suing over allegedly unlawful tactics used by Customs and Border Protection and ICE agents in the state.
The Trump administration will likely fight the Minnesota and Illinois lawsuits.
Cities and states in the past have sued the Trump administration to stop the deployment of National Guard troops. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court left in place a ruling by a federal judge in Chicago that bars the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois.
But the high court has let immigration officials arrest people based on their appearance and what language they speak, with the court’s conservative super-majority consistently giving Trump wide latitude to exert executive power.
The Trump administration has said that fraud of public programs is a driving factor behind the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota.
But Ellison said that stopping fraud is a pretext for the Trump administration to punish its political opponents.
“The real reason — it’s no secret. Donald Trump and his administration have been targeting people, cities and states that don’t agree with him politically,” Ellison said. “The Trump administration’s decision to target Minnesota and Twin Cities is motivated by a desire to retaliate against Trump’s perceived political opponents.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 19:58:11.083828

(File photo courtesy of Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority)New Mexico’s utility regulators have asked a San Juan County judge to order a third party takeover of private water utility Rosa Joint Ventures after allegations the utility did not turn over ownership under a prior agreement and failed to pay $275,000 in state fines.
Rosa Joint Ventures serves about 230 people near Aztec, according to the state’s drinking water database. Rosa Joint Ventures could not be reached for comment on the filing Monday, as calls to phone numbers listed for the utility played an automated message stating the number was disconnected. An emailed request for comment remained pending Monday afternoon.
The Jan. 8 legal filing said management of Rosa Joint Ventures failed to relinquish control of the utility and turn over water delivery to a new organization, the Sambrito Mutual Domestic Waters Consumer Association, which the commission ordered in 2021 after three years of hearings.
The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission regulates all privately-owned utilities in the state, including about 20 or so, mostly small, water utilities.
In a news release, Commissioner Patrick O’Connell said the PRC needs the court’s help to ensure the utility will deliver services in a “safe and reliable” manner.
“The Commission is committed to ensuring the health of our communities and the utilities that serve them,” O’Connell said. “Every order we issue is aimed at serving the public interest and Rosa Joint Ventures has shown no interest in complying with our orders.”
The PRC’s request for a receivership highlights the ongoing struggles of water safety and reliability in rural and small towns across the state and follows a similar request seeking state intervention in Timberon in September.
Along the same lines, the New Mexico Environment Department last May sued the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority in Sunland Park over longstanding problems with reliability and exceedingly high levels of arsenic.
In a December 18 PRC meeting, John Kreienkamp, a hearing examiner, told commissioners that the agency was convening a task force to “better serve the public and regulate these small water utilities.”
He said that would include determining the financial status of each utility, including the cash on hand and rates structure. It would also require information about water sources, and projected demand, and compliance with the environment department’s sanitary standards. As of December 18, they had contacted five of the 20 utilities, he told commissioners.
“We’re reviewing the responses that we’re getting from the small water utilities to figure out what our next steps are,” Kreienkamp said.
PRC Chair Gabriel Aguilera praised the effort.
“It will help us make sure that utilities are compliant with our annual reporting, and we understand their financial health, but more importantly than that is the potential to avoid these situations that leave people without water,” Aguilera said.
Concerns over the state’s water systems have also reached state lawmakers. During a Legislative Finance Committee hearing in November, a coalition of New Mexico municipalities and rural water systems said they would need an extra $200 million to fully fund water infrastructure projects across the state.

(Photo by Katheryn Houghton for KFF Health News)LODGE GRASS — Brothers Lonny and Teyon Fritzler walked amid the tall grass and cottonwood trees surrounding their boarded-up childhood home near the Little Bighorn River and daydreamed about ways to rebuild.
The rolling prairie outside the single-story clapboard home is where Lonny learned from their grandfather how to break horses. It’s where Teyon learned from their grandmother how to harvest buffalo berries. It’s also where they watched their father get addicted to meth.
Teyon, now 34, began using the drug at 15 with their dad. Lonny, 41, started after college, which he said was partly due to the stress of caring for their grandfather with dementia. Their own addictions to meth persisted for years, outlasting the lives of both their father and grandfather.
It took leaving their home in Lodge Grass, a town of about 500 people on the Crow Indian Reservation, to recover. Here, methamphetamine use is widespread.

The brothers stayed with an aunt in Oklahoma as they learned to live without meth. Their family property has sat empty for years — the horse corral’s beams are broken and its roof caved in, the garage tilts, and the house needs extensive repairs. Such crumbling structures are common in this Native American community, hammered by the effects of meth addiction. Lonny said some homes in disrepair would cost too much to fix. It’s typical for multiple generations to crowd under one roof, sometimes for cultural reasons but also due to the area’s housing shortage.
“We have broken-down houses, a burnt one over here, a lot of houses that are not livable,” Lonny said as he described the few neighboring homes.
In Lodge Grass, an estimated 60% of the residents age 14 and older struggle with drug or alcohol addictions, according to a local survey contracted by the Mountain Shadow Association, a local, Native-led nonprofit. For many in the community, the buildings in disrepair are symbols of that struggle. But signs of renewal are emerging. In recent years, the town has torn down more than two dozen abandoned buildings. Now, for the first time in decades, new businesses are going up and have become new symbols — those of the town’s effort to recover from the effects of meth.
One of those new buildings, a day care center, arrived in October 2024. A parade of people followed the small, wooden building through town as it was delivered on the back of a truck. It replaced a formerly abandoned home that had tested positive for traces of meth.
“People were crying,” said Megkian Doyle, who heads the Mountain Shadow Association, which opened the center. “It was the first time that you could see new and tangible things that pulled into town.”
 
The nonprofit is also behind the town’s latest construction project: a place where families together can heal from addiction. The plan is to build an entire campus in town that provides mental health resources, housing for kids whose parents need treatment elsewhere, and housing for families working to live without drugs and alcohol.
Though the project is years away from completion, locals often stop by to watch the progress.
“There is a ground-level swell of hope that’s starting to come up around your ankles,” Doyle said.
Two of the builders on that project are Lonny and Teyon Fritzler. They see the work as a chance to help rebuild their community within the Apsáalooke Nation, also known as the Crow Tribe.
“When I got into construction work, I actually thought God was punishing me,” Lonny said. “But now, coming back, building these walls, I’m like, ‘Wow. This is ours now.’”
  Meth ‘Never Left’ 

Meth use is a long-standing public health epidemic throughout the U.S. and a growing contributor to the nation’s overdose crisis. The drug had been devastating in Indian Country, a term that encompasses tribal jurisdictions and certain areas with Native American populations.
Native Americans face the highest rates of meth addiction in the U.S. compared with any other demographic group.

“Meth has never left our communities,” said A.C. Locklear, CEO of the National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit that works to improve health in Indian Country.
Many reservations are in rural areas, which have higher rates of meth use compared with cities. As a group, Native Americans face high rates of poverty, chronic disease, and mental illness — all are risk factors for addiction. These conditions are rooted in more than a century of systemic discrimination, a byproduct of colonization. Meanwhile, the Indian Health Service, which provides health care to Native Americans, has been chronically underfunded. Cutbacks under the Trump administration have shrunk health programs nationwide.
LeeAnn Bruised Head, a recently retired public health adviser with the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, said that despite the challenges, tribal nations have developed strong survival skills drawing from their traditions. For example, Crow people have held onto their nation’s language; neighbors are often family, or considered such; and many tribal members rely on their clans to mentor children, who eventually become mentors themselves for the next generation.
“The strength here, the support here,” said Bruised Head, who is part of the Crow Tribe. “You can’t get that anywhere else.”
  Signs of Rebuilding 

On a fall day, Quincy Dabney greeted people arriving for lunch at the Lodge Grass drop-in center. The center recently opened in a former church as a place where people can come for help to stay sober or for a free meal. Dabney volunteers at the center. He’s also the town’s mayor.
Dabney helped organize community cleanup days starting in 2017, during which people picked up trash in yards and alongside roads. The focus eventually shifted to tearing down empty, condemned houses, which Dabney said had become spots to sell, distribute, and use meth, often during the day as children played nearby.
“There was nothing stopping it here,” Dabney said.
The problem hasn’t disappeared, though. In 2024, officials broke up a multistate trafficking operation based on the Crow reservation that distributed drugs to other Montana reservations. It was one example of how drug traffickers have targeted tribal nations as sales and distribution hubs.

A few blocks from where Dabney spoke stood the remains of a stone building where someone had spray-painted “Stop Meth” on its roofless walls. Still, there are signs of change, he said.
Dabney pointed across the street to a field where a trailer had sat empty for years before the town removed it. The town was halfway through tearing down another home in disrepair on the next block. Another house on the same street was being cleaned up for an incoming renter: a new mental health worker at the drop-in center.
Just down the road, work was underway on the new campus for addiction recovery, called Kaala’s Village. Kaala means “grandmother” in Crow.
The site’s first building going up is a therapeutic foster home. Plans include housing to gradually reunite families, a community garden, and a place to hold ceremonies. Doyle said the goal is that, eventually, residents can help build their own small homes, working with experienced builders trained to provide mental health support.
She said one of the most important aspects of this work “is that we finish it.”
 
Tribal citizens and organizations have said the political chaos of Trump’s first year back in office shows the problem with relying on federal programs. It underscores the need for more grassroots efforts, like what’s unfolding in Lodge Grass. But a reliable system to fund those efforts still doesn’t exist. Last year’s federal grant and program cuts also fueled competition for philanthropic dollars.
Kaala’s Village is expected to cost $5 million. The association is building in phases as money comes in. Doyle said the group hopes to open the foster home by spring, and family housing the following year.
The site is a few minutes’ drive from Lonny and Teyon’s childhood home. In addition to building the new facility’s walls, they’re getting training to offer mental health support. Eventually, they hope to work alongside people who come home to Kaala’s Village.
As for their own home, they hope to restore it — one room at a time.

“Just piece by piece,” Lonny said. “We’ve got to do something. We’ve got these young ones watching.”

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderThe hallowed halls of Georgia’s state Capitol were abuzz Monday as lawmakers, lobbyists and everyday citizens flocked to the Gold Dome for the start of the 2026 legislative session.
For lawmakers in the state House and Senate, that means a 40-day countdown to introduce, deliberate and finalize laws for the upcoming year has officially begun. The calendar for this upcoming session, which also includes days off for holidays and committee meetings, will run from mid-January until early April. The 2026 session is also the second in a two-year cycle, meaning bills that didn’t make it across the finish line in 2025 could get a second chance this time around.
On the first day of the session, both chambers signed off on this year’s legislative schedule but not without some debate. The House passed the schedule with a 150-to-27 vote after some lawmakers objected to the Legislature being in session on Eid al-Fitr, a major religious holiday in the Islamic faith that marks the end of Ramadan. There are at least four Muslim lawmakers currently serving in Georgia. 
In the Senate, the resolution passed unanimously, but not without criticism from Sen. Nabilah Parkes, a Duluth Democrat who is Muslim.
“I am voting yes today for the good of the order, but moving forward, we should have an inclusive calendar,” she told the chamber. 
Under the calendar adopted Monday, a key deadline for bills to clear at least one chamber is set for Friday, March 6, and the last day of the session will be Thursday, April 2. 
New leadership in the Senate
The Senate kicked off the start of the 2026 legislative session by electing Sen. Larry Walker III, a Perry Republican to be the new president pro tem. Walker, who has served in the Legislature since 2015, is the son of former House majority leader Larry Walker Jr., who retired from the Legislature in 2005. 
“My father taught me that while we sit on different sides of the aisle, or come from different areas of the state, or different perspectives, we are all bound by a common duty to leave Georgia better than we found it,” Walker said in a speech following his election.
The position of president pro tem, which is the second-highest in the chamber, was previously held by state Sen. John Kennedy, a Macon Republican who resigned from his seat in December to focus on his bid for lieutenant governor. A special election to fill Kennedy’s seat will be held on Jan. 20.

In the House, three new lawmakers made their debut: Two Democrats, Rep. Akbar Ali of Gwinnett County and Rep. Eric Gisler of Watkinsville, and one Republican, Rep. Bill Fincher of Canton. All three were elected through recent special elections. 
The chamber also held a moment of silence for Fincher’s predecessor, Mandi Ballinger, who died last year after a long battle with cancer.
Two House seats are currently left vacant after Reps. Karen Bennett and Lynn Heffner announced their resignations last week. Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat, was indicted for unemployment fraud shortly after she stepped down, while Heffner, an Augusta Democrat cited damage to her home from Hurricane Helene as the reason she could no longer fulfill a state law requiring representatives to live in the districts they represent. Another House Democrat who was charged with unemployment fraud, Rep. Sharon Henderson of Covington, was present for the first day of the session Monday.
On the Senate side, two lawmakers — Democrat Jaha Howard of Smyrna and Republican Jason Dickerson of Canton — also made their first appearance as state senators.

In an interview with the Georgia Recorder, Dickerson described the experience of being a newly elected lawmaker as “surreal.”
“When you see your name up on the board for the first time, that’s when it really hits home,” he said.
But the new elected officials are not the only big change under the Gold Dome: Lawmakers returned Monday to a newly renovated state Capitol that has been restored to its original 19th century appearance, with some 21st century amenities – like a USB-C port – added to the desks. 
“You probably noticed, this people’s house is looking a little bit brighter today in every essence of that word,” House Speaker Jon Burns said. 
Advocates raise their voices
Lawmakers weren’t the only ones gearing up for the beginning of the session. Several advocacy groups held press conferences to encourage civic engagement and draw lawmakers’ attention to policy issues.
The ACLU of Georgia held a “Pack the Capitol” event alongside organizations like Indivisible Georgia Coalition and ProGeorgia to kick off the beginning of the 2026 session.
“Every law passed under this gold dome impacts 11.2 million Georgians,” said ACLU of Georgia policy and advocacy director Christopher Bruce. “That’s why the legislators need to listen more to the people than the politics. They need to listen more to the Georgians than the lobbyists.”
Georgia SNAP seeks at least $60 million after federal budget cuts

The Poor People’s Campaign and Georgia Interfaith Public Policy Center also held a press conference to advocate for the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to be fully funded. In the fall, Georgia’s SNAP administrators signaled they would need more than $60 million in additional state dollars to maintain their staffing levels amid federal cuts to the program. More than one in 10 Georgians use SNAP to buy groceries.
Wesley E. Myrick, executive director of the Georgia Interfaith Public Policy Center, said that fully funding SNAP not only helps ensure that every Georgian has access to food, but also sustains the businesses in local communities.
“Making sure that seniors, disabled persons, students and families with children have access to fresh fruits, vegetables and proteins is a critical issue for our state,” Myrick said in an interview.
Republican lawmakers in both chambers are floating additional tax cuts this session amid growing concerns about affordability, with the House proposing cutting property taxes and the Senate vying to eliminate Georgia’s state income tax by 2032. Myrick argued that those tax cuts would only benefit a segment of the population, while fully funding SNAP would help the state overall.
“Not every Georgian is a homeowner, so they’re not going to benefit from tax credits,” he said. “But every single Georgian can benefit from the economic impact of SNAP on local businesses that employ people in every corner of our state.”

About 1,200 people were in custody at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at the end of September. The facility recently increased its capacity from 1,360 to 1,530 detainees, and while Crow’s office did not get an exact number, ICE staff on Jan. 5 told Crow staff the facility was “slightly below capacity.”

Federal law gives members of Congress the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits of immigration detention facilities. Crow, an Aurora Democrat, attempted to visit the facility in July but was denied entry, prompting a lawsuit brought by Crow, Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette and other members of Congress. 
A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s policy that requires at least a week’s notice for members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to Department of Homeland Security facilities. But after Minnesota lawmakers were denied access to an ICE facility in Minneapolis Saturday, Democrats asked the judge for an emergency hearing. 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a new policy that requires seven days notice for lawmakers to conduct oversight visits, saying facilities funded through last year’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act do not need to comply with a 2019 appropriations law that allows for unannounced visits at facilities that hold immigrants. 
The Jan. 5 report from Crow’s office says the Aurora facility’s segregated transgender pods were consolidated into one pod, which holds “a few transgender detainees.” Other transgender individuals were moved to the general population, the report says. It also says “grandfathered” transgender detainees continue to receive gender-affirming medical care at the facility. 
Much of the information Crow’s office asked of ICE was not made available, and facility staff redirected his team to the ICE Office of Congressional Relations.
ICE did not respond to a request for information on the Aurora facility’s population, including the care available for transgender individuals.  
The Aurora facility, privately run by The GEO Group for ICE, is the only ICE detention center in Colorado. Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado show that the Trump administration contracted with The GEO Group in December to run another ICE detention center out of a dormant prison in Hudson. 
Crow’s staff and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper’s staff conducted a seperate visit to the Aurora facility in December.

Budget experts from both branches presented Monday to the state House Appropriations and Finance Committee, which is tasked with introducing the budget bill for lawmakers to consider when the Legislature meets for its finance-focused 30-day session. 
Wayne Propst, secretary of the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration, and Charles Sallee, director of the Legislative Finance Committee, both told the committee that their budget proposals reflect the tough economic conditions impacting the state and the rest of the country. 
“We are in a period of declining or moderating revenue growth. The executive budget is an attempt to recognize that,” Propst said at the beginning of his remarks. 
Despite the economic forces that are prompting fiscal architects to craft smaller budgets, Propst began his presentation with what he said was good news: Moody’s, the global credit rating agency, on Friday upgraded the state’s bond issuance rating. Propst said the upgrade reflects the state’s years-long strategy to invest record oil and gas revenue into revenue-generating trust funds. 
State legislators’ proposed $11.1B budget doesn’t fully fund universal child care plan for NM

As for the budget, the governor seeks just over $11.3 billion for state operations in FY27, which represents a roughly 4.7% increase over the current fiscal year ending July 1. The Legislative Finance Committee is pushing an $11.1 billion budget, representing a 2.5% increase over last fiscal year. 
The roughly $230 million difference can be accounted for, according to Source New Mexico’s review of the two budget proposals, in just a few of more than 125 line items detailed in budget documents.
The biggest difference relates to funding for the Early Childhood Education and Care Department, the agency the governor has tasked with implementing her universal childcare proposal. The governor’s budget seeks a little over $465 million for the agency, which is $163 million more than the LFC has called for in its budget. 
The extent to which the Legislature will fund the governor’s proposal during her last year in office is shaping up as a key battle during the session. State Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), told Source last week that the LFC budget is a starting point for negotiations. 
Another major difference between the two budgets centers on the state Health Care Authority, which administers major federal health and nutrition programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The governor seeks $80 million more than the LFC for the HCA, which currently has an operating budget of slightly more than $2 billion. 
Sallee said Monday that he believes Medicaid, and therefore the HCA, is overfunded by roughly $150 million, especially ahead of cuts to statewide enrollment expected due to the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
The budget proposals also reveal a potential fight over the fate of the embattled McKinley County District Attorney’s office. Lawmakers in last year’s session slashed District Attorney Bernadine Martin’s funding due to concerns about her performance; they then provided additional funding to the DA next door and asked him to take over Martin’s cases. 
Since then, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez has taken action to remove Martin from office. She is facing a trial before the Supreme Court in March that will determine whether she will be removed from office.

According to the budget records, the Legislature seeks to continue funding to the judicial district Martin now runs at the same level as last year, roughly $283,000, but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s budget seeks to restore funding to roughly $3.8 million, on par with other district attorneys across the state. 
Apart from those key differences, the two budget proposals largely agree. The median difference on more than 130 programs is 1.2%, according to a Source review, and the governor and the Legislature have identical spending proposals on eight line items, including the New Mexico Compilation Commission, the Public Employee Labor Relations Board and the Economic Development Department.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. Supreme Court denied a request Monday from Story and Shelby counties requesting a review of a lower court’s ruling that county ordinances pertaining to a carbon sequestration pipeline were preempted by federal pipeline regulations. 
The lawsuit was between the counties and Summit Carbon Solutions, an Iowa-based company seeking to build a carbon sequestration pipeline across the state. 
In October 2022, county supervisors from Story and Shelby counties enacted local ordinances that established setback, permitting, emergency management and abandonment standards for hazardous materials pipelines within the counties.

Summit sued the counties later that year, arguing the ordinances were preempted by federal pipeline safety standards. The courts ruled in favor of Summit in the lawsuit, which has also paused similar lawsuits with other counties from progressing. 
Shelby and Story county supervisors voted in August to take the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court after their requests for a rehearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Omaha was denied.
Property rights coalition proposes more limits on eminent domain in South Dakota

The appeals court upheld a December 2023 decision from the federal court in the Southern District of Iowa that said county ordinances cannot interfere with federal safety standards and pipeline routing decisions made at the state level. 
In a statement, the Shelby County Board of Supervisors said it would be consulting with its legal counsel and weighing its options “moving forward.” 
“Shelby County was surprised and disappointed by the denial by the U.S. Supreme Court to hear such an important case addressing local control authority and protections,” the statement said. 
The denial was listed in the high court’s orders on Monday along with a number of other denials. The court did not offer an explanation for the denial. 
Summit Carbon Solutions declined to comment on the decision. 
Tom Buis, CEO of American Carbon Alliance, said in a statement that the decision allows “important progress to continue.” Buis said carbon capture projects create new markets for farmers, boost ethanol production and “keep Iowa competitive.” 
“We remain confident this technology is good for Iowa and good for American agriculture,” Buis said in a statement. 
The Iowa Legislature is again expected to take up the issue of eminent domain and regulation around carbon sequestration pipelines during the current session. An Iowa House Judiciary subcommittee is scheduled to take up House Study Bill 507, which bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, at 4 p.m. Tuesday.
Landowners in opposition of the project, many of them from Shelby County, plan to lobby Tuesday against the sequestration pipeline at the Iowa State Capitol.

The group of conservative Republicans has promised cuts since last spring, but won’t say where and how deep. 
The post Wyoming Freedom Caucus aims at state spending, voting machines and the judicial branch in 2026 priorities appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Freedom Caucus revealed Monday its top five legislative priorities for the 2026 budget session, including a plan to “return to pre-pandemic spending levels and curb growth of government,” according to an announcement from the group. 
“Each of these priorities was driven by the people of Wyoming,” the caucus, a group of conservative Republicans who control the House, wrote. “Every bill is well-vetted. We’re ready to return to the Capitol to deliver real wins for the people of Wyoming.”
The four other priorities include: making pen and paper ballots “the default voting method,” making it easier for parents to sue “when their rights are violated,” removing “obscene pornographic materials” from the children’s section of all public libraries and codifying “public access to judicial opinions, orders, and oral arguments.”
The Freedom Caucus also outlined priorities ahead of last year’s session, but that plan focused instead on immigration, property taxes and certain investment practices. The group gave itself a deadline to pass those five priority bills in the first 10 days of session — dubbing it “The Five and Dime Plan.” 
At the onset of the legislative off-season in April, the Freedom Caucus told voters it would take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing Wyoming’s budget.” 
Those efforts included forming a subcommittee to scrutinize the Wyoming Department of Health’s budget, the largest of any state agency. 
In November, the group held a press conference in Cheyenne to reiterate its determination to shrink the state’s budget but did not provide specifics as to where or how deep cuts would go. Instead, Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, said the group was “setting some targets” and had its eye on pre-pandemic spending levels.
Budget specifics were still lacking Monday in the group’s press release, which again described an intention to “return to pre-pandemic spending levels.”
Budget
“It’s 2026, which means this legislative session is a budget session. It’s past time to get unchecked spending growth under control in Cheyenne,” the Monday press release states. 
This week, the Joint Appropriations Committee, which is largely comprised of Freedom Caucus members, is “marking up” the budget following three weeks’ worth of budget hearings. The committee is slated to have a budget bill by the end of the week.
Bear, who chairs the House side of the committee, opened Monday’s meeting with some remarks. 
“There’s been a lot of rumors out there that this more conservative Legislature is going to cut the budget 30%. I have spoken to many people and calmed their nerves that that is not the case,” Bear said. 
On Friday, during the committee’s one public comment period, several faith leaders from across the state testified in support of lawmakers fully funding mental health services. More specifically, they pushed back on the suggestion that churches or religious groups take on professional mental health services.

In November, Wyoming Public Radio published a story about Bear and his reported desire to see churches become more involved with addressing the state’s mental health needs. Bear pointed to the story Friday. 
“I think a lot of this has come about because of comments that I made in an article, which, if everybody reads those comments in context, they’ll understand that we don’t legislate on theory or ideals,” he said. “We legislate in the real world.”
Bear again addressed Friday’s public comment on Monday. 
“We heard last Friday that many in the public who came to comment expected a 15% cut to the Department of Health,” Bear said. “My vice chair and I were very clear that that was not the case. No such cuts were proposed, and that’s where we sit today.”
The Freedom Caucus has yet to unveil a precise target for cuts. Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Roriguez-Williams, the group’s chairwoman, did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment, which included an inquiry for specific numbers and when the caucus planned to share that information with the public. 
Ballots, parental rights and libraries
Laramie County, the state’s most populous, relies on “express voting,” a voting machine that has voters use a touchscreen to select their candidates. The machine then prints a ballot of their selections to be tabulated. Voters can also request a pen-and-paper ballot if they desire one. 
Wyoming’s other 22 counties use pen-and-paper ballots as their default, which is what the Freedom Caucus would like to see happen in Laramie County. 
“We believe in paper ballots, wet ink, and real votes,” the press release states. 
The Joint Corporations Committee voted to sponsor such a bill in the legislative off-season. 
For its third priority, the Freedom Caucus wrote that it will seek to “give parents the power to enforce their rights in court” by creating a private right to action. 
“Parental rights mean nothing if you can’t enforce them,” the press release states. “Allowing parents to recover the damages caused by a violation of their rights is common sense and long overdue.”
The fourth priority targets public libraries across the state and seeks to “remove obscene pornographic materials from the children’s sections of all public libraries in Wyoming.”
“Children should never be exposed to sexually explicit materials, period — especially at the taxpayer’s expense.” 
In October, the Joint Judiciary Committee voted to sponsor a bill dictating where libraries shelve certain books. Opponents told lawmakers at the time that the legislation would make an unprecedented intrusion into public libraries in an attempt to silence LGBTQ authors who write for young people.
‘Judicial transparency’ 
Hours after the Wyoming Supreme Court published its long-awaited ruling last week on two abortion bans, lawmakers held a closed-door meeting and discussed shrinking the court’s bench from five to three. 
The Freedom Caucus is now seeking “judicial transparency” as its fifth priority. More specifically, the group says it intends to “codify public access to judicial opinions, orders, and oral arguments so that the people know what our judges are up to.”
In its press release, the caucus pointed to its website, where “additional priorities” are listed, including “protecting pregnancy resource centers.” 
Notably, the priorities do not include a resolution to amend the Wyoming Constitution to prohibit abortion. 
The state’s high court struck down the abortion bans on account of Article 1, Section 38 of the state’s constitution, which enshrines the right of “each competent adult … to make his or her own health care decisions.” 
Upon the ruling, Gov. Mark Gordon called on lawmakers to put the issue “before the people for a vote.”
“A constitutional amendment taken to the people of Wyoming would trump any and all judicial decisions,” Gordon wrote. 
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, told WyoFile last week he and Sen. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Torrington, were working out the language of such a resolution. 
The 2026 session begins Feb. 9.

Most committee hearings and all voting on bills occurs on one of the 45 “Legislative Days” on the General Assembly calendar (shown here).
Delaware Legislative Calendar for 2026
The past year was a bit unusual, as the legislature held two “Special Sessions” (called by the General Assembly leadership) to address issues related to the property tax reassessment process in New Castle County.  They also held an “Extraordinary Session” (called by Governor Matt Meyer) to address concerns about the impact of federal legislation on the 2027 Fiscal Year Budget.  Notably, the Federal Government re-established a process for accelerated/immediate deduction for corporate R&D expenditures and certain capital purchases.  The Delaware tax laws were previously “coupled” to federal law, but the legislature chose to “de-couple” Delaware taxes in this case, protecting an estimated $400 Million in tax revenue (added cost for businesses operating in Delaware).
In the upcoming session, there are several outstanding bills from the 2025 session that will be important to many residents of Delaware.  Among the most impactful bills will be those that seek to make changes to the Delaware State Constitution.  These have a special and grueling process to be enacted.  Each proposed constitutional amendment must receive a greater than 2/3’s vote in each chamber (House & Senate) during two consecutive General Assembly sessions.  That means that constitutional amendments proposed and voted on in this 153rd General Assembly, must also be passed again in the 154th General Assembly (either 2027 or 2028), also by a 2/3’s or greater vote.  Currently, the Democrat Party has a super-majority in the Senate (15-6), but is one vote shy of a super-majority in the House (27-14).  As such, the majority party is only 1 vote away from being able to pass a proposed constitutional amendment without a single vote from the minority party.  This is a very significant situation, as we approach the General Election in November of 2026.

Monday’s filing stems from NetChoice’s lawsuit challenging Act 900 of 2025, which sought to amend a 2023 law found to be unconstitutional. 
The earlier law and the reworked version would have required age verification to create new social media accounts. A federal judge declared the 2023 law unconstitutional and permanently blocked it in April. 
“Arkansas’ ‘cosmetic’ update does not remedy the law’s continued constitutional defects,” NetChoice Litigation Co-Director Paul Taske said in a press release. “The new law, like its predecessor, ignores the First Amendment and will meet the same fate.”
In a statement, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said he would “vigorously defend Act 900.”
Monday’s motion for a preliminary injunction, which NetChoice filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, builds on a lawsuit the tech group filed in June challenging two 2025 laws, Acts 900 and Act 901. 
A federal judge in December granted the group’s request to temporarily block one of the laws, Act 901. That law would have allowed parent parents to sue social media platforms if exposure to content on their sites results in their child developing eating disorders, committing or attempting suicide, or becoming addicted to the platform’s feeds. The December ruling did not address Act 900.
Other states have also faced legal challenges for their social media laws, including Florida, Georgia and Ohio.

Photo by USDA/NRCSMost sites in Montana hit all-time, or near-record amounts of precipitation in December when an atmospheric river released a deluge across the state. 
That’s according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, which released its January Water Supply Outlook Report last week. 
Of the 96 SNOTEL stations in Montana, 70 recorded their highest or second-highest December precipitation on record, according to Florence Miller, USDA NRCS hydrologist.
While the precipitation helped improve drought conditions across the state, NRCS data shows a split perspective on how it could impact the state’s water supply for the rest of the year. Higher elevation snow bolstered early-season snowpack, while rain at lower elevations melted out some early snow. 
Snowpack is the primary reservoir for water that is released throughout the spring and early summer as it melts out. Low snowpacks can impact streamflows across river basins and lead to major droughts, as was seen in recent years with front-facing impacts such as the low water levels on Flathead Lake. 
The first data release for the 2026 water year shows the winter is off to a mixed start — while December brought record precipitation bolstering early season snowpack at high elevations, much of it also fell as rain at lower elevations. 
In northwest Montana, the rain led to significant flooding in Lincoln, Sanders and Flathead Counties, leading to state and federal disaster declarations. 
All river basins in the state received between 170% and 300% of the 20-year median precipitation for December, according to NRCS data.
“A parade of unseasonably warm storms throughout December meant that although most SNOTEL stations received above normal precipitation, only some of that moisture fell as snow,” the report stated, emphasizing the elevation split meant some SNOTEL sites saw several more inches of snow than normal for the month, while nearby sites a few thousand feet lower saw huge deficits. 
“Statewide, snow water equivalent (SWE) is looking deceptively positive,” Miller said. 
A map showing the snow-water equivalent in snowpacks across river basins in Montana. USDA/NRCS
Snow-water equivalent, rather than snow depth, is the measurement used to gauge the amount of liquid water contained within a snowpack, which will be released when the snowpack melts. The snowmelt plays a key role in agriculture, hydropower production, water storage, aquatic ecosystem health and recreation such as boating and fishing, as well as flood and drought forecasting.
Across the state, snowpack on Jan. 1 ranged from 70% of median to 120% of median, with “most major basins falling at or near normal.”
In the northwest, the Kootenai, Flathead and Upper Clark Fork basins all have snowpacks at more than 100% of median. The upper Yellowstone basin is at 120%, the Bighorn basin at 111%, the Gallatin at 107%, and the Sun-Teton-Marias at 116%. 
Lagging behind the state is the Tongue basin, which drains the state’s southeast corner into Wyoming, sitting at 71% of normal. 
Another outlier of the early season is the Lower Clark Fork basin, which despite seeing high precipitation during the last three months — including 223% of normal in December — has a snowpack below normal, at just 86% of median. At this time last year, the basin had a snowpack of 112%. 
Snowpack in most areas of the state tends to peak in late April. 
The NRCS report stated that lower elevation zones that look to have below-average snowpack could see those deficits quickly erased with a few good storm systems. 
But the near-term forecast isn’t favoring additional snowfall.
Temperatures across the state Monday and Tuesday look unseasonably warm, with high temperatures in the upper 40s across the western part of the state, and reaching into the 50s in Bozeman and in Billings, according to the National Weather Service.

Nevada is the nation’s largest gold producer, and the second largest producer of silver, after Alaska.
Over the weekend, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced he was under investigation by the Trump administration. The investigation is ostensibly about mismanagement of renovations at the Fed building in Washington. But Trump has been hounding and verbally abusing Powell for most of the last year in what critics worry is a sign that once Powell’s term is up, Trump will effectively become the person setting interest rates in the U.S.

(Courtesy of the Department of Corrections)New Jersey lawmakers advanced legislation Thursday to expand protections for imprisoned women in New Jersey, after brutality and sex abuse scandals drove Gov. Phil Murphy to order the troubled Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women closed and replaced.
The bill, known as the Incarcerated Women’s Protection Act, would codify protections state corrections officials have adopted since sexual misconduct drove federal authorities in 2021 to declare oversight. It also builds on a 2020 law, known as the Dignity Act, that set new protections for incarcerated parents and pregnant women.
The legislation would:

Enact “gender-responsive” policies from entry through release and beyond.
Require the state Department of Corrections to mandate annual gender-specialized training for all correctional officers who supervise imprisoned women.
Establish a special victims unit to investigate allegations of sexual assault or misconduct and require investigators to get gender-informed and victim-centered training on how to best investigate such cases.
Create a division of women’s services to develop policies, programs, and services addressing treatment for physical or sexual abuse, parenting, and child reunification.
Require the department to offer parenting classes, doula services, and family reunification programs for pregnant inmates and counseling and reentry services for women scheduled for release within six months.

Legislators approved the bill on the last voting day of their two-year legislative session, with the Assembly passing it 67-6 (six Republicans voted no) and the Senate, 39-0. Murphy has until Jan. 20 to sign the bill for it to become law. A new two-year legislative session begins at noon Tuesday.
Murphy in 2021 ordered Edna Mahan’s closure after more than a dozen correctional officers were arrested and accused of brutally assaulting incarcerated women during a violent night of forced cell extractions. A state judge dismissed their criminal indictment in October, citing deficiencies in the indictment and the state’s four-year delay in preparing the case for trial.
Construction on a new 420-bed, $310 million state prison for women began in October in Chesterfield, where the prison will relocate from Clinton.

(Getty Creative)Two Wisconsin hospital systems have paused providing gender-affirming health care for minors, according to a published report, prompting state lawmakers to urge them to reconsider.
“Wisconsin values include fairness, compassion and looking out for one another,” said state Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) and state Reps. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) and Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) in a joint statement Monday afternoon. 
“This decision moves us away from those values by placing additional burdens on families who are already navigating complex medical health needs. Parents should be able to make informed decisions in consultation with qualified health care providers without political interference or fear,” the lawmakers said.  
The statement was issued under the umbrella of the Legislature’s Transgender Parent and Nonbinary Advocacy Caucus.
The group responded to reporting Monday in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Children’s Wisconsin, a children’s hospital and health system in suburban Milwaukee, and UW Health, in Madison had both paused prescribing gender-affirming medication such as puberty blockers and hormones for minors.
The news story initially attributed word of the changes to anonymous sources. Representatives of both hospital systems subsequently confirmed the facilities had taken action to stop providing care, except in the area of behavioral health.
On Dec. 18, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department announced that the federal government would stop all Medicaid and Medicare payments to hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 18.
“At Children’s Wisconsin, we strongly believe everyone, including LGBTQ+ kids, should be treated with the support, respect, dignity and compassion they deserve,” a Children’s spokesperson told the Journal Sentinel. “We are communicating to patients that due to escalating legal and federal regulatory risk facing systems and providers across the nation, we are currently unable to provide gender affirming pharmacologic care.” Children’s Wisconsin will continue mental health and behavioral health services, the spokesperson said.
A UW Health spokesperson told the newspaper in a statement that the system “is committed to providing high-quality, compassionate and patient-centered care to our patients and families, including LGBTQ+ patients.”
The statement acknowledged that because of federal actions, “UW Health is pausing prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy as part of gender-affirming care for patients under 18 years of age.”
The lawmakers’ caucus statement, which did not name the medical systems, said that halting care could harm the mental health of young people receiving that care.
“Removing access to this care increases the risk of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts among young people who already are facing disproportionate mental health challenges,” the caucus statement said. It urged the health systems “to reconsider their decision.”
Abigail Swetz, executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy organization Fair Wisconsin, said in a statement that the Trump administration has been engaged in “disgusting” attacks on trans people since before taking office.
In pausing care the hospital systems made “an awful decision, and I believe it is the wrong decision — it’s a decision that is putting young patients, their families, and even their own providers in a very tough place,” Swetz said. “And at the same time, these clinics should never have been bullied by this federal administration into making any kind of decision in the first place, especially one that reduces access to this life-affirming care.”
Swetz said Fair Wisconsin was organizing public comment opposing the federal proposed rule and urged Wisconsinites to join the effort.

Masterson, who has served in the Kansas Legislature since 2005, is seeking the GOP nomination for governor in a crowded primary. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The 2026 session of the Kansas Legislature burst to life Monday as Republicans and Democrats staked out public policy priorities, welcomed members to fill unexpired terms of the departed and awaited the upcoming final State of the State speech by Gov. Laura Kelly.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, gaveled in the Senate and House in what could be the final legislative session for both. Masterson is competing in a crowded field for the GOP nomination for governor, while Hawkins tossed his hat into the ring in the race for state insurance commissioner.
In brief remarks with reporters, Masterson said his mind was on finding ways to control rising property taxes, embracing the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump and, possibly, redrawing the state’s congressional district boundaries for benefit of Republican candidates for Congress.
“A constitutional amendment to cap property tax, at least authorizing the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and parental freedom in education. Like to do a little tort reform. Obviously, get a budget passed,” Masterson said.
In terms of redistricting, the Senate president said he would “love to” advance a bill that shifted boundaries of the state’s four U.S. House districts to give GOP candidates a distinct edge over Democratic candidates. The idea would be to make it difficult for U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, to win reelection.
The original plan was to convene a special session of the Legislature in November to consider a new congressional map. The required two-thirds majority in the Senate signed a petition calling a special session, but Hawkins was unable to convince two-thirds of Republican peers in the House to sign a special-session petition.
“If we get it from the House, we’re going to take it up,” said Masterson, who would appear to have the easier task of securing enough votes to thwart a veto by Kelly.

The first order of business Monday was for Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Rosen to swear into office the Senate’s newcomers. Sen. Scott Hill, R-Abilene, and Sen. Silas Miller, D-Wichita, were drafted from the House to fill vacancies in the Senate. Hill replaced Sen. J.R. Claeys, a Salina Republican who went to work for the Trump administration. Miller took the seat left open by Sen. Mary Ware, who announced her retirement in November.
At the front of the Senate chamber, Rosen turned to Hill and began reciting the oath: “Do you, Silas Miller …”
The gaffe was noted, and Rosen affirmed: “Not a good start.” He replaced Miller’s name in the script with Hill’s, and the perfunctory ceremonies for both were completed.
House and Senate committees begin meeting Tuesday. Kelly, a Democrat in the final year of her two terms as governor, is scheduled to deliver the annual State of the State speech to a joint session of the Legislature at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.

‘Last first day’
Hawkins, a Republican insurance executive, marked his “last first day” of the session after 14 years in the House and three years as speaker. While he’s running for insurance commissioner, all 125 seats in the House will be up for election in November. The Senate won’t do likewise until 2028.
“The first day of the session is always a happy day,” Hawkins said to an almost full chamber. “I tried for the House to be the best House there ever was, and I think, for the most part, we have done just that.”
He said he strived to promote mutual respect in the House “so that we listen, hopefully, more than we talk.”
Hawkins encouraged spirited debate on the House floor that avoided personal jabs.
“Be engaged, and put everything you have into this session. But don’t leave wishing you would have done something,” he said.
Ahead of the House’s more ordinary first-day business, Rosen swore in Rep. Abi Boatman, a Wichita-area Democrat, Air Force veteran and advocate who replaced Miller.
Boatman, who is Kansas’ second-ever transgender legislator, worked in advocacy and civic engagement for the past decade. She said her first moments in the Legislature were fast-paced as she received a warm welcome. She said the Legislature felt like “the next natural step.”
Rep. Steve Brunk, a Wichita Republican who served in the House from 2003 to 2015, was appointed to complete the unexpired term of Rep. Patrick Penn, who took a job in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During the interim period, Brunk lobbied for a conservative policy organization opposed to abortion.
After checking with Capitol security at the visitor center to make certain the state’s conceal-carry gun law hadn’t changed in his absence, he discussed his reasons for returning to the House.
“I just felt like there was unfinished business here. I always liked the process,” he said.

Democrats’ agenda
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat running for state insurance commissioner, said one of her top priorities would be to approve a refundable child tax credit. In the past, proposals have been made to offer a $25 to $600 per child income tax credit for low- and middle-income households to help families deal with escalating costs. She said it was unlikely the GOP-led Legislature would approve the bill.
“I would love to see child tax credits passed through, but I don’t think there’s a possible way for that,” Sykes said.
She said the Legislature ought to extend the existing K-12 school finance formula — due to expire in mid-2027 — for another year. That would allow the 2027 Legislature to craft a new formula that wouldn’t be implemented until 2028, she said.
Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Democrat seeking the party’s nomination for governor along with Sen. Ethan Corson, said she would take on a defensive mindset in an attempt to disrupt GOP legislation that she would view as harmful to the state’s most vulnerable people.
“I am always focused on things that will help the people,” she said. “We’ve been pushing things like Medicaid expansion for years. I’m going to look for ways to bring things good forward and push back against the bad stuff.”
After the House adjourned for the day, House Democrats gathered with reporters at the Capitol to highlight an agenda designed to benefit working families.
House Democrats proposed raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, allowing renters to get 15% of their rent back in a tax rebate, providing universal school meals and addressing access to and the cost of child care. They also wanted to exempt $125,000 of a home’s value from the state property tax. The current threshold is $75,000.

House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, said Democrats were exploring ways to pay for their wish list. Legalizing recreational marijuana was on the table, he said, along with raising taxes for millionaires.
However, he said, cost of living was the No. 1 issue on Kansans’ minds. But their proposals would need support from Republicans to reach the minimum 63 votes for passage in the House.
“In the superminority, we have to go find friends, right?” Woodard said. “There’s only 37 of us, so we have to find 26 members that will work with us. The idea of coming up with our own agenda allows us to, one, tell Kansans what we stand for, but also, these are going to be floor amendments that you see on any of the bills that are introduced by Republicans.”
Rep. Dan Osman, D-Overland Park, said Kansas should be a place where growing families could afford child care, seniors could live in their homes on a fixed income, and young people could see a future instead of looking to other states.
“Families are doing everything right, working hard, budgeting correctly, planning for our future. Yet too many are still feeling squeezed,” Osman said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)State Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming) will lead the tri-state legislative body that advises lawmakers and Congress on government action needed to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay.
Yaw was elected chairperson of the 21-member Chesapeake Bay Commission, which includes 15 state House and Senate lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia; a cabinet secretary selected by each state’s governor; and a citizen member from each state. He previously led the commission in 2020.
Yaw said in a news release that he intends to guide the commission in driving forward innovative policies that will support the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, which state and federal officials approved last month.
The Chesapeake Bay Commission, created in the 1980s through legislation in all three states, serves to identify and coordinate state legislative and policy action to reverse decades of pollution that degraded the estuary’s waters. The Susquehanna River, which collects water across a massive swath of Pennsylvania, is the bay’s largest tributary.
“With the entire partnership united behind a revised agreement and committed to success, now is the time for bold ideas that deliver healthy streams and a restored Chesapeake Bay,” Yaw said in a statement. “I’m proud that Pennsylvania is being recognized as a leader on clean water and a showcase for innovative projects that highlight local benefits. I am looking forward to scaling up our efforts over the coming year.”
Yaw replaces Maryland state Senator Sara Love (D-Montgomery). Yaw will also continue to serve as the chair of the Pennsylvania delegation, of which state Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster), Rep. Kerry Benninghoff (R-Centre), Rep. Carol Hill-Evans (D-York) and Rep. Nikki Rivera (D-Lancaster) are members.
State Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Jessica Shirley and G. Warren Elliott of Chambersburg also represent Pennsylvania.
In December, the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council voted to revise the watershed agreement, accepting recommendations from a steering committee that had been meeting for more than two years. Notably, the council voted to develop formal channels for tribal nations to participate.
The revisions include data collection and analysis methods and greater accountability for clean up efforts. Other changes include more emphasis on habitat restoration and exposure of climate impacts in the region.
The council, which consists of leaders from six states within the Bay watershed, also elected Gov. Josh Shapiro to serve as its chairperson this year.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06024-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 18:58:26.533101

(Photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Students erroneously awarded K-12 scholarships in 2024 spent nearly $64,000 in taxpayer money before their removal, but it appears the problem didn’t repeat in the program’s second year, according to two state education agencies.
A report given to legislators last month and provided to the SC Daily Gazette revealed how much money was spent before the agency suspended students’ accounts because they didn’t qualify for the $1,500 quarterly payments. It also represented the Department of Education’s first public confirmation on the number of students removed.
While that problem didn’t resurface in a survey released Monday, it indicated that at least some schools are raising tuition prices for participants.
The $64,000 came from the accounts of 82 of the 1,005 ineligible students removed from the program in September 2024 because they still attended public school in their local district, which disqualified them from the program. The department clawed back the remaining $1.4 million in those students’ accounts.
How the parents of those 82 students spent the money before being disqualified remains unclear. By law, the money can be spent on various education expenses, including private tuition, tutoring and books.
A second survey of parents, similar to the one that revealed the problem, makes no mention of revoked funding. Parents who completed the survey for the program’s second year gave overwhelmingly positive responses, researcher Jenny May said Monday.
Up to 1,000 ineligible SC students booted from voucher program, report finds

“Everyone was very satisfied overall with this program,” May told a panel of the Education Oversight Committee, an independent agency that’s led by a committee of legislators, educators and business leaders.
It’s possible some students were still accepted to the program when they shouldn’t have been, but none of the nearly 1,700 survey responses suggested that was the case, and the oversight agency has no reason to believe the same problem happened again, May told reporters.
Students are no longer required to leave their public school district entirely to receive the funds, though they still can’t attend their zoned public school. For the first time this year, students already enrolled in private schools were allowed to apply for the money, as long as their parents made no more than 300% of the federal poverty level.
Considering around 45% of parents last year reported feeling dissatisfied with the program, Sen. Ross Turner, a member of the oversight committee, said he was “pleasantly surprised” with this year’s results.
The program “is obviously still young and still being molded into what it could be down the road, or what it will be down the road,” said the Greenville Republican, who voted in favor of the law. “But I think right now it’s on the right path.”
Applications for the 2026-27 school year open Thursday for students attending a public school this year, families making up to 300% of the federal poverty level, and/or children of active-duty military personnel stationed in South Carolina.
Everyone else who qualifies can start applying Feb. 9. This year, the income cap is 500% of the federal poverty level, or $128,600 for a family of four.
By law, the $7,600 vouchers must be made available to at least 15,000 qualified students this school year, though legislators can increase the amount. Gov. Henry McMaster and state Superintendent Ellen Weaver are asking for enough money to accept 20,000 students — a total cost of $61.4 million.
End-of-year report
The end-of-year report noted that the department found and removed all ineligible students during the 45 days the agency had to make sure all participants met the program’s requirements. That timing lined up with public schools’ first student count, which verifies state and federal funding per pupil.
During that check, 1,229 students appeared to be enrolled both in their zoned public school district and the voucher program, named the Education Scholarship Trust Fund, according to the report. Under the law that created the inaugural program, students had to leave their home district to access the money, but some parents didn’t seem to know about or understand that requirement, the report suggests.
Department of Education staff suspended the accounts at that point and verified where students were attending school, leading to the removal of 1,005 students. The remaining 224 students were automatically reenrolled in their public schools despite transferring, so the department reinstated their funds.
Application window to open for K-12 vouchers. Here’s who applied for this school year.

“Thankfully, (education) officials detected these ‘double counting’ problems early in the initial enrollment verification process and were able to pull back unspent funds that had been previously allocated,” the report reads.
That included all but $63,670. That’s a drop in the bucket for a program that ultimately spent more than $6 million, and the agency did claw back the vast majority of the $1.5 million put in accounts for students who didn’t qualify, the report said.
“Any dollar that’s spent in a way that’s out of line with the law is concerning,” said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association. “It’s notable that the department noticed that and addressed it.”
Survey results
Although the results from the November survey were overwhelmingly positive, some parents’ comments did raise concerns, May said.
For instance, some parents claimed private schools and other unspecified vendors charged parents receiving the taxpayer-funded benefit more than they charged those paying out of pocket.
“We thought our funds would go further, but when the school found out we had received the ESTF scholarship, they no longer gave us a previous discount,” one parent wrote. “We would have preferred to have the option of reimbursement so that we can choose how to spend those funds without schools setting prices based on what they know families are receiving.”
How many times this happened was unclear from the survey, and parents didn’t name any schools that hiked tuition for voucher recipients or say how much more they were paying.
Critics of the program have long warned that private schools would raise tuition to match whatever amount the state gives out.
“You could see this coming,” Kelly said.
Inflated prices will mean families can’t stretch their money as far, Kelly said. For instance, a parent enrolling their child in private school may not also be able to pay for additional expenses, such as a school uniform or tutoring, if increased tuition prices eat up all their state-funded scholarship.
“Families will be priced out of educational opportunities as vendors continue to raise prices,” Kelly said.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

Last year, as senators debated a revised version of the law, some proposed adding price caps. Legislators will likely need to take another look at the problem this year, now that the concerns are seeming to become reality, Turner said.
“I think those things are going to have to be ironed out,” Turner said, stopping short of any specific proposals.
A handful of teachers also reported that the school where they worked required them to apply for the program and use the money to cover tuition for their children who attended, even though the school previously allowed their children to attend for free. Those parents then couldn’t use the money for other needs, such as tutoring or textbooks.
“That might minimize choice for some families who are trying to access all of the opportunities to finance support and education opportunities for their kids,” May said.
The teachers did not say where they worked.
Confusion continues over homeschooling
For the second year, parents wrote how happy they were to use the money for homeschooling, even though that’s illegal.
“We wanted to home educate our children but we could not afford it,” one parent wrote. “This program gave us the opportunity to tailor our children’s education to their needs and gifts.”
Some parents may have conflated homeschooling with other acceptable forms of education under the program, such as virtual classes provided through a traditional school but completed at home.
“However, there’s enough ambiguity that it could appear as an inappropriate use of funds without more clarity,” May said.
In its end-of-year report, the education department defended those parents, saying they weren’t technically homeschooling.
Instead of opting for one of the state-provided homeschooling programs, which the law prohibits for those receiving vouchers, the parents agree to follow the Education Scholarship Trust Fund rules, according to the report. In that way, the state essentially acts as the homeschooling authorizer instead of a public school or homeschooling association.
The Education Oversight Committee’s staff recommended legislators add homeschooling as an option for the program to cut down on confusion.
That’s sure to stir up an ironic foe: parents who homeschool their children. Parents who signed up for one of the three homeschooling methods allowed under state law specifically requested legislators leave them out of the program out of fear of too much government involvement in their children’s education.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/studentsinclassroom-1024x686.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 18:58:26.533101

Education transformation is about building the best education system in the U.S.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Zoie Saunders: It’s not all about taxes.","This commentary is by Zoie Saunders, Vermont’s secretary of education. 



Education transformation in Vermont is not just about property taxes. It is about building and sustaining the best education system in America.
At a moment when nearly every other state is diverting dollars away from public education, Vermont has chosen a different path. 
Last year, a bipartisan coalition passed Act 73 — a bill that doubles down on public education as the great equalizer, the pathway out of poverty and the engine that fuels our economy.
Having the best education system in America is not just about test scores. It is about giving every student the opportunity to succeed, regardless of economic disadvantage, language status, or the town they call home.
But this requires us to ask why these opportunities remain so uneven. 
Why do some students not have access to the same course offerings as their peers in other districts? Why do some students attend districts with nearly half the per-pupil spending as others? 
Why do rural and economically disadvantaged areas struggle to offer competitive teacher salaries on par with wealthier pockets of the state? Why are there persistent achievement gaps between students from historically marginalized backgrounds and their peers?
The root cause of our inequities is a simple but hard truth: we are not organizing or operating our statewide education system well. Because of that, we are not directing resources to the places where they can make the greatest difference: supporting students and paying teachers competitively.
The good news is that we have a plan. During the 2025 legislative session, the governor, the Agency of Education and the General Assembly worked together to develop a roadmap that positions Vermont as a national leader in education.
Given the magnitude of the change proposed, Vermonters have questions, as they should. 
Will this plan save money? Will this plan actually give kids more opportunities? Will it better support teachers? Will it result in a more predictable and equitable approach to funding our education system?
Supporters say the answer is yes.
Extensive cost modeling was conducted before and throughout the legislative process, demonstrating the ability to provide an excellent education at a cost that Vermonters can afford. 
We built budgets, including sample budgets for the five districts originally proposed: Champlain Valley Region, Southwest Region, Southeast Region, Winooski Valley Region, and Northeast Region.
We adapted the plan based on educator input, and we engaged independent school finance experts. Their review, based on research, data and best practices, confirmed that the plan does what Vermonters expect.
It puts teaching and learning first, aligns with education and management best practices, directs more resources to students and staff, and strengthens Vermont’s statewide commitment to equity.
The resulting bipartisan bill, Act 73, represents one of the largest education investments in the country.
Vermont is on the cusp of something special.
A generational investment combined with generational change means we can maintain smaller elementary schools through thoughtful staffing while shifting resources to create more robust middle and high schools. 
We can expand mental health and behavioral supports, enhance electives and special programs, and create new, innovative pathways for high school students.
It all sounds good, right? Yes, and it is possible — but only if we are willing to change.
That change requires moving to larger districts in Vermont to ensure the generational investment of Act 73 reaches all students. Let’s be clear: larger districts create economies of scale that can determine whether a school can offer advanced courses, hire a reading coach, or afford a strong continuum of supports.
Ultimately, education transformation is about Vermonters coming together to acknowledge our challenges and tackle them collectively.
Right now, local communities are fending for themselves. The status quo has put local school boards and districts in a difficult position where staffing and programming cuts are being made and schools are being closed, all while property taxes continue to rise and families continue to be priced out of local communities.
We cannot ask local communities to fend for themselves. We cannot ask local communities—on their own—to boost educational outcomes while bending the cost curve of funding education. We cannot ask a fragmented structure to deliver world-class results. We have to do this together.
Change is hard, but Vermonters have shown we can do hard things by coming together.
Let’s come together to follow through on the bipartisan plan to build the best education system in America—a plan that puts students before politics, raises teacher pay, and creates opportunities and programs that rival every other state in the country. 
Our kids deserve nothing less.

Why do some students not have access to the same course offerings as their peers in other districts? Why do some students attend districts with nearly half the per-pupil spending as others? 
Why do rural and economically disadvantaged areas struggle to offer competitive teacher salaries on par with wealthier pockets of the state? Why are there persistent achievement gaps between students from historically marginalized backgrounds and their peers?
The root cause of our inequities is a simple but hard truth: we are not organizing or operating our statewide education system well. Because of that, we are not directing resources to the places where they can make the greatest difference: supporting students and paying teachers competitively.
The good news is that we have a plan. During the 2025 legislative session, the governor, the Agency of Education and the General Assembly worked together to develop a roadmap that positions Vermont as a national leader in education.
Given the magnitude of the change proposed, Vermonters have questions, as they should. 
Will this plan save money? Will this plan actually give kids more opportunities? Will it better support teachers? Will it result in a more predictable and equitable approach to funding our education system?
Supporters say the answer is yes.
Extensive cost modeling was conducted before and throughout the legislative process, demonstrating the ability to provide an excellent education at a cost that Vermonters can afford. 
We built budgets, including sample budgets for the five districts originally proposed: Champlain Valley Region, Southwest Region, Southeast Region, Winooski Valley Region, and Northeast Region.
We adapted the plan based on educator input, and we engaged independent school finance experts. Their review, based on research, data and best practices, confirmed that the plan does what Vermonters expect.
It puts teaching and learning first, aligns with education and management best practices, directs more resources to students and staff, and strengthens Vermont’s statewide commitment to equity.
The resulting bipartisan bill, Act 73, represents one of the largest education investments in the country.
Vermont is on the cusp of something special.
A generational investment combined with generational change means we can maintain smaller elementary schools through thoughtful staffing while shifting resources to create more robust middle and high schools. 
We can expand mental health and behavioral supports, enhance electives and special programs, and create new, innovative pathways for high school students.
It all sounds good, right? Yes, and it is possible—but only if we are willing to change.
That change requires moving to larger districts in Vermont to ensure the generational investment of Act 73 reaches all students. Let’s be clear: larger districts create economies of scale that can determine whether a school can offer advanced courses, hire a reading coach, or afford a strong continuum of supports.
Ultimately, education transformation is about Vermonters coming together to acknowledge our challenges and tackle them collectively.
Right now, local communities are fending for themselves. The status quo has put local school boards and districts in a difficult position where staffing and programming cuts are being made and schools are being closed, all while property taxes continue to rise and families continue to be priced out of local communities.
We cannot ask local communities to fend for themselves. We cannot ask local communities—on their own—to boost educational outcomes while bending the cost curve of funding education. We cannot ask a fragmented structure to deliver world-class results. We have to do this together.
Change is hard, but Vermonters have shown we can do hard things by coming together.
Let’s come together to follow through on the bipartisan plan to build the best education system in America—a plan that puts students before politics, raises teacher pay, and creates opportunities and programs that rival every other state in the country. 
Our kids deserve nothing less.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-12 23:25:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"Work can again resume on Revolution Wind, judge orders in blow to Trump",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/12/work-can-again-resume-on-revolution-wind-judge-orders-in-blow-to-trump/,Judge Royce Lamberth ruled from the bench Monday that evidence provided by the federal government was not sufficient to justify halting work.,"A federal judge ruled again Monday that work may resume on the offshore Revolution Wind project, despite the Trump administration’s efforts to halt construction for the second time.
U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said in a ruling from the bench Monday that evidence provided by the federal government — which cited the potential impacts large wind farms can have on military radar — was not sufficient to justify its decision to suddenly stop work on a project that was years in the making and had undergone extensive reviews by defense officials and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. BOEM gave its final approval to the project in 2023.
“While the Bureau may order a suspension of operations for legitimate reasons of national security… those suspensions are limited to emergency situations and demonstrated findings of particularized harm that cannot be averted short of a total stop to project activity,” Lamberth said. 
Lamberth, who was appointed to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, further pointed out that officials said they were made aware of newly-classified information regarding wind projects in November but they didn’t act on that information until Dec. 22 — three days before Christmas.
“I’m not persuaded that any such emergency exists in this case,” he said. 
Lamberth’s ruling only applies to Revolution Wind and not the four other offshore wind projects that saw their development halted as result of the Trump administration’s stop-work order. That order included Revolution’s Wind’s sister project, Sunrise Wind.
Even with Monday’s victory, Revolution Wind’s developers are facing a time crunch to complete the nearly $6 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.
Revolution Wind was already 87% completed when work was halted — for the second time — in late December. All but seven of of the massive turbines have been mounted on top of pilings driven into the sea floor, and transmission cables have been laid to connect the project to onshore substations, according to court filings. 
But the developers also face a deadline of Feb. 22 — 41 days away — to complete work on the seven remaining turbines before a specially-designed installation vessel, the Wind Scylla, has to depart for other projects.
That work will take at least 41 days to complete, according to Revolution Wind’s attorneys. 
“Revolution Wind will determine how best it may be possible to work with the US Administration to achieve an expeditious and durable resolution,” project spokeswoman Meaghan Wims said in a statement Monday. “The Project will resume construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority, and to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.”
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers released a statement responding to Monday’s decision deriding offshore projects as the “scam of the century.”
“For years, Americans have been forced to pay billions more for the least reliable source of energy,” Rogers said. “The Trump administration paused the construction of all large-scale offshore wind projects because our number one priority is to put America First and protect the national security of the American people. We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”
President Donald Trump is a vociferous opponent of wind energy who has repeatedly spread false and misleading claims about turbines, including that they kill whales and cause cancer in humans. In August, his administration halted work on Revolution Wind for about a month before Judge Lamberth lifted its earlier order.
In explaining that earlier decision, Lamberth chastised government officials for failing to provide any evidence to support its claims about national security concerns. The first stop-work order, he said, was “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”
This time, he said the government provided some evidence in a classified setting to support its claims. However, he said that evidence was similar to issues that were previously investigated during permitting for Revolution Wind, and it was not enough to justify shutting down the project as it neared the end of construction.
The Department of Interior’s announcement last month that it was pausing work on on those projects along the East Coast cited both classified and unclassified reports on a type of radar interference known as “clutter” that the agency attributed to the movement of turbine blades.
A spokesperson for Interior did not respond to a subsequent request from the Connecticut Mirror to provide copies of those unclassified reports. Attorneys for both Revolution Wind and the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island said that the government also declined to provide its findings to officials with the proper security clearances, include Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
The Trump administration did submit some of its classified information from Department of Defense for Lamberth to review, along with a declaration from Interior Deputy Secretary Jacob Tyner raising concerns about foreign entities involved in Revolution Wind. The project’s developers, Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, are based in Denmark and Germany, respectively.
Ultimately, Lamberth said he was not moved by the information he had seen and had reason to doubt the veracity of the government’s arguments.
For example, he cited Interior Secretary Douglas Burgum’s own appearances on television discussing the stop-work order, in which the secretary railed against the offshore wind projects for their costs and other “reasons unrelated to national security.”
Lamberth’s ruling was quickly hailed by officials in both Connecticut and Rhode Island, where Revolution Wind is due to begin providing hundreds of megawatts of power to electric customers later this year. More than 1,000 workers are employed by the project, including at its staging facility on New London’s State Pier.
“This project should have never been shut down the first time or second time by the White House,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement Monday. “Federal interference has stood in the way of lower energy costs and good-paying jobs, but today’s ruling puts Revolution Wind back on track. With construction resuming and suppliers gaining certainty as we near completion, this state-backed project will help deliver a more diverse energy supply and lower utility costs for families and businesses.” 
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island also filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration’s latest stop-work order. That case was consolidated with the lawsuit brought by Revolution Wind’s developers ahead of Monday’s hearing.
“This project is on the finish line to begin delivering clean, affordable energy to Connecticut families,” Tong said in a statement. “With yet another clear defeat, it is my hope that Donald Trump will drop his lawless and erratic attacks for good. We’re prepared to keep fighting — and winning — for as long as it takes to protect Connecticut ratepayers, workers and our environment.”
Supporters of renewable energy and other climate-conscious groups also jumped in to praise Lamberth’s decision. 
“Today’s ruling is a decisive win for energy reliability and the hundreds of thousands of families counting on Revolution Wind,” said Kat Burnham, a senior principal at  Advanced Energy United, a industry group representing renewable and distributed energy developers. 
“The court rightly saw through a politically motivated stop-work order that would have caused real harm: driving up costs, delaying power for Rhode Island and Connecticut, and putting good-paying jobs at risk. It’s good news for workers, ratepayers, and anyone who recognizes the need for a fair energy market,” Burnham added. 
Some Republicans in Connecticut had also begun to question the Trump administration’s treatment of Revolution Wind.
Last week, House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Brandford, and Senate GOP leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, sent a joint letter to Secretary Burgum requesting that the government expedite its review of the national security concerns, citing estimates that the loss of the project could cost New England electricity customers up to $500 million a year. 
“Say what you want about wind, solar, or any other renewable energy, I think these things should be visited in the prospective, not retroactively,” Candelora said. “You can’t put the genie back in the bottle.” 
Candelora said he had not received a response to his letter as on Monday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-098-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 18:58:26.533101

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)In a Monday morning high school art class in West Greenwich, a security detail stood next to a table adorned with rows of metallic-tubed paints in varying states of fullness, and kept close watch over U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon as she maneuvered from student to student and asked what they were working on.
“So you’re the only guy around here?” McMahon asked senior Jacob Tefft, the only male student in the six-student class, when she arrived at his seat.
McMahon’s Monday morning appearance at Exeter-West Greenwich Regional Junior High and High School comprised the Rhode Island leg of her Returning Education to the States Tour, which began in August 2025 and, with the conclusion of Monday’s tour, has so far come to 26 states.
The tour, according to the U.S. Department of Education’s boilerplate copy, comprises a mission assigned to McMahon by President Donald Trump to “lead on one of his most momentous promises to families — returning education to the states and equipping all parents to choose an excellent education for their children.”
It is also meant to emphasize what public education funding and regulation might look like once transformed by President Donald Trump’s administration. The Education Department has framed the tour as an attempt to gather best practices from schools nationwide as it attempts to redefine what public education could look like with a shrunken, or at least changed, federal role.
While Trump has previously and loudly proclaimed his intent to cast the Education Department into oblivion, McMahon told reporters during a scrum at the end of roughly two-and-a-half-hour visit that the availability of federal funding, not the name of its source, is educators’ core concern. 
“What they want reassurance of is that there is going to continue to be oversight, there’s going to be accountability,” McMahon said. The end of her department, she argued, would not dispel longstanding federal obligations to schools.
“Before there was a Department of Education, this funding — the Title I funding — still came through,” McMahon said. “IDEA funding still came through. The laws have not changed and the accountabilities have not changed for these laws, regardless of who is having the oversight and looking at this.”
McMahon’s visit to West Greenwich was the first tour stop since her Jan. 7 trek to Iowa, where the U.S. Department of Education approved what it described as the first “Returning Education to the States” waiver — a move federal and Iowan officials suggest can be a model for how states can have more flexibility and control over federal education dollars.
The waiver allows Iowa’s education agency to consolidate four federal funding sources into a single, state-level pot and, in the Education Department’s estimate, could lead to “nearly $8 million to be redirected from bureaucratic red tape to the classroom over four years.” 
The grant approved by the Education Department is more selective than Iowa’s original proposal, which wanted to consolidate 10 programs.  
“The goal…with returning education to the states,” McMahon said Monday, “is more autonomy at the state level.”
How would these block grants help further the Trump administration’ s goal of autonomy?

McMahon told reporters that the grants, by allowing for less stringent regulations over where grant monies go, give states “more flexibility in the spending.” Her department first invited education departments nationwide to submit waivers in July 2025. 
The waivers are meant to, in the department’s words, relieve state education agencies of “burdensome statutory and regulatory provisions by using the authority outlined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.”
Critics of the Trump administration’s block grant plan argue the intended flexibility could still lead to money being pooled toward some purposes over others, leaving some programs like multilingual education or after-school programs underfunded. Congressional Democrats have urged McMahon to reject block grant requests, saying such a funding plan would fail “the very students these provisions aim to support.”
Since Iowa’s successful waiver, however, more governors are expressing interest, McMahon claimed. “They’re lining up relatively quickly now,” she said.
Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who attended Monday’s classroom tour and the subsequent roundtable discussion with the secretary, does not consider Rhode Island among the states queuing up.
“I think that we are looking at what is best for Rhode Island,” Infante-Green told reporters, saying of the waivers, “And right now, that doesn’t seem to be the best way to go.” 
But, the commissioner added, “We will work with whoever we need to work with and to ensure that our state has what it needs and that our students get everything that they’re entitled to.”
Friendly territory
McMahon’s Rhode Island appearance was less shrouded in obscurity than the August 2025 visit of fellow cabinet member and U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez DeRemer to a Cranston fire station. Chavez DeRemer’s visit played out in an almost clandestine fashion, with the labor secretary never meeting reporters’ gazes except through the darkened glass of a garage door window.
McMahon’s team, meanwhile, let a small band of reporters tag along with the secretary and her posse of security, staff and government photographers as she toured four classrooms and spoke with students and teachers. 
Reporters were also permitted to sit in during the opening remarks of McMahon’s roundtable discussion — which included local leaders, school administrators and educators, a few students, and Infante-Green. Then the press was ushered out and brought back to the holding space in the school’s auditorium, where McMahon appeared about 45 minutes later to field questions. One reporter asked if West Greenwich was chosen because of the town’s conservative voting record, arguing that many of McMahon’s pit stops have been in conservative areas.
“I don’t think that it was because it’s particularly conservative,” she replied. “There’s a lot of CTE [career and technical education] concentration, and we are talking a great deal in this administration about workforce development and how much we need it.”
“We have really a deficit in our workforce, and we just have to rethink education, as to how we want to do it,” McMahon continued. 
West Greenwich is, in fact, a town where nearly 64% of West Greenwich voters opted for Trump in the 2024 election. Residents mostly elected Republicans to represent them in the Rhode Island General Assembly that same year and the five-seat Town Council is all Republican. (One seat on the Council is currently vacant due to former occupant Chas Calenda taking a job as the state’s interim U.S. Attorney in December.) 
McMahon’s office confirmed in a separate email that Sue Cienki, a former East Greenwich School Committee and Town Councilor, suggested the school as McMahon’s tour stop. Cienki did not immediately respond to a request for comment by press time.

Make like a banana and split
McMahon praised career and technical education in her roundtable opening remarks, but she also saw a less technical and more expressive take on Exeter and West Greenwich’s curriculum in visits to two art classes, a science class, and a gallery of student artworks.
The gallery in a separate room on the school’s first floor is where McMahon received a brief lesson in contemporary art from senior student Tefft.
One of Tefft’s canvases parodied Maurizio Cattelan’s “Comedian,” a 2019 conceptual gag of sorts that, in consisting of nothing more than a banana duct-taped to a wall, became the target of ire for the same art world pretension it sought to mock. 
“I was going to ask why there was a banana,” McMahon said.
Some of that banana’s iconoclasm, or at least refusal, might also be glimpsed in the underlying purposes of McMahon’s tour, which criticizes the very department she leads and aims to disband. Speaking to reporters, she cited a moment during her confirmation hearing. 
“I said, ‘We spent all this money. We put all these programs in place. We’ve got all of this happening,’” McMahon recounted. “We’ve continued to fail our students.”   
Infante-Green separately told reporters she still thinks the U.S. Department of Education is “necessary, and I will stand by that,” she said. 
“But I also think that my job is to work with everyone that’s going to bring resources into our state and make sure that our kids and our state shines and continues to shine,” the commissioner added.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little submits plan to balance state budget without repealing Medicaid expansion

But notably, he says his plan that calls for spending cuts to balance the state budget doesn’t propose repealing Medicaid expansion — a health insurance public assistance program approved by Idaho voters through a ballot initiative in 2018. Leading up to the 2026 session of the Idaho Legislature, some Republican state lawmakers have said they are considering repealing Medicaid expansion to avoid a budget shortfall. 
Instead, Little is calling for $45 million in cuts to Idaho Medicaid from the state’s general fund. Those cuts are split between extending 4% cuts to doctor pay rates and a list of options for cuts the governor says he is giving the Legislature. Repealing Medicaid expansion isn’t on that list, the governor’s office says. 
Little says the true cost of repealing Medicaid expansion isn’t what it may seem. 
“It’s the net net net effect of it,” the governor told reporters after his State of the State address. “It’s not the big top line. It’s the bottom line, when you take all the other areas out of it. And it was passed by 60% (of voters), a plurality in the state of Idaho.” 
But he said there’s still work to do on Medicaid’s budget. 
“It’s the right thing to do,” Little said. “It’s the fastest growing expense to state government; you have to scrutinize that.”
The governor’s list of possible Medicaid cuts was not immediately available.

 Advocates say Idaho needs to wait before more Medicaid cuts

This fiscal year and next fiscal year, Idaho is facing multimillion dollar projected budget deficits after years of state tax cuts. To avoid a shortfall, the governor last year ordered midyear budget cuts across state government, including cuts to pay rates for medical providers who treat Medicaid patients. He wants to extend those cuts permanently. 
But the state’s provider pay cuts don’t appear to be enough, with projections showing the state will save much less than it hoped for,  the governor’s office says. That has prompted the governor to propose $22 million in more Medicaid cuts.
“I think one of the toughest decisions we’ll be making this year is some of the Medicaid reductions,” the governor’s budget chief, Lori Wolff, told reporters Monday morning.

Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, a Republican from Star, said the governor’s proposed $45 million in Medicaid cuts likely won’t be enough.
“Somehow we’ve got to get that Medicaid expansion under control because it’s taking resources away from, in my opinion, the most important issue, that being education,” Moyle said.
Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, a Boise Democrat, said repealing Medicaid expansion would actually raise the state’s budget deficit by around $20 million. 
“This would be a staggering mistake for so many reasons if they tried to solve the budget mess that they’ve created by going there,” Rubel told reporters. 
Before Little delivered his address, advocates wearing red T-shirts that read “Medicaid unites us” gathered in the Idaho State Capitol Building and called for state officials to wait before making more Medicaid cuts. 
They said the state hasn’t even seen the full impact of Medicaid cuts from a sweeping cost cutting state law last year, and President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” But the state’s cuts to Medicaid provider pay rates are already taking a toll, advocates said.
“The disabled community did not create this budget problem, but they are being asked to pay for it,” said Trixy Wade, who said her disabled child has struggled to find a home-based speech therapist.
 What Medicaid cuts is the governor considering? 

The governor is presenting a few options of Medicaid cuts for the Legislature to consider, Wolff told reporters — including to the state’s shift to managed care, hospital reimbursements, and other programs. Because many of those services are spelled out in law, Wolff said carrying out the cuts would need more than just a budget bill.
‘It’s Groundhogs Day:’ Idaho Legislature to explore repealing Medicaid expansion — again

“The reason the governor did not choose is a lot of those actually have statutory requirements in terms of services offered. And it will require a policy bill, and we will work closely with the Legislature and the Department of Health and Welfare to decide what path we want to take,” Wolff said. 
After the governor ordered midyear budget cuts last year, Idaho Medicaid contractor Magellan cut a critical mental health service. Providers and sheriffs warn the cuts will risk public safety. Idaho health officials aren’t sure the cuts will save the state money long-term, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Asked how officials approach making more Medicaid cuts, Little said “Thread the needle is an appropriate analysis.”
The governor is also recommending more cuts for Medicaid because provider pay rate cuts are looking like they won’t save as much as officials hoped for. 
In October, Wolff estimated the cuts would save $41.6 million next fiscal year. But now the governor’s office is estimating the cuts will save just $23 million.
Wolff said Idaho’s savings are projected to come in short because the federal government took longer to approve the state’s cuts to provider pay rates, and the feds wouldn’t let the state cut pay rates across the board, prompting Idaho to exempt some services.

A Vermont judge has rejected a renewed request to release a former Rutland County man facing a murder charge stemming from a vehicle pursuit that killed a young Rutland City police officer.
David Sleigh, an attorney for Tate Rheaume, argued in recent court filings that revelations from an internal affairs investigation that criticized officers’ actions in the July 2023 deadly chase represented a substantial change in the case that warranted his client’s release. 
Rheaume has been held without bail since 2024. He is charged with aggravated murder in the death of 19-year-old Jessica Ebbighausen, a new recruit for the department who had been on the job for less than two months.

Rutland Superior Court Judge Cortland Corsones, in a five-page decision made public Monday, wrote that the information in the internal affairs report should be weighed by a jury at trial, including the question of whether the report impacts the strength of the state’s case against Rheaume. 
“The internal investigation findings do not alter the court’s findings as to the facts of the defendant’s action,” the judge wrote. “Credibility determinations raised by the internal affairs investigation, and any delayed disclosure thereof, are appropriately made by the fact-finder at trial.” 
Sleigh said Monday he was considering whether to appeal the ruling to the Vermont Supreme Court. 
Sleigh wrote in court filings that city police leadership kept quiet about the findings of the internal affairs report for months. He added that he only became aware of the internal affairs investigation conducted by a city police commander through depositions of other officers in the case and then subpoenaed it from the city police.
The report stated that Ebbighausen’s death was “preventable” if officers had followed the proper procedures. The policy violations cited in the report ranged from not having the proper authority to initiate the pursuit to failing to follow proper procedures while the chase was underway. 
Rheaume, 22, who was also injured in the crash, had initially been charged with grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a resulting death and attempting to elude police leading to a fatal crash.
Several months following further police investigation, Rheaume was arraigned on the upgraded charges, including the aggravated murder count, and has been held without bail since. 
Before the internal affairs report, Rheaume — who was represented by another attorney at the time — lost an appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court in August 2024. In that appeal, he was challenging the initial order holding him without bail. 
Rheaume’s attorney at the time “claims that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could find the requisite intent element,” the ruling stated. “We disagree.”
Sleigh, in recent filings, contended that the new information from the internal affairs report weakened the state’s case against his client, leading to his request to strike that order.
Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan, however, argued in recent filings against Sleigh’s request for Rheaume’s release. According to Sullivan, the report’s findings do not change that it was Rheaume who was driving the truck that struck and killed Ebbighausen.
Sullivan declined comment on the judge’s latest ruling on Monday.
No trial date has been set in the case, though court filings state that the attorneys are to be “trial ready” by April.

McKinney’s bill also seeks to narrow state law and say the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services can house offenders under only state laws, not any “law.” A Red Willow County District Court judge cited that section of law as a reason to not halt the Nebraska-ICE partnership.
“The executive branch does not have that autonomy and should not have signed our state up to have an ICE detention facility,” McKinney said.

Pillen has argued he’s doing his duty to help the federal government enforce immigration laws and, in a pre-session interview in mid-December, repeated “very clearly we have the authority.” He said there is “evidence every day,” including his four trips to the U.S.-Mexico border, which together highlight what he called a “safety problem.”
“We’re proud about it,” Pillen said. “We’re doing what we have the authority to do.”
Pillen called safety the government’s “highest calling.” He described Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s Corrections Department, as “one of the best directors” in the country. 
The Nebraska-ICE contract is in effect through at least September. Pillen’s office has estimated ICE’s reimbursements will annually net the state $14.25 million.
McKinney argued the state should not be giving up an institution specifically meant to prepare offenders to reenter society. The McCook prison had housed low-risk adult male inmates serving felony sentences. Some worked in surrounding communities.

The North Omaha senator said the McCook situation highlights a “lack of respect” toward the Legislature, the “crumbling” of separation of powers and “blurring of the lines.” 
State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha also introduced LB 881 last week, which would also require local law enforcement agencies, jails and the Nebraska State Patrol to receive approval from a “local governing body” before entering certain agreements to enforce immigration law.
Sheriff’s offices in Banner, Dakota, Sioux and Wheeler counties, as well as the Nebraska Corrections Department and Nebraska State Patrol, have joined what’s known as the 287(g) Program to that end. The Dakota County and Corrections Department, specifically in Lincoln County, signed agreements to allow officers to identify and process removable migrants. The other four signed agreements to enforce limited immigration authority in routine police duties.
Pillen said he remained confident he didn’t need legislation to authorize the McCook partnership. McKinney said any agreement could still be approved, just in a proper manner.
“If they wanted the authority to do so, they should have came to us in a respectful way,” McKinney said. “Shouldn’t have been, in my opinion, behind closed doors without all members of the body being notified and aware of what was going on.”

Jim Pillen will appoint a successor “as quickly as possible” for now-former University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, who resigned Friday as expected.
O’Connor announced Dec. 30 that she would resign at 11:59 p.m. last Friday. She submitted her resignation to Pillen’s office at 1:39 p.m. that day. Seven minutes later, she emailed the chair of the NU Board of Regents, Paul Kenney, and Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, to confirm her resignation, according to records from NU and the Governor’s Office.
“While I will not remain a member of the board, I look forward to continuing to support the university and the work of the great State of Nebraska,” O’Connor said in her resignation letter.
In a one-sentence reply Monday, Pillen told O’Connor her resignation had been received. A spokesperson said the governor would seek to fill the vacancy “as quickly as possible.” State law requires an appointment within 45 days.

O’Connor, 35, is charged with one Class IIIA felony, driving drunk and causing serious bodily injury, related to a May 21 crash in east-central Omaha. That’s the same allegation outlined in an impeachment article filed last week against her. She was charged July 30.
The Nebraska Constitution bars felons from holding public office, and if O’Connor had been convicted, she would have been forced to leave office.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, who had introduced two resolutions to formally pursue impeaching O’Connor, filed motions Monday to withdraw them. They will be voted on Tuesday, essentially a formality. Kauth had worked with the father of the three young children injured in the crash. His mother-in-law sustained a broken back and pelvis.
“Pleased that she did it, disappointed it took so long,” Kauth said of O’Connor’s resignation.
O’Connor leaves after seven years as an elected regent. She was previously a student regent representing the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Her eastern Douglas County constituents reelected her to a second six-year term in November 2024, with 67% of the vote. 
Her tenure included four years serving alongside Pillen, who had been a regent from his hometown of Columbus for 10 years before becoming governor in 2023.

Pillen, a Republican, could appoint someone closer to his political preferences than O’Connor, a Democrat. The regents are officially nonpartisan with a previous 6-2 split, majority Republican.
Under state law, because O’Connor resigned before Feb. 1, there will be a special election this year. Pillen will appoint a successor through Jan. 7, 2027. 
Had O’Connor resigned on Feb. 1 or later, the special election wouldn’t have been until 2028. Pillen’s appointment would have stayed through Jan. 4, 2029.
O’Connor indicated to Kenney that she would spend Friday afternoon responding to constituents regarding the proposed $800 million deal for NU to buy out Clarkson Regional Health Services’ share of NU-Clarkson Nebraska Medicine partnership and related Clarkson-area properties. 
Nebraska Medicine is the hospital and clinical and medical services partner of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The Nebraska Medicine board opposes the deal.
Regents were initially set to meet Friday to discuss Nebraska Medicine — it was unclear if O’Connor would attend or if her vote would be a deciding one — but delayed the meeting to Thursday.
Kauth said she’s glad O’Connor won’t have a say in such a major decision.

(Screenshot from video by Monica Bicking.) A U.S. Border Patrol agent kneed a man at least five times in the face while several other agents held him pinned facedown on the pavement in south Minneapolis on Friday, according to multiple witnesses who shared videos with the Reformer.
Yarrow Tkachuk-Kedziora, a Minneapolis resident, heard a horn blaring and looked out a second-floor window onto Chicago Avenue near 24th Street. They saw a black Chevrolet Suburban driven by a U.S. Border Patrol agent going the wrong way and then hit a gray Buick Encore head on.
An agent then jumped out of the Suburban, smashed in the driver’s window of the Encore and pulled the driver out of the car.
“It was almost faster than I could process,” Tkachuk-Kedziora said. “They took a baton out and smashed it in … and immediately, from what I could tell, started beating him.”
Monica Bicking was at work as a nurse at a nearby homeless shelter when she heard residents and staff yelling ICE was outside.
She ran out and started recording. Her video shows five Border Patrol agents on top of a man in the middle of Chicago Avenue.

One officer knees the man in the head at least five times as he cries out in pain. Bicking can be heard in the video yelling, “Stop kneeing him in the face! That’s his face! Stop it!”
“It was completely unnecessary and uncalled for,” Bicking said in an interview.
Then a masked agent with a vest reading “Border Patrol Federal Agent” approaches Bicking and tells her to back up or she’ll be arrested.
Three officers then pick up the man and carry him to the back of the Chevy — parked the wrong way, front-to-front with the man’s Buick.
On the video, bystanders who have come out to film the scene ask the injured man what his name is, and he replies over blaring whistles, “Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos,” as an agent tells him, “Get in the f*cking car.”
A GoFundMe set up for the man says he is a U.S. resident and was observing ICE activity when he was stopped. He was detained at the Whipple Federal Building before being transported to the hospital for medical treatment because he was having trouble breathing.
The Reformer has not verified the man’s identity, but received a copy of the car’s purchase contract for a man with the first and middle names Juan Carlos.
The Department of Homeland Security did not return emails seeking information about the incident.
The man stayed in the back of the Suburban as a Border Patrol agent moved the man’s car to the side of the road and another spoke with the driver of a black pick-up truck who had rear-ended the detained man, according to video shared by Charles Karter, another witness.
Karter’s video shows one agent holding what appears to be a can of chemical irritant, telling observers to back up.
The Trump administration has sent hundreds of immigration officers to Minnesota in the past week, following a few hundred back in December. They’ve been met with stiff resistance from anti-ICE activists, who are following federal officers and filming them while blowing whistles to warn their neighbors. The situation has intensified since last week, when federal officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good in her vehicle.
Attorney General Keith Ellison filed a lawsuit on Monday on behalf of the state of Minnesota with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeking an end to the unprecedented surge of federal agents and officers.
The suit argues agents have acted unlawfully since their arrival in December by arresting and using force against innocent bystanders; pointing firearms against people who pose no threat; and carrying out enforcement actions at schools, churches and hospitals.
Tkachuk-Kedziora said they’re still stunned by what they saw.
“Since seeing that I do feel like I am in an occupied zone,” Tkachuk-Kedziora said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-4.48.45 PM.png,,,2026-01-12 18:11:41.199357

Barbara Sharief stands in front of advocates from across the state affected by medical conditions confusing child endangerment investigations. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill inserting further medical evaluation into cases of suspected child abuse received unanimous support in its first committee stop Monday.
The Senate Children, Families, and Elder Affairs committee approved SB 42, sponsored by Sen. Barbara Sharief.
The bill would provide more time and opportunity for medical evaluations and second opinions when medical conditions such as Rickets, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or Vitamin D deficiency could explain away otherwise concerning signs of child abuse, before parents are arrested.
“There are cases where legitimate medical conditions, particularly rare or complex diagnoses, can be mistaken for abuse. When that happens, families may experience unnecessary trauma and children may face disruption that could’ve been avoided with the right medical expertise at the right time. This bill is about ensuring that medical complexity is met with medical knowledge while continuing to prioritize child safety,” Sharief said.
The bill, according to the Senate Democratic office, “focuses on improving medical accuracy and fairness in cases involving children with complex or rare medical conditions, while maintaining strong protection for child safety.”
In 2025, the bill passed the Senate unanimously but did not receive a vote in the House despite passing two committees. 
The House companion is HB 47.
Sharief, a Democrat from Miramar, and Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston, presented the bill Monday in a news conference, too. Rep. Patt Maney, a Republican from Shalimar, is a prime cosponsor.
Bartleman said similar bills in other states have passed and that Florida is “behind the 8-ball.”
Parents may allege “pre-existing diagnosis of Rickets, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Vitamin D deficiency, or any other medical condition known to appear to be caused by, or know to be misdiagnosed as, abuse,” triggering examinations.
The bill does not grant a second opinion examination “as to whether the child has been sexually abused.”
Twins
Michael and Tasha Patterson from Broward County made the trip to the Capitol Monday to share their story. 
They are parents of three-year-old twins, born prematurely and delivered by emergency c-section, who were home for about seven weeks after birth before being separated from their parents. 
After being released from the neonatal intensive care unit, they returned to a doctor’s office eight-10 times in the first weeks of their lives, Tasha said. In the last visit to the emergency room, providers found injuries on one twin, resulting in child abuse allegations. And later, the remaining twin was found to have fractures “everywhere.”
Tasha said Michael’s son, a third child in the family but not biologically hers, has no injuries.
The twins continued suffering injuries after Tasha and Michael lost full custody, she said. 
Michael and Tasha have supervised visitation with the children, visiting them four a few hours per week, but she said the state is trying to have the twins adopted, she said. 
Their twins were diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, “caused by genetic changes that affect connective tissue,” according to the Ehlers-Danlos Society, and metabolic bone disease, Tasha said, and preventative care now has her twins “flourishing.”
“It puts you in a position where it makes you feel insecure for something you didn’t do,” Tasha said. “But I also know that I’m a Christian and I believe God has a purpose for everything and I do believe we will get our children back and in the process of it we’ll be able to make changes for other families as well,” Tasha said.

,DC,2026-01-12 23:08:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal judge grants Rhode Island wind company reprieve from Trump pause,"Ariana Figueroa, Nancy Lavin",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-grants-rhode-island-wind-company-reprieve-trump-pause,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge gave a temporary greenlight Monday to a mostly constructed $5 billion Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island, reversing a late December order from the Trump administration that halted work.Judge Royce C. Lamberth rejected the Trump administration’s national security arguments, finding they didn’t provide “a sufficient explanation” for issuing a Dec. 22 stop-work order on Revolution Wind, the planned 65-turbine project. He found the entire 704-megawatt project would be imperiled if he did not order work to resume and issued a preliminary injunction to block the administration’s pause.Lamberth was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan.The project is one of several wind energy producers that, along with state officials, filed a suit in District of Columbia federal court after the Interior Department last month issued a new stop-work order that halted several projects off the coasts of Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia and New York.“We refuse to accept this Administration’s unlawful attempts to hinder progress on the Revolution Wind project, and today’s legal victory reaffirms that we are right on the law,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement after the preliminary injunction was granted. “The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case.”Janice M. Schneider, one of the attorneys representing Revolution Wind, said during a Monday hearing the stop-work order was costing the company $1.44 million per day for a project that is 87% complete. The administration first ordered work on the project stopped last year, but a Lambreth order in September unpaused it. The Interior Department then froze the project again in December, based on an analysis that found “the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference,” posing a national security risk. Peter Torstensen, an attorney for the Trump administration, said the national security issues should outweigh any monetary harms that Revolution Wind would incur. Questioning motiveSchneider noted President Donald Trump’s comment to oil executives last week, following U.S. military operations in Venezuela, that no new wind turbines would be built in the U.S. “We do think that this court should be skeptical of the government’s motive,” Schneider said of Trump’s recent comments. “It is clear the administration's goal is to not let any windmills be built.”Torstensen said the concerns from the administration stemmed from national security, and that the stop-work order was issued to provide a time to “have that discussion.”Lamberth said he didn’t understand that reasoning.“You want to stop everything in place…while you figure out what to do?” Lamberth asked Torstensen.Torstensen answered that the pause was to review the national security concerns.Project at stakeSchneider added that if a preliminary injunction was not granted Monday, then Revolution Wind would be at risk of breaching a contract with Rhode Island Energy, the state’s primary utility company.Schneider said the company has a short lease on specialty vessels needed to transport the towering seven turbines out to sea. The specific boat under contract, the Wind Scylla, is only available until Feb. 22, and needs 41 days to transport the remaining seven turbines, she said.Even after the skyscraper-sized foundations are anchored to the foundations in the seafloor, developers still need “months and months and months and months” of testing in limited capacity to meet the January 2027 deadline to supply power to Rhode Island, Schneider said.That deadline is also critical to New England residents who rely on an infusion of wind-powered electricity to boost supply and lower cost for energy, especially in winter months when fuel is limited and expensive, Sarah Rice, Rhode Island assistant attorney general, said during Monday’s hearing. “We’re talking about millions of dollars in increased electricity costs in the region,” Rice said, adding that residents would see a $31 million increase in electricity costs every 90 days the project is delayed. Rhode Island and Connecticut’s state decarbonization mandates also rely on the 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity the project will generate at full operations — enough to power 350,000 homes across both states.“It’s about people being able to turn on their heat in the winter,” Rice said.In Lamberth’s order from the bench granting the preliminary injunction, he acknowledged that tight window, and found that Revolution Wind is likely to face irreparable harm. “If Revolution Wind cannot meet certain benchmarks, the whole project could collapse,” he said.",,,,2026-01-12 18:11:41.199357

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Helena Moreno was sworn in as New Orleans’ 63rd mayor Monday, taking the oath of office under the artificial starry skies and amidst the pastiche neoclassical interiors of the Saenger Theatre — officially kicking off her first term as mayor of New Orleans.
Moreno is the second woman — after outgoing Mayor LaToya Cantrell — and the first Hispanic mayor to lead the city.
Moreno was joined by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who administered the oath of office to the mayor after giving a short speech, where she described Moreno as “talented but tough.”
“She believes in fairness and in the simple yet fundamental principle that elected leaders must be accountable to the people they serve,” Harris said. “Helena, I know you will be a mayor who will lead with integrity, with courage and with the people of New Orleans always at the center of your work.”
In her inaugural address, Moreno lauded the virtues of faith, hope and love in her work to serve and lead the city.

“This is our time to build that functional city that we all deserve together,” Moreno said. “We will build a New Orleans that is safe, where we can drive down the street without busting up the car, where there is no limit to realizing a dream, and where our children have endless opportunities for success, where our seniors live not in fear or uncertainty, but in dignity and insecurity. We want a New Orleans that works for everyone.”
The seven members of the New City Council — which will be led by two Black at-large councilmembers for the first time in the city’s history — were also sworn in at the ceremony, which featured music by The Soul Rebels and Trombone Shorty, among others, and included appearances by beloved local chef Emeril Lagasse and local philanthropist and New Orleans Saints and Pelicans owner Gayle Benson, as well as a host of local, state and federal politicians, including Cantrell.
The inauguration ceremony caps off a weekend of celebrations, which included a festival at Lafayette Square and a mass at St. Louis Cathedral. The Crescent City Connection bridge and the Superdome were also adorned in blue and gold lights — Moreno’s campaign colors — over the weekend. Moreno’s transition team will lead a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, after weather concerns delayed an initial plan to do it Saturday.

Monday’s ceremony seemed designed to showcase her diverse political coalition and breadth of relationships by including prominent Republicans such as U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Louisiana state Senate President Cameron Henry alongside local Democratic heavyweights such U.S. House Rep. Troy Carter and state Sen. Jimmy Harris in the ceremony.
“Let’s face it, these are complicated and troubling times; conflict and division are all around us,” Moreno said. “Some will continue to try to divide us, but we must choose to come together for our future. Today, you’ve seen local, state and federal leaders on all sides of politics come together to support the future of our exceptional city. We have more in common than divides us.”
Despite the optimism on display at Monday’s ceremony, Moreno will assume office under stormy conditions.
The city faces a projected $220 million deficit this year. To cover the deficit, Moreno, along with outgoing District A councilmember and incoming Chief Administrative Officer Joe Giarrusso, have clawed back $14.7 million in American Rescue Plan Act dollars, called for the furloughing of approximately 700 city employees and handed out pink slips to dozens of employees.
The latest round of layoffs, which included cuts to the Office of Resilience and Sustainability, caused a stir last week. Employees say they had previously been told they would still have a job in the Moreno administration by aides close to the mayor, according to recently fired employees who spoke to Verite News. A Moreno spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the firings.
Many of the other cuts came from subdepartments of the mayor’s office, including the Office of Youth and Families and the Office of Criminal Justice Coordination, which were both shuttered altogether.
Those employees were “unclassified” political appointees, meaning they are not covered by the city’s civil service system. Many such appointees enjoy higher salaries and quicker hiring processes than classified civil service workers. But unlike civil service workers, they are “at-will” employees who serve at the pleasure of the mayor and can be fired without cause or an appeals process.
On Monday morning, shortly after the inauguration concluded, the Office of Youth and Families sent out an email thanking the people of New Orleans for their support of the office as it closes.
“As our dedicated staff steps away from this work, we do so with pride in what we have built together,” the email read. “While we will no longer be here, our commitment to the wellbeing of children, youth, and families continues through the City of New Orleans Health Department, where this work will carry forward.”

Amanda Fallis, the president of the city workers’ union AFSCME Local 2349, said that the union has been in talks with Moreno and Giarrusso about furloughs and layoffs — and that union officials would meet with Moreno again tomorrow (Jan. 13) on her second day in office.
“AFSCME Local 2349 has greatly appreciated Mayor Moreno and CAO Giarrusso and their teams’ willingness to meet with us, even before officially being sworn into office,” Fallis said. “We look forward to partnering with them to follow the terms of our collective bargaining agreement regarding 45 days notice from City administration regarding any layoffs of classified employees, probationary or not.”
Despite the slew of challenges facing Moreno, she sounded a hopeful note in her inaugural address.
“We know that things are not exactly where we want them to be today, and we know that it’s not going to be easy to fix these things, but just because things are hard does not mean that they’re impossible,” she said. “We stand here on a turning point as we face challenging times, and we must be clear that failure is not an option. Not anymore. There’s just too much at stake.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo / New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers approved a bill Monday that would add more than $128 million in new spending, despite criticism from Republican legislators that their Democratic colleagues sidestepped the scrutiny that normally accompanies such budget requests.
Two legislative panels passed the bill at the tail end of hourslong committee hearings Thursday, without inviting public comment. On Monday, several Assembly Republicans blasted that process as a failure of transparency and accountability.
NJ Senate confirms final 16 judges of Gov. Murphy’s tenure

The state holds five months of budget hearings and hears from hundreds of experts, advocates, and others to decide how to spend taxpayer funds every year, Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) said. Yet the Legislature’s Democratic majority introduced and passed this additional funding in less than a week, with no public scrutiny, Dunn noted.
“We tell residents that their voices matter. But what happened this week tells a very different story,” Dunn said.
The bill was one of several that lawmakers passed that will cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending and tax breaks, prompting objections from several GOP legislators in the Assembly. There was no debate in the Senate.
The bill includes $20 million to the FIFA World Cup host committee for promotions (first lady Tammy Murphy chairs the committee’s board of directors), $25 million for a state supercomputer, $13 million for a new jail in Camden County, and other funding for food insecurity research and capital improvements at county buildings, schools, and a hospital, among other things.
When these types of specific spending requests are added to the state budget, they are often derided as “Christmas tree” items.

Assemblyman Brian Rumpf (R-Ocean) urged his colleagues to reject the bills, saying fiscal caution was needed because of a state budget deficit, federal cuts, and other budget stressors.
“I thought Christmas was over,” Rumpf said.
Both chambers passed the bill largely along party lines, with a vote of 46-25 in the Assembly and 25-14 in the Senate. Murphy, who leaves office Jan. 20, must sign the bill for it to become law.
It was sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) and Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the lower chamber’s Democratic budget officer.
The new spending comes six months after New Jersey lawmakers approved a record-high $58.8 billion budget that included a number of cuts and controversial diversions that have spurred ongoing protests and calls for restored funding. That budget also included over $700 million for lawmakers’ pet projects that critics have condemned as pork spending, even though Murphy had warned federal cuts would require “hard decisions.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen)Bering Straits Native Corporation faces criticism from shareholders regarding the corporation’s involvement in federal contracts to aid in the detention and removal of asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and migrants.
BSNC has in the past ten years secured lucrative contracts with the federal government, specifically the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to perform service related to migrant detention and removal.
Since the second Trump administration’s aggressive policies to round up and deport migrants and asylum seekers, the Native corporation’s participation in business contracts with DHS and ICE has come under renewed scrutiny by shareholders.
BSNC shareholders Charlene Aqpik Apok, Ayyu Qassataq and Jessica Saniguq Ullrich have publicly criticized that BSNC’s business strategy runs counter to the values that are supposed to guide the corporation. They penned an op-ed published in the Anchorage Daily News and drafted a petition that was circulated online and had garnered as of early December 102 signatures from shareholders and descendants, and 20 signatures from non-shareholders. They submitted the petition and the signatures to the BSNC board of directors prior to their December board meeting. The petitioners say additional signatures are being compiled with the intent to send an updated list, likely in January.
The petition

	
The petition calls on BSNC to divest from all business contracts associated in any way with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers immediately. It states, “As BSNC shareholders and descendants, we are deeply concerned about BSNC’s complicity in inflicting harm on Indigenous peoples through ICE detention facilities.”
The petition says that these detention centers “go against ancestral values of responsibility, human dignity, and respect. This line of business is an unjust investment on many levels, including adjacency to work that co-signs ICE methods including lack of due process for detainment, incarceration and rampant mistreatment of thousands of Indigenous relatives from Central and South America.”
The petition also reports that a BSNC descendant was recently stopped by ICE agents in Anchorage, Alaska and had he not produced ID, may have otherwise been hauled away and recounts Ullrich’s witnessing the detention of a worker who had been working legally in the country.
Ullrich witnessed the ICE arrest in front of her doorsteps last fall. She recounted the situation to the Nugget in an interview, saying she had hired contractors to work on countertops. As they pulled up to her house, she heard yelling outside. She saw the contractor van and two unmarked cars with police lights. “I had a feeling that it was ICE and started to go out and video it. And saw them bring one young man back in cuffs and put him in the unmarked car, and that’s when I asked, ‘Are you an ICE agent?’ And the man responded, ‘yes.’”
The man in handcuffs was detained and later deported.
This scene occurred the day before the BSNC annual shareholder meeting in Anchorage and Ullrich became aware of BSNC’s involvement in ICE contracts.
“These government sponsored actions are reminiscent of intergenerational traumas that we are still recovering from as a broader community,” states the petition. “Our Alaska Native community knows intimately the devastation that government-sanctioned separation of families and physical/mental violence causes to people, families and communities for generations. Boarding school survivors still live amongst us – and every single Native person in and from our region has been affected in some way by this violent assimilation era. To be complicit in inflicting these harms on other Indigenous people is unconscionable.”
Ullrich addressed the plenum at the annual shareholder meeting and although there was no response to her concerns, another comment elicited the response by BSNC CEO Dan Graham, who maintained that the business is conducted with utmost care and compassion.
Ayyu Qassataq ran for a seat on the BSNC board of directors and in her campaign highlighted the not very widely known issue of BSNC’s business with ICE. “After publishing our petition with its links to relevant news stories, we received many comments on social media and within the petition itself that made it clear that many shareholders, descendants and community members were horrified to learn that our corporation was involved with ICE in this way,” she said.
In her campaign video, she made clear that she would advocate for a change in direction.
“The way our Native corporations operate should be an extension of the values we carry as Native peoples. The work they do should amplify and reflect the relational power and knowledge that is embedded within our own cultures,” said Qassataq in an interview with the Nugget. She added that there’s a lack of transparency where individual board members stand on any given issue. “There are no opportunities made for people who are running for the board to express what they where they stand on different issues. So, there’s a complete lack of transparency at pretty much every level,” she said.
The business of migrant detention and removal

	
Several Native corporations in Alaska are engaged in ICE contracts, including NANA’s Akima division and BSNC through its subsidiaries. The corporations can secure government contracts thanks to a set-aside contract initiative administered through the Small Business Administration, the so-called 8(a) contracts, to help small businesses and what the federal government describes as “socially and economically disadvantaged” communities, including Alaska Native corporations.
An analysis of the publicly available contract documents reveals that BSNC over the last decade had a revenue of approximately $587 million from these ICE and Homeland security contracts. What is not clear is how much this revenue translates into profit.
In the latest BSNC Annual Report, Board President Cindy Massie reports that “2024 was a landmark year for our financial performance. BSNC achieved gross annual revenues of nearly $799 million, up 21% from the previous year.”
The report lists a total revenue of $122.7 million made in fiscal year 2024 from their Security Services division but does not spell out the money made from ICE or Homeland Security contracts. “These services typically include providing security personnel, surveillance, and related protective measures to ensure the safety and security of government facilities and operations,” reads the report.
The only reference to DHS and ICE work is found at BSNC’s job portal, where a plethora of jobs are advertised, including ICE related work as janitors at El Paso, detention officers at El Paso and Pecos, TX and armed transportation officers for DHS and ICE in Newark, NJ and Sykesville, MD.
On the website, BSNC also states its corporate values: “Our values arise from the culture of Our People. We honor our commitments. We empower one another. We respect diversity. We lead with responsibility.”
According to the federal procurement data system, BSNC subsidiaries Paragon Professional Services LLC, Global Precisions Systems LLC and Bering Straits Professional Service have or had several contracts with ICE and DHS.
Paragon Professional Services LLC branched out from providing environmental professional services to the migrant detention business connected to ICE. Paragon has and had contracts for detention, guard and transportation at El Paso Service Processing Center and to supply frozen meals; for transportation and guard services for the Baltimore, Maryland area of responsibility; for “transportation and guard services for the Enforcement and Removal Operations, NYC Area of Responsibility to achieve the ICE mission to safely transport detained aliens,” and to provide transportation and guard services at the Newark, NJ  detention facility.
Another BSNC subsidiary, Global Precisions Systems LLC, shows in the federal data base 230 so-called task orders – contracts and modified contracts – with ICE, stretching back to 2015 including facility support services at detention centers in El Centro, California, El Paso, Texas and Baltimore, Maryland for operation and maintenance of ICE facilities, armed guards and transportation services, and food for the El Paso detention center.
Bering Straits Professional Services LLC also bid on ICE related contracts. Last year, the subsidiary protested a decision by the government to award a contract for detention management, transportation and food services to Akima Infrastructure Protection LLC, a NANA subsidiary, and at the Krome Processing Center in Miami, Florida. Akima has managed the Krome facility for a decade and has a contract for Migrant Operations Center Services at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
According to a Government Accountability Office decision, the protest that Bering Straits Professional Services lodged, was denied. Among other points, the agency found that BSPS did not understand its role the process of screening migrants’ credible fear in their asylum requests.
According to an Amnesty International report, compiled in September 2025 after visits to the Krome detention facility and the Florida state-owned facility cruelly nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz,” detention conditions at both facilities amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
“The use of prolonged solitary confinement at Krome and the use of the ‘box’ at “Alligator Alcatraz” amount to torture or other ill-treatment,” reads the report.
A 2021 news story in the El Paso Matters online newspaper detailed allegations of sexual assaults by guards, medical neglect, hunger strikes and letter writing campaigns that sought to change the dire conditions at the facility, for which the BSNC subsidiary Global Precision Systems holds ICE contracts.
According to the petition, BSNC board members toured the El Paso detention center.
BNSC response

	
Marleanna Hall, Director of External Affairs and Public Relations with BSNC responded to a list of detailed questions from the Nugget. “BSNC is a diversified corporation that operates across a broad range of industries, including construction, environmental services, professional services, logistics, and security support,” she wrote in an email response.
“Like many Alaska Native corporations, BSNC participates in federal contracting as a means of creating employment opportunities, generating revenue to support shareholder benefits, and strengthening the long-term sustainability of the corporation.
“BSNC does not comment on details of contracts that our companies perform, our communications with shareholders, customers, or internal communications.”
Asked if the leadership has responded to the shareholders petition and concerns, she wrote, “Responses to any inquiries from shareholders will be evaluated in due course to provide the best outcome for our shareholders, customers, partners, and community.”
Elsewhere, tribes divest

	
Other Native entities have made recent headlines divesting from business involvement associated with migrant detention or deportation.
According to Native News Online report, the Oneida Nation’s Business Committee, after learning of two federal contracts worth $6 million providing services to ICE, passed a resolution requiring all tribal entities to disengage from any contracts or agreements involving ICE. One contract involved the El Paso, TX detention center. The Oneida Nation said the decision was guided by the Nation’s “Good Mind Principles,” which emphasize ethical responsibility and alignment with community values.
Another tribe, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation even went as so far as to fire their senior executives over ICE contracts. According to a December 18, 2025 report in the Kansas Reflector, the chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Tribal Council Joseph Rupnick said the Nation and its subsidiaries have fully separated from a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He drew parallels between immigrant detention and America’s history of forced removal of Native Americans. Some members of the tribe’s leadership were part of the company that contracted with ICE, KBP Services, and were subsequently fired for their involvement.
Back in Alaska, Jessica Saniguq Ullrich said that “Our ultimate goal and hope is that our corporation, is aligning with our ancestral values and engaging in businesses and investments that are ethical and moral according to our way of being in our way of life.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah judiciary is holding a town hall at the Matheson Courthouse in Salt Lake City on Wednesday at 6 p.m. as part of an effort to strengthen Utahns’ trust, access and understanding of the state’s court system. 
The town hall is part of a statewide initiative called Court Connect, which is “aimed at strengthening public trust in the courts, expanding access to justice, and increasing awareness of court resources and services,” according to a news release judiciary officials issued Monday.
“This free, public event offers community members a chance to engage directly with Judiciary representatives in an informal, welcoming setting,” the release said.

The town hall comes ahead of a legislative session set to begin next week, during which the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature is expected to debate a slew of bills aimed at the judiciary, including one to expand the Utah Supreme Court. Tensions between the judiciary and lawmakers are high after a series of court rulings that have upset lawmakers, especially regarding redistricting and the Legislature’s ability to change voter-approved ballot initiatives. 
The Court Connect town halls are meant to “open doors and build stronger connections between the courts and the communities they serve,” judiciary officials said. “They offer the public an opportunity to learn more about the role of the Judiciary, how the courts operate, and how the judicial branch fits into the broader system of government.”
During the town hall, attendees can learn about the role of the courts in Utah’s justice system, ask questions and interface directly with judiciary representatives, and meet with judges and other court personnel in a less formal setting, outside the courtroom. 
Attendees can also learn how to access justice services, including self-help resources, online filing systems, and court resources that are available in their communities.

Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, underwent an outpatient operation on Friday after breaking her wrist in a fall days earlier.","U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, underwent an outpatient operation on Friday after breaking her wrist in a fall days earlier.
The congresswoman fractured her right wrist after falling at a CVS on Sunday, Jan. 4. She got a temporary cast that night and scheduled the procedure for later that week.
Dr. Kevin O’Malley treated DeLauro, 82, at MedStar Health Medical Center at Brandywine in Brandywine, Md., on Friday morning. It was an outpatient procedure that lasted for 90 minutes, and she left the center shortly after it was done.
A spokesperson at her office said she’s expected to make a full recovery and have full mobility in her wrist.
“Congresswoman DeLauro received a routine, brief outpatient operation on her wrist on Friday morning at 9 a.m. to address a recent fracture. The operation was a success, and her wrist is expected to fully heal,” DeLauro spokesperson King Green said in a statement provided to the Connecticut Mirror on Monday.
DeLauro has continued to work since the operation. She began Monday at an event in New Haven. The U.S. House was set to hold the first votes of the week in the evening.
Wearing a cast on her right wrist, DeLauro attended a press conference about the Trump administration’s cancellation of Full-Service Community Schools grants. Schools in New Haven, Waterbury, and Hartford lost those federal funds at the end of 2025.
As the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, DeLauro is in the middle of negotiating and trying to pass the remaining full-year spending bills to fund the rest of the federal government before the Jan. 30 deadline.
Her committee released another spending package Sunday in fiscal year 2026 funding for the State Department, Treasury Department, the IRS, the federal judiciary and some other agencies.
Last summer, DeLauro went for surgery to treat spinal stenosis while Congress was on its month-long August recess. The surgery was successful, and she went to physical therapy after the procedure. She returned to Washington, D.C., after Labor Day when Congress came back into session.
The Mayo Clinic describes spinal stenosis as a condition where the spaces in the backbone are too small. It is a more common diagnosis in people who are over 50.
DeLauro is running for reelection in November’s midterm elections, seeking her 19th term to serve Connecticut’s 3rd Congressional District based in her hometown of New Haven.
She is the longest-serving member of Connecticut’s congressional delegation. She was first elected in 1990.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0112_SR_FSCSEducation_353-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-12 17:59:12.838403

(Photo via Google Earth)A West Branch nursing home that has faced allegations of sexual assault and contributing to a resident’s death has been cited for 16 regulatory violations covering a wide range of recurring problems, from staffing shortages to infection control.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing has proposed, but held in suspension, more than $16,000 in state fines against Crestview Specialty Care, a 65-bed nursing home that is part of the Iowa-based chain Care Initiatives. The department typically holds state fines in suspension while the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal penalty is warranted.
The violations cited by DIAL include insufficient nursing staff; failure to provide the required nursing services for residents; hazards in the building; failure to protect residents’ rights; failure to provide a safe, clean, homelike environment; inadequate quality of care; failure to treat and prevent pressure sores, and inadequate infection control.
Of the suspended state fines, $10,000 is tied to the failure to treat and prevent the pressure sores of two different residents, while $6,750 is tied to the failure to assess and follow physicians’ orders for wound treatment.
Although DIAL’s database of care-facility fines indicates the proposed state fines total $16,750, the agency’s written citation indicates an additional $8,000 in fines was proposed and held in suspension due to three residents of the home falling out of the mechanical lifts used to transport residents in and out of bed. One of the three sustained a head injury, a bone fracture at the base of the spine and a leg fracture, according to inspectors.
Seven complaints, all substantiated 
State records indicate the inspection was precipitated by seven separate complaints that required investigation. All of the complaints were substantiated in that inspectors cited the home for specific violations related to each of the complainants’ allegations.
Regarding the allegations of too few staff, which is widely considered to be the single biggest contributor to poor quality care, inspectors reported that employees of the home openly acknowledged the issue.
Inspectors reported that one certified nursing assistant told them the homes did “not have enough staff scheduled on a routine basis.” As a result, she said, employees were not able to provide residents with all of the care they needed, according to inspectors’ reports. “It has been brought to management’s attention numerous times and nothing changes,” the aide allegedly told inspectors.
A registered nurse at the home told inspectors there was “definitely a lack of staff working at the facility at any given time,” adding that she had, on numerous occasions, informed the home’s director of nursing that residents’ needs weren’t being met but had never noticed any difference in the subsequent staffing levels, according to inspectors’ reports.
During the inspection itself, inspectors reported, a licensed practical nurse told them she had been unable to complete that morning’s treatment of residents’ wounds due to the fact that no medication aide had been scheduled to dispense the residents’ prescribed medications.
Another CNA reported that during the evening shift, she was often the only aide assigned to a hall that had 25 residents, despite the fact that some of the residents could only be transferred in and out of bed with the assistance of two or more employees to guard against injuries, according to inspectors’ reports.
On some occasions, she alleged, there weren’t enough employees on duty to get residents to the dining room for supper, so all of the residents were sent trays of food to eat in their rooms.
State records indicate that during Crestview Specialty Care’s last annual inspection, in November 2024, it was cited for some of the same violations, including insufficient nursing staff, failure to treat pressure sores and failure to provide the required nursing services for residents.
That year, Crestview Specialty Care was cited by inspectors for failing to accurately assess residents’ condition and provide medical intervention when necessary. As a result, the inspectors alleged, a resident suffered worsening gastrointestinal issues — which included stomach aches and vomiting – for four days until he was transferred to a hospital emergency room, where he was intubated and three liters of bowel obstruction were suctioned from his stomach.
The hospital was unable to stabilize the resident, who died within six hours of arriving in the emergency room.
Sexual assault lawsuit focuses on staffing
Currently, the family of the late Ruth Bartow is suing Crestview and Care Initiatives in Cedar County District Court. The lawsuit alleges that Bartow was admitted to Crestview in February 2023 with severe cognitive impairments, and that three months later, at 2:50 p.m. on April 5, the staff found an unauthorized male “visitor” in her room — 54-year-old Michael Beaver of West Branch.
Beaver was laying with Bartow in her bed “without any clothes on,” the lawsuit alleges. The Crestview staff escorted Beaver out of Bartow’s room to the front lobby and notified the police. Bartow was later found in her room crying, according to the lawsuit.
Beaver wasn’t criminally charged in the case as he was already subject to a civil commitment proceeding.
State inspectors later concluded Beaver had been seen walking around in the facility as early as 10:30 a.m. that day. At 11:10 a.m., and at 1 p.m., staffers noticed Beaver pushing Bartow in her wheelchair throughout the building but failed to intervene.
The lawsuit accuses Crestview and Care Initiatives of gross negligence and recklessness in the form of inadequate staffing, false advertising, and “inappropriately allocating excessive funds to itself, thereby draining the facility of the resources necessary to maintain sufficient and appropriately trained staff to supervise residents and prevent avoidable injuries.”
The lawsuit also seeks unspecified actual damages and punitive damages for breach of contract and dependent adult abuse.
Crestview and Care Initiatives have denied any wrongdoing and attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed due to the arbitration agreement Bartow’s guardian signed at the time of her admission. That agreement stipulates that any disputes over care issues are to be settled through private arbitration rather than through courtroom litigation.
Attorneys for Bartow’s family argued the arbitration agreement was part of 50 pages of admissions documents that were electronically signed in quick succession, with the arbitration agreement signed only 40 seconds after the admission agreement.
They also claimed the arbitration agreement was barred in cases such as theirs by the 2021 federal law known as the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act. Care Initiatives argued otherwise, saying the family’s claims were “based on an alleged failure to secure the premises — not a sexual assault.”
In May, Cedar County District Court Judge Elizabeth O’Donnell rejected Care Initiatives’ argument and found that the lawsuit revolved around a claim of sexual assault that wasn’t subject to mandatory arbitration.
A trial is now scheduled for May 17, 2027.

Daricka Moore, 24, pleaded not guilty Monday to three counts of capital murder, three counts of first-degree murder and other charges in the Friday shootings, local TV stations reported. He has been held at the Clay County jail since the weekend and was denied bond. A judge also ordered a mental health evaluation.
Before the court hearing, family members identified the girl as Mikiylia Guines, who is Moore’s second cousin. He is also accused of killing three other family members. 
During a Saturday press conference, Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott said Moore tried to sexually assault someone at the address where the girl was killed, but did not specify who. One of the court affidavits lists Mikiylia as the victim of Moore’s attempted sexual assault. The sheriff was not immediately available for comment Monday. 
The capital murder charges are for the deaths of the 7-year-old, Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley. Barry Bradley was a pastor of Apostolic Church of The Lord Jesus in Cedarbluff, which is located near the home where the men died.
In addition to murder and attempted sexual battery charges, Moore is charged with attempted murder of a child, burglary and two counts of taking a motor vehicle.

A motive for the shootings was not immediately known. 
Lashanna Guines, the girl’s mother, told WTVA-TV she saw her child die in front of her and the girl’s siblings. She is left to wonder if she could have done more to help. 
“And that’s weighing heavy on my heart, because, you know, it may have been more, what if I did this, and what if I did that?” Guines said. “It would have been, you know, a better outcome, but I just don’t know. I tried. I tried.”
Community members have come together to support families of the shooting victims. 
The United Way of the Golden Triangle Region established a Family Assistance Fund, and there is a GoFundMe to help Guines, Mikiylia’s mother. As of Monday, over $10,000 had been raised.
“Let’s rally as a community of families to support them through the loss of her baby girl,” Rene Guines-McMillian, who organized the fundraiser, wrote on the GoFundMe page. Guines-McMillian was not immediately available for comment Monday.
Scott, the sheriff, previously said his department had not dealt with Moore or responded to calls at the locations where the six people were killed.
Over the weekend, District Attorney Scott Colom said his office will consider the death penalty.
Friday evening, Moore allegedly shot his father Glenn Moore, 67; uncle Willie Guines, 55; and his brother Quinten Moore, 33, in the head at a home on David Hill Road, according to law enforcement. It’s the same home that is listed as Moore’s home address in court records. 
Moore took a Ford F150 belonging to his brother and drove it to the second scene on Blake Road where he broke into the house and tried to sexually assault the 7-year-old, according to authorities. He shot the girl in the head and tried to kill another child, according to the sheriff. 
From there, Moore allegedly went to a home on Siloam-Griffith Road, where investigators found the truck he had taken hidden behind the house. There, they found the bodies of Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley, who also had been shot in the head, Scott said.  
Moore was arrested at a safety checkpoint about a half a mile from the second crime scene, Scott said.
This was the largest mass shooting in Mississippi since eight people were shot and killed in and near Brookhaven in 2017. Willie Godbolt, who was sentenced to death, shot his estranged wife and several of her family members and a Lincoln County sheriff’s deputy.

This story by Carla Occaso was first published in The Bridge on Jan. 11, 2026.
After a months-long process, the Montpelier City Council announced on Jan. 11 its choice of Kelly McNicholas Kury to be the next city manager of the city. McNicholas Kury, of Pitkin County, Colorado, is due to start Feb. 17. Meanwhile, Facilities and Sustainability Director Chris Lumbra is serving as acting city manager following the departure of former Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy, who filled the shoes of longtime City Manager Bill Fraser when he left this past summer.
McNicholas Kury emerged as one of the top candidates in December after a national recruitment process led by consultant Ian Coyle. The Montpelier City Council will formally approve her employment agreement on Wednesday, Jan. 14.
According to a press release issued Jan. 11, McNicholas Kury will lead a team of about 110 employees spread across nine departments. Appointed by the city council, the city manager is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the city, advising the city council on public policy, and ensuring that these policies are implemented professionally.
“Kelly McNicholas Kury brings a rare combination of strategic leadership, fiscal expertise, and deep commitment to community engagement,” said Montpelier Mayor Jack McCullough. “Her experience managing complex organizations and delivering results on critical issues such as housing, infrastructure, and economic resilience makes her exceptionally well-suited to lead Montpelier into its next chapter.”
A person with many years of experience in local government and public administration, McNicholas Kury brings expertise in strategic planning, fiscal stewardship, and community engagement, including 12 years in city and county government. Known for building trust-based relationships and translating public vision into measurable outcomes, she has played a central role in strengthening transparent, resilient, and forward-looking public institutions, the press release states.
“I am honored and excited to serve as Montpelier’s next city manager at such a pivotal time,” said McNicholas Kury. “I look forward to advancing the priorities of the council, staff, and community — including affordable housing, infrastructure, and economic vitality — so that together we can strengthen Montpelier now and into the future.”
Since joining Pitkin County, Colorado, in 2013, McNicholas Kury has steadily advanced into senior leadership roles and currently serves as county commissioner and chairwoman of the Board of County Commissioners.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Senate Republicans unveiled their property tax plan Monday as the 2026 session began, saying the state’s system for collecting these local taxes must be rebuilt in order to lower costs for taxpayers.
Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, and Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, held a news conference Monday to discuss Senate Study Bill 3001, Senate Republicans’ first legislative proposal of the year on how to change Iowa’s property tax system.
This proposal also involves changes to Iowa’s “rollback” system, similar to legislation brought up in 2025, alongside other changes Dawson said present ways to address the specific problems and concerns Iowans have brought up with the state’s property tax system.

“What we provide today in the Senate is a vision,” Dawson said. “And that vision is, that when valuation on your property — home — inflation goes up more than 2%, the rates automatically come down. It’s a vision that, permanently going forward, every homestead Iowan has a 50% taxable discount on their home. It’s a vision that we want good quality roads and bridges — we heard that loud and clear from our constituents over the interim. And finally, it’s a vision that ultimately, when you pay off your home at a certain age of life, you have to be able to own your home.”
Dawson chairs the Senate Ways and Means Committee, which deals with tax legislation. Last year he and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, his House counterpart who is now House majority leader, introduced legislation on Iowa’s property tax system. They proposed eliminating the state’s current system of calculating property taxes that limits taxation to a portion of a residential property’s value, known as “rollback,” in favor of a “revenue-restricted” system to limit levy rate growth. Though there were several versions of this proposal discussed, the measure failed to advance to a vote in either chamber.
Dawson said “what you see here is actually really continuation of last year,” with several components of the 103-page bill coming out of discussions in 2025 on how to effectively change the state’s property tax system.
As eliminating the rollback would mean property taxes are calculated based on the full value of a residential property, the bill contains measures to offset this cost. It increases Iowa’s homestead tax credit to 50% of a home’s taxable value and eliminates property taxes for older Iowa homeowners, in addition to setting limits on how much levy rates can increase each year.
Dawson said compared to the 2025 proposal, this year’s legislation will provide local governments new tools to address the expected loss of property tax revenues in their budgets. It allows city and county governments to seek voter approval to increase the local option sales tax, as well as adding an inflation index to the state’s gas tax. Additionally, Dawson said the proposal will separate taxing systems for residential property owned by a homeowner living with their family in a property versus residential real estate being rented to others.
“I mean, we’re trying to propose a new taxation viewpoint here in the state, either you own property that your family lives in, or you own property for income, and those should be two entirely different taxing type of situations, right?” Dawson said. “What we find right now is that, you know, a normal household out there could be paying the same percentage of property tax — their taxable value because of the rollback — as to what’s the big corporations do out there. And that doesn’t make sense.”
Other tax proposals are likely
Senate Republicans’ proposal is unlikely to be the only plan considered on property taxes this year. Gov. Kim Reynolds has named property taxes as her top priority for her last term leading the state executive branch, and legislative leaders spoke Monday about their commitment to working to find ways to lower these costs for Iowans.
The governor and lawmakers spent several months in 2025 holding meetings with local governments and community leaders to craft a policy. But Reynolds has said Iowans should understand reductions in property taxes will come with reductions in local government services — though she said she and other leaders are working to find areas where certain services can be streamlined or combined to more efficiently use taxpayer funds.
The governor is expected to discuss property taxes alongside her other legislative priorities in her Condition of the State address Tuesday.
In his opening remarks, House Speaker Pat Grassley said the property tax discussions from last year will help shape the measures moved forward in 2026.
“Last session, we made good progress and got great feedback from Iowans and stakeholders on this issue,” Grassley said. “But rather than rush just to say we got something done, we decided to return to the table this session. For too long, certainty for the taxing entities has taken priority over certainty for the taxpayers. It’s time to put the taxpayers first once again.”
Iowa House Democrats also introduced a plan to lower property taxes last week. Their proposal would freeze property taxes for people age 65 and older, triple the Homestead Tax Credit, limit annual property tax growth to 4% and provide state funding for public safety workers’ retirement funds.
House Minority Leader Brian Meyer said in his opening remarks the caucus proposal on property taxes was part of House Democrats’ larger agenda to make life in Iowa more affordable.
Meyer said Democrats’ plan to reduce property taxes is “paid for by cutting wasteful state spending.” He also said lawmakers must address other spending and budget issues in 2026 to avoid a deficit. In 2025, the Legislature approved a budget above the state’s expected revenue for the fiscal year, drawing at least $917 million from the state reserve funds, budget surplus and the Taxpayer Relief Fund.
Some Republicans are looking for tax relief beyond property taxes. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, said Monday in the committee’s first meeting that he is hoping to mirror some federal tax cuts enacted last year in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He specifically cited the federal actions eliminating income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security.
“So … hopefully we will be following suit with (the) federal government on that, giving some of the hardworking Iowans their money back, those that had to work overtime to make things work, or those that had to waitress … in a diner or a place of food service. It’s just nice to be able to give some of that money back to the people of Iowa,” Kraayenbrink said.
While property taxes are a top priority for legislative leaders, the breadth of tax policy discussed at the Iowa Capitol may be more limited in 2026 compared to other years. As the Senate Appropriations Committee met Monday, Dawson said he intended to complete the panel’s work in just five more meetings after Monday in the interest of keeping members’ work “focused and with a purpose.”
“I’m going to try to make the commitment right now, see if I can keep it, setting aside this meeting, we’re going to lay the gauntlet down: Five meetings,” he said. “So we’re gonna see if we can get our work done in five meetings this year. They might all occur on the last week, but that’s what we’re gonna try to do.”

Officials, educators and service providers from two of the districts — New Haven and Waterbury — joined U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, at Fair Haven School Monday to call attention to the cuts and voice sharp criticism of the Trump Administration and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The third district to lose funds, Hartford, was mentioned in remarks but did not have a speaker present.
The canceled grants were awarded under the Full-Service Community Schools program, which funds partnerships between schools and community organizations to expand resources to families. This can include providing literacy support, mental healthcare, after-school activities, food access and other wraparound services.
DeLauro led a successful push to increase FSCS funding 10-fold to $150 million when she was chair of the House Appropriations Committee during the Biden administration.
Each of the three Connecticut districts had won grants and were already running FSCS programming when they learned the Department of Education would be halting further payments. According to DeLauro’s office, New Haven and Waterbury each had $1.5 million remaining in their grants, while Hartford had $1.3 million remaining.
Nationally, a total of 19 FSCS programs saw their funding terminated on Dec. 12, with just one winning it back in an appeal to the department. The grants were expected to run through 2028.
Clifford Beers Community Care Center coordinated New Haven’s FSCS program. Its executive director, Ilaria Filippi, said the program directly served 310 children and 41 families at Fair Haven School and the Family Academy of Multilingual Exploration over 18 months — an effort she said brought together more than 20 organizations. According to state data, over 75% of New Haven Public Schools students qualify for free or reduced lunch — a common metric for assessing student need — compared to roughly 45% statewide.
In a letter to the New Haven program last month, Education Assistant Secretary Kirsten Baesler wrote that the applicant had “proposed project activities that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education. Specifically, ‘To advance racial equity and in reflection of the clients served, they will approach this project from the perspective of systemic racism and consistently ask themselves if they are missing data from hard-to-reach families or those at the highest tier of trauma.’” 
The letter also highlighted a passage on professional development that referenced “trauma-informed care, anti-racist practices, equity practices, community organizing, project management, systems thinking, and self-care.”
Filippi was critical of the administration’s reasoning. “This program did not end because it failed. It did not end because outcomes were poor. It did not end because it was ineffective,” Filippi said. “At no point did the department claim that the program wasn’t working. Because it was working.”
Filippi confirmed that the majority of the services offered through the New Haven program have ended.
“With seven working days’ notice, just before winter break, we were forced to dismantle a fully operational program mid-year. The disruption fractured relationships, interrupted care and removed critical support from students, families and educators,” Filippi said.
Rep. DeLauro described the grant cancellations as “a deliberate attempt to sabotage the education of our children.”
“There is not a doubt that this will raise the cost of living for families, many of whom are already living paycheck to paycheck,” DeLauro said.
The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment.
New Haven Public Schools superintendent Madeline Negrón said the district is looking into whether it can redirect recently-awarded state funds for after-school programs to continuing the FSCS after-school program.
Althea Brooks, executive director of the Waterbury BTS Community Partnership, said services for students and families in Waterbury will continue for now thanks to other funding sources.
“We are also pursuing opportunities at the state level with the governor’s fund that he, with wisdom, put aside for these attacks,” Brooks said. She added that Waterbury’s board of education has also allocated money to the program.
Hartford Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment on how the loss of funding will affect its programming.
New Haven Federation of Teachers president Leslie Blatteau criticized “billionaire” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon for treating public schools “as if they belong to her.”
“The data shows that for every dollar spent on community schools, there is a $7 return on investment,” Blatteau said. “At a time when students and working families need more support — at a time when we want to continue to make improvements to student achievement, student attendance and mental health — we learned that the programs designed to provide that support are illegally terminated at the eleventh hour.”
Blatteau also called on Gov. Ned Lamont to release $4 million dollars from the state’s surplus to make up the lost federal funding. 
Rob Blanchard, spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the state is “reviewing whether or not the cut to this federal education program meets the statutory guidelines for tapping into the recently created Emergency State Response Reserve.”
The American Federation of Teachers, a union representing public school teachers across the country, has sued the Trump administration to challenge the cancellations. The attorneys general of Maryland, North Carolina and the District of Columbia have also filed a separate suit. 
A spokesperson for the Connecticut Attorney General expressed hope that any relief from those lawsuits would also be provided to grantees in Connecticut but declined to comment on this state’s legal strategy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0112_SR_FSCSEducation_134-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-12 17:59:12.838403

Photo courtesy of the candidate Former Macon-Bibb commissioner Seth Clark on Monday became the latest Democrat to enter the race for lieutenant governor.
In an interview, Clark positioned himself as an alternative to the “career state Capitol folks (who) could learn a thing or two from local government,” saying that he is entering the race as a voice for middle Georgia in the state Democratic party. He said he believes having a candidate with geographical diversity will help Democrats in Georgia prevail in November.
“The Georgia Democratic coalition is much bigger than the 10 square miles of Atlanta, Georgia … and the divide between these two Georgias you hear all the time is better served by a Democratic coalition that looks like and is geographically from the state that produced it,” Clark said.
Clark, who stepped down from the commission in early January, said he is entering the race for lieutenant governor now because policies at both the state and federal levels are hurting families financially. As he waited for someone to enter the lieutenant governor’s race who he felt “could step up and speak to the needs” of Georgians, Clark said, he realized that he wanted to run.
“What matters is that these offices have people in them every day that wake up with the interests of their neighbors at heart, and the lieutenant governor’s office does not have that right now, and that office could use the refreshing results that we have seen in local government,” Clark said.
State Sen. Josh McLaurin, a Sandy Springs Democrat who is serving his fourth term in the Georgia Legislature, was the first Democrat to announce in May.
McLaurin welcomed the “late-entering” candidate in a press release Monday, saying that he looks forward to contrasting their records. 
“When we need to get hard things done in a partisan arena, Democrats in the state legislature turn to me to deliver,” McLaurin said. “This is not a moment when Democratic voters can or should settle for anything less than a proven fighter.” 
Those interested in being on the ballot this fall have until March to decide whether to run. The primary will be held in May, and the winner will go on to face the Republican nominee.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — The South Dakota coalition that successfully pushed for a state ban on eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines last winter will propose broader limits on eminent domain and more protections for landowners this legislative session.
Sen. Mark Lapka, R-Leola, announced the efforts. One would send a proposed state constitutional amendment to voters in November that would further restrict eminent domain.
“Codified law is too easily amendable over time,” Lapka said. “It’s the constitutionally protected rights that hold firm forever.”
The amendment would “eliminate eminent domain for private gain,” Lapka said, while allowing for public works projects such as public highways, water lines and other infrastructure.
South Dakota governor signs eminent domain ban on carbon pipelines

Eminent domain is a legal process for gaining access to privately owned land when a deal can’t be reached with landowners. It’s often used for public infrastructure projects. It became controversial in South Dakota when Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions attempted to use it for a five-state pipeline that would capture carbon dioxide from ethanol plants and transport it to an underground sequestration site in North Dakota. The project would benefit from federal tax credits incentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.
Landowner opposition to the Summit project in South Dakota culminated in the Legislature’s passage of a law last year banning carbon pipelines from using eminent domain. Summit is still pursuing the project and has permits in other states, but has been denied permits twice by South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission.
Lapka announced his new proposals at a property rights rally Monday in the state Capitol rotunda, attended by dozens of South Dakota farmers, ranchers and lawmakers.
Along with the constitutional amendment, Lapka announced what he’s calling the “Bossly Bill,” named for Jared Bossly, of rural Aberdeen, who is suing Summit Carbon Solutions for allegedly trespassing on his land while it was asserting its right to use eminent domain.
Lapka said the bill will mirror language in a decision by the South Dakota Supreme Court in 2024. The decision said Summit had not proven it was a common carrier. That meant the company could not use eminent domain to access landowners’ property.
Lapka’s bill would “clean up” the language that exists in state law, he said, and protect against “invasive tactics.”
There was a bill introduced last legislative session that would have empowered citizens to sue for allegedly deceptive practices, fraud, harassment, intimidation or misrepresentation during the acquisition of land access agreements by carbon pipeline land agents. The bill narrowly failed in the Senate after passing the House.
The text of the bills announced by Lapka had not been released as of Monday afternoon. The 2026 session of the South Dakota Legislature begins Tuesday and continues through March.

Shipley said the state has done an “awful lot” to address conservation issues that are “not unique to Iowa.” 
“But we can do better,” Shipley said. 
He said “something is being done right” because he can look out at the landscape and see birds and animals that he wasn’t able to see 20 years ago. 
Water quality has been noted as a key priority heading into the session from lawmakers and environmental groups, especially following a wet summer where nitrate concentrations in Iowa rivers reached near record highs. 
The levels were so high in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers that Central Iowa Water Works had to issue its first ever lawn watering ban in the region to manage demand and keep finished drinking water levels below the federal limits. Levels in the rivers have remained high through the winter, however, and the utility had to turn on its nitrate removal system, according to reporting from KCCI, in January to remain compliant. 
Sen. Art Staed of Cedar Rapids, ranking Democrat on the committee, said it was “long past time” to act on water quality issues that impact Iowan’s health. Staed pointed to the high nitrate concentrations in Iowa rivers and noted that Iowa is also one of two states with a rising cancer rate. Some studies and public health professionals indicate a potential link between nitrate concentrations and certain cancers. 
“Our water crisis has reached a breaking point,” Staed said. “…Protecting clean water must be a shared priority and meaningful solutions require cooperation across party lines – I hope that begins here.” 
Sweeney highlighted a number of programs like the federal Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, and the state’s Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, that she has been part of or used on her farm to make improvements. 
“I believe that we need to make sure that we build upon what we have established; keep the conversations open for more improvement in our water quality,” Sweeney said.

With lawmakers planning major changes to the state’s education finance system this year, here’s what you need to know.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How Vermont pays for schools — and how it might change.","Members of the House Ways and Means Committee listen to testimony on education finance during a remote joint meeting with other House and Senate committees at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Jan. 25, 2024.

Vermont’s education funding system is notoriously complicated and totally unique.
Following years of rising property taxes — and a watershed 2024 election animated, in part, by a debate over how the state pays for its schools — lawmakers entered the 2025 legislative session poised to consider major changes. 
And while the Legislature began to transform how public school is paid for in 2025, the debate is slated to continue in 2026. 
To understand where we’re going, it’s important to understand where we’ve been. Here’s how the system has worked in recent years.
Vermont pays for education on a statewide basis, meaning property taxes from across the state are pooled and then redistributed. As a result of the state’s complex funding system, budget decisions in individual communities impact tax rates across the state.
School district budgets are built by local school boards in consultation with district officials and voted on at the local level, often on Town Meeting Day in March. What voters approve is what the state will fund, and property tax rates are set at a per-$100 of property value rate to pay for it. 
Roughly two-thirds of the entire state’s education budget is paid for with property taxes. The remainder is covered through the sales tax and portions of other taxes — such as rooms, meals, purchase and use — as well as state lottery proceeds and federal and state Medicaid money. 
Every year, the Legislature passes the “yield bill,” which helps set homestead, non-homestead, and income-sensitized property tax rates in order to fund the voter-approved budgets in each school district. 
Homestead property refers to primary residences. Non-homestead property includes everything else, from second homes and apartments to businesses and camps. The annual non-homestead tax rate is uniform statewide. Homestead property tax rates, however, are impacted by local school spending decisions. 
A resident’s homestead property tax rates go up and down based on how the school district’s per-pupil spending compares to a state average. Per-pupil spending is a technical term that, in short, refers to the amount of money spent by a school district divided by the number of students in the district. 
But not every student is counted equally. Like other states, Vermont uses student weights to adjust for those who are more expensive to teach, including English learners and economically disadvantaged students. Those students are weighted as more than one student in the calculation. 
A majority of homestead property tax payers receive some discount based on their income. These taxpayers are sometimes referred to as “income-sensitized,” and Vermont uses a property tax credit system to support income-sensitized taxpayers. 
Yet another layer of complexity is added when the so-called common level of appraisal, set annually for each town by the state Department of Taxes, is added to the equation. 
Historically, the common level of appraisal, expressed as a percentage, reflects the difference between a town’s appraised property values and what the department considers to be fair market value. For example, if the property in a town is found to be appraised on average at 85% of market value, the common level of appraisal would be 85%.
To come up with a property owner’s education property tax rate, the base rate — set by the Legislature only for non-homestead property, adjusted by school district per-pupil spending for homestead property — is divided by a town’s common level of appraisal. This can lead to towns within the same school district having very different property tax rates.
Since July 2025, the common level of appraisal has worked slightly differently, though the formula is not any less complex. The percentage reflects the difference between a town’s appraised property values and the statewide average appraised value as both compare to fair market value. For example, if statewide property values are at 95% of fair market value, the new appraisal level of the town above would be 85% divided by 95%, or 89%.
Much of how Vermont pays for education could change because of the passage in 2025 of Act 73. The new law envisions a major departure from Vermont’s current system by shifting budget decisions away from school districts and their communities and to the state via a foundation formula.
Used by most states in the country, a foundation formula would provide each school district with a set amount of money based on the number of students enrolled, with additional weights to account for the increased costs of educating certain students, such as English learners and students with disabilities.
School districts’ governing boards could still set their budgets and choose how to spend that money but would have to operate within the confines of the set amount the formula allocates.
Districts would be able to choose to spend more than what the formula provides by raising funds from local property taxpayers with voter approval. But that spending, called supplemental spending, would be capped at 10% of a district’s budget. That cap would be ratcheted down every year until the cap hits 5%.
However, the new formula is dependent on lawmakers first agreeing to a new map of consolidated school districts this legislative session. The formula would then be phased in over a five-year period and would not go into effect until 2028.

The city’s motion to dismiss argues that the state statute cited applies only to boards of civil authority and claims the Board for Registration of Voters is not one.

A civil lawsuit claims Burlington is flouting state law by avoiding appointing more Republicans to a board responsible for maintaining the voter registration list and ensuring fair elections. The city has filed a motion to dismiss.
Filed Nov. 25 in Vermont Superior Court by two residents, the lawsuit alleges the city “has refused to permit Republicans their statutory-required, minimum representation” on the Board for Registration of Voters.
The city filed a motion to dismiss on Jan. 3, claiming that the state law governing civil authority boards does not apply to this board.
The Vermont statute pertaining to elections ensures fair representation by mandating that boards of civil authority contain at least three members of each major political party. The city charter does not mandate a minimum but sets a maximum of six members of the same political party for its board of registration of voters.
The 12-member board in Burlington currently comprises five Democrats, four Progressives, two Independents and one Republican.
When prior inadequate Republican representation on the board was pointed out by the chairman of the Vermont Republican Party in 2021, the City Council followed the city attorney’s advice and appointed two Republicans to the board, the lawsuit notes.
Communications shared in the lawsuit indicate that city officials and Article 16 of the city charter discussed the issue pertaining to the Board of Civil Authority, as it was called at the time. 
Justin St. James, then assistant city attorney, advised the City Council president “to fill both the vacant position and a new, temporary 13th position with Republican applicants,” whose terms would end June 30, 2022, at which point the board would revert to 12 members.
“I am seeking both to inform you of the issue and the likelihood of litigation if we do not comply, as well as to see conceptually how you feel,” St. James wrote in an Aug. 20, 2021 email.
Max Tracy, former council president, thanked him for the explanation and wrote he was “in support of appointing the two additional Republicans to ensure that we are in compliance.”
When a similar situation occurred last year and appellants William Oetjen and Jeffrey Comstock brought the matter to the council, they got a different response, said Brady Toensing, one of the lawyers representing the two Republican residents.
Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak and the City Council were asked to fix the balance of membership on the board “meant to ensure not only fair and properly functioning elections, but also public confidence in the legitimacy of Vermont elections,” but did not comply, Toensing wrote in an email. 
Documents filed in court indicate that Oetjen, the chair of the Burlington Republican Party, submitted his and Comstock’s application in his Sept. 10 request for appointment to the board; three other Republican residents also joined the request.
The lawsuit states that the City Council met in executive session on Nov. 3 and decided not to appoint any additional members to the board and informed the applicants accordingly. 
The plaintiffs said they are qualified and allege the city “has wrongfully refused” to appoint them to the Board for Registration of Voters.
The city’s elected leaders “have chosen to violate their oaths of office by flouting this election integrity law and forced concerned citizens into costly litigation to make them obey the law,” Toensing said.
The city’s recent motion to dismiss argues that the state statute cited applies only to boards of civil authority and claims that the Board for Registration of Voters is not one.
To conclude that it is “would illogically result in a requirement that any of several City boards, commissions, committees, or councils would be required to expand its membership if it did not include at least three representatives from each major political party,” city attorney Jessica Brown wrote in an email.
The city board had three Republican members in March 2024; one resigned in April 2024 and a second left in June 2025. No Republican residents applied to fill those vacancies during the open application process, according to Brown.
The lawsuit states that in August 2025, one of the two Republican members on the board
resigned and was replaced with a Democrat, and that “no effort was made to recruit a Republican to fill this seat.”
While Burlington claims it does not have a civil authority board, the city’s own description states that the Board for Registration of Voters is responsible for ensuring accurate voter lists and responding to voter registration issues on Election Day. 
“Therefore, the Board for Registration of Voters, which performs the same relevant functions as the Board of Civil Authority, must abide by the law that requires a minimum number of major political party members,” the lawsuit states.
In its motion to dismiss, the city agrees the Board for Registration of Voters is responsible for the maintenance of the voter list, which in a typical municipality is a function of the Board of Civil Authority, but states the two boards are “quite different.”
“Burlington is unique among Vermont municipalities in that no single official or body functions as its board of civil authority for all purposes,” the motion states.
“It has a unique structure, role, and composition. Its membership is chosen in an entirely different manner from a town board of civil authority. And it is subject to its own rule to ensure diverse party representation,” Assistant City Attorney Erik Ramakrishnan wrote in the motion to dismiss.
Brown further clarified that ward officers have managed the polls on election day in Burlington at least since the adoption of the current 1949 City Charter. General election planning decisions have since been the responsibility of the City Council and mayor.
Toensing claims this is “a silly argument to try to mask the city’s misconduct.”
“Section 43 of the municipal charter establishes a Board of Civil Authority, but then delegates all election-related duties of that board to what it calls the Board for Registration of Voters,” he said. “If it walks, looks, and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”
“Vermont voters would be justified in asking why the Secretary of State, whose office’s primary mission is to promote public trust in elections, has chosen to remain silent instead of defending this election integrity law,” he added.
The city conferred with the Secretary of State’s Office before litigation was filed, said Brown, and received no further comments or questions.
A spokesperson from the Secretary of State’s Office said the “complicated wrinkle” is that Burlington has its own charter and the dispute would have to be resolved in court.
“The short answer is, we don’t have enforcement authority or run local elections,” said Sean Sheehan, director of elections.

Solar and batteries keep getting cheaper, while the cost to supply and deliver gas is only rising.","WINTER IS HERE, and if it is anything like the past few, families across Massachusetts will open painfully high energy bills. Cold weather rate hikes arrive on top of electricity costs that are already among the highest in the nation. In the past five years, the Commonwealth’s residential power prices have risen by more than 30 percent, and they are only expected to increase.  
As Beacon Hill looks to tackle this problem, state leaders should pass an energy affordability package that delivers long-term relief by limiting our dependence on costly fossil gas. To protect ratepayers, we need to double down on transitioning to stable, affordable, and locally generated clean energy, like solar.  
Why are our state’s electricity bills so high? Massachusetts over-relies on imported gas to generate power. The price of gas is not just expensive (and getting more so), but volatile, making our rates vulnerable to spikes from extreme weather, international conflict, and market dynamics. If ratepayers continue to foot the bill for new gas infrastructure, we will be locking ourselves into a worsening affordability crisis and lose control of our energy future for decades. 
Breaking this cycle requires unleashing local solar and storage so we can generate affordable electricity right here in Massachusetts. Solar and batteries keep getting cheaper, while the cost to supply and deliver gas is only rising. Distributed energy resources can come online rapidly, provide direct bill savings to families and businesses, and benefit all ratepayers by reducing the need for expensive peak power purchases and costly new grid infrastructure.  
Repeatedly, we’ve seen how local solar saves everyone money on their electric bills. During the heatwave this past June, distributed solar saved consumers at least $8.2 million in a single day and prevented what would have been record-breaking stress on our grid. From 2014 to 2019, small-scale solar generated over $1 billion in savings for New England customers. These savings were enjoyed not only by people with systems on their rooftops, but by all ratepayers. 
Massachusetts has historically been a leader on solar, but the pace of deployment has lagged in recent years. Although we have tens of gigawatts of untapped potential, our state ranks 26th nationally for new installations, and growth in key segments like community solar has slowed sharply since 2021. Federal rollbacks of tax credits for clean energy will further hamper our progress unless state policymakers act.  
First, our representatives should fix the overly burdensome local government and utility approval processes that add months of delay and thousands of dollars to even the simplest solar and battery projects.  
Ask any contractor what drives up the cost of home solar installations and they’ll tell you the same thing: time and complexity. In communities across the Commonwealth, cookie-cutter residential projects that should be installed quickly and easily are hindered by antiquated and bespoke bureaucratic requirements like paper forms and in-person appointments, long wait times, and multiple inspections. This maze of barriers and delays drives up the sticker price of home solar by at least $1/watt, and leads many families to give up on going solar during the approval process.  
Convoluted and outdated permitting, inspection, and interconnection do not enhance safety or quality, and streamlining them would deliver real benefits for consumers. For example, by adopting “smart permitting,” where the code compliance checks for home solar and batteries are done instantly and online, Massachusetts could reduce the cost of the standard system by $2,400 by 2030 and deliver nearly 120,000 additional installs  by 2040.   
Smart permitting technology was developed by the Department of Energy and National Renewable Energy Laboratory in partnership with leading building safety organizations and has an impeccable track record. More than 300 communities around the country have adopted it, representing roughly a third of the national solar market.  
Second, policymakers should scale virtual power plants–networks that deliver power back to the grid by aggregating it from rooftop solar panels, home batteries, and other distributed energy devices. 
States across the country are embracing VPPs to manage demand and reduce costs without building pricey new infrastructure. Massachusetts’s own ConnectedSolutions, which has delivered over $8 million in annual net benefits for households, is a good start and should be expanded upon to help more families save.  
Third, state leaders should change how our utilities get paid to better align with consumer interests.  Current regulatory structures provide financial incentives for utilities to prioritize expensive capital investments –like constructing new power lines and substations–to meet our energy needs. These costs are directly passed down to ratepayers.  
While we will certainly need to continue to make smart infrastructure improvements, we also need to redesign this incentive structure and instead pay utilities for their performance on cutting costs, increasing system efficiency, and delivering cheap, clean power. We know that this works. For instance, in Illinois, a performance based regulatory scheme has translated into a more than 70 percent improvement in reliability, nearly 21.7 million avoided customer outages, and over $3.8 billion in avoided outage costs.  
Massachusetts families deserve a power system that relies less on ever-more expensive gas, prioritizes efficiency, and clears the pathway to bring more cost-effective renewable energy online. By fixing the approval process for solar and batteries, scaling virtual power plants, and better aligning utility incentives with the public interest, lawmakers can deliver real, durable affordability.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-12 21:58:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,Jackson plastic surgeon Dr. Adair Blackledge surrenders medical license,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/12/plastic-surgeon-surrenders-license/,The facade of the building that housed Blackledge Face Center is pictured on Jan. 11.,"Dr. Adair Blackledge, a physician who practiced facial plastic surgery in the Jackson area for 22 years and was the subject of a five-month Mississippi Today investigation in September, surrendered his state medical license Dec. 31, according to an order accepting the surrender published by the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure. 
Blackledge was under investigation by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure — the state agency that licenses and regulates physicians — for allegations of professional incompetency, unprofessional conduct and dishonorable or unethical behavior likely to deceive, defraud or harm the public, the order says. Board minutes show that the board approved an investigative subpoena for the case in March. 
Blackledge, of office-based facial plastic surgery practice Blackledge Face Center, denied wrongdoing and surrendered his license to retire from medicine and resolve the board’s investigation, the order writes. The signage for Blackledge Face Center had been removed from the building’s facade as of Sunday.
Blackledge did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment by publication time Monday. Board of Medical Licensure spokesperson Cara Shirley declined to answer questions about the surrender, writing in an email that “the Board does not comment on matters related to Board business.” 
Mississippi Today’s reporting showed that Blackledge performed facelifts about three times more quickly than what other plastic surgeons considered average. He also employed some practices other doctors said were uncommon, such as instructing patients to remove their staples themselves after surgery and performing post-operative visits at hotel rooms for patients who traveled to Mississippi for surgery. 
Blackledge said in July he used a sleeping pill and a sedative, anti-anxiety medication to sedate most patients before surgery, a drug combination other doctors told Mississippi Today could make it difficult for patients to breathe during surgery. Blackledge also said he was trained using the regimen and has never had an adverse event related to anesthesia administration.
He also said there is no way to compare the amount of time a facelift takes to another because each one involves different techniques and areas of the face.
Mississippi Today’s investigation also showed Blackledge was not board certified in any specialty medical field, a credential that is not required to practice plastic surgery in Mississippi. Some experts, however, say certification improves patient safety by demonstrating that a doctor has trained extensively in a field and is capable of performing certain procedures.

Patients interviewed by Mississippi Today last year described a range of complications, including nasal indentations and infections, prominent scarring, a cheek implant that burst through the skin and wounds that reopened and required medical attention. They recounted quick procedures, results that didn’t last and repeated revisions, or procedures to correct or improve past surgeries.
It is uncommon for a physician to surrender a medical license, and it is not typical for a doctor to surrender a license upon retirement, said Dr. Randy Easterling, a Vicksburg physician who previously served on the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure for 12 years. Easterling said he does not have knowledge of Blackledge’s case and cannot speak on behalf of the medical board. He also could not speak specifically about Blackledge’s license.
“Usually a surrender of license — generally speaking — is when there’s so much evidence against the physician that you don’t want to have a hearing,” he said. “Because if you go to a hearing, there will be stuff to come out that maybe you don’t want the public to know.” 
If an investigation is concluded without the initiation of disciplinary action, all records of the investigation and proceedings remain confidential, according to Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure policy. 
Blackedge’s surrender of his medical license will be reported to the Health Resources and Services Administration’s National Practitioner Data Bank, a registry used to collect and share disciplinary information about medical providers across state lines. 
“Generally speaking, you would have difficulty getting a license in any other state,” Easterling said. 
However, physicians whose licenses have been surrendered in Mississippi can reapply for licensure, beginning the process as if they have never held one before, according to Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure policy.

Blackledge’s former patients have greeted news of his departure from the field with mixed reactions. Vicky Pitts of Laurel underwent a necklift with Blackledge in 2020, followed by a series of revisions and touch-up surgeries that occurred for more than two years after she said the initial surgery failed. Pitts said the subsequent procedures resulted in complications. 
She said Friday she feels relieved that other patients may be spared similar experiences, but does not believe the outcome will bring her closure.
“It still does not heal some of the people he has really hurt in the long run, with the stress, the depression, the embarrassment,” she said. “… When I look in the mirror, I just want to cry.”
Scores of people who say they were patients of Blackledge have shared stories and photographs of their surgery experiences in a members-only Facebook group created by patients in 2023. 
Blackledge told Mississippi Today in emails from July to September that the complaints made by patients about his practice represented a small portion of his patient population and said he believes his complication rate is far below the national average. He said the complaints were the result of a “social media barrage” in which he, his family and his staff members were attacked and threatened by patients. 
“The past year has been an extremely frustrating one for me, and I really feel like I am being painted in a false light by patients who had apparently unreasonable expectations of the results that could be achieved,” he said to Mississippi Today in July.
Blackledge told Mississippi Today for months last year that he could not locate a transfer agreement he said he had with St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson. The agreement is a state requirement for surgeons who sedate patients in their offices, and is widely considered a critical patient safety measure for office-based surgery. 
Blackledge provided a written transfer agreement with St. Dominic to Mississippi Today the day before it published its article, signed that day, after Mississippi Today inquired about it for the third time in three months.
There was no indication Monday on the Blackledge Face Center website or social media pages that the business has closed. Appointments for aestheticians are listed as available beginning Jan. 19. Plastic surgery services are not listed.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12105123/829A0937.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 16:58:52.035395
