Snowpack in the Upper Colorado River Basin, which provides streamflow for the two largest reservoirs in the United States — Lake Mead and Lake Powell  — has underperformed this winter, reinforcing long-term drought challenges facing the west.
Snowpack is a crucial source of water for Nevada and the West. As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland.
Despite two consecutive decent water years, both reservoirs could see gains reversed, according to the monthly Nevada Water Supply Outlook Report from the Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“Southern Nevada should expect a lean water year with less than normal streamflow predicted for the Virgin River and the Colorado River inflow to Lake Powell,” reads the report.
According to the report, the Upper Colorado Basin’s snowpack only reached 89% of the historical median this April, which is considered the month when the snowpack reaches its highest snow water total before melt begins.
That could spell trouble for water levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell which are already suffering deficits due to drought impacts and high water demands. 
Water officials estimate that streamflow for Lake Powell will be at about 74% of the historical median, according to the report. Lake Powell’s water levels directly affect Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead as of March is down 691,000 acre-feet compared to the same time last year, or enough water to supply 1.3 million households. Both reservoirs combined are at 33% of capacity as of April.
Snowpack in Southern Nevada’s Spring Mountains has also underperformed this winter, hitting only 30% of its historical median. Snow melt from Spring Mountains is the largest source of groundwater for Southern Nevada and provides some limited water to Lake Mead. 
However, Spring Mountains did receive much needed rain in March, hitting about 229% of the historical median as of March. 
Despite deficits in Southern Nevada, other parts of the state are looking at a more robust water year. Snowpack in the Eastern Sierra is about normal at 105% of median, compared to 134% at this time last year.
Snowpack in several basins that supply water for the Reno-Sparks area — including the Walker River, Carson River, Truckee River and Lake Tahoe basins — are at about normal as of April. Combined all four basins hit nearly 98% of their historical median. 
Snowpack is well above normal in other parts of Northern Nevada, especially in regions along the Oregon-Nevada border. 
That snowmelt will also help bolster already healthy reservoirs in northern Nevada. Most reservoirs in northern Nevada were near normal to well above normal storage as of March, according to the report.
Snowpack in the Humboldt, Owyhee, Snake, Clover-Franklin basins — largely located in Elko County — reached well above normal snowpack at 122% to 151%.
The Humboldt Basin has now seen three consecutive winters with snow water peak amounts above normal. There hasn’t been a three-year period with better consecutive snowpacks in the Humboldt Basin since the mid-1980s. The Humboldt Basin is a major course of water for Humboldt, Elko, Lander, and Eureka counties 
Snowpack in the Northern Great Basin, located largely in Humboldt County, also reached well above normal at 151% median as of early March. Precipitation in March in the Northern Great Basin was also about normal at 96%.
Snowpack in Eastern Nevada — which covers the majority of White Pine County and part of Eureka County — improved dramatically from 55% in early March to 86% by early April.
While March significantly improved snowpack in Eastern Nevada, snowpack in the region is still below the historical median, hitting 86% of median. Snowpack in the region was also not distributed evenly. 
“Eastern Nevada is a mixed bag with better mountain snowpack conditions near Austin, Eureka and Ely, but well below normal snow in Great Basin National Park,” read the report. “It should be noted that snow percentages in Eastern Nevada vary widely from site to site ranging from twice normal to less than 50%.”
Above normal rain also helped improve conditions in Eastern Nevada, reaching well above normal at 182% in March, 
Above normal precipitation in March also reduced drought severity on the US Drought Monitor Map in Elko, Churchill, Lander and Eureka counties over the last month. But areas of extreme and exceptional drought in southern Nevada remain unchanged from last month.
Dry conditions in Southern Nevada followed a pattern of drought throughout the Southwest this winter, according to the latest National Water and Climate Center report from the Natural Resources Conservation Service.
The Southwest experienced a snow drought and precipitation deficit this season, with well-below normal streamflow from snow melt expected for the spring and summer period, according to the National Water and Climate Center report.
Above-normal springtime temperatures are also causing a rapid melting of high-elevation snowpacks across the entire West, which could impact streamflow as snow melts before it’s most needed in the summer.
In Nevada, snowmelt started early due to a week of warm temperatures in late March. Daily average air temperature at snow monitoring sites across Nevada peaked at 48 degrees Fahrenheit on March 26th, very close to a record for that date.
Those conditions are expected to continue in Nevada in the long term. The National Weather Service predicts there is a 40 to 50% chance most of Nevada will see above average temperature from April through June, according to the National Water and Climate Center report. Climate scientists predict Nevada will also see below average precipitation during that same period.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-13-25-at-3.25-PM-e1744583200719-1024x735.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 16:09:44.176792

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A sea of red descended upon the Indiana Statehouse Monday as hundreds of teachers, parents and students from across the state rallied to demand increased funding for public schools — and to protest pending policy proposals that could shift millions of local dollars to charters.
The rally — one of many hosted in recent years by the Indiana State Teachers Association, the state’s largest teachers union — came just hours ahead of a possible final vote on a massive property tax plan. The latest provisions baked into the legislation could reduce public schools’ tax dollars by as much as $744 million over the next three years.
ISTA President Keith Gambill said that blow comes in addition to education funding gaps in the newest draft of the state budget.
“The overall funding increase of 2% per year — of $870 million — does not even meet inflation,” Gambill said. “Our students deserve bold investment, not the bare minimum.”

He said teachers will be pressing lawmakers in the coming days and weeks “to ensure that public dollars are staying with public schools.”
ISTA organizers demand action
The legislative session must end by April 29 but could be finished as early as April 24. All bills — including the state budget — must be finalized by that time.
“Our schools deserve to be fully funded — and fully public — so all kids receive a quality education,” Gambill emphasized.
Teacher attendance at the rally forced at least three Hoosier school districts to move to an e-learning day, including Indianapolis Public Schools and nearby Pike Township, as well as Monroe County Community Schools in Bloomington.










Our schools deserve to be fully funded — and fully public — so all kids receive a quality education.


– Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill


The shift to e-learning appeared to prompt a legislative amendment published Monday morning by Indianapolis Republican Rep. Andrew Ireland.
Proposed language filed to Senate Bill 373, an unrelated education bill, sought to jeopardize funding for public school districts that convert scheduled in-person instructional days to virtual because of “planned or coordinated absence of teachers or other personnel for the purpose of participating in a protest, demonstration, or political advocacy event.”
Districts would risk losing state tuition support for each day of a violation, according to Ireland’s amendment.
Gambill read the amendment aloud during the rally, drawing shouting and boos from the crowd.
“We have got to talk to our legislators today, tomorrow and every day between now and the end of the session. We must be vigilant,” he said. “We have to speak from the heart, and remind them that behind every policy is a classroom with a teacher and students.”
Ireland introduced the amendment Monday afternoon to make a statement, but withdrew it without discussion or a vote.
Rallygoers demand action
Chants echoed throughout the Statehouse halls for more than two hours Monday morning.
“Schools need funding!”
“Pay our teachers!”
“Defend public education!”
Rallygoers, many dressed in red t-shirts, had homemade signs in tow, too. Banners, poster boards, paper placards — and even painted messages on the backs of LaCroix boxes — were raised by attendees amid chanting, cheering and frustrated yells.

Everyone’s goal was the same: demand “fair” and “adequate” funding for public schools.
Gambill said recent changes to both bills were improvements from their original versions. But he maintained that increases to base tuition support in the Senate GOP’s state budget draft “are not enough,” and held that amendments added to the property tax measure would divert “critical” dollars from traditional publics to charters and could allow districts to “side step” collective bargaining rights for teachers.
Monica Shellhamer, a vice president with the Indianapolis Education Association, said during her rally remarks that teachers continue to be left out of conversations around school funding.
“Indianapolis public schools has been a target of the legislature for many years and this year is no different,” Shellhamer said. “Bill after bill continued to be submitted to shut down or defund Indianapolis public schools.”
Jenny Noble-Kuchera, president of the Monroe County Education Association, further pointed to pending education cuts at the federal level.
“The way it is currently, public education as we know it will begin to disappear, and our children are the victims,” she said Monday. “We already have severe mismanagement at the federal level of Title I grants for our lower-income students, of critical programs supporting students with disabilities, and elimination of programs for our schools.”
“This is bad enough, and now Indiana politicians can’t put their youngest constituents first, and support basics, like learning to read and write, and foundational math,” she continued. “It’s not OK.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A bill set to be considered Tuesday could force rural emergency service providers to shut down by reducing a needed source of funding, a leader of the state’s Ambulance Association said Monday.
But a Senate lawmaker said the proposed reimbursement rate cut to Oklahoma’s ambulance providers could save Oklahomans as much as $60 a year on their health insurance plan costs.
Senate Bill 1067, which is scheduled to be heard in the House Rules Committee, would authorize local government entities or ambulance service providers to submit ambulance service rates to the Oklahoma Insurance Department to create a public database. It would also cut the minimum amount that out-of-network ambulance providers can be reimbursed. 
Robin Robinson, vice president of the Oklahoma Ambulance Association and director of McClain-Grady County EMS, said she was at the Oklahoma Capitol Monday to encourage lawmakers to vote “no” on the bill. 
She said it strips local control from municipalities and county governments and would limit the amount her agency collects. She said it comes just months after a state law took effect that allowed ambulance providers to charge more. Robinson said if the new bill became law, the financial difference could equate to the salary of a full time paramedic. 
“With the bill that was passed last year, I was hoping that we could add another paramedic to staff full time,” she said. “My call volume is increasing, and that’s not going to change, but the money to be able to staff isn’t there. And so if this bill passes, I’m not going to be able to add that full time, permanent position.”
The average salary for a paramedic in Oklahoma is $48,640, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Robinson said salaries vary around the state depending on location and demand. 
Instead of letting local governments set reimbursement rates based on what’s needed to keep EMS providers in business, the bill creates a “cap all the way across the board,” Robinson said.“If I can’t staff the extra ambulances during the times that I need, we have to call in mutual aid ambulances, and that’s going to be anywhere from 15, 20, 25 minutes to get there,” she said. “This could hurt Oklahomans. You know, we have ambulance services that are further out than I am, more rural. It could hurt them worse, they may have to shut down.” 
Rep. Preston Stinson, R-Edmond, the House author, was not available for comment Monday.
But Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, the Senate author of the bill, said the new law, which took effect in January, could increase the cost of Oklahomans’ health plans by $3 to $5 per month.
He said it does not prevent local governments from setting ambulance service rates and only affects out-of-network providers. He said the measure drops reimbursement rates by 50%, from 325% of the Medicare or Medicaid rate to 275%, to help alleviate strains on health care plan costs
“That’s a massive, massive thing on the people of Oklahoma and their health plans,” he said. “We do know that ambulance people need a bump, so we just dropped it. The insurance people didn’t want it to be up more than 150%. Ambulance people, of course, want it to stay at 325% because if it stays the same, they keep getting paid. All I’m saying is, ‘Hey, let’s drop it 50 percentage points, and then you still get a raise and the people of Oklahoma’s health plan doesn’t come up.’ ”
He said the public database would let insurance companies know what local reimbursement rates are set at. 
The bill, which has already cleared the state Senate, would be eligible to be heard on the House floor if it passes committee Tuesday.

The reduction is significantly less than the near-$5 billion House Speaker Daniel Perez has pushed for through a reduction in the sales tax rate paid on goods and services (HB 7031) and the $5 billion Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to give Florida homeowners in the form of $1,000 in property tax rebates.
Of the $2.1 billion reduction proposed by the Senate, nearly $947 million would be permanent, a staff analysis shows. One Albritton target is the sales tax on clothing and shoes priced at $75 or less.

The bill directs the Office of Economic and Demographic Research to conduct a study to establish a framework to reduce, or eliminate taxes for homesteaded property. The report on accomplishing those goals would be submitted to legislative leadership by Nov. 1.
The study must include at least: 

An analysis of the potential impact of eliminating property taxes on public services, including education, infrastructure, public safety, and emergency services.
An assessment of potential housing market fluctuations, including changes in homeownership rates and property values.
An analysis of consumer behavior regarding home improvements that now result in property tax increases, including elevating homes in flood-prone areas, adding a mother-in-law suite, etc., and whether reducing or eliminating property taxes would change consumer behavior leading to an increase in resiliency.

The findings would help inform the Legislature about how to “craft a constitutional amendment for voters to consider during the next General Election.”
An example of a nonrecurring tax relief would be a one-time credit for the annual license tax tag fees associated with annual vehicle registrations.
The credit would apply to new registrations issued on or after July 1, 2025, and existing registrations that expire after Sept.  30, 2025. The credit would be available until October 2027, to ensure residents who purchase registrations before the tax credit takes effect and those who purchase two-year registrations can take advantage of the opportunity.
Another example of a nonrecurring sales tax is the newly created tax holiday for hunting season between Sept. 8 and Dec. 31, when enthusiasts can save on “ammunition firearms, bows, crossbows, and related accessories,” according to a press release announcing the details of the tax package.
The Florida Senate Committee on Finance and Tax is set to consider the proposed tax package Tuesday afternoon.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)When Washington’s 147 legislators kicked off the 2025 session three months ago, solving the problem of an ever-growing shortfall in the state’s next operating budget topped their to-do list.
They haven’t done it yet. They’ve got 13 days, or roughly 300 hours, left to find a solution in order to finish on time and avoid a special session. And the latest barometer of the state’s economy shows the situation is worsening.
This isn’t the only uncompleted task on the legislative checklist.
Huge differences on a rent cap bill need reconciling. There’s a transportation budget to finish writing and the amount of a gas tax hike to settle on. And public school students may wind up with their own bill of rights, as their parents did last year, or maybe not.
Start the clock. Set it for 11:59:59 on April 27. That’s the final scheduled moment of the regular session. The last time lawmakers went into extended overtime was 2017 when it took three special sessions to get a budget deal.
Tax and spend
Democrats in the House and Senate drew up spending plans for the two-year budget cycle that starts July 1. Then they used their majorities to pass them over the objections of Republicans.
GOP members opposed them because each counts on historically large tax increase proposals to overcome the shortfall, pegged by the governor to be $16 billion spread over the next four fiscal years. And none of those taxes had been voted on in either chamber.
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson upended the process when he put the kibosh on Democrats relying on billions from an untested tax on the assets of really wealthy people to balance the ledger sheet.
Now, the status is unclear for other major pieces of their revenue-raising plan. This includes a payroll tax on large employers, higher business taxes on corporate and banking giants and lifting the cap on what cities, counties and the state can collect in property taxes each year. There’s formidable opposition to each.
Democratic lawmakers and Ferguson agree any solution will involve some taxes. The conversation is focused now on which ones. There could be more clarity later this week.
Meanwhile, budget negotiators need to settle on where to shave spending. There are many tough decisions in that arena.
For example, Ferguson and Senate Democrats are interested in furloughing state workers; hundreds of employees loudly dissented last week. And, with public schools, the Senate pumps about $800 million more into special education than the House. Getting more dollars into the operation of public schools was the topic of a February rally of students, parents and educators.
The differences fill a spreadsheet. Until they know what taxes they can pass, Democrats will be hard-pressed to make final decisions on where to trim.
Politics at the pump
Washington lawmakers must also adopt a new two-year budget for the state’sits transportation system before calling it quits. That’s not simple. 
The Senate-passed proposal spends about $1 billion more than the House. It also shifts future spending obligations tied to removing barriers to fish passage over to the capital budget while the House pencils in more money to deal with these culverts.
There’s another problem. Incoming revenues, primarily from the gas tax and vehicle fees, aren’t enough to carry out long-promised projects. So the House and Senate each assembled a package of new and higher fees plus a bump up of the state’s nearly highest-in-the-nation gas tax.
There’s disagreement here too. The Senate’s plan is anchored by a 6-cent per gallon increase in the state’s current 49.4-cent gas tax, with 2% increases each year after to account for inflation. The House wants to raise the state tax 9 cents, and then index it to inflation. Senators approved a much longer list of new and higher fees than House members.
Ferguson has not publicly signaled which lane he’s in. He’s not even said if he’ll sign a gas tax increase.
Rent cap clash
House Democrats want a statewide cap on residential rent increases. It’s a top policy priority. They had high hopes the Senate, which blocked it last year, had shifted far enough to the left to make it happen.
Twenty-nine of the 30 Democratic senators did vote to pass House Bill 1217. Not before making substantive changes, like hiking the limit on rent increases to 10% plus inflation in a single year, up from the 7% cap the House backed. The Senate also exempted single-family homes and set the law to expire in 15 years.
A conference committee of four Democrats and two Republicans will likely be deployed to wordsmith a version that the majority party in each chamber can stomach enough to approve. Republicans have been and will be a hard no.
Schoolhouse rocks
There’s been much gnashing of teeth among Democratic lawmakers since they enacted the parental “bill of rights” initiative last session. They intend this session on, in their words, fixing language in that 2024 law to clear up confusion and conform its provisions with existing statutes.
Senate Bill 5181 is the vehicle. It reached the House floor Monday. At each stop, Republicans and those who helped get Initiative 2081 to lawmakers last spring say it rolls back the rights granted to parents.
In the meantime, House Democrats drew up House Bill 1296, which they describe as a “bill of rights” for students. Opponents decry it as an attempt to further weaken the initiative and undermine the authority of school districts.
The two bills were united at one point this session. Now they’re not. Both could get to the governor’s desk. Both may not. And, as is often the case this session, the new governor has yet to voice an opinion publicly.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/wa_state_capital-1024x610.jpg,,,2025-04-14 16:09:44.176792

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole has announced a new “trauma-informed tool” meant to better keep victims of crimes informed about parole processes involving their offenders and available services. 
The board on Monday announced the launch of a MyVoice, a new software designed to better notify victims of crimes of services and other information, including when their offenders have upcoming hearings.  
“For years, the Board has relied on an offender management system to access victim information,” the board announced in a news release. “MyVoice represents a significant shift toward a victim-centered approach, enabling the Board to provide more timely and sensitive notifications regarding hearings that victims have a right to attend, along with introductory information about the post-sentence parole process.” 
Scott Stephenson, chair of the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, said in a prepared statement that the board is “committed to providing trauma-informed notifications to victims, and the launch of MyVoice is a major step in this direction.”

MyVoice’s first phase enhances the board’s ability to email victims who prefer electronic communication over traditional mail, according to the board. 
“It also gives Board staff access to a trauma-informed platform where they can update and manage victim contact information more efficiently,” board officials said. “In addition, the new system has allowed for important updates to the language used in notification letters, making them more informative about the post-sentence parole process and more considerate of victims’ experiences.”
Jennifer Yim, administrative director of the board, called the launch of MyVoice a “major milestone.” 
“As an agency, we are committed to continuing the development of this platform to reach our end goal — allowing victims to independently enter and manage their contact information and to offer additional options, such as text messaging notifications,” she said. “We thank the victim services representatives and victims who have helped us understand the needs of victims to inform this process of improving our services.”
The board included a link to templates for four “victims’ notifications letters,” which include information about why the board would be contacting victims, their right to be informed about an upcoming hearing for the offenders, and contact information for victim coordinators that can provide more information about resources that are available to them. 
“The Board remains committed to protecting public safety through transparency, accessibility, and delivering services that recognize the rights and experiences of victims throughout the parole process,” board officials said.

Jeff Merkley and Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, the top Democrats on the Budget committees, urged the Government Accountability Office to look into the matter.GAO General Counsel Edda Emmanuelli Perez did and wrote in a letter released earlier this month that OMB’s decision to withhold publicly sharing the apportionment information was “very concerning.”“We understand that OMB took down the website taking the position that it requires the disclosure of predecisional, and deliberative information,” he wrote. “We disagree.”Perez rejected OMB’s argument that all of the information had to be removed since “apportionments may contain sensitive information which, if disclosed publicly automatically, may pose a danger to national security and foreign policy.”“While there may be some information that is sensitive if disclosed publicly, it is certainly not the case that all apportionment data meets that standard,” he wrote. “Where there is such sensitive data that should be protected from public disclosure, those would be the exception and should not serve to take down the entire database.”Lawsuits want public info restoredThe two lawsuits — Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Office of Management and Budget and Protect Democracy Project v.

Sullivan, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton.Protect Democracy Project wrote in its lawsuit that the “laws requiring transparency for apportionments make it more difficult for the executive branch to impound funds unlawfully outside the view of Congress and the public.”The Trump administration faces numerous lawsuits stemming from its efforts to block several departments and agencies from spending money appropriated by Congress, also known as impoundment.The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 bars the executive branch from holding onto money instead of spending it as directed by Congress. But Vought has said several times he believes the law is unconstitutional.Protect Democracy Project’s lawsuit was also filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, though it hadn’t been assigned to a judge as of Monday afternoon.",,,,2025-04-14 16:09:44.176792

(Courtesy of the Fillmore County Sheriff's Office via the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen has requested a major federal disaster declaration for 27 Nebraska counties related to a March winter storm that disaster response officials estimate did more than $64.9 million in damage.
Pillen sent the request to President Donald Trump for the March 18-19 storms, during which the state’s public utilities suffered the most eligible damage, the most significant of which was to power poles and electrical lines. More than 1,700 poles were downed or destroyed. 
Major roadways closed due to the storm — producing thunderstorms, sleet, high winds and blizzard conditions — including a 160-mile stretch of Interstate 80. 
An estimated 200,000 customers were left without power at the height of the storm, and some communities established emergency shelters to help those without electricity for a prolonged time.
In his letter to Trump, Pillen described the March storm as “one of the most destructive winter weather events to impact Nebraska in recent history” and wrote that “emergency services were pushed to their limits.” This is Pillen’s first federal disaster declaration request for 2025.
A disaster declaration would open up federal funding to help cover costs in the following counties: Boone, Burt, Butler, Cass, Clay, Colfax, Cuming, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Hamilton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lancaster, Nuckolls, Otoe, Platte, Polk, Saline, Sarpy, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Thurston, Washington, Webster and York.
Pillen requested and was granted five federal disasters in 2024 under President Joe Biden:

April 6-7: Severe wintry storm and straight-line winds; $38 million estimated preliminary damage.
April 25-27: Severe storms, straight-line winds and tornadoes; $20 million estimated preliminary damage.
May 20 – June 3: Severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding. $12 million estimated preliminary damage.
June 19 – July 8: Severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding: $15 million estimated preliminary damage.
July 31: Severe storms , straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding: $35 million estimated preliminary damage.

Pillen signed a state-level disaster declaration in February for wildfires in Custer and Dawes County.

Greg Lopez is launching another bid for Colorado governor.
The Republican who spent six months representing Colorado’s 4th Congressional District in Congress last year has run for governor twice before, losing in primary elections in both 2018 and 2022. 
Lopez became a self-described “placeholder” in Congress following former U.S. Rep. Ken Buck’s resignation in March 2024. Shortly afterwards, a small committee of Republican Party members nominated Lopez to finish Buck’s term, and he went on to defeat Democrat Trisha Calverese in the June special election. GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Windsor won election to a full term representing the 4th District in November.

“My whole life, I’ve been a listener, a problem solver, a fighter for the people,” Lopez said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “I’m running to fix what’s broken and bring people together. Not as a Republican governor. But a Colorado Governor.”
Lopez also previously served as mayor of Parker. He said he will run a statewide “People Over Politics” tour starting later in April, named for his campaign mantra.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who has been in office since 2019, is term-limited in 2026. U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser are running on the Democratic side of the race. Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will be favored to win the general election. Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election, and Polis won reelection in 2022 by nearly 20 percentage points.
In 2018, Lopez placed third in a four-way GOP primary won by then-State Treasurer Walker Stapleton. He then narrowly lost a head-to-head primary contest against former University of Colorado Regent At-Large Heidi Ganahl in 2022, winning 46% of the vote to Ganahl’s 54%.
Other Republican candidates to announce a 2026 run for governor include state Sen. Mark Baisley, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell and Brighton Fire Chief Brycen Garrison, among several others. 
Lopez hinted that his name would appear on the Colorado ballot in 2026 in a November interview with Newsline.

Adam Hollier (D-Detroit) | Ken Coleman photo Former State Sen. Adam Hollier (D-Detroit) announced on Monday that he would once again seek to represent the state’s 13th congressional district, throwing down the gauntlet against U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit).
In his announcement, Hollier sharply criticized Thanedar, who is serving his second term in Congress. 
“From housing to daycare to the rising costs of everything from groceries to the brakes on our cars, we’re in a real crisis in this country,” said Hollier. “We need bold solutions and leaders who won’t back down in the face of this challenge. The last thing we need are more millionaires and billionaires like Elon Musk and Shri Thanedar who are only in it for themselves.”
Thanedar, who spent $10 million of his own funds seeking the governor’s seat in 2018, served one term in the Michigan Legislature from 2021 through the end of 2022. He was elected to Congress for the first time that year, winning reelection in 2024.
Hollier served in the state Senate from 2018 through the end of 2022. He served as the Director of the Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency from January to October of 2023. Hollier is also a team chief and paratrooper in the 412th Civil Affairs Battalion, Army Reserve. 
The two previously squared off in the 2022 Democratic primary, with Thanedar receiving 28.3% of the vote and Hollier receiving 23.5% of the vote.
While Hollier sought to unseat Thanedar in 2024, he was disqualified from the primary after Thandedar challenged his petitions to appear on the ballot. In her review, Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett found only 863 of the 1,553 signatures he submitted were valid, leaving Hollier 137 signatures short of the 1,000 needed to qualify for the ballot.
After he was disqualified from the ballot, Hollier said the circulator he’d brought on to collect signatures had let him down, but that as the leadership of the campaign fell to him, he must hold himself to a higher standard.
In announcing his candidacy for 2026, Hollier amplified criticism of Thanedar, pointing to an investigation from the Detroit News which found Thanedar had spent $930,000 in taxpayer funds in 2024 TV, radio, billboards and other advertisements to promote himself as he faced challengers from several other Democrats heading into the primary election last year. 
“It’s absurd. While everyday Michiganders are struggling, Shri Thanedar is spending hundreds of thousands of their hard-earned tax dollars putting up self-portraits of himself all over the district,” Hollier said in a statement. “That’s something only Donald Trump would be proud of.”
Thanedar told the News the ads were unrelated to his reelection campaign  and were intended to generate calls from constituents who need help from the federal government.
On Monday, Thanedar defended his record in a statement to the Michigan Advance.  SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Since my election, we’ve solved over 2800 constituent cases, recovered nearly $3 million for constituents, gotten $30 million approved in community projects, and sponsored and cosponsored 810 different bills. We have world class constituent communication, including a record 11 in-person town halls,” Thanedar said before blasting Hollier for his previous failure to qualify for the ballot.
“Congressional candidates have the simple task of getting 1,000 qualified signatures to get on the ballot. Voters in the 13th District, 30% of whom are at or below poverty, have serious problems they need addressed. They are looking for someone competent and qualified, not someone who will hire his friends and disastrously fail to accomplish simple tasks,” Thanedar said.

In his announcement, Hollier called for aggressive action from the federal and state government to build new affordable housing across the region and crack down on corporations gouging buyers and renters on housing costs. 
He also pledged to fight for investments to lower the costs of childcare and a repeal of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. If elected, Hollier also promised he would work to make it easier for Michiganders to start small businesses and cut taxes on the poor and the middle class.
As one of the two U.S. representatives whose districts encompass Detroit, the race for the 13th District is considered vital for representation of the predominantly Black city. Detroit elected its first Black U.S. representative, Charles Diggs Jr., in 1954, and consistently elected a Black representative up until 2022, when voters elected Thanedar, who immigrated from India, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who is Palestinian American, to Michigan’s 12th Congressional District. 
While Hollier, who is Black, did not make the ballot in 2024, Thanedar’s Democratic challengers included Lawyer Shakira Lynn Hawkins and Detroit City Council Member Mary Waters who are both African American. Republican Martell Bivings, who faced off against Thanedar in 2022 and 2024, is also Black.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC_0270-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-04-14 16:09:44.176792

(Photo by Getty Images)More New Mexicans will be able to receive treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, thanks to a first-in-the-nation requirement for some health insurance plans to cover the costs.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on April 7 signed into law House Bill 233, which requires state-regulated health insurance plans to pay for medically necessary treatments for diabetic foot ulcers starting in 2026.
In a news release on April 8, the American Diabetes Association applauded the new law and said it makes New Mexico the first U.S. state to require state-regulated health insurance plans to cover these treatments.
Diabetes-related foot ulcers affect approximately 15 to 25% of all people with diabetes at some point in their lifetime, the ADA said in the news release, and 15% of people with a diabetes-related foot ulcer will require an amputation.
In New Mexico, approximately 217,400 adults, or 13.1% of adults in the state, have diagnosed diabetes, with an estimated 9,800 adults receiving the diagnosis each year, according to the state Department of Health’s analysis of HB233.
Diabetic foot ulcers can lead to loss of the ability to walk, infection, hospitalization, lower-extremity amputation and death, according to a review article in the ADA’s journal Diabetes Care.
Christine Fallabel, the ADA’s director of state government affairs, told Source NM that people with these ulcers have found that insurance does not cover the specialized podiatric treatments to fight the infection and save the foot.
Other states have not tried to introduce similar legislation, Fallabel said, because there is a lot of stigma around diabetes and foot health, and policymakers generally don’t know about the problem.
Fallabel, who has lived with Type 1 Diabetes for the last 25 years, said one of those treatments, called topical oxygen therapy, has resulted in a 71% reduction in amputations, an 88% reduction in hospital visits and a six times higher likelihood of healing within three months, she said.
“There’s really good data coming out about targeting diabetic foot ulcers with this high-pressure oxygen therapy that, until this bill was signed, most insurers wouldn’t cover for one reason or another,” Fallabel said.
Other services that podiatrists could try and would be covered by health insurance under the new law could also include antibiotics or physical therapy, Fallabel said.
State-regulated health insurance plans include a range of private health insurance plans managed by the state government, Fallabel said. It does not include Medicare or Medicaid patients, she said.
Some state Medicaid programs cover these kinds of treatments but New Mexico’s does not, Fallabel said. During the recent legislative session, some lawmakers expressed interest in returning in a future session to change the Medicaid program to cover these treatments too, she said.

Parts of the floor were water-damaged, and after more than 50 years of housing low-income residents, wear and tear on the building was becoming impossible to ignore. 
In October, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development gave the building’s nonprofit owner a $3.8 million grant to pay for needed repairs and upgrades, including a new heating system and windows.
But the money never came through because the Trump administration has “permanently frozen” the funds, CommonBond Communities president and CEO Deidre Schmidt said Monday. 
The grant money came from HUD’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, which provided grants and loans to finance energy efficiency upgrades at affordable housing developments nationwide. Vista Village was the only Minnesota-based project to receive an award through the competitive program.

Congress authorized $1 billion for the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In March, the Associated Press reported that the program was being “terminated” at the direction of DOGE.
Communication about the “permanent freeze” has been confusing and contradictory, said Sen. Tina Smith, who joined Schmidt and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter for a press conference at Vista Village Monday.
Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a close advisor to President Donald Trump, has directed federal agencies to cancel funding related to climate change mitigation.
“What’s going on here is actually a massive power grab, and a big money grab, because their plan is to scoop up all of this money and then use it so that they can pay for the tax cuts that they have planned for really wealthy individuals and big corporations,” Smith said. 
Vista Village resident Lisa Bennett, a nurse who has lived at the building for nearly seven years, said the repairs to the complex are needed. 
“We’re not asking for no hardwood floors. We don’t want no stainless steel appliances. We don’t want no recessed lighting — just for that grant to come through so that we can get our building together,” Bennett said.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)This story was originally posted on IdahoEdNews.org on April 14, 2025.
Time is fast running out. And there are no visible signs of progress.
But University of Idaho and University of Phoenix officials insist they haven’t given up on the idea of a partnership.
“We continue to be excited about the proposed affiliation with the University of Idaho and the opportunity to support important educational and workforce needs in the state of Idaho,” University of Phoenix spokeswoman Andrea Smiley said in an email to Idaho Education News last week. “The two universities will continue to collaborate to find solutions.”
“We continue to see incredible value in University of Phoenix,” U of I spokeswoman Jodi Walker told EdNews in an email. “However, next steps are in the hands of Phoenix and its ownership team.”
But the State Board of Education has the U of I on a deadline to close a deal with Phoenix, a for-profit online university serving some 85,000 students. That deadline, June 10, is quickly approaching.
And what’s more, the State Board agreed to an extension in order to give the two universities time to win over skeptical legislators. And that hasn’t happened — at least not publicly.
The 2025 legislative session came and went without a Phoenix bill, a committee hearing, or any kind of vote. That silence stood in a stark contrast to the 2024 session. The Legislature stymied the $685 million Phoenix deal — with the Idaho Senate killing a bill that would have restructured the purchase — after lawmakers complained that they had been left in the dark by the parties’ closed-door negotiations.
In short, U of I and Phoenix officials now have less than two months to settle on a deal to meet the State Board’s deadline. And with the Legislature adjourned until January, it isn’t clear how lawmakers would have a chance to weigh in on a revamped deal — unless they returned to Boise for a special session.
In the meantime, as the U of I suggests, the next move belongs to Phoenix.
The State Board’s extension also gave Phoenix the latitude to talk to other would-be buyers. Phoenix is continuing to explore “other transaction opportunities,” Smiley said.
One option could involve going public.
As Bloomberg reported in March, Phoenix’s ownership groups are considering an initial public offering, perhaps as early as the third quarter of 2025.
And what about the State Board — which has the U of I on the clock?
The State Board did not respond to a request for comment.
The board meets Wednesday and Thursday at the U of I. And while U of I President C. Scott Green is expected to address the board and deliver the university’s annual report, the board has no Phoenix-related item on its agenda.

Citing existing legal precedents, U.S. Circuit Judge Elizabeth L. Branch wrote in the unanimous opinion that First Amendment protections of speech apply to the act of begging.
“Thus, the begging statute’s applications, which are solely to begging, are impermissible, and the pedestrian solicitation statute’s applications, which are to begging and other constitutionally protected speech, are impermissible,” Branch stated in her opinion.

Messages were sent to Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, the defendant in the lawsuit. Messages were also left with the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which represented the state, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which represented plaintiff Jonathan Singleton, and others in the suit.
The initial lawsuit challenged two statutes. The first prohibits a person from standing on the highway and asking those in a vehicle for money, a job or other “business.” Violating that statute is punishable by up to 10 days in jail and a $100 fine.  The second prevents people from loitering in public spaces “for the purpose of begging,” which carries a penalty of up to 30 days in jail and a $200 fine.
Singleton was cited six times for allegedly violating the laws in Montgomery.
A lower court ruled in Singleton’s favor in March 2023 and issued a permanent injunction against ALEA’s enforcement of the law. The agency appealed the lower court decision to the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center, who represented Singleton and the individuals affected, and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office argued the case before a panel of three judges with the 11th Circuit in December.
Alabama Deputy Solicitor General Robert Overing argued in court that begging specifically is not protected speech based on the First Amendment and that the state could regulate the activity and impose penalties on those who violate rules set by the government.
He cited a law passed in the state of New York in 1788 and an action by former President James Madison in 1812 to penalize those who loitered in public spaces.
The Southern Poverty Law Center cited Smith v. Fort Lauderdale, a 1999 decision by the 11th Circuit that upheld a local law banning panhandling on part of a sidewalk, but said that panhandling laws must be narrowly tailored to avoid infringing on the First Amendment. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals then applied that same standard to other cases involving panhandling.
The Alabama Legislature revised the statute concerning begging in public places during the 2023 session by approving HB 24, sponsored by Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Matthews, that  makes the first arrest for loitering a violation and subsequent infractions a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.

“Sentiment has now lost more than 30% since December 2024 amid growing worries about trade war developments that have oscillated over the course of the year. Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,” said Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu in a release.
Hsu added that the drop was “pervasive and unanimous” across multiple factors including age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation. 
The index is published monthly by the university, and is an indicator of consumers’ confidence in the health of the U.S. economy.
The results, released Friday, came just two days after President Donald Trump reversed course on sweeping tariffs on imported goods, pausing them for 90 days, while keeping in place an across-the-board 10% duty as well as separate tariffs on specific commodities. 
While the university’s survey concluded the day before Trump’s announced pause, Hsu said the share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead has been increasing for five consecutive months and is now more than double the November 2024 reading and the highest since the Great Recession. 
“This lack of labor market confidence lies in sharp contrast to the past several years, when robust spending was supported primarily by strong labor markets and incomes,” said Hsu. 
Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told business journalists at a speech in Virginia that while there was a “still solid” outlook on economic growth, surveys of households and businesses reported “dimming expectations and higher uncertainty” in reaction to Trump administration policies, especially as they related to trade. 
The University of Michigan survey noted that inflation expectations for the coming year “surged from 5.0% last month to 6.7% this month,” which was the highest reading in nearly 45 years. That rise was also seen across the political spectrum. 
“Long-run inflation expectations climbed from 4.1% in March to 4.4% in April, reflecting a particularly large jump among independents,” said Hsu.

(Photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Gov. Glenn Youngkin dubbed April 14-19 Virginia Screen-Free Week, which the governor’s administration encourages citizens of all ages to observe by reducing their time on digital devices and increasing activities that promote human connection, physical activity and improved mental health.
Virginia Screen-Free week includes resources and activity guides for parents and children, schools and communities and is an extension of the work Youngkin and lawmakers have undertaken to counter the negative impacts excessive social media and screen time can have on developing minds. 
“By reducing distractions and supporting healthier screen use, we are creating space for deeper learning, stronger relationships, and more meaningful engagement—both in and out of the classroom,” Education Secretary Aimee Rogstad Guidera said in a Monday release about Virginia Screen-Free Week .
 Lawmakers respond to growing data on youth phone use

A 2023 Gallup survey revealed that teens who spend five or more hours per day on social media apps were more likely to report negative emotions compared to those who use social media less than two hours a day. In response, Youngkin launched initiatives to encourage and enforce time away from phones in classrooms, which the administration said can offer students a few hours most days to focus on their studies instead of their devices. 
The governor’s Executive Order 43 established the Reclaiming Childhood Task Force, which analyzed social media and screen times’ role in mental health, while last summer’s Executive Order 33 directed state agencies to draft guidance for how schools could implement cell phone-free policies.
Youngkin signs executive order to establish ‘cell phone-free education’ in Va. public schools

Virginia lawmakers introduced legislation this year to allow local school boards flexibility over how cell phones and smart devices are governed in classrooms. Youngkin has since signed the bills, carried by Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke and Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax. 
Rasoul told The Mercury in February that the legislation enables age-appropriate policies across different schools but has exceptions for students with disabilities that rely on electronic devices to communicate. The proposal also prevents harsh disciplinary measures to ensure that violating the school’s phone policy alone wouldn’t lead to suspensions or expulsions. 
Last week, U.S. Rep. Eugene Vindman, D- Fredericksburg, introduced federal legislation that could take phone-free school policies nationwide, if passed. Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt — whose book, “The Anxious Generation,” focused on social media’s connections to youth mental health — provided a statement in the press release about Vindman’s bill.
“Schools that go phone free almost always report increased student engagement, decreased disciplinary problems,” Haidt said. “And, most touchingly, teachers say that they hear laughter in the hallways again.” 
Virginia scholars have weighed in on the family and education benefits of limiting screen use, as well. 
Longwood University professors Sarai and Adam Blincoe enjoy a low-tech lifestyle when it comes to cell phone, laptop or tablet use and are also raising their young children with little screen time. On a cross-country road trip last summer, their kids only watched two movies, they said in an interview. 
Sarai is a psychology professor and Adam is a philosophy professor; their shared interest in how cell phones affect people has infused their work.
In 2021, they published a research paper based on input from their students, who they encouraged to test out a lower-tech lifestyle outside of the classroom while surrendering their devices inside its walls.
Sarai offered students extra credit for disregarding their phones during class time and solicited surveys from them later in the semester. Sixty-five percent of students reported more cognizance of their cell phone use habits as a result, 50% reported how the practice affected cell phone use in other classes, and about 15% reported how the habits carried over to their cell phone use outside of class time.  
“I feel that (functioning cell phone-free) has increased my focus in class,” one student wrote. “Ever since I realized how much more focused I am without my phone … I have found myself leaving my phone in my backpack or sometimes in my dorm room.”
Meanwhile, Adam’s research tested student responses to device-free time outside of classroom environments. Students were required to pick a novel to read in book form, rather than on a device. Students shared that the exercise reminded them of the joy of reading in particular, but also encouraged them to carve out leisure time more broadly. Adam also required students to take three 20-minute walks without their phones per week. 
“I witnessed genuine relief when students realized that they had permission to opt out of the phone even for small periods of time,” he said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)On the eve of another Florida House hearing on the workings of Hope Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday accused House Republicans of working with the “liberal media” in a smear campaign against First Lady Casey DeSantis and the Hope Florida Foundation.
DeSantis unsolicited made the accusations during a Kissimmee press conference following a Miami Herald/ Tampa Bay Times story that the non-profit organization affiliated with Hope Florida paid $5 million a piece to two organizations that contributed to a political committee that worked to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana. 
The $10 million payment to the two groups mirrors the amount the Hope Florida Foundation received from health care giant Centene as part of a settlement regarding overpayment of Medicaid pharmacy benefits and services.
“I got to tell you, I’m used to the baseless smears from liberal media. I’m used to the baseless smears from Democrats. I’ve been dealing with it for over six years. It’s par for the course. But I think now we have Republican leadership in the Florida House joining with liberal media and joining with Democrats to launch baseless smears against Hope Florida and by extension, myself and the First Lady,” DeSantis said.
Hope Florida was set up by Casey DeSantis as a state effort to work with the private sector and faith-based community to help people relying on government assistance transition — or as the DeSantis administration calls it, “graduate” — to self reliance. 
The DeSantis administration claims 30,000 people have called the Hope Florida hotline for help in getting work and transitioning from government support. The foundation is a direct-support organization for the Department of Children and Families, one of the main agencies involved with Hope Florida.

Florida law requires agencies to notify the Legislature when they enter into settlement agreements, but that did not occur with the Centene agreement, which was signed by former AHCA Secretary Jason Weida (now Gov. DeSantis’ chief of staff), Chief Deputy Attorney General John Guard, Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworksy, Department of Health Chief of Staff Cassandra Pasley, and Centene Corp. Executive Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel Christopher A. Koster.
So, at a minimum, the DeSantis administration broke state law, said House Health Care Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Alex Andrade.

Medicaid, the safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled, is funded with state and federal dollars. Which could mean that a portion of the $67 million settlement should have been returned to the federal government if the money was related to a Medicaid overpayment.










This is the murky, corrupt, swamp behavior people hate about politics. This money belonged to the taxpayers of Florida, not to the DeSantis family. Floridians deserve to know that their tax dollars aren't being moved around in a shell game to pay political consultants.


– Rep. Fentrice Driskell


It is not clear that occurred.
“This is the murky, corrupt, swamp behavior people hate about politics. This money belonged to the taxpayers of Florida, not to the DeSantis family. Floridians deserve to know that their tax dollars aren’t being moved around in a shell game to pay political consultants,” Fentrice Driskell, the Democratic leader in the state House, said during a Monday morning press conference.
“No matter your politics, no one wants to see taxpayers dollars ending up in the coffers of a political party, or even the appearance of that happening. We need a full investigation, and I’m glad that the House is pursuing this. We need an accounting of all tax dollars involved here.”
Driskell added: “Now, it’s ironic for a governor who talks about Florida Doge to chase waste and fraud to be caught in the middle of a scandal involving defrauding and wasting taxpayer money. The Legislature deserves better answers than what we got in committee last week.”
Latest battle with the Legislature
House Republicans, too, have questioned the legality of steering money from the settlement with a Medicaid vendor to the Hope Florida Foundation. 
On Tuesday, the House Health Care Budget Committee plans to hear testimony from several people regarding Hope Florida, including the head of the foundation.
Gov. DeSantis hotly objected to the House’s efforts.
“Let me tell you something, none of these Republican leaders got elected on the platform that they were going to launch baseless attacks against the governor and First Lady. That is not why they got elected. Had they run on that, they would have lost their primaries, they would never have been elected in the first place. No, they were elected to continue our success in Florida, to build off the great achievements of the last six years. “
This is the latest salvo in the fight between the governor and the Republican-controlled Legislature, a dispute that seemingly started with the governor’s call for a special session on immigration early this year but that has spun out from there to include disputes on government spending, automobile insurance, access to the courts, and tax policy. DeSantis has pushed the Legislature to eliminate property taxes for homeowners and to pass a proposed constitutional amendment for voters to consider doing that in 2026.
House Speaker Daniel Perez proposed to reduce the state’s sales tax instead, which, if passed, would take effect sooner. The governor countered with a proposal to provide $1,000 rebates to roughly 5.1 million property owners and called on the Legislature to act immediately. The governor’s rebate idea, however, has gotten no traction and does not appear to be under serious consideration.
DeSantis also wanted legislators to pass a bill that would permanently enshrine Hope Florida in the governor’s office. The bill has stalled in the House but is scheduled for its second Senate stop on Tuesday.
DeSantis said the House is working to sabotage his agenda.
“They were elected to cut property taxes, which they refused to do. They were elected to help alleviate and end the condo crisis, which the Florida House has refused to do. They were elected to continue our Florida First agenda. 
“And what are they doing with their actions?” DeSantis asked. “Not only are they trying to sabotage that agenda, but they are stabbing the voters in the back with their behavior. Shame on you in the Florida House and your terrible behavior and leadership questions.”
Meanwhile, Attorney General James Uthmeier, formerly DeSantis’s chief of staff, played down any suggestion of wrongdoing during his own press conference Monday saying there’s “not a problem”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Islanders are once again being asked to share how they feel about life in the Ocean State in this year’s RI Life Index survey.
The collaboration between Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health is now in its seventh year of tracking residents’ views on social and economic factors that influence health, including housing, food security, job opportunities, education, child care and the cost of living.
Respondents are selected randomly and contacted primarily by phone or text message, with some respondents also reached online. Surveys started in March and will run through the end of spring, with results expected to be released in fall. The Siena College Research Institute administers the surveys.
The anonymous surveys were first conducted in 2019 with the goal of aggregating data over time and from diverse communities about how people perceive quality of life in Rhode Island. Since 2020, the survey has placed special focus on social factors of health among Rhode Island’s Black and Latino populations. 
The findings help inform and guide a 14-member coalition of local organizations and public health agencies to provide “thought leadership on viable solutions to the challenges identified” in the survey data, according to the index’s website. Among the coalition members are AARP Rhode Island, HousingWorks RI, Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, the Economic Progress Institute, and the Rhode Island Department of Health. Past survey data has been used in publications by coalition members, like the HousingWorks RI Housing Fact Book and the Rhode Island Community Food Bank’s “2024 Status Report on Hunger in Rhode Island.” 
Blue Cross also uses the data to steer its philanthropic initiatives. 
Respondents are asked questions about their communities and the likelihood of specific experiences within their communities, as well as their direct experiences with housing and food security. Responses are graded on a 100-point scale dubbed the “POP” score, or “percent of the possible” — a measure of how close respondents believe their  community is to an ideal, healthy environment. The overall, statewide POP score in the 2024 survey was 57.
The 2024 survey included 1,946 respondents, with an oversample of Black and Latino Rhode Islanders. Last year’s data also saw improvements in perceptions about access to health care among Black and Latino residents. People living in the four “core” cities of Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, and Woonsocket rated health care, community life, and programming and services for children more positively than in the previous year. Scores for Latino residents rebounded to 2020-2022 levels in all categories except quality of community, cost of living and food security.

Mike Thompson, right, says the Kansas Legislature failed to deliver on a bipartisan promise to concentrate during the 2025 session on meaningful property tax reform. Here, Thompson speaks with Democratic Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau on the floor of the Kansas Senate in March. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature and Gov. Laura Kelly patted themselves on the back last June after placing into state law a compromise bill slashing income taxes an estimated $1.2 billion over three years.
Senate Bill 1 had broad support with a mere six opponents among 159 legislators voting on the package negotiated by the Democratic governor, Republican Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover and GOP House Speaker Dan Hawkins of Wichita. The focus of that bill was income taxes, but it did raise to $75,000 the exemption on the value of a residence when calculating a taxpayer’s obligation to the state’s property tax levy for public schools.
While 2024 was viewed as the year of the income tax, promises were made by Republicans and Democrats to address property tax reform during the 2025 legislative session. The end of the annual session last week offered evidence the performance of lawmakers on property tax relief was again underwhelming.
“When it came time to lead, both the governor and leadership came up short,” said Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican candidate for governor, said Monday.
He said state lawmakers this session delivered a paltry $25.88 property tax break for the owner of a $150,000 home. That’s not enough to fill the gas tank in many vehicles, cover the cost of a couple sacks of groceries or pay someone to mow a lawn.
Schwab encouraged “every property owner” to respond by challenging their property tax valuation with the Kansas Board of Tax Appeals.
“Kansans expected leadership that would address runaway property tax increases, arrest out-of-control valuations and restore confidence that they can afford the homes they live in — not rent them from the government,” he said.
The Senate did endorse an amendment to the Kansas Constitution imposing a 3% cap on residential property tax valuation increases. That won’t be appearing on statewide ballots, however, because the amendment was never taken up in the House.
“We came here with a mandate,” said Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican. “I’m just disappointed that we end up at the end of this session with no real relief for those homeowners who are facing selling their home or paying their property tax. That’s where we are.”
Lenexa Sen. Dinah Sykes, who serves as Democratic leader of the Senate, drew the same conclusion with a partisan twist. She said progress on property tax reform was minimal, but reminded Kansans that Republicans held supermajorities in the House and Senate. Those two-thirds majorities meant the GOP could pass just about any bill it desired and had numbers to override the governor’s vetoes and place constitutional amendments on the ballot.
“Kansans deserve better than what they got from their Legislature in 2025,” Sykes said. “Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues refused to join us in that effort. Republicans promised Kansans they would deliver property tax relief, but they failed to make good on that promise.”
 
‘Put Kansans first’
Kansas voters were assured by sloganeering candidates during last year’s August primary and November general elections that nothing would stand in the way of meaningful property tax reform in 2025. Voters made it clear they thought property taxes were too high, valuations were rising faster than paychecks and, incredibly, some people on fixed incomes who worked all their lives to have a home of their own were being forced out.
As the legislative session began in January, another layer of political vows emerged about cutting property taxes.
“You expect us to put Kansans first, control the overreach of government and keep our promises — and that is exactly what we intend to do,” Masterson said. “That must begin with property tax relief and reform.”
When the dust settled in April, the Legislature barely scratched the surface on rolling back state property taxes. The governor signed Senate Bill 35, which used general state tax dollars to replace a 1.5-mill state property tax dedicated to government building projects. It was unanimously approved in the Senate and overwhelmingly endorsed in the House 96-26.
The Legislature passed a bill renewing the state’s 20-mill property tax, valued at about $875 million annually, to provide financial support to K-12 public schools. The Legislature could have earmarked state income or sales tax dollars to public schools and trimmed state property tax dedicated to that purpose.
Instead, the Republican-controlled House and Senate placed emphasis on income tax reform by voting to override Kelly’s veto of Senate Bill 269. This so-called income-tax-trigger bill was designed to methodically drop individual and corporate income tax rates to 4%.
“I have proposed and supported tax cuts when they are implemented responsibly and benefit the people of Kansas, especially those who need it most,” Kelly said. “This bill ignores Kansas families at a time of rising costs and inflation in favor of hundreds of millions of dollars in giveaways to corporations and the wealthy.”
The override vote on SB 269 was 87-37 in the House and 30-10 in the Senate. Instead of responding to Kansans’ demands for gradual reduction of property taxes, the Legislature in 2025 ended up dedicating future state revenue surpluses to gradually reducing income taxes.
The Senate did endorse a constitutional amendment that would have set a 3% cap on property taxes starting in 2027, but House GOP leaders said the necessary two-thirds majority to place Senate Concurrent Resolution 1603 before Kansas voters didn’t exist in the House.
Critics of the amendment had argued the limitation would cripple the ability of cities and counties to operate, because municipal government relied heavily on property and sales taxes. The state’s revenue stream includes income, sales and property taxes.
 
‘Very disappointed’
In January, the conservative Kansas Policy Institute highlighted for legislators an opinion poll conducted by SurveyUSA on behalf of the Wichita think tank. It showed 64% of participants were in favor of limits on annual increases in the appraised value of property rather than the current practice of annually resetting appraisals to fair market value.
The poll showed majority support for restraint of property taxes existed in urban and rural regions of the state, said Dave Trabert, a lobbyist with Kansas Policy Institute.
He said 70% of conservatives in the poll were supportive of steps to hold down property taxes, while 67% of moderates and 52% of liberals were on board. Eighteen percent were opposed and the same percentage was uncertain.
“Many homeowners have experienced double-digit property tax increases because local officials took advantage of valuation spikes,” Trabert said.
Rep. Tom Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat often distant from KPI’s perspective on public policy issues, said it was folly to ignore will of the people.
“Our constituents are asking for property tax relief,” said Sawyer, who contended the income tax trigger law would prove to be an obstacle to property tax reform. “We go to a rachet so all of our money above inflation in the future goes to cutting the income tax.”
Some of the Senate’s most right-wing members were convinced the Legislature did a belly flop on property taxes in 2025.
Sen. Virgil Peck, a Republican from Havana, said it wasn’t enough the Legislature worked on income tax policy and ditched the 1.5-mill property tax for building construction.
“I think we could do better when it comes to property tax reductions,” Peck said.
Finally, Wichita GOP Sen. Renee Erickson, said the Legislature’s approach to property tax issues didn’t answer the public’s call for relief.
“I’m very disappointed we did not do more for our constituents on property tax and I hope that we seriously are able to do something next session,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Thompson-and-Faust-Goudeau-3.26.25-Senate-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-14 14:13:07.174779

Most military and overseas absentee voters use a special electronic portal to cast their ballots,  a method that does not allow them to submit additional documents.
The state Board of Elections had told military and overseas voters they did not need to provide a photo ID. With the court ruling, elections officials would have to collect those photos from voters. 
Riggs asked a federal court judge to freeze action in the case. But District Judge Richard Myers told the state Board of Elections to prepare to act on the state court’s instructions while barring the board from declaring a winner.
Separately, a federal lawsuit filed Monday morning in federal court on behalf of overseas voters seeks to prevent the state Board of Elections from requiring them to supply photo ID. 
Named plaintiffs include Carrie Conley, a military spouse who maintained a legal voting residence in Guilford County and voted from Italy using the online portal. According to the court filing, she found out her vote was being challenged while the vote of a neighbor who maintains a Cumberland County voting residence was not challenged. 
Lockhart Webb was living in Switzerland when she voted and found out on April 5 she was on Griffin’s challenge list, according to the court filing. She fears she won’t receive notification of steps she would have to take based on new rules because she and her husband are in the process of returning to North Carolina and won’t have a fixed address. 
Ella Kromm, a Durham resident who voted while teaching in Spain, is also a plaintiff.
The Board of Elections “cure” process selectively imposes additional burdens on some voters and not others, the lawsuit said. 
“Presumptively invalidating votes cast by eligible, qualified voters who complied with all rules and requirements in place at the time of the 2024 elections—and then requiring those voters to jump through additional hoops months after the election to have their ballots counted equally in deciding the Seat Six race—is fundamentally unfair, unduly burdensome, and wholly arbitrary,” the suit said. 
At the rally, state Senator Val Applewhite, a 20-year Air Force veteran, said Republicans are disrespecting military voters. 
“You ask for fairness,  you ask for respect. And above all, you expect for your vote to count,” she said. “Today, we’re watching Republican politicians try to silence the very people who fight for our democracy.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-14-at-10.25.48-AM-1024x583.png,,,2025-04-14 14:13:07.174779

SB 279, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, allows the Alabama Legislature to demolish the current State House once the lawmakers and staff have moved into the new Statehouse, expected to take place in 2026. Givhan told the Senate State Governmental Affairs Committee that he did not know when the demolition would happen or how much it would cost, although the expense would come from the General Fund.
“This destruction is going to have to be paid for, in full, by Alabama taxpayer money,” chair of the Senate General Fund Committee Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, said.

The Legislature has occupied the current Statehouse, the old Highway Building, since 1986. The building, meant to be temporary to allow renovations to the Alabama State Capitol to proceed, has mold and other issues that led the Legislature in 2023 to approve construction of a new facility.

When completed, the Statehouse will be the first new one built in the nation since 1977.
Givhan, seemingly joking, said there could be a raffle for people to participate in the demolition, but that would be determined later.
“We may also raffle off tickets to get people with sledge hammers, like you used to do with old cars to beat them up a little,” he said. “This gives us the right to do that.”
The bill also allows the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate to sell furniture that will not be used in the new building. Rep. Chris Pringle, R-Mobile, carries a companion bill in the House, which has yet to be seen in the House State Governmental Affairs Committee.
Givhan’s bill will now be considered by the full Senate.

Saying Worrell had refused to prosecute at least 90 cases in the past week, Uthmeier said, […]","Florida Attorney General and Orange County Sheriff John Mina in Orlando on April 14, 2025. (Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier offered Monday to provide six prosecutors from his office to assist in Florida’s Ninth Judicial Circuit, where State Attorney Monique Worrell recently announced new policies to manage a backlog of more than 13,000 cases.
Saying Worrell had refused to prosecute at least 90 cases in the past week, Uthmeier said, “We’re going to tell her the words that no George Soros prosecutor wants to hear: We’re from the Attorney General’s office, and we’re here to help you.”
“So, the calvary’s here,” he added. “We’ve got the entire team of prosecutors that we’re going to be sending to help out. We hope that she will take that help. We want to get rid of that backlog and those thousands of cases that we want to make sure that dangerous people are put behind bars. We want to see bad guys go away.”
Worrell did ask Uthmeier last week for funding to bring in 13 more prosecutors to address the backlog of non-arrest cases that is now up to 13,675, according to WFTV in Orlando.
That request followed her announcement of a new policy that requires local law enforcement to make an arrest or issue a notice to appear in court before they submit a case to her office for prosecution — comments Uthmeier criticized as “blanket policies” that “are contrary to the essential duties of a prosecutor.”
Worrell, a Democrat, campaigned and won office for the first time in 2020 in part by promising criminal justice reform in her circuit, which encompasses Orange and Osceola Counties. Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended her in August 2023, alleging she had neglected “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
The move outraged Democrats, and Worrell took her case to the Florida Supreme Court, which voted 6-1 to uphold her suspension. However, running in liberal Orange and Osceola, she won a second term in November, beating NPA candidate Andrew Bain (appointed by DeSantis to replace her) by 15 percentage points.
Nick Cox, who serves as statewide prosecutor in the attorney general’s office, said during Monday’s press conference that if Worrell takes in the state prosecutors, they would act under her authority.
“We will try to determine how these cases would typically be handled in the Ninth Circuit but, at the same time, we’re going to bring to bear our opinions and our judgements on the cases, working with the state attorney’s office,” he said.
Despite his comment referring to Worrell as being funded by Soros, Uthmeier insisted his actions were not politically motivated.
“We’re not running around the state looking for people to remove from office,” he said. “We’re looking for people who aren’t doing their job. And, as a prosecutor, your job is simple: Put the bad people away and keep Floridians safe. It’s that simple.
“If you’re willing to do that, I’ve got no beef with you. I want to help you. I want to help everybody. Democrat, Republican, if you are a prosecutor your job is to put bad people away.”
‘Inaccurate and uninformed’
Worrell and Uthmeier have sparred in just the last week.
Speaking at a news conference in Tampa last Monday to announce arrests in a child pornography ring, Uthmeier said that one of the people arrested “was on a lighter probation sentence by the state attorney over in Orlando,” citing it as an example of a prosecutor who “go soft on crime.”
However, the individual to whom he referred, Frankie Pineiro, was prosecuted in a different jurisdiction and before Worrell was elected in 2020.
“The Attorney General is once again inaccurate and uninformed,” Worrell said in a statement issued last week.
“A simple review of public records established that not only was this individual sentenced prior to my election in 2020, but also that this case did not come out of the 9th Judicial Circuit. Since the Attorney General has stated that he will be looking at my conduct going forward to make sure we are enforcing the rule of law, I hope that he will prioritize public safety and also look at my request for additional prosecutors to support our enforcement of the rule of law.”
Throughout last year, DeSantis refused to comment about the possibility of suspending Worrell a second time if she won re-election. Speaking Monday in Kissimmee, which is part of Worrell’s jurisdiction, the governor said he would do so if there was proof that she was neglecting her duties.
“You do not have the ability to pick and choose which laws you’re going to enforce,” he said. “You don’t have the ability or the authority to let the inmates run the asylum. So I know the attorney general is keeping a close eye on what she’s doing. That could end up on my desk if there’s proof that somebody is neglecting their duties or satisfying one or the other provisions of the Florida Constitution, then obviously I could act again.”
As of early Monday afternoon, Worrell’s office had not responded to Uthmeier’s offer. We will update this story when and if she does.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina will appeal FEMA’s decision to end their 100% cost-share for Hurricane Helene debris cleanup and emergency services, Gov. Josh Stein said Monday.
“We were granted 30 days to appeal, which we will surely do,” Stein said during a Monday meeting of his advisory committee on western North Carolina.
The “uncertain” future of FEMA under the Trump administration, he added, combined with the president’s tariffs, would likely further complicate recovery in the mountains.
“The only thing we know for sure is the costs of recovery are going to go up, potentially dramatically,” said Stein, a Democrat.
President Donald Trump has put a 90-day pause on the vast majority of planned tariffs that had spurred chaos in the global markets. But he kept a 10% rate on all nations except China, and has floated additional tariffs on specific industries.
The resulting increased costs on materials are likely to be felt in western North Carolina, where rebuilding has already cost billions and is expected to take years.
“I continue to urge Congress and the White House to appropriate additional funds at a meaningful level,” Stein said.
FEMA: Less cost-sharing, canceled programs and slow-moving cash
FEMA’s decision Friday canceled the agency’s agreement to reimburse the state for 100% of costs on removing debris and emergency services.
It is far from a total departure of the agency from western North Carolina — federal money and resources continue to flow into the region. But the ruling does represent yet another Washington-based hurdle for state officials to find a way around as they try to rebuild.
FEMA’s recent decision to end a grant program focused on building resilient infrastructure will result in around $184 million in losses for North Carolina. Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s task force for Helene recovery, said it ranked eighth among states using the program’s money.

“Those are not immediate repairs,” Calabria said Monday. “And that is an impact for us going forward.”
In a statement announcing its shuttering, a FEMA spokesperson called the program “wasteful” and “ineffective,” and said it prioritized “political agendas.” Any unsent money for the program will be clawed back by the federal government.
The agency has not made a public statement on its denial of cost-sharing in North Carolina as of Monday.
Calabria said an additional $150 million in disaster aid had been pledged by FEMA but has yet to be sent.
“Reimbursements have been slow to come through,” he said.
FEMA and state officials are communicating “almost on a daily basis” as they work to get money flowing to the region, where local governments are facing fiscal cliffs due to damages and lost revenue.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee remains among least popular governors across the country, according to new polling data released last week by Morning Consult.
Surveys conducted between January and March show 43% of Rhode Islanders approve of the job McKee is doing, with 41% of respondents disapproving. Around 16% of those surveyed for the first quarter of 2025 did not have an opinion on Rhode Island’s Democratic governor. 
That’s a six point drop in favorability from the same time last year. McKee’s disapproval rating remains unchanged, leaving him tied for the fourth-highest disapproval rating among the nation’s 50 governors. 
Democrat Tina Kotek of Oregon and Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida also had disapproval ratings at 41%.
Morning Consult’s latest poll comes a little over a month after McKee announced his intention to seek reelection in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Campaign spokesperson Mike Trainor did not immediately respond to request for comment.
No doubt about it, Gov. McKee is running for reelection

Just ahead of McKee in unfavorability is Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who has a 42% disapproval rating. Maine’s Janet Mills, a Democrat, saw 44% of respondents in her state disapprove of how she’s handling the job.
Kim Reynolds, a Republican from Iowa, has the highest disapproval rating from residents, at 49%. Reynolds announced Friday she would not seek re-election in 2026.
Republican Phil Scott of Vermont holds the highest approval rating of any governor in the nation, with 75% of state residents viewing him favorably.
Connecticut’s Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s approval rating was at 62%, with 30% of respondents disapproving. Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey’s approval rating was at 58%, while 29% disapproved.
New Hampshire’s Kelly Ayotte, a Republican elected in November, has a 49% approval rating. After just three months in office, 31% disapprove of how she’s doing the job.
The last time McKee’s approval rating was higher than 50% was in the second quarter of 2023, according to Morning Consult’s polling data. At the time, McKee saw 52% approval, with 33% of respondents holding unfavorable views.
His highest approval – 60% –came in the third quarter of 2021, just a few months after he became governor following Gina Raimondo’s appointment as U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Joe Biden’s administration.
Morning Consult conducts nationwide online surveys every quarter to measure the approval ratings of governors, U.S. Senators, and the president. Rhode Island’s senior U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat, had a job approval of 53% and 28% disapproval. Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who was re-elected to a fourth term on Capitol Hill in November, saw an approval rating of 51%, while 32% of those surveyed disapproved.

(Photo courtesy of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission)In an effort to address tens of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells statewide, lawmakers in the Oklahoma legislature are considering a bill to increase funds to plug them.
The state uses an excise tax on oil and gas producers to cap the wells with the help of private contractors. House Bill 1370 adjusts the plugging fund with the hope of expanding it from around $2.5 million annually to up to $20 million, said state Sen. Grant Green, R-Wellston, who co-authored the bill with Rep. Brad Boles (R-Marlow).
It now heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), which oversees abandoned wells, reported in January it had at least 20,000 known sites statewide. The wells can leak liquid into nearby water or release methane, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.
“There’s been a real concerted effort to clean this state up with shut-ins, abandoned, orphaned, however you want to categorize them, and I just encourage us to keep moving forward,” Green said during the meeting. “And I mean, the number just changes all the time since I’ve been up here. But one thing that hasn’t changed, it’s growing. So we need to get a handle on it.”
Although the state keeps an estimate of the wells, it’s impossible for it to have a definitive list because many of the wells are in rural areas, a spokesperson for the OCC told StateImpact earlier this year.
Another bill passed by the committee would keep the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board (OERB) funded through 2031. House Bill 1031 is authored by Rep. Gerrid Kendrix (R-Altus) and Sen. Micheal Bergstrom (R-Adair). That bill is now headed to the Senate floor.
The board restores land around plugged abandoned wells using a 1% voluntary tax on oil and gas producers. According to the OERB, at least 20,000 sites have been cleaned up using the fund. The organization also promotes pro-oil and gas education in Oklahoma classrooms through its “HomeRoom” initiative.

It’s been more than six months now since Hurricane Helene devastated much of western North Carolina, and while there’s been a great deal of heroic recovery and rebuilding effort at all levels of government since then, recent actions in Washington are raising red flags in many corners.
At the North Carolina General Assembly, for example, lawmakers like Wake County state Rep.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The full Nebraska Legislature appears likely to debate a governor-backed bill to reexamine contributions for school employees’ retirement plans, which the sponsor described as a “win-win-win.”
The Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee on Monday morning voted 4-0 to advance Legislative Bill 645 by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, the committee chair. State Sens. Brian Hardin of Gering and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln were absent from the vote, but Ballard left the vote open through at least the end of the day for both to weigh in if they choose to.
“This is a win for state tax dollars, a win for teachers and also, I believe, a win for property taxpayers as well,” Ballard told the Nebraska Examiner of his amended bill.
State contributions and funding
The school retirement plan at center stage applies to eligible school employees outside of the Omaha Public Schools, which has a separate retirement plan.
Currently, teachers and other eligible school staff contribute 9.78% of their monthly payroll to the pooled retirement plan. School districts match this at 9.88% of the amount they pay their employees, while the state contributes 2% of statewide school employee payroll each year.

The estimated payroll for teachers in Nebraska, as of July 1, 2024, was $2.5 billion annually. That means the plan took in $543 million in direct contributions — about $50 million from the state, $245 million from employees and $248 million from school districts in the most recent year.
The amended LB 645 is significantly different from when it was introduced in January, which at the time would have reduced state contributions to 0% depending on the plan’s actuarial funding status, but left contribution rates for employees and school districts the same. The plan is currently 99.91% funded.
If LB 645 moves forward, contribution levels of all three groups would change at four stages based on the actuarially funded level — less than 96% funded, between 96% and 98% funded, between 98% and 100% funded and fully funded.
The state would fall to 0.7% of annual contributions at the two intermediate stages, retaining the 2% contribution level when the retirement plan is underfunded and paying zero when the plan is fully funded.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, and a member of the Retirement Committee, said LB 645 could save the state $77 million over the next biennium.
The governor’s office maintains that the freed-up funds should not be used to balance the state’s projected budget deficit but instead to invest in education.
Increased take-home pay
Under the latest version of Ballard’s bill, school employees would contribute 9.75% of payroll if the plan is less than 96% funded. This would lower to 8.75% and 8%, respectively, at the intermediate stages. When fully funded, employees would contribute 7.25% of their individual pay to the plan. Employees were brought to the table for negotiations prior to LB 645’s public hearing last month.
Ballard’s staff provided data estimating that the average school teacher could receive $1,000 in more take-home pay if the retirement plan is more than 98% funded, as it is now, because of lower monthly contributions.
  The following represents the scaling contribution rates that would be in place under an amended LB 645 proposed by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln. (Courtesy of Sen. Beau Ballard)
When the plan is fully funded, take-home pay for the average teacher could rise by up to $1,500 each year.
Employers would continue to contribute 101% of what their employees do, which is a first for the continued negotiations. Before, LB 645 would have locked the employer contribution rate at 9.88% of what employees are paid. Ballard said allowing lowered contributions when the retirement plans are flush could lead to reduced property taxes.
Lowered contributions at full funding would lower contributions for both employers and employees by 2.5%, potentially freeing up funding for a priority of the Nebraska State Education Association — funding more long-term substitutes so teachers can take paid time off around significant life events.
That bill, LB 440 from State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, is planned to be advanced through the Education Committee’s LB 306. An amended version of her bill seeks a 0.35% payroll tax, for both employees and employers, to fund four weeks of long-term substitutes, rather than her original proposal’s idea for six weeks.
Excess funds collected under the Spivey proposal above what’s needed to cover subs would be steered toward teacher retention or recruitment, such as forgivable loans for special education teachers as provided in Lincoln State Sen. George Dungan’s LB 408.
Latest actuarial study
Before structural changes to state retirement plans can be made, an actuarial study must assess the feasibility. The latest study came back last Thursday indicating the plan would still receive about 0.27% more funds each year than required under state law at full funding. The actuaries said this provides “little cushion … to absorb adverse experience.”
State law currently requires that the state is on the hook for additional funding in any given year if the plan requires more funds outside of annual contributions.
The actuaries wrote that part of the “challenge” in the future will be adjusting to the varied contribution rate, which could eat into state funds, property taxes or employee pay.

The study also takes into account a phased-in slightly lower assumed return on investment for the retirement plan. State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, vice chair of the Retirement Committee, said normally contributions would increase in that case. The actuaries agreed this could increase risk to the retirement plan.
However, Ballard and Clements noted that one built-in fail-safe is increased contributions if the funding status of the retirement plan lowers.
The actuaries predicted the probability that the retirement plan would be fully funded about 56.4% of the time over the next 20 years, while it could be less than 96% funded about 31.5% of the time.
‘This is their livelihood’
Ballard, who introduced LB 645 more than 50 legislative days ago, said he appreciated the feedback that he received from teachers, administrators, school boards, the Governor’s Office and more, all of which he said are now on board.
Conrad clashed with Ballard at LB 645’s public hearing in March in part over the bill’s negotiations. She could not immediately be reached for comment Monday on the advanced bill, nor could the NSEA.
Ballard said he took the feedback of teachers and other employees with “high consideration.”

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will remove gender dysphoria from disabilities protected under federal law, but it’s still unclear whether 17 Republican state attorneys general will continue a related lawsuit that could dismantle federal protections for all people with disabilities.
Last fall, Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the federal government over the Biden administration’s addition of a gender identity-related disorder to the disabilities protected under a portion of federal law known as Section 504.
Republican attorneys general from 16 other states joined the lawsuit: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.

But they  faced a swift backlash earlier this year. Disability advocates pointed to parts of their lawsuit that asked the court to find all of Section 504 unconstitutional, not just the update that included gender dysphoria.
If the court agrees, advocates fear that schools, workplaces, hospitals and other entities could refuse to provide disability accommodations they’ve been required to provide for the past 50 years.

AGs hurried to distance themselves. Arkansas Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin, Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and others adamantly denied that interpretation and said their only goal was to remove protections for people with gender dysphoria.
The new HHS ruling seems to achieve what the AGs said they wanted. It essentially declares that the Biden update adding gender dysphoria to disability law can’t be enforced.
But the broad language of the lawsuit leaves open the possibility, some experts say, for the court to strike down the entirety of Section 504 protections.
The state AGs’ position should become clearer in a few days. They’re scheduled to file an update with the court on April 21.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers in the Maine Legislature are trying to restrict the governor’s emergency powers. 
Republicans proposed limiting the governor’s ability to convene the Legislature, in response to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills calling lawmakers into a special session after the Democratic majority made the decision to quickly pass a two-year majority budget that failed to secure two-thirds support. 
Crucial to that plan was the understanding that the Legislature would adjourn, in order to start the clock to release the funding, and immediately get called back by the governor to attend to the remainder of legislative business. 
In addition to the Republican proposal, a Democratic lawmaker has suggested an alternative way to reign in executive reach by requiring legislators to be consulted in emergency decisions. 
When the lawmakers presented their plans to the State and Local Government Committee on Monday, no one from the public testified for nor against. 
Republican proposal
Rep. Joshua Morris (R-Turner) and eight Republican co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor and Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Smith of Palermo, proposed amending the state constitution so that if the Legislature adjourns “sine die”, or finally, the governor can’t reconvene the body for 90 days.
Because it proposes a constitutional amendment, LD 1331 has to be passed by two-thirds of the Legislature and then ultimately be decided by Maine voters through a ballot referendum question.
“I will not attempt to hide the true motivation behind my proposal,” Morris told the committee. “The last three sessions have seen a majority budget passed at the end of March with a sine die adjournment, only to see the Legislature called back immediately.”
The two-year budget was ‘not the last word.’ Here’s what comes next.

The Maine Constitution establishes an adjournment date for the Legislature for both the first and second regular sessions. The end date for the first regular session of the current 132nd Legislature had been June 18 but the body adjourned just after midnight on March 21 before Mills called a special session. There is no statutory limit on the length of a special session.
“The constitution states that the governor may call us back on ‘extraordinary occasions,’ not just to finish the work we haven’t gotten to yet,” Morris said. “For example, calling the Legislature back so we can commemorate official reptiles and amphibians is hardly an extraordinary occasion that can’t wait until the second regular session.”
Several of Morris’ Republican colleagues made similar remarks at the time of those specific votes after the Legislature began its special session on March 25.
Rep. William Tuell of East Machias said on the House floor ahead of the vote one state amphibian that the body should instead be dealing with matters he views as in line with “extraordinary occasions,” such as high property taxes. The Legislature is considering a number of bills on property taxes carried over into the special session.
During the hearing on Monday, lawmakers discussed the possibility of more specifically defining what constitutes an “extraordinary occasion” through LD 1331.
Morris also argued his bill would require more bipartisan consensus on a budget or other laws in order to get them passed in a timely manner without deploying the special session maneuver, as it takes 90 days for bills to take effect if they don’t secure the two-thirds support needed to pass as an emergency. 
Members of the minority party have been vocal about their opposition to the current special session. 
Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) has continuously called the session “illegal” and questioned what extraordinary circumstances warranted it in speeches on the House floor and in meetings of the Taxation Committee.
Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford) is also leading an effort for a people’s veto of the two-year budget. The referendum needs at least 67,682 signatures from Maine voters by June 18 to put the budget, the funding for which is set to become available at the end of June, on hold until the November election or an earlier statewide special election. 
Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows released the proposed wording for the question last week, which Drinkwater has said he’s disappointed with. 
The proposed question reads: “Do you want to stop most state government operations and programs, including new and ongoing state funding for cities, towns, and schools, by rejecting the state’s two-year budget?”
This is not the first time lawmakers have objected to how the governor has exercised emergency power.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mills adjourned the Legislature, prompting lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to call for her to bring the body back, though Republicans wanted to only address pandemic-related issues during the special session while Democrats wanted to address other unfinished business, as well. 
The Legislature can call itself into a special session without an action by the governor if the majority of the members in each party consent, which could not be achieved in that case. 
Democratic proposal 
Executive emergency power is not vested in the governor by the constitution. Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) told the committee that the Legislature, therefore, has and should assert its authority to be more involved in emergency decisions.
“This bill isn’t about the present chief executive, nor is it about any former or future chief executive,” Lee said. “This bill is about this branch of government, the primary policymaking branch of government, the one closest to Maine citizens, modestly reasserting its role in participating in governance of the state in the event of an emergency.”
LD 1524 would require the governor to consult directly with the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected leaders of legislative leadership, when acting on emergency powers. 
It would also require the executive’s actions to be narrowly tailored to address the specific public health or safety emergency for which the emergency was declared and require court action if the governor’s actions don’t adhere to that standard. 
Specifically, it would provide the Maine Superior Court jurisdiction to issue temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions against executive actions, and in the event one is granted, it gives an expedited appeal to the governor to challenge the injunction to the law court. 
Another way the governor would be required to loop in the Legislative Council would be through a weekly, written briefing detailing all actions taken pursuant to emergency powers and how and whether those actions have helped abate the emergency. 
Lastly, the bill would require three-fifths of the Legislature — 91 representatives and 21 senators — to extend an emergency beyond 30 days.
“While I can understand that in emergency circumstances it is more efficient for a single person advised by talented and intelligent but nevertheless unelected individuals to make decisions for the people,” Lee said, “that efficiency comes at the expense of having these decisions made by the individuals closest to the people.”

Delaware insurance regulators have fined Liberty Mutual $300,000 following an investigation that revealed tens of thousands of misleading advertisements promising discounts that weren’t actually available to state residents.
The Delaware Department of Insurance announced the penalty after a months-long examination of three Liberty Mutual member companies: Liberty Insurance Corporation, Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, and LM Insurance Corporation.
In addition to the $300,000 fine, the companies face a conditional penalty of $200,000 if the misleading practices are not immediately corrected.
The investigation uncovered 39,806 instances of false or deceptive advertising between January 1, 2021, and July 31, 2023.

Most notably, Liberty Mutual advertised “claims-free” discounts on homeowners insurance declaration pages—despite not offering that discount in Delaware.
Similarly, the company promoted auto insurance discounts for vehicles equipped with advanced safety features like adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning systems, though those discounts were not available on any Delaware policies.
“When shopping for insurance coverage, Delawareans already have so much to think about, especially in this economy. Our team is dedicated to uncovering misleading advertising and other misrepresentations that could lead to consumers choosing the wrong coverage for their needs, or their wallets,” said Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro. “We have seen this problem before, and we are committed to ensuring it is corrected.”
The three Liberty Mutual companies currently write more than $59.7 million in insurance premiums in Delaware.
This is not the first time the insurer has faced scrutiny over similar practices. A prior investigation into related Liberty Mutual entities found nearly 35,000 instances of misinformation between 2018 and 2021. At the time, those companies were fined $150,000 each, but continued noncompliance triggered the most recent examination.

Teresa Marie Johnson, 53, of Manilla, who is a state-licensed paramedic, is charged with the felony of unlawfully obtaining a controlled substance through fraud or deceit while working as a licensed paramedic in February 2025.
She also faces five separate counts of misdemeanor prohibited acts related to unlawful possession of drugs. She has yet to enter a plea in the case and is scheduled to be arraigned April 21, 2025.
Police records indicate the alleged thefts occurred while Johnson was working for the Carroll County Ambulance Service.
Separately, the Iowa Bureau of Emergency and Medical Trauma Services has issued an emergency order suspending Johnson’s license as a paramedic. The board alleges her “continued practice of emergency medical services constitutes an immediate danger to the public health, safety, and welfare.”
According to the board, Johnson removed 25 micrograms of fentanyl from each of three different vials and replaced the missing opioid painkiller with normal saline.
In addition, Johnson is also accused of stealing one full vial of fentanyl. All of the vials of fentanyl were located in an ambulance which she helped staff, the board alleges.
In its suspension order, the board claims Johnson admitted gluing the caps back on the vials after the alleged theft.

Bill Lee): The tornado that tore through McNairy County in West Tennessee early this month caused an estimated $30.3 million in damage, according to the county’s emergency management agency.
An EF-3 tornado with a 43-mile storm track swept through the county early April 3, killing five people. Wind speeds reached up to 160 miles per hour.
The storm hit Selmer, the county’s largest city and county seat, home to about 4,500 people. Those killed include three Selmer residents on New Bethel Road, one McNairy County resident on New Bethel Road and one McNairy County resident on Friendship Road, according to the Selmer Police Department.
Residents and business owners bore the brunt of property damage, with preliminary assessments totaling $27.6 million, the McNairy County Emergency Management Agency reported Friday.
Flooding caused by the storm system also damaged roads across the county. The local government response and the cost of damage to public property, roads, utilities, and government facilities totals around $2.7 million.
Of the 332 structures impacted by the storm, 108 were destroyed and 70 sustained major damage, McNairy County EMA reported on April 5.
The preliminary damage assessments will be sent to FEMA, the first step in determining whether McNairy County is eligible for federal assistance with disaster recovery. The Small Business Administration also assessed the damage to determine if the county is eligible for low-interest disaster loans.
A disaster declaration is needed for the county to receive federal aid.
Damage assessments are ongoing.
Tennessee has been under a federal Emergency Declaration since April 2, as severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding slammed West and Middle Tennessee. 
Under the declaration, FEMA can provide equipment and resources to support emergency response, and direct federal assistance under the public assistance program will be provided at 75% federal funding, according to the agency.

(Photo by Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty Images)Mothers in Alaska’s northern and western regions are more likely than other Alaska mothers to give birth to preterm and underweight babies, and their travel from rural Alaska to get care in bigger communities is a factor that contributes to those outcomes, a new study has found.
The study, by researchers at the University of Alaska Anchorage, analyzes the more than 218,000 childbirths recorded in the state from 2000 to 2020. It revealed striking geographic disparities in the rates of preterm and very preterm births, defined respectively as births before 37 and 32 weeks’ gestation, as well as the cases of low birth weight.
Preterm births are associated with numerous health problems, including breathing and heart problems, long-term complications like cerebral palsy and higher rates of sudden infant death syndrome, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The factors that are associated with adverse childbirth impacts are numerous, the UAA study found. They include tobacco use during pregnancy, mothers’ pre-pregnancy diabetes or hypertension, mothers’ ages and a lack of adequate prenatal care.
For many women, the factors associated with adverse impacts are cumulative, said study co-author Micah Hahn, an epidemiologist at UAA’s Institute of Circumpolar Health.
“It’s kind of like a constellation of things that contribute to preterm birth,” Hahn said.  
One important factor for Alaska newborns is their mothers’ need to leave home, the study found.
Nearly 40% of babies born during the two-decade period had mothers who traveled outside of their home communities for childbirth, the study found. That travel is itself a stressor, the study said.
Routine prenatal care for rural Alaska women can also require travel, making such care more difficult to obtain prior to childbirth.
For rural Alaska women, where communities are predominantly Alaska Native, “it takes so much more effort to go to prenatal care,” Hahn said.
Beyond the travel itself, which can be expensive, the women need child care and supportive partners, family members or friends to take on various duties, she said. Those women need extra time as well, she added. In contrast to her experience as an expectant mother in Anchorage, driving a couple of miles to her doctor’s office, women flying in from rural Alaska can take two or three days to get their appointments, she said.
Often, the factors associated with adverse birth outcomes overlap, the study found.
Rural women with more high-risk pregnancies may be directed to travel to cities or hub communities to give birth, while women with low-risk pregnancies may be able to stay home. But travel and the prolonged stays in settings that might be unfamiliar add complications to pregnancies that already may be of higher risk, it said.
“If a mother travels to a service hub for prenatal care or delivery, they will incur costs for flights, accommodation, food, and missed work, which may not be covered by insurance,” the study said “They may need to have difficult conversations about whether their partner will travel with them or stay at home to work and care for other children. These stressors are compounded by a lack of social support and living in an unfamiliar place.”
Improvements, policy ideas and further study
There is good news revealed in the study.
Rates of prenatal care for Alaska Native women have increased in recent years, the study found. By 2020, about 40% of pregnant Native women get at least 11 prenatal visits, a substantial increase from the 2005-2010 period, the study found. In comparison, more than half of pregnant white women had at least 11 prenatal visits in 2020.
“You can see that one good news story is that in Alaska we are closing the gap on prenatal care utilization by race,” Hahn said.
And while babies born to mothers from northern and Western Alaska are more likely to have adverse outcomes than the state average, the rates for those rural women are not worse than the national rate, she pointed out.
About 1 in 10 babies in the United States are born preterm, the study notes. That is about the same as the rates the study found for babies born to northern and Western Alaska women.
Hahn said the study can guide health policies in the state to help women and their babies.
Tobacco-cessation programs can be useful, she said. So could anything that reduces pregnant women’s need for travel or makes travel, when it is necessary, easier and more comfortable.
Telehealth could be used for some prenatal care for rural women, though certain visits would still have to be conducted in person, Hahn said.
A bill pending in the Alaska Legislature, Senate Bill 83, is aimed at making telehealth more available. It would require that insurers fully reimburse health providers for telehealth services.
Other ways to reduce risks of adverse birth outcomes involve holistic approaches that consider rural and Alaska Native needs and cultures, Hahn said.
One organization that has been helpful to that end, she said, is the Alaska Native Birthworkers Community, a network of Indigenous midwives, doulas, breastfeeding consultants and other health experts. The community provides prenatal and postpartum support and education.
Not considered in this new study are environmental factors that may affect birth outcomes.
Those will be addressed in a different study by Hahn and her research partners that is expected to be published later in the year. They are examining the impacts of wildfire smoke on childbirth outcomes.
Wildfire smoke is a well-known health hazard. It has already been shown to increase risks of preterm birth elsewhere, in California and Brazil, for example.
In Alaska, climate change is causing wildfire seasons to become longer and more intense, and wildfire smoke problems in Alaska communities have increased over time, according to University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers.
In Fairbanks, for example, smoke-free summers were common prior to 2000, but those have occurred only twice since then, according to a new report led by UAF’s Alaska Fire Science Consortium. According to the report, titled Alaska’s Changing Wildfire Environment 2.0, Fairbanks for the first time had three consecutive summers, from 2022 to 2024, with at least 100 hours of smoke that was thick enough to degrade air quality.
Hahn said wildfire smoke is not just a Fairbanks or Interior Alaska problem. “Even if that’s where the wildfires are, smoke is affecting most of Alaska during the really bad years,” she said.

Facing a historic funding crisis, SEPTA unveiled a proposed budget Wednesday that would slash nearly half of its service, raise fares, and cut staff. If implemented, the Wilmington/Newark Line would be shut down, along with other major rail services.
The proposal, driven by a looming $213 million deficit for the upcoming fiscal year starting July 1, includes a 45% reduction in service. 
Due to these proposed cuts, the Broad-Ridge Spur would be shut down entirely, along with five Regional Rail lines: the Cynwyd Line, Chestnut Hill West Line, Paoli/Thorndale Line, Trenton Line, and the Wilmington/Newark Line.
“These cuts to SEPTA’s service – which would hurt our economy and make it harder for hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians to get to work, school, and wherever else they need to go – are completely avoidable,” said Governor Josh Shapiro, who has introduced a statewide transit funding plan now stalled in the state Senate. 
“For two years in a row, I have proposed a commonsense plan to support mass transit all across the Commonwealth and last December, I flexed funding to give the legislature more time to come to the table. The state House has passed my proposal three times and plans to do so again next month – it is now squarely on the state Senate to come to the table and pass more funding for mass transit that their own constituents rely on.” 
“SEPTA would go from being the economic driver of this city and region to its limiter,” said SEPTA Board Chair Kenneth E. Lawrence Jr.
“We are grateful for Governor Shapiro’s proposal and for the continued efforts of legislators from our city and region. Now, we all need to hear from the public. Even if you don’t ride, deep service cuts would impact you – whether it is from increased congestion on area roadways, declining property values or less revenue for local businesses as SEPTA purchases significantly fewer supplies and materials.”

SEPTA, like many public transit systems nationwide, has struggled to stabilize after pandemic-era federal relief funding expired. Despite efforts to tighten its belt – including management pay freezes, third-party contract cuts, and a resumed Regional Rail parking fee – the agency still faces mounting pressure from rising costs, inflation, and safety concerns.
“We know how critical service is to our customers and the region, and we have done everything possible to avoid the drastic measures that are proposed in this budget,” said Interim General Manager Scott A. Sauer. “
We have made significant progress in cutting costs, growing ridership, improving reliability and delivering on safety and security enhancements. All of that is at risk if we are forced to start dismantling the system.”
Governor Shapiro temporarily rescued SEPTA last fall by redirecting federal highway funds to close the current year’s gap, but that one-time fix won’t be available again. By law, SEPTA must approve a balanced budget by July 1, and with no legislative relief yet in sight, officials say painful cuts are inevitable.
In addition to its Operating Budget, SEPTA also released its Capital Budget proposal, which outlines delays and deferrals for dozens of infrastructure projects due to limited funding and inflation, including station accessibility upgrades and long-promised improvements.
Public hearings for both budget proposals will take place at SEPTA Headquarters on May 19 and 20 for the Operating Budget, and May 21 for the Capital Budget. 
The SEPTA Board is expected to vote on the final budgets on June 26.

The governor has advocated for states to receive block grants to operate all aspects of emergency preparation and response over getting assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Trump has canceled environmental justice grants. Here’s what communities are losing.

“We’ve got a big surplus. We would have to make adjustments to how we approach things, but I can do that, you know,” DeSantis said of the possibility of the Trump administration cutting disaster assistance. “Just let me know what’s in the best interest of the United States and, if it is, then Florida will respond very, very appropriately, but that would obviously require us to change a little bit about what we’re doing.”
However, he emphasized that he doesn’t anticipate Trump would eliminate FEMA without the federal government giving grants to the states. The governor’s comments came after the Trump administration cut nearly $300 million for flooding and hurricane relief projects across the state, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell of Tampa called out the funding cuts during a press conference Monday morning.
“It really breaks my heart that these funds are being cut, because our area was completely devastated by the hurricanes that we saw last fall,” she said. “I know there are other areas of the state that were impacted, and in a time where we are experiencing stronger and stronger hurricanes and stronger natural disasters, it’s not the time to cut FEMA funding, not when our state needs it the most.”
FEMA last year approved more than $1 billion in individual assistance to Floridians following the destruction from Hurricanes Milton, Helene, and Debby. The next hurricane season starts on June 1.

Recent federal government budget and staffing cuts imposed by the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency are having devastating impacts in dozens of areas, but one that’s received less attention than it probably deserves is agriculture. As journalist Kevin Hardy of the national news outlet Stateline reported recently, the administration has yanked funding for programs that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms.
Originally funded under the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s local food programs aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers and small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination, while channeling fresh food and produce to schools and food banks. Now the programs are gone and as Hardy told NC Newsline when we caught up with him earlier this week, the damage being inflicted is widespread and deep.

The Edmond Board of Education voted unanimously Monday morning to hire Josh Delich as the next chief executive to lead the district of 25,700 students. On July 1, he will succeed Angela Mills Grunewald, who is soon retiring after four years as superintendent. 
“When you drive around here, you can see the greatness that’s happening here, and I want to be a part of that excellence and continue that,” Delich told reporters after the school board meeting.

The board also voted to contract with Delich on a “daily rate basis” as he visits and consults with the administration as the incoming superintendent. He formally takes office on July 1, but he will begin preparing for the transition right away by traveling back and forth from Minnesota, he said.
Edmond schools didn’t immediately provide details of his contract and salary. Grunewald earns a base salary of $220,000 and $26,700 in additional benefits and compensation.
Delich is an associate superintendent for high schools at the largest district in Minnesota, Anoka-Hennepin Schools north of Minneapolis. The Minnesota district of 38,000 students is known, like Edmond, for academic performance above the state average.
Edmond Board President Courtney Hobgood said Delich delivers not only experience but a “strong heart” for education.
“He brings passion for continuing the forward progress in Edmond and building on our history of success,” Hobgood said after the meeting.

Delich said he will bring “external ideas” to Edmond, Oklahoma’s fourth largest district, but first wants to “listen, learn (and) lead to better understand what’s going on before I start infusing some of the ideas or experiences I have into the system.”
He said he intends to examine ways to improve four key areas: student achievement and outcomes, staff and teacher performance, operational efficiency and effectiveness, and relations with the Edmond community.
Delich said he also hopes to connect with Edmond’s state lawmakers and state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
The relationship between Edmond district leaders and Walters at times has been strained. The district sued the Oklahoma State Department of Education after Walters’ administration tried to order the removal of “The Kite Runner” and “The Glass Castle” from Edmond’s high school libraries.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in Edmond’s favor, deciding local school officials rather than the state decide what books to keep on school library shelves.
“I look forward to meeting Ryan Walters and spending some time, get to know the individual, get to know him, also for him to get to know me and then figure out where to where can we align and where can we best keep moving things forward,” Delich said. “Because I know that if you’re in the world of education, it’s about students and how do we develop and create great opportunities for students.”
Born in Bogotá, Colombia, Delich was adopted and raised in Minnesota. He has 21 years of experience as an educator in his home state and in Texas. He attended Concordia University, St. Paul and then the University of Texas at Arlington for his master’s degree in education. He earned a Ph.D. from the University of North Texas.
Before joining Anoka-Hennepin Schools, Delich was an assistant superintendent at St. Paul Public Schools, the second-largest district in Minnesota.
His wife, Desirae, and their three daughters will relocate with him to Edmond.
Delich said he and his wife had visited Oklahoma before and “could see ourselves someday being here.”
“The amount of welcoming, the genuine sense of belonging that one can get when they get here to Oklahoma is amazing,” he said. “This is a gem of a state.”

Shapiro and his family. It is being investigated as arson. (Photo Ian Karbal/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The smell of fire was still strong on the side lawn of the governor’s residence around 5:00 pm on Sunday, hours after an arson attack on the governor’s residence in Harrisburg.
As Governor Josh Shapiro held a press conference to announce an arrest in the incident, he stood in front of a large reception room that had been set up for a Passover Seder. It was blackened and charred. The wreckage could be seen though busted windows and doors.
It was almost unrecognizable from the night before when the governor, who is Jewish, held a Seder for family and friends to mark the first night of the Passover holiday. A photo of the preparation posted to his Facebook page on Saturday showed a Seder plate on a gold table cloth, an open bottle of wine and copies of the Haggadah, a Jewish text about the Hebrews’ exodus from Egypt brought out every year for the holiday.
Hours after the Seder ended, Shapiro said he and his family were woken up by a member of his security detail banging on his door. The state trooper said they had to evacuate immediately. Someone had broken into the residence, set the reception room ablaze with a homemade incendiary device, and was able to get out before being apprehended. According to State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens, the attack appeared planned and methodical.
Shapiro, his wife and children, their two dogs and another family that was staying with them were all evacuated safely. The fire was extinguished.
So far, no motive has been determined, and it’s unclear if the attack was at all related to the holiday or Shapiro’s Jewish heritage, though a suspect, 38-year-old Cody Balmer, is in custody.
Speaking to the press from a podium on the lawn, Shapiro was visibly emotional. He said the event traumatized his family and the governor’s residence staff.
“If this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday,” Shapiro said. “If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community who joined us for a Passover Seder in that room last night, hear me on this: We celebrated our faith last night proudly, and in a few hours we will celebrate our second Seder of Passover.”
“We’ll clean this up, we’ll get it repaired, we’ll get it rebuilt, we’ll get rid of that smell of fire and smoke, and we’ll be back very soon,” Shapiro added. “We’ll be back to welcome the community into this residence.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-14 15:08:52+00:00,CT Mirror,A Maine pole vaulter cleared the bar to win the state title. Waiting below was Donald Trump.,Kalyn Belsha | Chalkbeat,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/14/maine-pole-vaulter-trans-athletes/,"After a trans athlete in Maine won a state title, the Trump administration moved to withhold the state's K-12 funding.","This story was  originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters
The winning pole vault at Maine’s Class B girls’ track and field championship in February missed the state record by 7 inches. But it was high enough to catapult Maine to the top of President Donald Trump’s enemies list.
Two weeks before that competition, Trump had signed an executive order aimed at “keeping men out of women’s sports.” The order threatened to withhold federal funding from any school that allowed athletes assigned male at birth to participate in girls’ or women’s sports.
The pole vaulter who clinched the girls’ state title was a trans athlete from a school district of 1,850 in the suburbs of Portland on Maine’s southern coast.
That same day, a Republican state legislator shared the 10th grader’s picture on Facebook, later calling it “unfair, unsafe, and unacceptable” that she had been allowed to compete. Conservative news outlets boosted the story.
The issue came to a head a few days later at a White House governors luncheon, where Trump told Maine Gov. Janet Mills that she better comply with his executive order or Maine wouldn’t get any federal funding. “See you in court,” Mills replied curtly.
That viral exchange set off a battle over not just who is protected by Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in education, but how far the president can take his aggressive and unusual approach to civil rights enforcement to reshape American education.
The Trump administration launched two overlapping civil rights investigations that rapidly determined Maine had violated Title IX. Maine officials say they are complying with their state’s human rights law, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, and don’t plan to back down. Now the Trump administration is taking Maine to court and moving to strip the state of its K-12 education funding — an unprecedented step.
That move could instill fear in states and schools that have policies similar to Maine’s. Educators and officials could now be wondering if they’ll be the focus of such an investigation themselves, and whether they’re ready to risk hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to hold onto those rules and beliefs.
What’s happening in Maine comes as the Trump administration wages war with numerous colleges and several state K-12 leaders over antisemitism on campus and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, respectively.
Federal officials are conducting at least 18 other investigations into school districts, state education agencies, and state athletics associations over policies involving transgender students, according to a tracker compiled by Education Week. There’s now a Title IX special investigations team tasked with wrapping up investigations quickly and preparing them for litigation.
Those backing the Trump administration’s actions say the president’s position — far from being radical — is supported by the law, common sense, and the general public.
Teresa Manning, the policy director at the National Association of Scholars, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative education policies, said the phrase “on the basis of sex” in Title IX should be interpreted by its “plain meaning” that there are two sexes, male and female, and those don’t change.
“What the Trump administration is doing is simply maintaining the status quo of how Title IX has been interpreted for 50 years,” Manning said. “It’s not like the executive orders are anything new.”
Seth Galanter, who served in the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights during the Biden and Obama administrations, said a big reason the Maine case matters is how it will “affect trans athletes and their lives, and their ability to participate in sports.”
But he also believes the outcome of the dispute matters for all kinds of students.
“This is really an administration that is trying to bully people and schools to do what they want by discarding all the protections and norms that usually accompany a civil rights investigation,” said Galanter, who worked in the Education Department until January. “If they can do that successfully around trans kids, then they can do it around kids with disabilities, or English learner kids, or other kids who really need federal protection.”
Why trans girls playing sports is key issue for Trump
Trump made the participation of trans athletes on girls’ and women’s sports teams a signature issue of his presidential campaign. He and his supporters have said that athletes who were assigned male at birth have an unfair physical advantage over their competitors whose birth sex was female.
When trans girls medal in sporting competitions, they say, it takes honors away from cisgender girls and could reduce their shot at a college scholarship. Some cisgender girls feel uncomfortable undressing in front of trans girls in the locker room.
“A sport I had loved and had put my heart into became a sport that was painful and a constant reminder of the physical abilities that I do not have,” the Maine 12th grader who tied for second place in the girls’ pole vault championship wrote in an opinion piece for the Portland Press Herald. “How were we expected to compete with someone who would always physically dominate?”
Advocates for trans athletes, meanwhile, say it’s crucial for kids to be able to play on teams that correspond with their gender identity so they feel included at school. Trans kids are at a much higher risk for depression and suicide, and playing sports can help with self-esteem and mental health.
“Leadership, teamwork, being a good loser and a good winner — all those great benefits that sports provide, which is why sports are an important part of your education — that needs to be available to all of our students, including our transgender students,” said Sarah McDaniel, who has a trans son and is the president of the Portland chapter of PFLAG, which supports the families and friends of LGBTQ people.
Trump’s executive order focused on student athletics wasn’t his only directive focused on gender. On the first day of his second term, he also signed an executive order stating that the federal government would recognize only two sexes, male and female, and that the definition of “sex” under federal law did not include gender identity.
That helped form the policy backbone for his early February directive about trans athletes.
In addition to its threat to strip federal funds from any educational program with policies deemed “unfair to female athletes”, the executive order expressed the Trump administration’s opposition to “male competitive participation in women’s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.”
That executive order also urged athletics organizations and states to change policies that allow trans girls to compete in women’s sports, even if they “reduce the testosterone in their bodies below certain levels or provide documentation of ‘sincerely held’ gender identity.”
Manning said the Trump administration’s swift approach to enforcing Title IX matches the issue’s urgency: “The threat to these women is happening right now. It is, right now, a violation of Title IX.”
It’s also a “political no-brainer,” Manning said, pointing to polling from January by the New York Times and Ipsos that found 79% of American adults do not think trans women should be allowed to compete on women’s sports teams. That finding mirrors other recent polls.
Trump administration takes unusual civil rights approach
The federal government’s treatment of Maine is unprecedented, multiple legal experts told Chalkbeat, from the way it carried out its investigations to the severity of the consequences it has imposed.
The Education Department has a backlog of civil rights cases and recently fired hundreds of civil rights attorneys. But it chose to open the Maine investigation unprompted by any complaints.
While any agency that gives federal funds to an educational institution can enforce Title IX, the Education Department typically leads the charge because it has the most expertise. But in this case, the Department of Health and Human Services, which usually investigates medical schools and hospital training programs, opened the first investigation, followed by the Education Department.
Both decided Maine had violated Title IX within a few weeks — though these kinds of investigations typically take many months to conclude.
Neither federal agency requested any data or documents or attempted to interview anyone from the Maine Department of Education before issuing their findings, said Danna Hayes, a spokesperson for the Maine attorney general’s office, which is representing the state’s education agency.
The Education Department’s draft agreement contained five pages of demands, including stripping any trans girl who’s ever placed in a Maine girls sports competition of her title and giving it to the athlete behind her with an apology letter. Maine should have received 90 days to consider that proposal, according to the agency’s manual. Maine got just 10.
There’s a clear process for investigating potential civil rights violations, said R. Shep Melnick, a professor of American politics at Boston College who’s studied Title IX and civil rights. The Trump administration has “done none of that.”
“I’ve been critical of OCR in the past under Biden and Obama for using investigations basically to get schools to do what they want without following these procedures, but this is far worse,” Melnick said.
The Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies targeted Maine, too.
Neither the Education Department nor the Agriculture Department responded to Chalkbeat’s questions regarding the Trump administration’s Title IX enforcement strategy and its probes in Maine.
In response to a list of questions, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, directed Chalkbeat to a two-sentence social media post from March 28 in which the department said it had referred its Maine Title IX investigation to the Justice Department. “HHS will continue to protect women’s sports and keep the promises of Title IX,” the post states.
Who gets to define ‘sex’?
Many biologists now think sex is more complicated than the male and female binary. But Title IX is “completely silent” on the issue of transgender athletes and does not spell out whether schools should require trans athletes to play on teams that correspond with their birth sex or their gender identity, Melnick said.
Congress could pass a law to define sex under Title IX. Or the Trump administration could go through the lengthy formal rule-making process. The Biden administration tried to define sex to include gender identity in a rule, but a federal judge threw it out. A separate Biden administration proposal that ultimately could have allowed high schools and colleges to restrict the participation of trans athletes never made it across the finish line.
The Trump administration has said Title IX “forbids” trans girls from playing on girls’ and women’s sports teams, and allowing them to do so is an outright violation of the law.
But multiple civil rights experts told Chalkbeat that’s not how Title IX is enforced under the 1979 policy interpretation that governs the Education Department’s civil rights investigations.
It’s a Title IX violation if girls lack equal access to athletics in the aggregate. For example, an investigator concerned about whether girls had the same access to athletic gear as boys would look at the equipment used by all teams, not just the tennis team.
“Identical benefits, opportunities, or treatment are not required, provided the overall effects of any differences is negligible,” the 1979 policy states.
On top of that, there are federal court rulings in two cases, one in the Ninth Circuit and another in the Fourth Circuit, that have upheld the rights of trans girls to play on teams that correspond with their gender identity.
Those cases are ongoing. But the Trump administration hasn’t said why the 14 states bound by those decisions should not follow them, Galanter said.
“It’s just completely unclear what their legal theory is here,” Galanter said.
Issue of trans athletes continues to divide Maine
On Friday, the Maine attorney general’s office told the Trump administration that the state wouldn’t agree to the Education Department’s Title IX resolution. Maine offered no counter-proposals.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” Maine’s assistant attorney general, Sarah Forster, wrote.
In response, the Education Department said it had referred the case to the Justice Department and would start the administrative process to take away Maine’s K-12 education funding. That includes discretionary grants and formula funds, the department said, which covers Title I dollars for high-poverty schools and IDEA grants for children with disabilities.
“Governor Mills would have done well to adhere to the wisdom embedded in the old idiom — be careful what you wish for,” Craig Trainor, the Education Department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said Friday in a statement. “Now she will see the Trump Administration in court.”
Hayes, of the Maine attorney general’s office, declined to comment further, and the Education Department did not respond to follow-up questions from Chalkbeat.
Galanter worried a Justice Department lawsuit against Maine could make even school districts and states with gender-affirming athletics policies “really scared to have trans kids play sports, or even worse, have kids who people think are trans play on sports teams.”
“There is no way to enforce gender that isn’t gross, weird, a complete invasion of privacy,” said Bre Danvers-Kidman, the executive co-director of MaineTransNet, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of transgender people in Maine. Kids think: “I don’t want to have to show somebody my junk to play softball.”
The issue continues to divide people in Maine.
Republican state lawmakers introduced several bills to restrict the participation of trans athletes on sports teams. Mills, Maine’s Democratic governor, said the issue is “worthy of a debate” but that for now, she will defend the state’s current laws.
Hundreds of people recently turned out to a rally to support trans youth outside Greely High School, where the winning pole vaulter is a student, including several of her classmates.
Maine School Administrative District 51, which includes Greely, did not sign a resolution agreement with HHS, but the school district responded to the Education Department’s probe.
The district had less than two weeks to reply to dozens of requests, said Melissa Hewey, the attorney representing the district, including for rosters of every girls sports team and any trans athletes playing on them, and a breakdown of how the district’s fields and equipment compare for boys and girls.
Maine has a long tradition of standing up for what it believes in, “even in the face of political pressures,” said Danvers-Kidman, who’s listened to how angry this situation has made trans kids in meetings across the state.
For their sake, Danvers-Kidman hopes Maine stands its ground.

Some of the first signs Teitelbaum had ALS appeared during a vacation to Mexico in 2022. She and her husband, Steven, had taken their grandsons on a trip to Cancun when they noticed Marilyn’s foot was dragging, an early sign of her impending nerve degeneration.
The average patient dies within a few years of diagnosis. What starts as muscle weakness advances to total incapacitation.
“Marilyn didn’t want to do that or have the family experience it, so the day that she was diagnosed, she said to the physician that she is not going to go to the end with this,” said Steven Teitelbaum, who has worked as a medical researcher and professor at Washington University in St. Louis for more than 50 years.
Rather than live out the fatal disease, which leads to permanent paralysis, Teitelbaum took another trip, this time to Colorado — one of 10 states, plus Washington, D.C., where physician-assisted dying is legal. Under the laws, physicians can prescribe life-ending medication to terminally ill patients who request it.
Before establishing residency in Colorado, the couple rented an ocean-front house in Hawaii for a week, and the family flew out to join. The grandsons took surfing lessons and played soccer. They took a helicopter tour. They had parties and events where Marilyn gave away her jewelry.
“She was very gracious,” Teitelbaum said. “There was no weeping or feeling sorry for herself or anything like that. It was: How much can I enjoy my family, and particularly my grandchildren and children?”
In Colorado, where she had family, the couple hosted celebrations. A nephew who plays the trumpet brought his band to play for her.
But by the time she took the lethal medication nine months after her diagnosis, Marilyn Teitelbaum’s disease had advanced rapidly. Quickly losing muscle function and no longer able to stand on her own, she chose to take the medication two weeks ahead of schedule.
“It’s a gracious way to go, actually. And when Marilyn did die, she could die with grace,” Teitelbaum said. On Jan. 26, 2023, she woke up and had breakfast. About a half dozen of her closest relatives gathered around her. A nephew played the guitar. “And it was just going to sleep,” her husband said.
Missouri is one of at least 25 states this year where lawmakers are considering legislation related to physician-assisted dying, a practice controversial enough that there’s debate over what to call it. Proponents prefer “medical aid in dying,” while opponents insist “physician-assisted suicide” is more forthright.
The American Medical Association takes a stance against physician-assisted suicide as “fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer,” difficult or impossible to control, and posing serious societal risks, the group’s website said.
A 2024 Gallup poll found 66% of Americans believe doctors should “be allowed by law to assist the patient to commit suicide” when a terminally ill patient in severe pain requests it.
New Mexico, the most recent state to legalize physician-assisted suicide, did so in 2021. Delaware’s Democratic governor vetoed a bill to legalize assisted dying in 2024, and in 2023, Republican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo similarly vetoed a legalization bill.
Lawmakers in 18 states are considering legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide. As in a number of other states, Missouri’s “Marilyn Teitelbaum Death with Dignity Act” has languished without a committee hearing.
“We were unable to secure a Republican sponsor for it,” said Rep. Ian Mackey, D-St. Louis, who introduced the bill this year and last. “Until we can do that, it’s not going to get any traction.”
 Momentum to legalize in New York, Illinois and Delaware

Strong political will exists in Illinois, Delaware and New York to move legislation legalizing assisted dying forward, said Elizabeth Armijo, national director of legislative advocacy at Compassion & Choices.
New York lawmakers are taking up the issue again for the 10th consecutive session. Two identical bills are in health committees in their respective chambers.
A 2024 YouGov poll found 64% of New Yorkers support passing the legislation, and another 8% are leaning toward supporting it. The bill is gaining sponsors in the state’s House and Senate quickly, with those in favor of the bill vying for Gov. Kathy Hochul’s support.
Between the two bills, 90 lawmakers have signed on as sponsors “and that number is continuing to grow,” said Corinne Carey of Compassion & Choices. “I am more hopeful than ever that this will be the year the legislature finally passes the bill.”
In the Illinois General Assembly, two bills are progressing, but face opposition from pro-life advocates and medical professionals.
“This can be an emotional issue, and many fallacies circle medical aid in dying,” said Illinois state Sen. Linda Holmes, who co-sponsored one of the measures, said during a Senate executive committee hearing. “I encourage those with misgivings to read the legislation in full to see its criteria and the safeguards that would protect patients, medical professionals, and relatives.”
Last year in Delaware, outgoing Gov. John Carney vetoed a bill to legalize the practice after it had passed the state’s Senate by one vote. A similar measure this year passed the Delaware House and a Senate committee, and now awaits approval from the full Senate.
“So many of these efforts get incredibly close, and then they’re disappointing. They’re so disappointing for our terminally ill advocates who don’t have the luxury of having one more session,” Armijo said. “They don’t have the luxury of waiting for another legislative session and so often they really die waiting.”
Bills introduced in states where the practice is legal would amend aspects of the law including waiting time or who qualifies to prescribe the medication. Opponents say the efforts remove safeguards while proponents argue these improve access.
Two bills — one in New Jersey and another in Washington — would, for qualifying patients, waive the wait period between the patient’s first and second required request for the medication.
Bills in Oregon and Vermont would allow certified licensed nurse practitioners and physician assistants, in addition to physicians, to prescribe the medication. A measure in California would remove the Jan. 1, 2031, sunset on the state’s law.
In Montana, a 2009 state Supreme Court ruling permitted the practice; a bill to codify its legality died in March. A competing measure that would make it illegal for doctors to prescribe the medications passed the state Senate but was defeated on the House floor April 9.
“This bill reinforces that life is valuable and should be protected,” said the bill’s sponsor, Montana state Sen. Carl Glimm, during a March 19 hearing in the House Judiciary Committee.
 Opponents fear second-tier medicine for terminally ill

As a pathologist, death is a common part of Steven Teitelbaum’s life. With physician-assisted dying, he said it’s crucial that no one making the decision is encouraged by others to do it.
“If that’s not dealt with, then the other side has a very compelling argument,” he said.
Assisted-dying laws in the United States follow the basic criteria of the initial Oregon legalization bill. Geoff Sugerman, who helped write Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act, echoed Teitelbaum’s concern.
“It’s something that always has to be driven by the patient. The patient is the one who really has to initiate that conversation,” said Sugerman, who now works as the national policy advisor for Death with Dignity, an advocacy group.
Jessica Rodgers grew up in Oregon, the first state to legalize assisted dying in 1997, when the debate over the issue began making headlines. Oregon doctors who supported the law publicly advocated for it. Rogers was 12 when her mother was given six months to live after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Her mother met the qualifications for assisted dying.
With her father working two jobs, Rodgers took care of her mother. She remembers one of the doctors in her mother’s oncology practice was an outspoken advocate for the bill that would become Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act.
“As her primary caregiver, it changed how I viewed her doctor’s appointments, because I felt as though I needed to protect her from her doctor, and I never wanted her to be alone with her doctor,” Rodgers said.
Her mother lived for three and a half years, long enough to hold her first grandchild, Rodgers said.
Now a social worker who specializes in gerontology, Rodgers has spent the last two decades advocating against physician-assisted suicide. Today she works as the coalitions director at Patients Rights Action Fund.
She fears legalizing assisted death creates a lower standard of care for people who are terminally ill.
The American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, an industry group, takes a neutral stance on assisted dying, but echoes similar concerns over the practice’s effect on “the perceived or actual integrity of the medical profession,” according to its website.
About 22% of Americans – 74 million people – live in jurisdictions where assisted dying is legal. Between 1998 and 2020, just 5,329 people died using physician-assisted death in the United States. That’s according to a 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society .
Each state collects data differently making it difficult to analyze trends, according to the study’s author, Elissa Kozlov, an assistant professor at Rutgers University.

The findings are the latest in a string of problems at hospitals owned by private-equity funded Prospect Medical Holdings.
Currently, Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Memorial Hospital and Rockville General Hospital all face an uncertain future following the apparent collapse of a purchase deal with Yale New Haven Health.
According to inspection reports obtained by Connecticut Public, nurses at the intensive care unit at Waterbury Hospital were “concerned that the ICU is often inappropriately staffed which causes unsafe conditions, there are frequently unsafe staff assignments.”
The report says nurses at the hospital feel overwhelmed and that “they are not providing quality patient care,” the 2024 records showed.
“The RNs indicated that the ICU is staffed unsafely on most days, and not consistent with the hospital Staffing Plan, and staff is exhausted which leads them to call out for scheduled shifts,” the report states.
Records show the nurse absenteeism rate in the ICU was 31%, and to fill the gap, administrative staff stepped in with patient care.
Edmond Gadomski, the hospital’s nurses’ union representative, said nurses are working short-staffed and taking on bigger assignments than they should.
“So yes, they are burned out, [it] does increase the absenteeism in the hospital,” Gadomski said. “They’re not superheroes, there’s only so much that they can do. You’re taking care of 5,6,7 patients when you should be at a 1 to 4 cap.”
In a statement, Waterbury Hospital said it has been in compliance “with at least 80% of the nursing staffing assignments outlined in the hospital’s staffing plan, which is within DPH’s requirements,” and it is actively recruiting nurses, and adding traveler nurses to its rosters to provide additional help.
But Gadomski said the shortage is ongoing, despite records filed by the hospital with the DPH to the contrary.
“I have some departments at 50% vacancy rate, 33-to-40% vacancy rates, there’s no way that they could be compliant,” he said. “And I have actually filed a violation or complaint myself in the DPH, so that they will investigate that fact.”
DPH declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation.
In addition, the hospital is looking into the use of an acuity tool through the electronic health records system to better align staffing with patient needs, the records showed.
A registered ICU nurse interviewed by the DPH approximately five hours into the shift said he was unable to titrate medications on patients for the shift due to the workload and acuity of the patients.
And a DPH inspection of the gastroenterology unit identified that the assistant director of gastroenterology and medical therapies was not a registered nurse, as required, and was not able to assist with care when the registered nurses needed help.
Prospect filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings Jan. 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas. Prospect does not own hospitals in Texas, but may have chosen that state as some debtors find Texas preferable in bankruptcy court, Chris Mattei, a former assistant U.S. attorney, told Connecticut Public.

,DC,2025-04-14 14:42:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. human rights law likely violated in $6M payment for El Salvador prison, experts say",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-human-rights-law-likely-violated-6m-payment-el-salvador-prison-experts-say,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department is paying El Salvador $6 million to house hundreds of immigrants deported from the United States in an immense and brutal prison there, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.But a U.S. law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons —  facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations. That has led those who wrote what’s known as the Leahy Law and enforced it for years to question the legality of the $6 million payment made as President Donald Trump carries out his campaign of mass deportation.The Trump administration on March 15 sent 261 men to CECOT, after invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to apply to Venezuelan nationals 14 and older who are suspected members of the gang Tren de Aragua.On March 30, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said another 17 nationals from El Salvador were sent to CECOT, again alleging gang ties. On Sunday, Rubio said 10 more men were sent to the prison in El Salvador, and noted how “the alliance between” the U.S. and El Salvador “has become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere.”Tim Rieser, the main author of the Leahy Law while a longtime foreign policy aide to former U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the $6 million payment for those migrants’ incarceration for up to a year is likely a violation of the law.“Sending migrants who have not been charged or convicted of any crime to the maximum-security terrorism prison in El Salvador, where they have no access to lawyers or their families, where they have no rights of due process, and with no idea if they will ever be released, held in cruel and shockingly degrading conditions, would certainly appear to violate the Leahy Law,” Rieser told States Newsroom.“I don't think the Trump administration is upholding the Leahy Law or other laws that protect human rights,” he said.Also deeply concerned is Charles Blaha, a former State Department official for 32 years who led the office responsible for vetting the Leahy Law worldwide, the Office of Security and Human Rights, from 2016 to 2023.“CECOT is a facility that exposes prisoners to torture, and cruel, degrading, and inhumane treatment and punishment,” Blaha said in an interview. “Under the Leahy Law, this should disqualify CECOT from receiving U.S. assistance.""Trump has also expressed that he is open to sending U.S. citizens to CECOT.“I love that,” he said. “I don’t know what the law says on that.”El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele is scheduled to visit with Trump at the White House on Monday.Trump administration says law followedThe Trump administration plans to keep using the mega-prison as deportations continue under the Alien Enemies Act, top officials such as U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have pledged. Noem visited the prison in March.“This facility is one of the tools in our toolkits that we will use,” Noem said during her tour of CECOT.The State Department has denied any potential violations.

“The Department is following all applicable laws related to foreign assistance, including the State Leahy Law,” a State Department spokesperson wrote in a statement to States Newsroom.The spokesperson said the U.S. is engaged with El Salvador through foreign assistance to address unauthorized migration and human trafficking.“As these countries continue to work with us in securing our borders and addressing illegal immigration, we will provide assistance as necessary in support of these collaborative efforts,” the spokesperson said. “Our goal is to ensure that our partners are well-equipped to handle the challenges they face, ultimately contributing to a more stable and secure region.”The 1997 Leahy Law refers to two statutes – one applying to the State Department and one covering the Department of Defense – that prevent U.S. funds from being used for assistance to foreign security forces that have credible allegations of gross violations of human rights such as torture, extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearance or rape. Payment originThe exact agency within the State Department that is paying out the $6 million in funding to CECOT is unclear and is a source of interest among Democrats in Congress.It is likely coming out of the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, said Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight at the Washington Office of Latin America, a research and advocacy group that aims to advance human rights in North and South America.INL, among other things, gives financial assistance to security forces and is subject to the Leahy Law, Isacson said.

The State Department did not answer detailed questions from States Newsroom as to whether the funds were coming from INL. “And even if Leahy doesn't apply, the State Department has a duty to make sure that we're not turning over people, even if they're not our citizens, to places where they'll be mistreated or tortured,” Blaha said.The State Department’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor oversees an office that vets recipients of proposed foreign aid for potential gross human rights violations.Fewer than 1% of requests are blocked after going through vetting through the Leahy Law compliance database. Those units that are blocked from funding are publicly posted on a case-by-case basis.The most recent listing of publicly rejected units is from 2022, so there is no publicly available record of CECOT or the security units in charge of El Salvador's prisons being vetted because the prison was built in 2023. However, experts say the country’s record of prison management and publicly available details about the mega-prison mean it should be on the latest version of the list.  Beatings, use of electric shocksThe State Department’s 2023 Human Rights Report on El Salvador noted there were credible reports from human rights organizations “of abuse and mistreatment of detainees by prison guards.”Groups cited in the report interviewed people who were released from prisons in El Salvador and “reported systemic abuse in the prison system, including beatings by guards and the use of electric shocks.”

“The coalition alleged the treatment of prisoners constituted torture,"" according to the report.The State Department in its report raised concerns about abusive physical conditions in El Salvador’s prisons, such as overcrowding.While CECOT is not mentioned in the report by name, the report noted that El Salvador's government opened a new facility in January 2023 to hold up to 40,000 detainees, which apparently is now CECOT.No access to CECOTNo human rights group has had access to investigate the conditions of the CECOT prison, said Juanita Goebertus Estrada, the director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.Goebertus Estrada has studied El Salvador’s prison system since the country’s Congress allowed President Bukele to issue a state of emergency in 2022 that suspended due process. It’s led to 1.4% of the population, about 84,000 people, being incarcerated.“We have no reason to believe that the (CECOT) conditions are not similar to those in the rest of the El Salvadorian prison system,” she said. “It's administered by the same institution and the training of the guards is the same.”She added that Human Rights Watch and other organizations have not documented anyone who is imprisoned at CECOT ever leaving. Additionally, attorneys and families are not allowed to visit.“The government has explicitly said that this is a prison for the most reprehensible members of gangs, and that they're going to rot there,” Goebertus Estrada said.More than 300 people have died in prisons across El Salvador in the last three years, Goebertus Estrada said. That kind of record, WOLA’s Isacson said, is something that should trigger the Leahy Law.“The Salvadoran units in charge of the prison system... you think would come up because of extraordinarily credible allegations of about 300 people dying in the prison system in the last three years,” Isacson said.Enforcement up to CongressIsacson said if the State Department’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor is not enforcing the Leahy Law, then “it would be up to members of Congress to raise this” concern and potentially pull funding for the bureau in a future appropriations bill.The most recent warnings about violations of the Leahy Law have been tied to the start of the 2023 war in Gaza and the role of U.S. security assistance to Israel units. Thousands of Palestinians have died in the Israel-Hamas war.“You had Israeli units, who would not have qualified, getting aid, and Democrats not really making any noise about it,” Isacson said. “The (Leahy) Law is mortally wounded.”Democratic senators pressed DHS on April 8 to provide a copy of the contract between the U.S. and El Salvador. And House Democratic members, such as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, are pushing for a congressional delegation to visit CECOT.Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, visited the prison in July 2024, calling CECOT “the solution” and adding “the good ideas in El Salvador actually have legs and can go to other places and help other people be safe and secure and hopeful and prosperous.”  U.S. citizens at CECOT?El Salvador’s Bukele has become a key ally in Trump's plans for mass deportations.One of Rubio’s first visits to Latin America as secretary of State was to El Salvador. During that February trip, Rubio and Bukele talked about the possibility of detaining immigrants removed from the U.S. in El Salvador. Bukele also offered to imprison U.S. citizens.

“And in an extraordinary gesture never before extended by any country, President Bukele offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals, including U.S. citizens and legal residents,” according to the State Department’s readout of the trip.Noem said during an April 9 border security conference that the Trump administration will continue to carry out deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and maintain a strong partnership with El Salvador.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled April 7 that, for now, the Trump administration can continue use of the Alien Enemies Act, but said those subject to the proclamation must have due process, including court hearings.The high court did not rule on the merits of using the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, when the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. Until now, the Alien Enemies Act has only been used during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.The Venezuelan men who were sent to CECOT on March 15 under the wartime act, were not notified and or given due process, federal trial and appellate judges have noted. Lawyers for many of the Venezuelan men sent to El Salvador said their clients were not involved in gangs and instead either had no criminal record or were in the middle of asylum hearings before an immigration judge.‘Cruelty is the point’During the April 9 conference, Noem touted her meeting with Bukele and said the kind of partnership exemplified by the use of the prison would continue.However, the Trump administration has taken the position that those at the CECOT prison are no longer in U.S. custody. In a high-profile case, the Supreme Court April 10 ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of a wrongly deported Maryland man to the prison back to the U.S., but stopped short of requiring it.

“The idea of paying someone else to be your (Guantanamo Bay), is brand new,” Isacson said, referring to the U.S. Navy base in Cuba that houses foreign nationals accused of terrorism.Noem visited CECOT after the Trump administration invoked the wartime law to send deportation flights to El Salvador. On camera Noem pointed behind her and warned the same would happen to immigrants who ""commit crimes against the American people.”Behind her were dozens of men who were stripped from the waist up, their tattoos visible behind bars.Blaha was highly critical of Noem’s visit, where she took videos and pictures of the incarcerated men.“Noem's stunt epitomizes cruel, degrading, and inhumane treatment, which is why the administration loves it so much,” he said. “Sadly, the cruelty is the point with these guys.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-14 11:16:51.901155

(Photo illustration by zimmytws/Getty Images Plus)The first words of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution tell us that “all persons born or naturalized” in the United States are U.S. citizens.
This is the law of “birthright citizenship.”
The amendment was ratified in 1868, and its initial purpose was clear. The Civil War had nominally ended 300 years of slavery, but the newly freed African Americans had neither citizenship nor civil or constitutional rights.
The 14th Amendment was supposed to fix that. You’re born here; you’re a citizen. End of story.
Except the story has never ended.
In today’s atmosphere of virulent political animosity and cultural conflict, it is useful to understand that “birthright citizenship” is not so much about birth anymore as it is about citizenship and the rights that accompany it.
This is what made the 14th Amendment a lightning rod in the civil rights movement.
My new book set for release Tuesday, “Grant’s Enforcer,” follows the career of Reconstruction-era Attorney General Amos T. Akerman, the first federal lawman to understand the potential reach of the amendment in protecting the underserved.
His immediate concerns were the predations of the Ku Klux Klan in the interior counties of South Carolina — especially York County, on the northern border.
But he also believed the amendment could be used to blunt Americans’ ugly and recurring tendency to demonize the “other” in our society.
In 1868, the “other” were the freed slaves, but many groups have subsequently played this unenviable role: Chinese contract laborers; interned Japanese Americans; pregnant mothers crossing the border to give birth; Jews and Black Americans on countless occasions.
Over the last decade this spotlight has focused on refugees and immigrants, Muslims generally and, most recently, anyone whose sexual orientation differs from the “norm.”
Akerman, a Republican from Georgia, knew that “citizenship” was a hollow privilege without guaranteed rights. He made his case before a congressional committee late in 1868 when many states in the former Confederacy were being savaged by Ku Klux Klan terrorism.
Local law enforcement mostly ignored these offenses, seldom tried them and never convicted anyone. Congress wanted to know what to do about it.
Akerman had a simple answer: Prosecute the cases as federal crimes and try them in federal court.
Under the 14th Amendment, no one could deny a citizen’s voting rights, break into someone’s house or take someone’s guns. And if you murdered the father, beat the mother or raped the daughter during your home invasion, these crimes could be added to the case against you.
Under the 14th Amendment, these offenses were now violations of the civil and constitutional rights of U.S. citizens.
When President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him attorney general in mid-1870, Akerman set out to test his theory. In October elections, Republicans in South Carolina won both the governorship and both houses of the Legislature, benefitting from a solid voting majority of newly enfranchised Black voters.
Democrats were enraged, and by the end of 1870 the Ku Klux Klan had ravaged parts of South Carolina to such a degree that its exploits had become national news.
Akerman chose York County as his testing ground because the U.S. Army garrison in Yorkville (today’s York) had collected massive amounts of intelligence and knew everyone in the county who was affiliated with the Klan — leaders, soldiers and sympathizers.
By year’s end, federal authorities had 200 York County Klansmen in custody, and 500 others had surrendered. Thousands more South Carolina Klansmen fled the state altogether, and Klansmen across the South ducked their heads.
The final act played out in federal court in Columbia at the end of 1871. Akerman sought convictions for violations of civil and constitutional rights: voter intimidation, confiscation of firearms and home invasion.
He failed, but he was not surprised. Akerman was proposing new law, while the defense relied on the canon of states’ rights. In the end, the court declined to hear a 14th Amendment case.
As a fallback, Akerman’s prosecutors charged the defendants narrowly with conspiracy to deny the voting rights of their victims, invariably threatened with beatings — or worse — unless they abandoned the Republican Party.
Akerman’s team won these cases effortlessly: 55 York County Klansmen were either convicted or pleaded guilty.
It was, however, a hollow victory.
The Klan, as such, disappeared for 50 years, but white terrorism never abated. In 1876, former Confederate cavalry Gen. Wade Hampton, supported by paramilitary “Red Shirts,” won a bloody gubernatorial race to restore white supremacy to South Carolina. In 1895, a new state constitution effectively disenfranchised Black voters.
Full vindication for Amos T. Akerman only came a century later.
Beginning with the “Mississippi Burning” case in 1966, where seven Ku Klux Klan defendants were convicted in the murders of three civil rights workers, prosecutors have repeatedly called on the same laws that Akerman used in Columbia.
The 14th Amendment today underpins rights cases ranging from hate crimes to human trafficking, disenfranchisement, and election fraud — exactly how Akerman would have wanted.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/birthright-citizenship-1024x853.jpg,,,2025-04-14 11:16:51.901155

(Photo by Blair Miller / Daily Montanan)Debate over legislation prohibiting towns from enacting red flag gun laws, House Bill 809, led to accusations of sexism in the Senate chamber over the weekend.
The hot button issue drew strong testimony from numerous senators, including Sen. Ellie Boldman, a Missoula Democrat.
The bill, brought by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls and carried in the Senate by Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, states, “extreme risk protection orders violate a person’s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.”
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, “Research has shown that states can save lives by authorizing courts to issue extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs) that temporarily prevent a person in crisis from accessing firearms.”
Arguing against the bill, Boldman spoke about a man who killed a woman with a gun, explaining numerous red flags that should have prevented him from having a weapon.
Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, then accused Boldman of being melodramatic.
“I enjoyed the histrionics of the opponent to this bill,” Fuller said.
Boldman later called his criticism “blatant sexism” in a social media post.
Fuller’s statement elicited an immediate, though quiet, reaction in Senate chambers with several members looking on in shock.
Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, asked Fuller to clarify what he had said after the Kalispell legislator finished explaining why he thought local governments shouldn’t be allowed to enact gun laws.
“Histrionic is defined as undue emotion in presentation of what they believe to be true,” Fuller said. “I believe that’s the definition.”
The Senate approvedHouse Bill 809 in a 29-21 vote shortly after.
However, at the end of the meeting, when senators may make comments unrelated to agenda items, several referenced the debate over HB 809.
Sen. Jacinda Morigeau, D-Arlee, expressed frustration with how women in Senate chambers are treated.
“We live in a society where words have additional connotations beyond their dictionary definitions,” Morigeau said. “So I must say that the use of histrionics has always been derogatory towards women.”
Morigeau said she’s witnessed disrespect toward women time and time again during the Legislature. She said the body frequently consults its decorum rules for other matters, but not when it comes to the way women are treated.
“I have seen in my 73 days in here, over and over, many times, the women in this body being put down, overtly, subtly,” Morigeau said. “And I just, I am tired of it.”
Fuller also spoke, again defining histrionics, and said, “if someone takes offense to that, I’m sorry, I apologize, but there is nothing wrong with them being dramatic, lively and excitable in this chamber.”
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings commented how men’s speech can be perceived as “passionate” while when women speak, it’s sometimes referred to as “emotional.” He apologized for his caucus and said the chamber needs to do better.
“We all have the right to have our arguments,” Zolnikov said, adding they also had the right to argue, “how we want to.”
Manzella spoke in defense of her male colleagues.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)While a student studying economics, my professors often said that our national debt was nothing to worry about. This was the late 1990’s; the national debt was $5 trillion. They argued that deficit spending was an investment in our economy and in government programs that benefit people. The U.S. was politically powerful and wealthy so we could manage our debt and interest payments, no problem.
In 1946 our debt was 121% of the country’s total economic output, mostly due to WWII, but fell to 32% by 1974. This drop was not a consequence of paying off the country’s debt. It occurred because our economy grew much faster than our accumulating debt.
Today, there is more public concern about the country’s debt level, likely because it is a political talking point. But also because gross debt has grown to $36 trillion. Tax cuts are one of the primary drivers of our growing debt, even though most of the debate is focused on government spending. 
The tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy enacted during the first Trump administration increased our national debt by $2.5 trillion. In fact, tax cuts enacted since 2001 are responsible for 57% of the increase in the debt ratio (debt as a percent of economic output). If these tax cuts were never enacted, the debt ratio would be declining, rather than increasing.
Managing the country’s debt is more difficult when the economy slows. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently released its long-term budget outlook report. The CBO projects that the economy will grow more slowly as the labor force shrinks. And the recently enacted tariffs are forecasted to slow the economy even more, potentially causing a recession. 
Now is not the time to have a weak economy. Unlike corporations, the U.S. cannot declare bankruptcy or ask banks to forgive our debt. And selling residency gold cards for $5 million, as President Trump proposed, will not raise sufficient revenue.
The smartest way to manage our debt is to support policies that encourage a growing economy with a strong middle class, political stability and confidence in the U.S. dollar. 
To achieve this, Congress needs to work toward a fair tax system. It is short-sighted of Republicans to support large tax cuts for billionaires and profitable corporations. President Trump has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, well below the average tax rate of 24% for other developed countries. 
Many corporations are only paying effective tax rates of 9%. Minnesota companies Target, General Mills and UnitedHealth Group each had an average effective tax rate of 20% over the past five years, even though their total profits were $60 billion in 2024. In 1993, the top corporate tax rate was 38%, but was as high as 53% in 1942. 
Profitable corporations need to pay their fair share: They benefit from good roads, a trained workforce, antitrust oversight and national security. And billionaires do not need a tax cut. Furthermore, it has been shown that cutting taxes does not trickle down or spur economic growth — this did not happen in Kansas or with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.
Extending tax cuts to corporations and billionaires is a priority for Republicans this year. But these tax cuts fail to solve any problem; tax cuts do not lower costs for Minnesotans. They do not lower the price of eggs, increase the supply of housing, or lower the cost of health care and child care. Instead, Minnesotans will be paying for these tax cuts by cuts to public schools, Social Security, Medicaid, Head Start, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Meals on Wheels and cancer research. Minnesotans will sacrifice safe food and drugs, services for veterans, good roads, safe bridges, rural broadband and clean energy. 
Tax cuts are so important to Republicans that they are not only threatening to cut programs like Medicaid, Social Security, and services for veterans, but are attempting to use a budget gimmick that assumes the tax cuts are budget neutral. They are not. To pay for the tax cuts, Republicans will be adding trillions to the country’s debt and will need to raise the debt ceiling to $41 trillion. 
Minnesota corporations should consider whether tax cuts are worth cutting vital programs for Minnesotans and increasing the debt. Corporate CEOs should realize that it is working Minnesotans who purchase their goods and keep our economy chugging along. Unfortunately, Minnesota families are struggling already and are in no position to pay for large tax cuts for billionaires and corporations.
Tariffs will further harm Minnesotans. Tariffs are a tax on goods that will add 2.5% to consumer prices, cost Minnesotans $5,200 per year, increase unemployment and hurt farmers. The tariffs will only raise $600 billion in revenue, not sufficient to cover the $5 trillion needed for the proposed Republican tax cuts to corporations and billionaires.
The Minnesota CEOs lobbying for tax cuts should rethink their strategy and instead spend their resources convincing Republicans of sound economic policies. Countries are retaliating against U.S. tariffs; China issued a 125% retaliatory tariff tax on U.S. imports and barred an additional 11 companies from doing business in China. Countries are also removing Minnesota products off their shelves and labeling American-made products so their customers may boycott them. These blanket tariffs — including on our longstanding friends and allies — are not sound economic policies; they harm Minnesota businesses, farmers and consumers.
Minnesotans will be harmed by other federal policies that have already been enacted or are in the works to set the table for the tax cut. Minnesota is expecting to lose significant federal funding as the Trump administration cancels grants and closes federal agencies. 
Federal funds comprise 35% of Minnesota state revenue, or $23 billion annually. Minnesota could easily lose billions. The federal government rescinded $226 million in federal grants from the Minnesota Department of Health. The University of Minnesota and Mayo could lose $117 million in NIH funding. Minnesota could lose billions in Medicaid funding and expects federal funding cuts for education and human services. All of these cuts will be detrimental to Minnesotans, particularly the most vulnerable.
Other threats could be more consequential than tariffs. Foreign governments may respond to tariffs or other threats by divesting of U.S. Treasury bonds or not holding U.S. dollars in reserve funds. (Currently the dollar is used in approximately 90% of global foreign exchange transactions and nearly 60% of global foreign exchange reserves.) The chaos and uncertainty from Republican leaders will have severe consequences that may damage confidence in the U.S. dollar and decrease our ability to manage the country’s debt.
If President Trump threatens to force foreign governments to swap U.S. Treasuries for cheaper bonds to reduce interest payments; continues to say that there is fraud in the U.S. Treasury debt payments; or interfere with the independent Federal Reserve Bank (like Trump did with the independent Federal Trade Commission), it could undermine U.S. credit worthiness, upset the global financial system, make U.S. Treasury bonds —the world’s safest asset — risky, increase interest rates, cause stagflation, devalue the dollar, and lead to a deep recession. 
And then the executive branch could leverage catastrophic economic instability to centralize more power.
The bottom line is that we need a strong and growing economy to manage our debt. To achieve this we need sound economic policies, a fair tax system, financially strong working families and accountable elected officials. 
I hope Minnesota Republicans start prioritizing the people they represent, and Minnesota executives lobby for economic policies that benefit their customers and their country, and push back against tariffs. 
We need to work together to face our challenges and to continue the journey of realizing the idea of America for all.  For our country to succeed, working people need to succeed.

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
States Debate Whether to Restrict — Or Invite — Crypto Mining

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.










We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. 


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

Ervin Wyatt’s history behind the wheel spreads across two pages of a recent court filing: Fleeing police. Fleeing police again. Running a red light. Causing a traffic collision. Driving without a license, four times. A dozen speeding tickets.
Yet the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued him a license in 2019. Wyatt promptly got three more speeding tickets, court records show. Prosecutors say he was speeding again in 2023 when he lost control and crashed into oncoming traffic, killing three women. He’s now facing murder charges in Stanislaus County.
The California DMV routinely allows drivers like these — with horrifying histories of dangerous driving, including DUIs, crashes and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways, a CalMatters investigation has found. 
Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill. Some go on to kill again. 
CalMatters investigative reporter Robert Lewis reviewed vehicular manslaughter cases in California from 2019 through early 2024 to understand how California handles dangerous drivers.
The court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. 
Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.

Morgan Gire, Placer County District Attorney: “I don’t think anyone fully understands what you need to do behind the wheel to lose your driving privilege.”

Our key findings:

Nearly 40 percent of drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license.
The DMV issued licenses to 150 drivers less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road. 
Nearly 400 of the drivers charged with killing someone got a ticket or were in another collision — or both — after their fatal crash. 
The DMV has no record of vehicular manslaughter or related convictions of hundreds of drivers.

CA utilities not required to update fire maps

With Cal Fire’s rollout of updated local fire hazard maps concluded, California property owners who fall into the 2 million acres of “high” or “very high” fire danger areas are subject to a host of building codes and other rules to mitigate the spread of wildfires.
But a proposal for California’s three major utility companies to update their own fire risk maps — which would help impose more regulatory scrutiny and stricter rules for utility infrastructure in high-risk areas — was recently rejected by state regulators.
As CalMatters’ Malena Carollo explains, since their original filing in 2017, the fire maps have been voluntarily updated by the utilities in piecemeal updates. In 2023 the California Public Advocates Office, a state entity responsible for representing consumer interests and ratepayers, requested regulators at the California Public Utilities Commission to require the utilities to update their maps immediately and in their entirety. 
The companies — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — supported the request, which the commission rejected in January. A spokesperson for the commission said its members “cannot comment today on a potential future vehicle about the fire maps.”
The rejection came weeks after deadly wildfires swept through Los Angeles County. In March the county filed a suit against Edison, arguing that there was evidence the company was responsible for the Eaton Fire that killed 18 people.

Is CA’s law on paying college teachers outdated?


Students walk through the MiraCosta College campus in Oceanside on Sept. 26, 2024. Photo by Adriana Heldiz, CalMatters




From CalMatters higher education and workforce reporter Adam Echelman:
In 1961, California passed the “50 Percent Law,” which mandates much of how community colleges spend their money. Most of the state’s community colleges didn’t exist yet and there had never been a James Bond film.
College administrators say the rule is outdated.
In an April 8 report, the state auditor’s office said it agrees. The law requires community colleges to spend 50% of their funds on teacher salaries, with some exceptions. College leaders say the restrictions hamper their ability to spend money on counselors, librarians and other support services that students need.
The audit also said that the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office has done a poor job of enforcing schools’ compliance with the law. 
Teachers say the law is a bulwark against administrative bloat, keeping colleges focused on their educational mission. Over the course of one 10-year span, the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office reported that its schools have increased the number of administrators by 45 percent compared to just 3 percent for faculty, although the audit noted that the staffing data contains “anomalies” and “discrepancies.” 
The audit recommended amending the law but not eliminating it.

Former Assemblymember Evan Low and his campaign will pay a $106,000 fine for using a technology-focused nonprofit to pay Alec Baldwin to appear at the politician’s re-election fundraiser and concealing the payment afterward, the state’s Fair Political Practices Commission decided Thursday. 
The hefty penalty comes five years after the agency began investigating Low and his relationship with the nonprofit he founded — a probe sparked by CalMatters’ reporting on the ties between Low and the foundation.

Angela Bereton, FPPC assistant enforcement chief, during a commission meeting Thursday: “This conduct was egregious. There was purposeful action taken to conceal this activity and it wasn’t reported for five years.”

After narrowly losing the 2024 U.S. Senate race to Democrat Elissa Slotkin, Rogers, 61, released a statement on his campaign website that he was ready to “be an ally for President Trump and champion for Michigan.”
“President Trump needs strong allies in the Senate to help him deliver on the mandate given by the American people,” said Rogers on the social media platform X. “That means bringing manufacturing jobs back to Michigan, protecting seniors’ social security, lowering the costs of gas, groceries & prescription drugs, and setting our kids up for success by improving the quality of their education. Michigan, let’s get to work.”

Rogers is the first announced Republican to seek the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township), who said in January he would not seek another term in 2026.
Other potential GOP candidates include U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland), state Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), and former gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon.
On the Democratic side, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) announced earlier this month she was running for Peters’ seat, while U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Abdul El-Sayed, a former gubernatorial candidate who recently stepped down as Wayne County’s health director, are also anticipated to announce candidacies.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) have also been mentioned as possible Democratic candidates.
Rogers, who represented his mid-Michigan district in Congress from 2001 to 2015, rose to become chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee. Prior to that he served as a state senator and FBI agent.
After leaving Congress, Rogers moved to Florida and went into the private sector as a cyber security adviser and businessman. His return in 2023 to seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Debbie Stabenow brought with it questions whether or not his official residence was in the White Lake Township home he and wife Kristi had purchased earlier that year.
That house was eventually torn down and a new one built in its place. A check by Michigan Advance on Sunday indicated the home was completed and appeared to be occupied.
A request for confirmation of his residency was made to the Rogers campaign, but has yet to be returned.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) also released a statement Monday, saying Rogers was the conservative leader Michigan needs in the U.S. Senate.
“As an Army veteran and former special agent, Mike understands the importance of putting service before self. We need him in the U.S. Senate to help achieve President Trump’s America First agenda and to bring manufacturing and good-paying jobs back to Michigan,” said Thune.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PA169156-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137

Silvia Paz
Silvia Paz is the founder and executive director of Alianza Coachella Valley, and was the chair of the governor’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Lithium Extraction.


I grew up in the Salton Sea region in a mobile home community of farmworkers. Our corner of the unincorporated town Mecca lacked access to transportation, grocery stores, health clinics, sidewalks, reliable electricity and sewer or water infrastructure. 
Over the decades, change has been slow. It would take substantial, sustained funding to address the dire economic, health and environmental needs.
Communities in the Salton Sea are united by more than our historic underinvestment, though. Despite being artificially separated between Imperial and Riverside counties, we have similar cultures, ecosystems and economic drivers like agriculture and tourism. In many ways, the experiences and priorities of Salton Sea communities have more in common with each other than with the larger metropolitan regions assigned to us. 
We must find a way to overcome the economic regions that divide us based on county lines. Creating a stronger future for the Salton Sea depends on our unity, especially as we navigate the uncertainties of the lithium industry, and as the state prepares to disburse $10 billion from the climate bond that California voters passed in November. 
When separated between Imperial and Riverside counties, our community’s voices are drowned out by the priorities of more-resourced metropolitan areas. For areas comprised of neighborhoods and mobile home parks that consistently rank in the state’s lowest income quartiles, this deepens our competitive disadvantage, and blocks us from accessing resources that are so crucial to bolstering fundamental infrastructure.
Our current experience with the lithium mining boom is a perfect example. Salton Sea communities will be closest to the environmental impacts of lithium extraction. Yet, we have no guarantees or assurances that the major economic benefits developers have long touted will also reach our communities. 
Instead, we’re left negotiating for the basics, like road and bridge repairs to handle heavier industrial traffic. Every community should have functional roads. We should not have to negotiate with developers to fulfill this fundamental need, especially one that supports their business and financial success. 
The reason we don’t have the building blocks for a thriving economy — the reason we’re asking developers for the basics — is directly tied to the economic regions where the state has placed us, fragmenting the flow of public funding into our communities over the years.
Being recognized as one region would provide a spark of hope and a pathway to overcome the obstacles hampering the access to resources. In 2024, the Salton Sea region came together to ask the state to elevate our geographic area to a fully recognized economic region. While these initial efforts were ultimately vetoed by the governor, local governments and community leaders are exploring other ways to make our fractured voices louder and advocate as one for what we all need.
Alongside researchers from the University of Southern California, we are working to unearth areas of common interest between communities and local governments. We are currently focused on Imperial and Riverside counties, as well as the cities of Brawley, Calipatria, El Centro, Westmorland and Coachella. 
Already, our research is revealing promising opportunities for us to advocate together around shared goals. For example, every single one of these areas wants to prioritize upgrading their water systems — which happens to be a primary investment focus of the climate bond.
All around the Salton Sea, my neighbors and I have pride in our histories and cultures. We feel a deep connection to our neighborhoods and agree that stronger infrastructure, clean water and clean air are essential. We are determined to make progress on strengthening our collective voice to meet our shared needs, and we urgently hope our partners in state government will follow. 
A united and recognized Salton Sea region is the key to ensuring our communities benefit from new climate investments and major industrial development. It is key to realizing our potential so this important area of California’s future can truly thrive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/020323-Geothermal-Lithium-AD-CM-27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137

Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill.

Ivan Dimov was convicted of reckless driving in 2013, after fleeing police in Washington state while his passenger allegedly dumped heroin out the window. Before that, he got six DUIs in California over a six-year period. None of that would keep him off the road.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles reissued him a driver’s license in 2017. The next year, on Christmas Eve, he drove drunk again, running stop signs and a traffic light in midtown Sacramento, going more than 80 mph, court records show. He T-boned another car, killing a 28-year-old man who was going home to feed the cat before heading to his mom’s for the holiday.
Kostas Linardos had 17 tickets — including for speeding, reckless driving and street racing — and had been in four collisions. Then, in November 2022, he gunned his Ram 2500 truck as he entered a Placer County highway and slammed into the back of a disabled sedan, killing a toddler, court records show. He’s now facing felony manslaughter charges. 
In December of last year, while that case was open, the DMV renewed his driver’s license.
Ervin Wyatt’s history behind the wheel spreads across two pages of a recent court filing: Fleeing police. Fleeing police again. Running a red light. Causing a traffic collision. Driving without a license, four times. A dozen speeding tickets.
Yet the DMV issued him a license in 2019. Wyatt promptly got three more speeding tickets, court records show. Prosecutors say he was speeding again in 2023 when he lost control and crashed into oncoming traffic, killing three women. He’s now facing murder charges in Stanislaus County.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles routinely allows drivers like these — with horrifying histories of dangerous driving, including DUIs, crashes and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways, a CalMatters investigation has found. Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill. Some go on to kill again. 
With state lawmakers grappling with how to address the death toll on our roads, CalMatters wanted to understand how California handles dangerous drivers. We first asked the district attorneys for all 58 counties to provide us with a list of their vehicular manslaughter cases from 2019 through early last year. Every county but Santa Cruz provided the information.

Because California has no centralized court system and records aren’t online, we then traveled to courthouses up and down the state to read through tens of thousands of pages of files. Once we had defendants’ names and other information, we were able to get DMV driver reports for more than 2,600 of the defendants, providing details on their recent collisions, citations and license status. 
The court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.
We found nearly 40% of the drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license.
That includes a driver with two separate convictions for vehicular manslaughter, for crashes that killed a 16-year-old girl in 2009 and a 25-year-old woman in 2020. In July of last year, the DMV issued him a driver’s license.
The agency gave licenses to nearly 150 people less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road, we found. And while the agency has since suspended some of those, often after a conviction, the majority remain valid. In Santa Clara County, a man prosecutors charged with manslaughter got his current license just a month and a half after the collision that killed a mother of three young children.
And many drivers accused of causing roadway deaths don’t appear to have stopped driving recklessly. Records show that nearly 400 got a ticket or were in another crash — or both — after their deadly collisions.
A commercial driver drove his semi truck on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County in 2021. Less than a year later, he still had a valid license when he barreled his semi into slow-moving traffic, hitting four vehicles and killing a woman in Fresno County, records show. Another man, sentenced to nine years in prison for killing two women while driving drunk, got his privileges restored by the DMV after being paroled, only to drive high on meth in Riverside and weave head-on into another car, killing a woman.
“It is somewhat shocking to see how much you can get away with and still be a licensed driver in the state of California,” Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said. “I don’t think anyone fully understands what you need to do behind the wheel to lose your driving privilege.”
Almost as interesting as the information in the drivers’ DMV records is what’s not there.
Hundreds of drivers’ DMV records simply don’t list convictions for manslaughter or another crime related to a fatal crash, we found. The apparent error means some drivers who should have their driving privileges suspended instead show up in DMV records as having a valid license.

License to Kill
Key takeaways: How the DMV allows dangerous drivers to stay on the road
How we did it: Reporting on California’s deadly drivers


The cases we reviewed cut across demographics and geography. Defendants include farmworkers and a farm owner. They include off-duty police officers and people with lengthy rap sheets, drivers who killed in a fit of rage and others whose recklessness took the lives of those they loved most — high school sweethearts, siblings, children. The tragedies span this vast state. From twisty two-lane mountain roads near the Oregon border to the dusty scrubland touching Mexico. From the crowded streets of San Francisco to the highways of the Inland Empire. From Gold Country, to timber country, to Silicon Valley, to the almond capital of the world. So much death. More people than are killed by guns.
Dangerous drivers are able to stay on the roads for many reasons. The state system that targets motorists who rack up tickets is designed to catch clusters of reckless behavior, not long-term patterns. And while there are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for certain crimes, like DUIs, there is no such requirement for many vehicular manslaughter convictions. 
It’s often up to the DMV whether to act. Routinely it doesn’t. 
The DMV declined to make its director, Steve Gordon — who has been in charge since Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed him in 2019 — available for an interview to discuss our findings. 
Chris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, said the agency follows the law when issuing licenses. “We use our authority as mandated and as necessary,” he said. 
Even when the DMV does take away motorists’ driving privileges, state officials, law enforcement and the courts are often unable or unwilling to keep them off the road. We found cases where drivers racked up numerous tickets while driving on a suspended license and faced little more than fines before eventually causing a fatal crash, even though authorities could have sent them to jail.
Taking away someone’s driving privilege is no small decision. It can consign a family to poverty, affecting job prospects, child care and medical decisions. 
Still, the stakes couldn’t be higher. More than 20,000 people died on the roads of California from 2019 to early 2024.
Kowana Strong thinks part of the problem is that lawmakers and regulators are too quick to treat fatal crashes as an unfortunate fact of life, as opposed to something they can address. 
Her son Melvin Strong III — who went by his middle name, Kwaun — was finishing college and planning to start a master’s program in kinesiology when he was killed by Dimov, the driver with six prior DUI convictions. Kwaun was a bright and innocent young man, she said, just starting his life. 
“It’s just another accident as far as they’re concerned,” Kowana Strong said.
Holes in the DMV’s point system
Young people think they’re invincible. It’s the old who know how unfair life is, Jerrod Tejeda said.
His daughter Cassi Tejeda was just 22. She was months from graduating from Chico State with a bachelor’s degree in history and a plan to be a teacher. Outgoing and athletic, she wanted to travel, see the world and make her own life.
She had a girlfriend who was visiting. Courtney Kendall was 24 and a student at Louisiana State University.
On a Sunday afternoon in January 2022, a Volvo SUV topping speeds of 75 mph ran a red light and smashed into their Jeep, court records show. The collision killed them both.
“The most difficult part besides the incident is every day that goes by you’re always wondering what if. What would they be doing today?” Jerrod Tejeda said. “Would they be married? Would they have developed into the career that they chose? Where would she be living?”

Tanya Kendall lamented not being there to protect her daughter, hold her hand or say goodbye.
“Instead, I was left with the unbearable task of choosing what outfit she would be buried in. Buried, Your Honor. Not the gown she would wear to her graduation from LSU — the one she will never attend,” the mother wrote in a letter to a Butte County judge, adding that she and her husband stood in their daughter’s place, accepting her diploma. 
Such pain was preventable.
The driver of the Volvo, Matthew Moen, had a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit, according to court filings. And it wasn’t his first time drinking and driving. Moen was caught driving drunk in Oregon in 2016. He never completed the requirements of a diversion program and had an outstanding warrant at the time of the fatal crash, the Butte County district attorney’s office said. In January 2020, he was convicted of DUI in Nevada County for driving with a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit, given a couple weeks in jail and put on probation for three years.

His license was valid at the time of the fatal 2022 crash, records show.
Across the country, states grapple with how to effectively spot and punish drivers who could be a danger on the road. Often they rely on a basic point system, with drivers accruing points for various types of traffic violations and thresholds for when the state will take away a motorist’s driving privileges. But like many, California has such high limits that drivers with a pattern of reckless behavior can avoid punishment.
The state suspends a driver’s license for accumulating four points in a year, six points in two years or eight points in three years. What does it take to get that many points? Using a cellphone while driving is zero points. A speeding ticket is a point. Vehicular manslaughter is two points.
Between March 2017 and March 2022, Trevor Cook received two citations for running red lights, got two speeding tickets and was deemed responsible for two collisions, including one in which someone was injured, court records show. (A third red-light ticket was dismissed.) At-fault collisions add a point to a driver’s license, according to the DMV. But the incidents were spaced out enough that none resulted in a suspension.
So Cook had a valid license on April 14, 2022, just a month after his last speeding ticket, when he blew through a Yolo County stop sign at more than 100 mph.
At that exact moment, Prajal Bista passed through the intersection, on his way to work after dinner and a movie with his wife, according to details of the crash that prosecutors included in court filings. Bista was driving the speed limit and on track to make it to work 30 minutes early.
The force of the collision nearly split Bista’s Honda Civic in half. Investigators determined Bista had been wearing his seat belt, but the crash tore it apart. They found his body 75 feet from the intersection.
On March 28, 2024, Cook pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter.
Just a month later, on April 30, the DMV issued Cook his current driver’s license, agency records show. Less than two weeks after that, he got a ticket for disobeying a traffic signal.
Melinda Aiello, chief deputy district attorney in Yolo County, said her office didn’t know anything about the new license or the red-light ticket until contacted by CalMatters. What’s more, the manslaughter conviction — like hundreds of others we found — isn’t listed on Cook’s driving record.
Cook’s license was still listed as valid in California DMV records as of early 2025. But for now, he’s off the roadways: Last summer, Cook started serving time in state prison.
“It’s stunning to me that eight months later his license is still showing as valid and the conviction for killing someone while driving is not reflected in his driving record,” Aiello said. “You killed somebody. I’d think there might be some license implications.”
Orrock, the DMV spokesperson, said he couldn’t speak directly to why so many convictions are missing. But, he said, “we acknowledge that the process and coordination between the judicial system and the DMV must continually evolve to address any gaps that have been identified. And we’re looking into that.”
Kill someone, get your license back
There are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for various convictions. A first DUI conviction, for example, is a 6-to-10-month suspension. Felony vehicular manslaughter is a three-year loss of driving privileges. The agency isn’t necessarily required to give a license back if its driver safety branch deems a motorist too dangerous to drive, agency officials said.
But CalMatters found the agency regularly gives drivers their licenses back as soon as the legally required period ends. And once crashes, tickets and suspensions fall off a driver’s record after a few years, it’s often as if the motorist’s record is wiped clean. So even if the driver gets in trouble again, the agency often treats any future crashes and traffic violations as isolated incidents, not as part of a longer pattern of reckless driving.
Perhaps that’s why Joshua Daugherty is licensed to drive in California.
In July 2020, Daugherty drifted onto the highway shoulder while driving near Mammoth Lakes, overcorrected to the left and lost control, court filings show. His Toyota Tacoma cut across the lane into oncoming traffic, where an SUV broadsided it. Daugherty’s girlfriend, 25-year-old Krystal Kazmark, died. Police noted that Daugherty’s eyes were red and watery and his speech was slurred when they arrived. He told officers that he’d smoked “a couple of bowls” of marijuana earlier in the day, according to records filed in court.
Kazmark’s mother was devastated. Like other victim relatives we spoke to for this story, Mary Kazmark tried as best she could to summarize a life into a few words — an impossible task. Her daughter liked to sing, travel, cook, draw, snow-ski, water-ski, wakeboard, hike, read, entertain friends and plan parties. She was a responsible kid, her mother said, always the designated driver with her friends. She oversaw guest reservations at one of the Mammoth Lakes lodges.
Mary Kazmark said she tracked down Daugherty on the phone a few days after the crash.
“He just said, ‘I can’t believe this happened again.’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’”
She eventually learned it wasn’t the first time Daugherty’s driving had killed.
In August 2009, in a strikingly similar incident, Daugherty was speeding along a Riverside County highway when his Ford Expedition drifted onto the shoulder. Witnesses told police he veered back to the left, lost control, hit a dirt embankment and went airborne, the SUV flipping onto its roof. A 16-year-old girl riding in the back died. Daugherty was convicted of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. He was sentenced to 180 days in custody and three years’ probation, according to a summary of the case filed in court.
Because of the earlier manslaughter conviction, police recommended he be charged with murder for the death of Krystal Kazmark. But the Mono County district attorney’s office charged him with a mere misdemeanor.

Felony charges typically require a prosecutor to prove “gross negligence.” A prosecutor in another county described the difference between a felony and a misdemeanor this way: A felony is one in which you tell the average person the facts and they say, “Wow, that’s really dangerous.” A misdemeanor is one which they say, “That’s dumb but I’ve probably done it.”
The Mono County district attorney’s office refused to comment on the case, because the prosecutor and the elected DA at the time have both since retired. The office did provide a prepared statement explaining the charging decision. “It was determined that there was not a substantial likelihood of conviction at trial,” it said.
Daugherty pleaded guilty and was convicted in January 2023. He was sentenced to a year in jail. The DMV suspended his driving privileges after the fatal 2020 crash, a DMV report shows. But losing his license wasn’t enough to keep Daugherty off the road, records show.
Two months after his conviction for killing Kazmark, before he reported to jail, police caught him driving on a suspended license.
Still, the DMV reissued Daugherty a license in July 2024.
To recap: That’s two convictions for two dead young women, plus a conviction for driving on a suspended license, and the California DMV says Daugherty can still share the road with you. 
“It’s so sad. You make a mistake and then you don’t learn from it and then you cause another person to lose their life,” Mary Kazmark said. “It’s unbelievable that he can continue to drive.”
Orrock said the DMV couldn’t comment on individual drivers. 
When law enforcement reports a fatal crash, the agency’s driver safety branch flags all drivers who might be at fault. It then looks into the collision and decides whether the agency should suspend those motorists’ driving privileges. If the driver contests the action, there’s a hearing that could include witness testimony. Suspensions are open-ended. Drivers need to ask for their license back, and agency personnel decide whether the suspension should end or continue. These discretionary suspensions typically last for about a year.
And while officials said the DMV can continue a suspension if they think a driver poses a danger, Orrock said they need to give drivers an opportunity to get their license back. He said there’s no process in the state “to permanently revoke a license.”
Get your license back, get in trouble again
Roughly 400 drivers accused of causing a fatal crash since 2019 received a ticket, got in another collision or did both after the date they allegedly killed someone on the road. (The reports don’t show whether the drivers were found at fault, only that they were involved in an accident.) That’s about 15% of the drivers for whom we could get DMV reports. 
Drivers like William Beasley.
From 2011 to 2016, Beasley collected five speeding tickets and a citation for running a red light in Sacramento County, court records show. Then around 9 a.m. on a sunny Tuesday in October 2019, he killed a man.
William and Deborah Hester were crossing the street to go to a dentist appointment at a veterans facility when Beasley’s silver pickup sped toward them. They thought they would make it across. But the truck didn’t stop. At the last minute, William Hester shoved his wife out of the way. She heard the truck smash into her husband’s body and screamed, according to court records.
Beasley still didn’t stop. He fled the area and tried to hide his truck. Investigators used nearby cameras and license plate readers to track him down days later. Beasley admitted to being in a collision.
He later pleaded no contest in Sacramento to hit-and-run and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. A probation report in the case revealed Beasley was nearly blind in his left eye.

“Mr. Hester is with me every moment of my life,” Beasley said in an interview. “I took away a father, a grandfather, a husband, and they consider me a murderer. That’s not who I am.”
“My accident with Mr. Hester was just that, an accident. Nothing more,” he said, adding that he worked as a courier for years and sometimes got speeding tickets because he was rushing.
In May 2020, the DMV took away his driving privileges. 
In November 2022, Beasley got his license back — “because I could and I needed to,” he said, adding that people deserve second chances, particularly for accidents.
Almost immediately — less than three weeks after getting his license — he was in another collision, his DMV report shows. In early 2024, he got in yet another. His license was suspended when his car insurance was canceled, records show.
“It makes no sense to me that they would give him a license and give him the opportunity to hurt someone else,” said Loriann Hester Page, William Hester’s daughter.
Her father’s death broke the family, she said. He drove a tank in the Army, played guitar in a band, liked to ride horses.
“My dad was such a wonderful, kind man,” she said. “He would always walk in a room and wanted to make everyone smile.”
Beasley said he doesn’t plan to drive again.
“I am 75 years old,” he said. “I am blind in one eye. I have had a situation where a man was killed, he lost his life. I am not going to repeat that situation at all.”
Still on the road, license not suspended
The DMV does have the ability to act quickly. In some cases, it suspended a driver’s license shortly after a fatal crash. However, we found numerous cases in which the DMV did nothing for months or years, often not until a criminal conviction.
In July 2021, truck driver Baljit Singh drove his semi on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County, court records show. There are no suspensions listed on his DMV record during that time, even though the agency has the discretion to suspend someone’s license without a conviction. 
Less than a year later, as his case wound its way through the slow-moving court system, Singh plowed his semi into the back of a car in Fresno County, killing a woman, records show. He ultimately pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter in Kern County. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter in Fresno for the second fatal crash. The DMV finally took away his driving privileges in February of last year.
Prosecutors say Jadon Mendez was speeding in December 2021 in Santa Clara County when he lost control and caused a crash that killed a mother of three young children. A few weeks later he got a speeding ticket. And yet, the DMV issued him his current driver’s license on Jan. 27, 2022 — 49 days after the fatal crash. 
There were no suspensions listed on his DMV record as of early this year, even though Mendez was charged with manslaughter in May 2022. The judge in his case ordered him not to drive, as a condition of his release. But such court orders don’t necessarily show up on a driver’s DMV record. 
That might be why he didn’t get in more trouble in December 2022 when he got a speeding ticket in Alameda County. Prosecutors didn’t know about that ticket until CalMatters asked about it, said Angela Bernhard, assistant DA in the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office. 
Mendez’s manslaughter case is still open, and his license is still listed as valid. 
When asked about the Mendez case and others, Orrock acknowledged that while there’s a DMV process for deciding when to revoke or suspend a license, “sometimes the process takes a while to happen.”
When the DMV doesn’t act at all
In many cases, the DMV doesn’t take action even after a conviction.
In May 2022, a semi driver named Ramon Pacheco made a U-turn in front of an oncoming motorcycle, killing 29-year-old Dominic Lopez-Toney, who was finishing his rotations to be a doctor. 
Court records show Pacheco had gotten in trouble behind the wheel before. He had been arrested for DUI in 2009, caused a collision in 2013 and got a ticket in 2016 for making an unsafe turn. It wasn’t enough to keep him off the road. 
Neither was killing a man.
Months after San Joaquin prosecutors charged Pacheco with vehicular manslaughter, he got into another collision for which he was also deemed most at fault.
As the case dragged on, Lopez-Toney’s large but tight-knit family wrote dozens of letters to the court, pleading for justice. Dorothy Toney wrote that, more than a year since her grandson’s death, she was still haunted by images of his “mangled and broken body” and the gruesome details in the police report. “Somedays,” she wrote, “I wish I had been there to gently hold his hands” and “tell him how much I loved him.”
The letters are full of shock and outrage that the driver had faced so few consequences. “Allowing this truck driver to continue driving and engaging in civilian activities with only a mere consequence of probation is appalling,” wrote Lynelle Sigona, the victim’s aunt.
Pacheco ultimately pleaded no contest to misdemeanor manslaughter and received probation. His DMV record as of Feb. 11 indicates his driving privileges were never suspended; his commercial driver’s license is valid.
Pacheco’s defense attorney, Gil Somera, said his client isn’t a reckless driver. His prior incidents are relatively minimal, he said, given the fact that “truck drivers drive thousands and thousands of miles a year.” Pacheco needed to turn around and didn’t think there was another place he could do so, since he was approaching a residential area, Somera added.
Pacheco wasn’t being “inattentive or reckless,” Somera said. “And it’s unfortunate and sad and tragic this young man died because of this decision he made to make a U-turn.”
In the wake of the tragedy, Lopez-Toney’s mother has become an advocate for truck safety. 
“Road safety and truck safety is not a priority right now with our legislators, with our government,” Nora Lopez said. “Changing our mindset, our attitudes, our culture on the roads is not impossible.”

In an interview at her Castro Valley home, she talked about her only child. He was smart and caring, liked snowboarding and animals, loved food. On vacations they would take cooking classes together, Lopez said. He studied molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and was almost done with medical school.
She still has the dry-erase whiteboards in his old room. One is filled with his small and neat study notes; another has what appears to be a to-do list. There’s a note that says “Surgery: 600.” Lopez said that’s when he was due to start his surgical rotation in a San Joaquin hospital, just a couple of days after he died.
She said he just wanted to help people and serve the Native American community as a doctor, a future that a driver snatched away.
“It’s because of a man’s recklessness and carelessness — no regard for humanity,” she said.
While felony manslaughter is an automatic three-year loss of driving privileges, a misdemeanor typically carries no such penalty. It’s discretionary — it’s up to the DMV to decide whether to do anything. And the man who killed Lopez-Toney is far from alone in facing no apparent punishment from the DMV.
We found nearly 200 drivers with a valid license whose DMV record shows a conviction for misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter but for whom there is no suspension listed.
When shown a copy of Pacheco’s current driving report, Lopez sat in silence for several seconds.
“Does this make sense to you? It makes no sense to me,” she said. “With his record, how does he still have a license?”
‘Are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?’
Research on dangerous drivers appears to be thin and largely outdated. 
Liza Lutzker, a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Safe Transportation Research and Education Center, said much of the focus in the traffic safety world is on creating better design and infrastructure, so people who make honest mistakes don’t end up killing someone. 
“I think that the issues of these reckless drivers are a separate and complex problem,” Lutzker said. “The system we have clearly is not working. And people are paying with their lives for it.” 
Jeffrey Michael, who researches roadway safety issues at Johns Hopkins University and spent three decades working at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said he understands officials might be hesitant to impose harsher penalties more broadly, “for fear of the unintended consequences.”
“We live in a society where driving is really essential,” he said. But he said the findings show the agency needs more scrutiny and analysis of who is on the roads. 
“These are not unresolvable problems,” he said.
Leah Shahum, executive director of the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit promoting safe streets, said sometimes officials prioritize preserving people’s ability to drive rather than ensuring safety. 
“We don’t all have the right to drive,” Shahum said. “We have the responsibility to drive safely and ensure we don’t hurt others.” She added that many people need to drive in this car-centric state. “That does not mean there can be a license to kill.”
“If we know somebody has a history of dangerous behavior,” she said, “are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?”

The gun metaphor was common in the thousands of vehicular manslaughter cases we looked at across California. One prosecutor described dangerous behavior behind the wheel as akin to firing a gun into a crowd.
In letters to the court, surviving relatives and friends described the hole left behind, writing about an empty seat at a high school graduation, a photo cutout taken without fail to home baseball games.
It’s a void one young man tried to explain to authorities — the sudden, violent, blink-of-an-eye moment where life forever changes. For him, it was at 6:45 p.m. on Feb. 27, 2020, on Lone Tree Way in the Bay Area city of Antioch.
Two brothers, ages 11 and 15, were going to meet their dad at a Burger King. They crossed to the median and then waited for a break in the traffic before continuing to the other side. The older one made it across, according to court documents. His younger brother stepped into the street just as a driver gunned his car to 75 miles an hour — 30 over the speed limit. 
The older boy watched as his younger brother “just disappeared.”

The UC says others were restored, too.","In summary
The National Institutes of Health restored a leading University of California researcher’s $36 million grant studying dementia on Friday after terminating it three weeks ago as part of the Trump administration’s DEI purge. The UC says others were restored, too. 


The National Institutes of Health reversed its termination of a $36 million grant to a UC Davis researcher studying dementia, a day after CalMatters wrote about the cancelled grant and the researcher filed an appeal. 
The National Institutes of Health cancelled the grant last month, following the Trump administration’s ban on federal spending on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.Charles DeCarli, a neurologist at UC Davis and lead researcher on the project, got a notice from the agency Friday morning that he could again use the grant’s funds and conduct his research. The agency gave no reason for the reversal. The project included 1,700 participants with mild cognitive impairments plus 28 research and clinical sites across the country. 
The notice came after DeCarli and UC Davis officials submitted an appeal contesting the termination Wednesday night. A CalMatters story detailing the fallout from his grant’s cancellation ran Thursday morning.DeCarli’s grant was among the roughly 30 projects that the National Institutes of Health cut at the University of California since February. Those projects included developing a coronavirus vaccine, studying HIV prevention and assessing how racial discrimination affects the health of older gay men. The UC grants were worth $173 million and the terminated portions totalled $38 million. Nationally, the agency killed off more than 700 grants. The NIH is the world’s largest funder of health science research.On March 21 the agency canceled DeCarli’s grant and froze about $10 million in remaining funds it awarded the project last September. With the grant funds frozen, the ongoing work of evaluating the current participants through MRI imaging and blood analysis ceased.The NIH’s termination letter said that DeCarli’s work “does not effectuate NIH priorities” — a phrase used in letters to other researchers whose grants were terminated.DeCarli’s research project focused on understanding how dementia affects all Americans and considered demographic details that included not just race and ethnicity but also education levels and where in the U.S. individuals live. The NIH awarded him the grant in Trump’s first term. The grant application required that projects reflect the “gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the United States.”
State, national lawsuits against NIH cuts
California’s attorney general sued the NIH over the cancellations on April 4, joining a coalition of 15 other state attorneys general trying to force the agency to reverse their rescissions. The lawyers argue that the cuts violated a law passed by Congress and are unconstitutional. It’s one of the growing list of legal actions the state has taken against the Trump administration in response to federal funding cuts, including health research. Other groups have also sued the NIH, arguing that the agency is illegally conducting an “ongoing ideological purge” by stripping funding from grants it perceives as focused on DEI.The often-conservative editorial board of the Wall Street Journal wrote last week that “taking a machete to research funds and contracts will undermine public support for the (Trump) Administration’s goals.”An article in the highly respected Journal of the American Medical Association warned that President Donald Trump’s campaign to gut research that examines health issues in women and diverse demographic groups may lead to harmful drug side effects. That’s because studies with less diverse participants may not catch genetic or other biological differences that make a drug safe for one group but lead to defects for another. In one infamous case, a medicine whose drug trial excluded pregnant women resulted in thousands of babies born with deformed or missing limbs. The NIH only required that women be included in research it funds between 1989 and 1993, the article said. 
Dementia project still compromised
In addition to DeCarli’s, other grants at the University of California were reinstated, said UC office of the President spokesperson Stett Holbrook on Saturday. He didn’t indicate which ones were brought back or when those notices appeared. But at least one notable grant has yet to be restored: a project studying the benefits and risks of the shingles vaccine at UC San Francisco that received national media attention, said Kristen Bole, a spokesperson for UCSF, on Friday.
Even with the funds returned, DeCarli said it’ll take a month to restore the project’s operations and that the research will likely be permanently limited. His team needed roughly 500 more participants to bolster the scientific analysis. “I’m not sure we’re going to meet that number,” he said. Just before the grant was terminated, his team was recruiting about 90 participants a month. He and his colleagues will lead webinars for individuals who were already participating in the study to explain the pause in research. DeCarli expects some participants won’t return to the study. 
He’ll also need to reestablish subcontracts with other university sites to continue the research. Those include the clinical work at UC San Diego and University of Southern California to recruit participants, draw blood and conduct MRIs; statistical analysis at UC San Francisco and work at UCLA reviewing blood samples.He’s grateful for the legal and administrative work UC Davis and the UC Office of the President provided him in contesting the termination. His appeal was 18 pages and took three weeks to write. In it, he argued that the grant reflected major scientific priorities, including a law Congress passed more than a decade ago to study dementia. He received input from other scientists across the country on how to rebut the NIH. “I have a very strong faith, and it helps to say, OK, God, what do I do here?” he added. “No magic answer” appeared, but the message he felt was, “just hang in there, you know, just help me to let go of something.”
Five million Americans suffer from dementia, which is a loss of the ability to think and remember. While Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, there are others. DeCarli’s work examines the role vascular problems, such as injury to blood vessels in the brain, plays in dementia. At its most serious, dementia causes people to rely on others for basic tasks, such as eating and bathing.
In its original cancellation letter, the NIH wrote that “research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/UC-Davis-Campus-MG-CM-13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137

(Molly Montgomery/Searchlight NM)In January and February, county governments in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and North Carolina began passing resolutions containing nearly identical language. The resolutions oppose what they refer to as an “abuse” of the Antiquities Act of 1906. Enacted by Congress as people went west and frequently looted from historic sites, the law gave presidents the authority to protect any area on federal lands by declaring it a national monument. A deep anti-federal current runs through the county resolutions, and they express support for extractive industries and a general objection to “the designation of lands, whether private lands or government lands as national monuments, wilderness, wilderness study areas, wildlife preserves, open space, or other conservation land.”

Hutchinson regularly communicates with a network of private property rights activists who jokingly refer to themselves as the Secret Meeting. He says that when reporters ask him for the group’s name, “the response might be, ‘If we told you, we would have to kill you.’”

These convictions flow from a right-wing anti-regulatory movement that raged through the 1990s and is surging during the second Trump administration. Those who rally around such ideas believe that the federal government is imposing its values on them, and that public lands would be best-managed by local or state governments — or privatized. Luna County Commissioner Colette Chandler, for instance, who supports the resolutions, believes that a blend of state land management and private ownership would be ideal, and contends that New Mexico should oversee areas in the state currently in federal hands. (See maps below showing various types of New Mexico public lands.) The federal government, she told me, “shouldn’t just be able to dictate to us exactly how to handle our own land, in our own place.”

In March, Chandler delivered copies of the resolutions to lawmakers in Washington, D.C.  Meanwhile, at the highest levels of government, activists and politicians have been lobbying for sales and transfers of federal lands. Last August, the state of Utah filed a case in the U.S. Supreme Court calling for a transfer of lands from federal to state management; the Court ultimately declined to hear it. In January, House Republicans adopted a rules package that simplified the process of passing lands from federal to state and local control. On a menu of options for a reconciliation bill, the House Ways and Means Committee listed “Sell Federal Land” as a possibility, which GOP members of both the Senate and the House are currently debating.
These actions go against what most New Mexicans hope to see. Eighty-nine percent of state residents believe that existing national monument designations from the last decade should remain in place, while 66 percent do not think New Mexico should have control over federal lands, according to a 2025 Colorado College State of the Rockies poll. Every member of the state’s congressional delegation has in various ways expressed support for maintaining federal protections on public lands. In January, Representative Gabe Vasquez co-sponsored proposed bipartisan legislation that would largely ban the sale or transfer of lands managed by the Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service.
“Our cherished public lands should remain in the hands of the public so that New Mexicans and the American public can enjoy them in perpetuity, including national monuments established through the Antiquities Act,” Vasquez said in a March 21 statement. He pointed out that public lands generate billions of dollars in economic activity and support thousands of jobs.

Supporters of federal land management are motivated by a fear that a rollback of protections could make beloved places vulnerable to sale and irreparable harm. “You and I are not going to be the private hands buying up that land,” Luna County Commissioner Ray Trejo told me. “It’s going to be the Elon Musks of the world, the Ted Turners, the Rockefellers.”
Trejo, southern New Mexico outreach coordinator for the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, grew up around Deming. On surrounding BLM lands, during hunting season, he’d spend afternoons and weekends hunting doves and rabbits. As an adult, he hunts quail three or four days a week during the season. Ninety percent of the meat he consumes is venison he harvests. He opposes Luna County’s current version of the resolution, which takes the form of a proclamation, and he hopes to ensure that future generations can spend time on public lands.
To understand the anti-federal sentiment in New Mexico, I started by focusing on the resolutions. Who created them? Was it the county commissioners? A constituent? A think tank?

The federal government currently oversees about a third of all lands in New Mexico. Around 55 percent of that total is managed by the Bureau of Land Management; 37 percent by the Forest Service (which is part of the Department of Agriculture); around 5 percent by the Defense Department; and around 1 percent by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The state is full of important national monuments; some of the most beloved include El Malpais, Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks, Bandelier, the Organ Mountains, the Aztec Ruins and the Gila Cliff Dwellings.

“A fine drafting”
New Mexico counties that have passed versions of the resolution — which is usually called Resolution Opposing Abuse of the Antiquities Act — include Catron, Otero, Hidalgo and Sierra.
It was difficult to reach commissioners who voted in favor of it, and little was clarified when I did. Catron County Commissioner Audrey McQueen approved a version of the resolution in January but told me she couldn’t remember why. She directed me to Catron County Commissioner Haydn Forward. Forward said that Catron County attorneys based their resolution on a Luna County version.
In the conversations I had, a name kept coming up: Howard Hutchinson. Hutchinson is a private property rights activist in his mid-70s who lives in Glenwood, New Mexico. For decades, he’s been arguing that federal lands should be managed by states or privatized. “I am such a staunch believer in private property that any property that is under state control is problematic,” he told me during one of several interviews.

Since the 1990s, Hutchinson has served as the executive director of the Coalition of Arizona/New Mexico Counties for Stable Economic Growth, an organization that advocates for private property rights and increased resource extraction. The Coalition’s membership consists of representatives from the ranching and agricultural industries as well as county officials from eleven counties in New Mexico and five in Arizona. (Historically, mining and timber industry representatives also participated, Hutchinson told me, but none are currently active in the organization.)
How county officials are selected for Coalition membership is unclear. At least four Coalition members listed as representing counties on the board are not currently elected officials, and one member, Peggy Judd, a former Republican county supervisor in Cochise, Arizona, pleaded guilty to refusing to certify the 2022 midterm elections. “It’s up to each county commission or county supervisors to appoint a representative,” Hutchinson said. But Trejo said he knows of no public or government process behind the selection, and that he has never received an invitation to join.
Each entity that joins has to pay yearly dues: According to a membership application on the Coalition’s website, counties are charged $2,600, “major corporations” $1,000 and livestock organizations $500. “The industries are basically there in an advisory capacity,” Hutchinson told me. “In other words, we go to them and we say, ‘Will this federal regulation impact X, Y, Z?’ And then we take that information and the data behind their answer to formulate policy.”

Hutchinson initially said that he saw a version of the resolution when Luna County Commissioner Colette Chandler sent it to him. He said she wrote it and shared it with him after Luna County adopted it; he then sent it out through his channels across the U.S. — to other county commissioners, fellow property rights activists and the American Stewards of Liberty, a Texas-based think tank that promotes the sale of federal lands.
Several details conflict with Hutchinson’s account, however. Luna County still has not yet passed the proclamation that represents their version of the resolution. Chandler said that the Luna County attorney, Charles Kretek, drafted the proclamation, and that she didn’t send it to Hutchinson.
A response to an Inspection of Public Records Act request filed in Sierra County turned up an email that Hutchinson sent to members of the Coalition in mid-December 2024. “At our December 11th meeting it was asked that a resolution template be drafted opposing the Antiquities Act counties or organizations can adopt,” he wrote. “Please see the attached template.” The attachment, a Word document, lists “Howard Hutchinson” as its author. (Another public records request returned an email from Commissioner Forward, saying that he had modified Catron County’s resolution from Hutchinson’s version, a statement at odds with Forward’s claim that the resolution came from Luna County.)
When I showed Hutchinson a copy of the template and asked if he knew who wrote it, he said, “I’m not sure who actually wrote this, but it looks like it’s like a template that somebody started circulating.” When I said that the document’s properties list him as the author, and that he circulated it, he said, “I may have taken it and scanned it and pasted it into a Word document.” He said he didn’t remember where he’d scanned it from. In a follow-up email, he wrote: “Well, I did not remember drafting the resolution but upon looking at the original document ‘properties’ I was shown to be the author. Well now I can pat myself on the back for a fine drafting.”
“Unilaterally making a decision”
Hutchinson is behind other county actions calling for an end to federal management of lands. Last October, a couple of months before counties began passing the resolutions, the Coalition and others filed an amicus brief in support of Utah’s lawsuit seeking a transfer of lands from federal to state control.
The eleven New Mexico counties of the Coalition are named in the brief, though the decision-making process for signing onto the suit was not made transparent. Chaves and Roosevelt counties are misspelled “Chavez” and “Rosevelt” at one point in the brief. At least four counties — Eddy, Otero, Hidalgo and McKinley — posted nothing about the brief on agendas for public meetings between last August, when Utah filed its suit, and January, when the Supreme Court declined to hear it. Catron, Socorro, Roosevelt, Lea and Luna counties listed the matter only on agendas for meetings that occurred after the brief was already submitted. At press time, the Coalition website listed meeting minutes only through last July — the month before Utah filed  suit.

The effort to file the brief was “anti-democratic,” said Mark Allison, executive director of the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, a statewide nonprofit working to protect wildlands. “It seemed like they were unilaterally making a decision without providing the public the opportunity to be aware of or weigh in on that decision about their public lands.” He noted that there are New Mexico Wilderness Alliance members across all eleven counties who do not want to see a transfer of public lands.
When Catron, Socorro, Roosevelt, Lea and Luna included discussion about Utah’s suit on their agendas, they did so to debate whether to contribute financially to the efforts behind the brief — not to debate whether to sign onto it in the first place. In a November 2024 email to Coalition members, Hutchinson wrote that Socorro, Catron and Roosevelt intended to contribute $500 each to fund the “crafting” of the brief and asked if other counties wanted to contribute. Socorro and Roosevelt made public their plans to contribute last October and November, as did Lea County. Catron County Commissioners approved a contribution at a December meeting.
Luna County Commissioners discussed the possibility of contributing but ultimately decided not to pay for the brief, in part out of concern that doing so would violate the New Mexico Anti-Donation Clause, which states that no county “shall directly or indirectly lend or pledge its credit or make any donation to or in aid of any person, association or public or private corporation.”
“I said, not ‘no,’ but ‘hell, no,’” Commissioner Trejo told me. “I wasn’t going to send our taxpayer dollars to Utah.” He believes the New Mexico Attorney General should investigate the counties that did contribute money to support the filing.

How transfer becomes sale
Utah filed its case, Utah v. United States, in the Supreme Court by invoking the Court’s original jurisdiction. (The Constitution allows a state to file a case with the Court when the state is suing another state or the federal government.) After the Court declined to hear it, Gov. Spencer Cox raised the possibility of pursuing it in a federal district court. Even if the state does take that route, legal experts are skeptical it will prevail. The lawsuit tests whether courts, interpreting the Constitution, have the power to order a transfer of federal lands — which is highly unlikely, according to John Leshy, a law professor at the University of California, who wrote a history of public lands called “Our Common Ground.” “The Utah theory is really muddled,” he told me. “I don’t regard this, frankly, as a serious lawsuit.”
But there’s no doubt Congress could get rid of all federal lands, Leshy said. If activists “can create a political movement that catches fire, then from the standpoint of people who love public lands, the worst could happen,” he said. “It is something that’s worth taking seriously.”
Those who call for the transfer of federal lands often say they want the lands to remain public, but under state control, and are not worried that the states would sell off the land. “The states aren’t stupid,” said Commissioner Chandler. “They’re not going to just all of a sudden decide, ‘Well, we can’t have this anymore.’ They’ll decide what’s best for the state, and the state legislation comes from the people, the voice of the people.”

But if Congress were to take action to sell off lands, which are likely worth trillions, conservationists and legal experts are skeptical that they would simply pass the lands to the states. “There’s really no mechanism to dispose of them in that mass quantity right now, so Congress would probably have to take some sort of an action to set up a system,” said David Willms, the associate vice president of the National Wildlife Federation and an adjunct professor at the University of Wyoming. “If you look at the value of those lands, and this is a little bit of speculation, it would be very difficult to get the bipartisan support you’d need to get a bill to pass Congress to just flat give those acres to a state with nothing in return.”
If a transfer to state management were to happen, extraction and privatization would likely follow. Western states, including New Mexico, have constitutional mandates to maximize revenue from state lands. “Because of that, states have very frequently sold those state trust lands, when their land boards have determined that the highest economic value of those lands actually is through selling them,” said Willms. Since becoming a state, New Mexico has sold off four million acres, close to a third of its trust land. The presence of oil under New Mexico’s ground could make management of federal lands profitable for the state — but extraction would then likely occur in places that are currently protected.
The Secret Meeting
Hutchinson regularly communicates with a network of private property rights activists who jokingly refer to themselves as the Secret Meeting. He says that when reporters ask him for the group’s name, “the response might be, ‘If we told you, we would have to kill you.’”
On a Sunday afternoon, we met outside the New Mexico Roundhouse, which, he told me, he’s been coming to for 35 years. “What you’re looking at here,” he said, waving at the structure, “this is corruption at its finest example.”
He does not believe humans have caused climate change. People, because of their “arrogance,” overestimate human impact on the climate, he said. “To surrender my personal liberty to a bunch of grafters in this building, and in Washington, D.C., so that they can pretend to adjust a thermostat for the climate, I have no desire for that.”
Over the course of eight decades, Hutchinson moved from one side of the political spectrum to the other. He was born in Mobile, Alabama, but his family moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico, when he was two, and then to southern California when he was in third grade. His mother was an “avid strict construction constitutionalist,” he told me, and as a young man, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he rebelled against her by becoming a socialist.
He was an early supporter of Earth First!, a radical-left environmental organization founded in New Mexico in 1980 by activists reacting against the moderate tactics of the conservation movement. Its eco-warriors unrolled 300 feet of black plastic down Glen Canyon Dam to make the structure look cracked, hammered metal into the trunks of trees to stop loggers and dressed up as bears to protest the uranium industry.
“I believed that the collective was the motivating force behind a person’s activities, so centralized command-and-control government was more of a positive than a negative,” Hutchinson said. “I’m 180 degrees out from that.” Even so, he still considers himself an environmentalist. “In my mind and spirit, I am still very much a radical environmentalist, but I have changed my view of what entails being a good steward,” he said.
The shift began in the forest. In the 1970s and ’80s, Hutchinson told me, he contracted with the Forest Service around Glenwood, thinning growth and planting trees and actually living for eight years in the woods. “I got an observational perspective of looking at forest health and how everything in forest health was interconnected as an ecosystem,” he said.
He also read extensively about ecology and forest and species management. “I’m kind of a weirdo. When someone purports giving me a fact, I start researching, looking for science papers.” What he learned eventually led to a disillusionment with Forest Service policy and its misapplication, which hardened into a conviction that the federal government could not be a responsible steward of land.
By the ’90s, alongside staunchly anti-federal activists, Hutchinson was working with the Coalition, which formed at the beginning of that decade. Several of the activists prioritized economic concerns over environmental considerations. Since its early days, the Coalition received funding from mining, timber and livestock interests.
Hutchinson now tends to lead with a call for state management of lands. During our first round of phone interviews, he told me he wants state government to manage federal lands and argued that such management would “give the public greater access” to natural resources.
But when I called a county commissioner who approved of an Antiquities Act resolution in Cherokee County, North Carolina, I learned that Hutchinson views state land management as only the second-best option. The commissioner, an ophthalmologist named Dan Eichenbaum, presented the resolution to the Cherokee County Commission after Hutchinson shared it with him. He runs a website called Dr. Dan’s Freedom Forum, which invites visitors to pray for Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance and sells T-shirts that show Trump’s face and read “Guilty of Making America Great Again!” He says that he and Hutchinson are old friends, and he argues that “private property is what separates us from totalitarian governments.”
I found an article Hutchinson wrote on the Freedom Forum last July, calling for the privatization of public lands. In subsequent conversations, he told me he believes private management of all lands would be ideal.
The Antiquities Act
The county resolutions opposing the Antiquities Act describe monument designations as “land grabs.” President Trump used similar language in 2017, calling the designations “a massive federal land grab,” when he rolled back protections on Bears Ears, a place sacred to several tribal nations — including the Navajo Nation, the Pueblo of Zuni and the Hopi, Ute Mountain Ute and Ute Indian Tribes — and coveted by corporations for uranium mining. Using the Antiquities Act, Obama had declared the place a national monument in 2016, and a year later, Trump reduced its boundaries by 85 percent. (Biden restored the boundaries.)
The “land grab” characterization is misleading. The Antiquities Act stipulates that the president can designate any area a national monument on lands that are already federal; monument status gives those lands extra legal protections. In some cases, a president has designated a monument on a recently acquired area after private owners willingly sold or donated their land. But the Act does not give the president the power to condemn and seize land to designate it a monument — and no president has ever done so.
“There’s no circumstance where the federal government, the president, has said, ‘Hey, there’s a bunch of private land, let’s go take it,’” said Justin Pidot, a law professor at the University of Arizona who served in both the Obama and Biden administrations. “There are kid gloves around private property.”
Those who criticize the Act — a group that includes Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts — also feel that the legal protections following a designation are overly restrictive to commercial interests, and that the president should not be able to put such restrictions in place without approval from Congress.

“I don’t think that one man, namely the president in this instance, should have a say over everybody in the country,” said Luna County Commissioner Colette Chandler. “He shouldn’t be able to dictate to us exactly how we’re going to feel about something.” The controversy around the Act in Luna County is especially contentious: one group of constituents hoped that the Florida Mountains, which jut out from federal lands within county borders, would be declared a national monument, while another group rallied against the designation.
But presidents have often issued protections that are less restrictive than what is laid out in law, Pidot notes. And the Act’s stipulations respect pre-existing mining and grazing rights. Designations have usually come about after local groups, tribes or state officials asked for them. The claim that the president has unchecked power to restrict access to land is also not accurate — Congress is able to overturn any national monument designation the president issues. Over the past century, the Supreme Court has upheld Antiquities Act designations several times, in suits whose plaintiffs alleged that presidents had abused their power with the law.
At an April 3 public meeting about the Luna County proclamation, several constituents who spoke against its passage noted its endorsement of extractive industries and voiced concern about the consequences of decreased regulation. (Commissioners and the county attorney may still change the wording of the proclamation; those who spoke at the meeting were referring to a version published in February.) Deming resident Charles Feyh questioned the idea that giving Congress oversight on national monument designations would increase local power and argued that mining and oil and gas industries can more easily influence Congress than they can a president. The “phantom proclamation,” he said, “is not really getting more power to the local people.”
Commissioner Trejo read a statement written by Keegan King, founder of the Native Land Institute, who noted that the Act has often been used to protect sacred indigenous lands. “For more than a century, this law has been one of the few tools that recognizes a deep and enduring connection tribal nations have to our ancestral lands, has protected sacred places, preserved cultural landscapes, ensured that our stories, the stories of this land, are not erased,” wrote King. “To dismantle these protections serves no real public need. It answers no call from the people. Instead, it is driven by corporate interests that view these lands only in terms of extraction and profit.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/floridamountains-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-14 09:01:11.382137
,California,2025-04-14 12:28:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers quietly sideline bills in secretive suspense process,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/04/california-lawmakers-killed-bills/,"More than 100 California bills moved to the “suspense file” last week, the start of a process where consequential decisions are made out of public view.","In summary
More than 100 California bills moved to the “suspense file” last week, the start of a process where consequential decisions are made out of public view.


In just 24 minutes and without any debate, the most powerful committee in the state Senate last week moved 33 bills from public view into a secretive process that will decide whether the measures live or die.
Two days later, its sister committee in the Assembly moved 82 of its bills in under two minutes to the same secretive, uncertain future.
If history is any guide, between a quarter to a third of those bills will be killed next month. For most of the bills, no one but lobbyists, a handful of capital staffers, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s policy team will know exactly why.
So it goes with the Senate and Assembly’s appropriations committees, the gatekeepers for bills proposing to spend taxpayer money. The committees’ “suspense files” are where hundreds of bills die quietly each year. The fates of the bills that were moved to the file last week – along with dozens of others that will be added later – will be announced in a single hearing on what’s known as “suspense day” scheduled for May. 
As CalMatters has reported, members of the Legislature almost never vote in public hearings to kill bills by attaching their names to a formal “no” vote. For instance, of 2,403 bills that died in the two-year session that concluded last fall, only 25 were killed by a majority of lawmakers voting “no.” Instead, bills tend to die behind the scenes. It can be incredibly difficult for members of the public to learn who killed a measure and why.The appropriations committees’ suspense files are the most notorious example. 
The opaque process frustrates some lawmakers, including Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Democrat representing Moreno Valley. He has criticized Democratic leadership for not doing more to address homelessness, inequality and people moving out of state.
“The way we treat the appropriations process is a non-democratic process; I believe that it’s a corrupt process,” Jackson said.
Per decades-old policy, any bill that’s estimated to cost taxpayers at least $50,000 gets placed on the suspense file. Twice a year – once in May and again in August – the committees announce which bills move bills off of “suspense” and can advance through the Legislature.
Last summer, the committees culled about a third of the 830 bills that had been placed on suspense. Some of them were controversial.Republicans were outraged that the committee didn’t vote on their bill seeking to add new requirements before state officials could place “sexually violent predators” in communities.
The Senate’s top Republican, Sen. Brian Jones of San Diego, accused Democratic leaders of protecting “predators over families.”

But some Democrats, including Jackson, also were frustrated. Jackson had a child tax credit bill die in the suspense file. Asked last week if he knew who was responsible for killing the bill, Jackson said, “That’s part of the process. You don’t know in many cases.”
When cost estimates kill California bills
Other Democrats last summer also accused the Newsom administration of inflating cost estimates to kill health care legislation the governor’s team didn’t like through the suspense process. The Newsom administration insisted its estimates were accurate. 
“The administration looks forward to tackling some of the most pressing policy challenges with the Legislature, but doing so within the confines of our budgetary constraints,” Christian Beltran, legislative director for Newsom’s Department of Finance, told the Senate Appropriations Committee last week.Last week, the 82 bills that moved to the Assembly appropriations suspense file included measures on overnight parking for homeless students, vending machine prices in prisons and corporate homeownership.
In the Senate committee, measures on indigenous missing persons cases, gun-dealership inspections and the formation of a California Latino Commission were all moved to the suspense file.
Now the behind-the-scenes work begins for lobbyists such as Chris Micheli, who is advocating for a bill that was moved last week to suspense.
“You’re going to have conversations with the staff of the committee and the members of the committee, particularly the chair, who is most influential in terms of what bills, you know, stay or go,” Micheli said.
Appropriations chairs make hard calls
Former chairs of the appropriations committees – called “approps” in Capitol shorthand – told CalMatters it can be a difficult position to be in. The chairs often have to make tough decisions to kill particularly controversial, poorly thought out or expensive bills that the leaders of the other legislative committees didn’t want to make.

“I would get angry with people,” said Lorena Gonzalez, a former Democratic assemblymember from San Diego who is now president of the California Labor Federation. “I’d have policy (committee) chairs come to me and they’re like, ‘Oh, I couldn’t kill these. But here are the bills I think you should kill.’ I’m like, you know, ‘Grow some balls.’ ” 
Plus, chairs also have to deal with colleagues who take it personally when their favorite bills are killed.
Mike Gatto, a former Democratic Assembly appropriations chair from Los Angeles, said he faced intense blowback from some colleagues. He said one fellow Democrat targeted him during a reelection campaign after Gatto killed his bill in suspense. Another retaliated by killing one of Gatto’s bills in a different committee.
“My mandate was to engage in a cost-benefit analysis for the good of the state, to make sure that we did not spend any more than we had,” Gatto said. “Maybe I took the mandate too seriously, or maybe I was not that great with managing human relationships, but I ended up having a number of very upset colleagues.”
Gonzalez said she didn’t think it was fair to call the suspense file process secretive. She said anyone can review the committee’s fiscal estimates and its analyses and weigh in. 
But in the end, it’s the chairperson who usually has to take the heat.
“‘I think everybody leaves being approps chair with a lot of people upset with them,” she said.

When we began looking into it, we found that while there has been research on infrastructure, technology and engineering solutions, there had been little study of the drivers who cause bad crashes.
So we asked the California Department of Motor Vehicles for data on drivers involved in fatal and serious-injury collisions. The agency said it would cost thousands of dollars and take many, many months to provide such data. One reason: The DMV would have to pay outside technical experts to query its own database, which dates to “the late 1970s and is built, at least in part, on programming language that dates back to the 1950s,” said Joseph Chapman, attorney with the agency.

How we did it: Reporting on California’s deadly drivers


We then tried to get accident reports from cities, but those aren’t always public records. 
As a workaround, we went to all 58 county district attorneys’ offices in the state and asked for lists of vehicular manslaughter and homicide cases filed from 2019 through early last year. That’s a subset of fatal crashes. Roughly 1 in 5 fatal collisions appear to lead to a criminal case in California.
The records provided a foundation to study who was causing deadly accidents. But they were just lists. They didn’t tell us the story of each case. To understand the details, we would need to review the court records. However, there’s no centralized system for California court records. We’d have to review them in person.
We sent a team of nine reporters to courthouses throughout the state to review more than 3,600 case files, either on paper or from a computer terminal in the courthouse.
We were able to do this review for all but two counties that had manslaughter cases. Santa Cruz District Attorney Jeffrey Rosell’s office was the only one that refused to release a list of cases. San Bernardino provided us a list, but we weren’t able to review the specific cases — roughly 300 — for a variety of reasons: Files weren’t available in the courthouse, imaged documents weren’t uploaded to public portals at the court, and a clerk said the office lost our request for information on the criminal complaints.
Finally, we needed to understand the driving records of the people charged with manslaughter. 
Under state law, certain information on a driver’s record is public. Generally, that includes accidents and citations within the past three years, DUIs within the past 10 years, and information on any suspensions or revocations that are in effect or were recently lifted. So while the records aren’t particularly helpful in identifying a long-term pattern of reckless driving, they do show recent incidents and a driver’s current license status. 
We put in thousands of requests with the DMV for drivers’ records, using information gleaned from the court records, such as driver’s license numbers and dates of birth. (We weren’t able to search for some defendants, because the web portal for requesting the records only allows for searches of a certain length — some drivers’ last names were simply too long. In other cases, it’s possible we had a bad driver’s license number or other information that didn’t match what is in the DMV’s database.) Ultimately, we were able to get the DMV driving records for more than 2,600 of the motorists charged with vehicular manslaughter or homicide since 2019.
Manually entering information from the reports into our database of deadly drivers, we were able to spot trends. 
We then contacted officials, experts, victims’ families, prosecutors, defense attorneys and drivers accused of causing deadly crashes. We contacted a defense attorney or the defendant — often both — in every case mentioned in the story. Unless noted in the story, they either declined to speak with us or did not respond.
This is the first story of what will be an ongoing series looking at deadly drivers in California and the systemic issues that lead to so many roadway deaths.

Ervin Wyatt’s history behind the wheel spreads across two pages of a recent court filing: Fleeing police. Fleeing police again. Running a red light. Causing a traffic collision. Driving without a license, four times. A dozen speeding tickets.
Yet the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued him a license in 2019. Wyatt promptly got three more speeding tickets, court records show. Prosecutors say he was speeding again in 2023 when he lost control and crashed into oncoming traffic, killing three women. He’s now facing murder charges in Stanislaus County.
The DMV routinely allows drivers like these — with horrifying histories of dangerous driving, including DUIs, crashes and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways, a CalMatters investigation has found. Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill. Some go on to kill again. 
We reviewed vehicular manslaughter cases in California from 2019 through early 2024 to understand how the state handles dangerous drivers.
The court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.
Here are the key takeaways from our investigation:
1. The DMV misses — or ignores — patterns of reckless behavior on the roads that persist for years, failing to stop dangerous drivers before they kill.
The state system that targets motorists who rack up tickets is designed to catch clusters of reckless behavior, not long-term patterns.
The state suspends a driver’s license for accumulating four points in a year, six points in two years or eight points in three years. What does it take to get that many points? Using a cellphone while driving is zero points. A speeding ticket is a point. Vehicular manslaughter is two points.
And while there are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for certain crimes, like DUIs, there is no such requirement for many vehicular manslaughter convictions.
It’s often up to the DMV whether to act. Routinely it doesn’t.
2. Nearly 40% of drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license, according to DMV records.
That’s about 1,000 out of 2,600 drivers for whom we obtained DMV reports, drivers like Joshua Daugherty.

In July 2020, Daugherty drifted onto the highway shoulder while driving near Mammoth Lakes, overcorrected to the left and lost control, court filings show. His Toyota Tacoma cut across the lane into oncoming traffic, where an SUV broadsided it. Daugherty’s girlfriend, 25-year-old Krystal Kazmark, died.
In August 2009, in a strikingly similar incident, Daugherty was speeding along a Riverside County highway when his Ford Expedition drifted onto the shoulder. Witnesses told police he hit a dirt embankment and went airborne, the SUV flipping onto its roof. A 16-year-old girl riding in the back died.
He was convicted of vehicular manslaughter in both cases. The DMV suspended his license after his conviction for killing Kazmark. But it wasn’t enough to keep him off the road. Before he could report to jail, two months after the conviction, police caught him driving on a suspended license.
The DMV reissued Daugherty a license in July 2024.
3. The DMV often takes no action against drivers convicted of killing someone on the road. 
State law requires the agency to strip motorists of their driving privileges for three years after a felony vehicular manslaughter conviction. But there is no such requirement for most misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter convictions. It’s up to the DMV whether to do anything. 
We found nearly 200 drivers with a valid license whose DMV record shows a conviction for misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter but for whom there is no suspension listed.

That includes truck driver Ramon Pacheco, who made a U-turn in front of an oncoming motorcycle, killing 29-year-old Dominic Lopez-Toney, who was finishing his rotations to be a doctor. 
Court records show Pacheco had gotten in trouble behind the wheel before. He had been arrested for DUI in 2009, caused a collision in 2013 and got a ticket in 2016 for making an unsafe turn.
Months after San Joaquin prosecutors charged Pacheco with vehicular manslaughter, he got into another collision for which he was also deemed most at fault.
Pacheco ultimately pleaded no contest to misdemeanor manslaughter and received probation. His DMV record as of Feb. 11 indicates his driving privileges were never suspended; his commercial driver’s license is valid.

In the wake of the tragedy, Lopez-Toney’s mother has become an advocate for truck safety. 
“Road safety and truck safety is not a priority right now with our legislators, with our government,” Nora Lopez said. “Changing our mindset, our attitudes, our culture on the roads is not impossible.”
4. The DMV issued licenses to 150 drivers less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road. 
Prosecutors say Jadon Mendez was speeding in December 2021 in Santa Clara County when he lost control and caused a crash that killed a mother of three young children. A few weeks later, he got a speeding ticket. 
And yet, the DMV issued him his current driver’s license on Jan. 27, 2022 — 49 days after the fatal crash. Mendez’s manslaughter case is still open, and his license is still listed as valid. 
5. Nearly 400 of the drivers charged with killing someone got a ticket or were in another collision — or both — after their fatal crash. 
That’s about 15% of the drivers for whom we got the DMV reports. While the reports don’t indicate whether a driver was at fault in a crash, the records do suggest many drivers continue to drive dangerously even after killing someone on the road. 
A commercial driver drove his semi truck on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County in 2021. Less than a year later, he still had a valid license when he barreled his semi into slow-moving traffic, hitting four vehicles and killing a woman in Fresno County, records show. Another man, sentenced to nine years in prison for killing two women while driving drunk, got his privileges restored by the DMV after being paroled, only to drive high on meth in Riverside and weave head-on into another car, killing a woman.
6. Hundreds of drivers have vehicular manslaughter or related convictions that don’t appear in DMV records.
The apparent error means some drivers who should have had their driving privileges suspended instead show up in DMV records as having a valid license.
Between March 2017 and March 2022, Trevor Cook received two citations for running red lights, got two speeding tickets and was deemed responsible for two collisions, including one in which someone was injured, court records show.
Cook still had a valid license on April 14, 2022, a month after his last speeding ticket, when he blew through a Yolo County stop sign at more than 100 mph, killing Prajal Bista as he passed through the intersection, on his way to work after dinner and a movie with his wife, according to details of the crash that prosecutors included in court filings. Bista was driving the speed limit and on track to make it to work 30 minutes early.
On March 28, 2024, Cook pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter.
The manslaughter conviction — like hundreds of others we found — isn’t listed on Cook’s driving record. The DMV issued Cook his current driver’s license just a month after the conviction, agency records show. Less than two weeks after that, he got a ticket for disobeying a traffic signal.
“It’s stunning to me that eight months later his license is still showing as valid and the conviction for killing someone while driving is not reflected in his driving record,” said Melinda Aiello, chief deputy district attorney in Yolo County. “You killed somebody. I’d think there might be some license implications.”
7. The DMV denied our request to discuss our findings with Director Steve Gordon. 
Gordon instead issued a brief statement: “The modernization of our systems, including the launch of the Driver Safety Portal, reflects our ongoing commitment to enhancing accountability and transparency while continually refining our processes to ensure California’s roads are safer for everyone.”
Chris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, said the agency follows the law when issuing licenses. “We use our authority as mandated and as necessary,” he said.
Orrock said the DMV couldn’t comment on individual drivers. But he and agency officials did explain what happens after a deadly collision, a process that’s separate from any statutorily required suspensions following a conviction.
When law enforcement reports a fatal crash, the agency’s driver safety branch flags all drivers who might be at fault. It then looks into the collision and decides whether the agency should suspend those motorists’ driving privileges. If the driver contests the action, there’s a hearing that could include witness testimony. Suspensions are open-ended. Drivers need to ask for their license back, and agency personnel decide whether the suspension should end or continue. These discretionary suspensions typically last for about a year.
And while officials said the DMV can continue a suspension if they think a driver poses a danger, Orrock said they need to give drivers an opportunity to get their license back. He said there’s no process in the state “to permanently revoke a license.”

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.












We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith




Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday criminalizing human cloning 71-4, with 22 abstentions. 
HB 380, sponsored by Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville, makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, to engage in human cloning. Rigsby said during a brief debate on Wednesday that he is not aware of any human cloning happening in Alabama or the United States, but he said that is the direction science is going.
“We stand at a crossroads in science ethics and human dignity. The prospect of human cloning, once confined to science-fiction, now challenges us to make a firm moral and legal stand,” Rigsby said. “While technological advances have provided humanity with remarkable medical breakthroughs, not all scientific possibilities align with what is ethical, just and safe.”

The legislation defines human cloning as “asexual reproduction.” Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, expressed concern on how the legislation would affect in vitro fertilization (IVF). 
“In theory, it could happen accidentally,” Yarbrough said. “This is saying you can’t be intentionally trying to do so?”
Rigsby said the legislation includes a provision exempting IVF from the definition of asexual reproduction.
“They just wanted to make sure that their practices did not fall under what they do as cloning,” Rigsby said.
The crime includes those cloning humans, and anybody that participates in human cloning, including transportation of a cloned cell, according to the bill.
House Democrats criticized the legislation for being unnecessary. Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, questioned if other states have similar laws.
“I just didn’t know if mass cloning was going on,” she said. “I don’t know of anything or anybody that I’ve ever seen come through Alabama that I’d want to clone.”
Rep. A.J. McCampbell, D-Demopolis, echoed Givan.
“This sounds like science-fiction, cloning people,” he said. 
Rigsby said his bill is modeled after a 2003 law in Arkansas. Rigsby proposed a floor amendment to exclude university research on human organs. It passed 79-1.
“We have some universities that are doing some research on organs and they were a little concerned about line 38, ‘generate all or most of the body tissues of a living organism,’” Rigsby said.
The bill now goes to the Alabama Senate.

“Yes, we will build studios,” Democratic state Sen. Roberta Lange told lawmakers on the Senate Revenue and Economic Development Committee, which held a hearing for the bill on Thursday before referring it to the Senate Finance Committee. “We will be making movies. We will be making shows. But that’s just the beginning.”
Lange’s Senate Bill 220 seeks $1.6 billion in public subsidies over 18 years to support the construction and operation of a 34-acre film and production campus planned for a southwest Las Vegas lot owned by the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Nevada’s film tax credit program would jump from $10 million annually to $98 million in three years, then remain at $98 million annually for 15 years.
For that investment, the project is promising $9.8 billion in total production spending and the development of workforce pipelines into new industries. The campus would also include a dedicated media and technology lab for use by UNLV, Nevada State University, and College of Southern Nevada, as well as a second lab focused on creative technologies used both for entertainment and non-entertainment industries like defense and healthcare.
Lange emphasized the project will be built on public land and is a public-private partnership.
“That structure ensures that this development doesn’t just benefit a single company or a single decade,” she added. “It becomes a long-term public asset.”
Birtcher Development is developing the project and would own the buildings on the property. Birtcher would lease the land for 100 years. MBS Group, a film and television studio operator associated with more than 1,000 productions per year in studios across the globe, has signed on as the lead occupant of the studio space.
Consulting firm Camoin Associates estimates nearly 3,000 jobs would be created during construction and around 8,800 jobs would be created permanently. They estimate the total economic output at $33.3 billion over the 18-year period.
About $607 million of that would be directly through new state revenue — commerce, modified business and sales taxes.
Put another way: Camoin estimates that for every $1 of tax credits Nevada would receive $0.38 back in taxes and see $3.31 generated through wages.
SB220 would create a nonprofit called the Creative Technology Initiative focused on boosting Southern Nevada as a leader in video game design and publishing, aerospace and defense, and medical device and healthcare manufacturing. It would establish the UNLV Center for Creative Technologies.
The proposal is inspired by the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies, one of 14 research centers sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense, and the University of Utah’s Division of Games, which has become a leader in the video game industry.
Lange and her partners believe the initiative could tap into DOD and Veterans Affairs contracts and bring in additional billions in new economic investment over the next two decades.
Meanwhile, in Summerlin…
During the hearing for SB220, Lange did not mention the competing film tax credit proposal, Assembly Bill 238. That bill, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymembers Sandra Jauregui and Danielle Monroe Moreno, would establish a film and production studio in Summerlin. Sony Pictures, Warner Bros Discovery, and Howard Hughes Holdings are attached to the project.
https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/02/28/largest-public-subsidy-in-state-history-makes-legislative-debut/
Those partners previously worked with Lange on a film tax credit bill introduced in 2023. That bill, which asked for a staggering $4.9 billion in tax breaks over 25 years, languished and never made it out of its first committee, meaning this year’s duo of bills have already gone further.
Lange has previously said the partners “went radio silent” on her during the interim period between sessions and reemerged with a new bill sponsored by other lawmakers. She’s also said she believes the film tax credit bills should be combined.
Like Lange’s bill, the assembly bill was advanced out of the chamber’s revenue committee without recommendation after a lengthy hearing and referred to the chamber’s finance committee.
Either proposal would amount to the largest public subsidy ever approved by the state. Both are being considered at a time when lawmakers are openly worried about revenue shortfalls caused by a downturn in the economy, federal cuts to widely used programs like Medicaid, or both.
Lange acknowledged those concerns in her presentation.
“We are facing real economic headwinds,” she said. “This is not an optimistic time. Instabilities in markets and the economy will affect Nevada more than most. We are all asking ‘where do we go from here?’”
SB220, she added, is “a beacon of hope and a way forward that is visionary and practical.”
Both film tax credit bills are exempt from standard legislative deadlines. The legislative session runs through June 2.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nevada-Studios-Day-Rendering-Looking-east-4-8-23-1-1024x577.png,,,2025-04-14 08:10:12.577072

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives.
But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers.
In South Carolina, a sweeping energy bill passed by the Senate earlier this month includes limitations on incentives for data centers. Senators inserted the restrictions during floor debate before sending the amended bill back to the House.
Whether those limitations make it into state law depends on whether the House agrees with the changes.
Senate passes sweeping energy bill aimed at meeting SC’s growing power needs

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Data centers gobble up energy. Should SC block them from getting special deals?

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
In South Carolina, a deal approved by regulators last year allows a Google data center planned near Summerville to pay a special discounted rate that’s less than half of what residential customers pay.
“Even though they’re paying a rate 60% below, they’re consuming so much power that they’re paying a substantial amount of money to the utility,” state Commerce Secretary Harry Lightsey told senators during a hearing last fall.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue.
But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years.

The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules.
South Carolina’s energy bill, as amended by the Senate, includes language mirroring the Georgia regulation.
Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.

The lessons progress like any foreign language course. Start with food and water and how to get them. Gloine uisce, le do thoil. A glass of water, please.
Step outside and describe the weather. Tá sé grianmhar. It’s sunny. Or Tá sé dorcha agus scamallach. It’s dark and cloudy.
Then point out buildings. Cá bhfuil an ospidéal? Where is the hospital? And languages. Labhraím Béarla. I speak English.
I don’t know what drew me to this. My mother grew up in County Mayo in western Ireland, but outside of math she never spoke Irish around me. I doubt I’ll use Irish conversationally around the Alabama Statehouse, unless my cousins in Éire get commanded to do some kind of penance on Goat Hill.
But maybe it’s a feeling that the people in charge speak a patois the rest of us don’t.
Take health care.
Alabama has nation-leading rates of death from heart disease and strokes. More Alabamians die from gunfire each year than in New York State. Infant mortality is about twice as high among Black Alabamians as among whites.
Those are the fruits of poverty and systemic racism. Our ability to cope with all this, never great to begin with, is shrinking. Hospitals are closing. OB-GYNs don’t want to come here.
But instead of alleviating this misery, the Legislature seems determined to maintain it. Even exacerbate it.
In the last decade, they’ve forced women to travel hundreds of miles for basic health care. Lawmakers made it easier to get killed by a firearm. They’ve cut off life-saving treatments for gender dysphoria, sitting stone-faced amid parents’ pleas for their children. And their vindictive stubbornness in refusing Medicaid expansion continues to imperil state hospitals.
Now our elected officials want our kids exposed to preventable diseases, in the name of unverifiable “religious belief.”
And they’ve been rather meek about a looming assault on Alabama health care.
Congress is considering massive cuts to Medicaid — up to $880 billion — to pay for tax cuts for wealthy Americans. If they go through with it, Alabama could lose $824 million in funding for the program.
That’s a tsunami on the horizon.
Medicaid covers over 1 million people in Alabama. It pays for about half the births in the state. It’s critical to the functioning of Alabama’s hospitals and nursing homes in Alabama, which pay special taxes to the state to keep Medicaid going.
The program should get over $1 billion in state money next year, but that doesn’t come close to covering the costs. The federal government pays for about 73% of Medicaid in Alabama.
And if that funding gets cut? On paper, the state could raise taxes to replace what’s lost. But come on. This Legislature will not do that. That leaves one option: cutting Medicaid services.
That will hurt everyone because everyone’s health care in Alabama depends in some part on Medicaid. More hospitals will close. Pediatricians will scale back or end services.
The least bad outcome would be longer wait times for basic care. The worst outcome, especially in rural areas, is health care vaporizing. More illness; more avoidable death; more misery.
This ought to enrage our leaders, who lose their minds when a teacher acknowledges the existence of gay people.
But many of them got into government by claiming to hate government. So their vocabulary is an argot with many words for “cuts” and “bureaucracy” and none for “vital program” or “public servant.” They want a government so small that it can’t prevent powerful men from drowning Alabama in a bathtub.
You may remember President Donald Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. The bill he backed included an attempt to turn Medicaid into a block grant program. Enacting that would have slashed Alabama Medicaid to ribbons.
Hospitals and health care providers in the state all but screamed about the grave harm that would do to Alabama. The people who could stop the damage couldn’t understand. Every single Alabama Republican in Congress — eight of our nine representatives and senators — voted to kill state health care.
People who understand the importance of these and other public systems — whether trade or education — know that a conservative number-go-down approach to governance is poison to both the economy and the well-being of the governed.
And by and large, they’re ignored. Because those with power don’t understand.
They’re shoving hard-won expertise aside and tearing through fragile systems of public health care. Programs critical to our safety and well-being, erected over decades, are under attack from people who feel zero duty to those who elected them.
Rebuilding these services could take decades. Those who work to keep us healthy understand this. They have explained the dangers of what our decision-makers are doing in plain English.
But all our leaders hear is Tá sé dorcha agus scamallach. Cá bhfuil an ospidéal?

(File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Jesse Albright, along with his brother and father, has been operating Albright Farms in Baltimore County for decades, producing beef, pork and, more recently, eggs.
But Albright is one of dozens of local farmers who may lose significant business opportunities due to a recent decision to end a federal program that helps food pantries buy locally grown produce for low-income households — which he says would “be a blow” to farmers and the community.
“I think it’s great that we can provide local product to our local community,” Albright said. “It would be a blow to anybody who’s been selling through the LFPA program.”
He’s talking about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, shortened to LFPA, a Biden-era program that gives food banks extra funding to connect with local farmers and use their produce for meal assistance, as local products can be more expensive.
In March, the USDA, under the Trump administration, announced that LFPA program would come to an end in November, withholding millions from Maryland food banks that could affect not only the quality of food provided in meal programs, but also have a financial toll on the dozens of farmers who are part of those agreements.
Meanwhile, more Maryland families are looking to meal assistance programs, according to Meg Kimmel, chief operating officer of the Maryland Food Bank.
“At a time when there is historic levels of need that are not dropping, we cannot have our food distribution totals go backwards,” Kimmel said Friday.
The Maryland Food Bank serves as a meal assistance hub for a majority of the state, connecting with local food banks and pantries to expand outreach for families needing extra help putting food on the table. The Maryland Food Bank has LFPA agreements with 44 local Maryland farmers, and receives about $4 million through LFPA every 18 months.

Without those additional dollars, the Maryland Food Bank will have to “try to spread our dollars more broadly,” which will likely mean fewer purchases from local growers.
Capitol Area Food Bank is Maryland’s other food assistance hub, serving Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. The Maryland Food Bank covers the rest of the counties and Baltimore.
There are 33 local Maryland growers and farmers that work through the LFPA program with the Capitol Area Food Bank, which receives over $5 million from LFPA.
In a written statement Friday, Capital Area Food Bank CEO Radha Muthiah, said that “in Maryland alone, the LFPA has so far enabled CAFB to purchase and distribute more than 3 million meals worth of fresh local food, including items that we typically haven’t been able to offer to our clients due to higher costs.”
“The program has also been beneficial for farmers, giving them more certainty that they have a market for the foods they’re producing,” Muthiah said in the statement.
Albright can attest to that. Albright Farms entered an LFPA agreement with the Maryland Food Bank during the COVID pandemic, providing eggs for the food bank.
He said that the partnership with food banks through the LFPA program can help small farms, such as his own, build up production because they’re “growing product with the intent that they’re going to sell it to the food bank.”
“They’re putting an extra field of cabbage or tomatoes or sweet corn — whatever that product might be. They’re putting in additional acres and additional crop specific for the food banks that they’re selling to,” he said. “It’s no different with us and the chickens … We started small and as they’ve asked for more, we’ve grown our product more.”
Kimmel calls the LFPA a “win-win” for the food bank, families, and the local economy.
“We were able to leverage federal dollars to do things that we haven’t been able to do. We haven’t been able to buy highly-nutritious local food and pay farmers and producers a fair wage for their work. It was prohibitively expensive for us in the past,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s an economic stimulus program that has benefited our food system – there is nothing else that I have seen in the many years of being in this work that is remotely close to this,” Kimmel said.
If the LFPA program comes to an end on Nov. 30 as currently planned, Kimmel and the food bank will have to make hard decisions on how best to stretch their available funds. She said the first cost-saving action would be to invest in more fresh produce – which would be cheaper than protein, milk and eggs – but their goal is to sustain the number of pounds of food delivered to families. Asking for more donations would be a last resort for them.
Kimmel hopes the Trump administration will reconsider, and restore the program or create a new one that would achieve the same goals as the LFPA.
“It’s not just about buying food, it’s about investing and building in a stronger food system for our tiny little state, which I think is pretty magical,” she said.
Albright would also like to see the program continue, but he and his family are already talking about how to adapt if the LFPA agreements fall through.
“I think farmers have learned to be adaptive,” Albright said. “We try to plan – but I can’t plan for Mother Nature, so I think we’ve learned as a whole, farmers have to become adaptive to the ever-changing environment that we’re operating in.
“If we end up in a tight spot, we’ll have to figure it out,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4591-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 08:10:12.577072

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A Montgomery County Circuit Court Tuesday allowed lawsuits alleging the Alabama Department of Corrections and the University of Alabama System conspired to illegally harvest their loved ones’ organs to move forward.
Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge J.R. Gains rejected a motion from the defendants that argued the individuals and entities named in the lawsuit had civil immunity.
“While state officials are immune from certain claims in their official capacities, they are not entitled to sovereign immunity from civil liability in their individual capacities when their actions violate constitutional or statutory provisions, or when they act willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond their authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of law,” Gains wrote.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs and a spokesperson for the University of Alabama Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine declined comment. A message was sent to the Attorney General’s Office seeking comment.
The plaintiffs allege that the state took control of their loved one’s bodies after they died in prison and conspired to confiscate the deceased’s organs. The suit also alleges that both ADOC and UAB financially gained from the practice and never got permission from the deceased individuals’ families.
In 2018, a group of medical students at UAB noticed that a significant number of the specimens they encountered came from autopsies performed on individuals who died while incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons.
After further investigation, the lawsuit alleges, the students learned that “23% of their yearly income comes from Department of Corrections autopsies, and 29% comes from Alabama Department of Forensic Science,” according to the plaintiffs’ lawsuits.
The original lawsuit states that students also learned that the warden has the authority to request autopsies and to set limits on those autopsies, but it was routine for the warden to sign the paperwork indicating that no limit be placed for the autopsies performed.
Representatives of the opposing parties in the case verbally sparred over the motion during a hearing in February.
Attorneys for ADOC and the university said that their clients had absolute immunity that stems from the Alabama Constitution. They also challenged other aspects of the plaintiffs’ lawsuits on other grounds that included heightened pleading standards or because facts specific to the case did not apply.
For example, the defense attorneys argued  a conversion claim, based on the illegal taking of property, be dismissed because conversion does not apply to organs or human tissues.
“The Alabama Constitution states that ‘the State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity,’” attorneys for the defendants wrote. “This ‘wall of immunity’ is ‘absolutely impregnable’ with regard to the State of Alabama and its agencies, and it may not be waived.”
The defendants also argued a two-year statute of limitations on civil action had expired and barred the plaintiffs from proceeding with the case.
Gains rejected the statute of limitations argument in his Tuesday order, saying the suit was filed within the appropriate time frame.
Gains also said that the families had shown evidence that the state’s Uniform Anatomical Gift Act had been violated, and that they offered “more than mere circumstantial evidence of conspiracy in their complaints.”

Before the 2000s, RadioShack was the place to go if you needed a cable or help with anything tech related. Now, the last brick-and-mortar store in Maryland is closing its doors.
“I’m not one to sit at home, so I’m going to find something to do,” said Cindy Henning, the store’s manager and sole employee.
After more than 40 years, the RadioShack in Prince Frederick is shutting down.
Henning told WTOP she’s going to miss it dearly. She’s worked there for three decades.
“We would have a lot of fun. That was half of our day was to have fun with people and show them how electronics work,” Henning said.
It was owned and operated by longtime local resident Michael King, who passed away at the end of January at the age of 79. His son Edward has taken over as owner.
“It’s the end of an era,” he said.
King said his grandfather owned a TV repair shop in the ’50s and then his dad worked with him. They started carrying RadioShack products and grew to franchise three stores in Maryland.
The RadioShack franchise first declared bankruptcy in 2015. King said they used the RadioShack name, but they don’t have a warehouse in the U.S., so they were buying product from other wholesalers and selling it.
“It was fun while it lasted, but it’s not the same anymore,” King said. “I know my dad realized that.”
The store’s last day is Saturday, April 26.
Henning said she really enjoyed her job and fixing items for customers.
She said that since she didn’t go through training, Edward’s father said she couldn’t officially be a repair tech. But through the years, she honed her skills.
Before he passed away, she said he was incredibly impressed with her growth.
“Last year, (Michael King) informed me, ‘I can’t give you the title because you didn’t go to college, but you do a heck of a good job repairing things and fixing it and taking care of people,’” Henning said.

If you were to drink improperly recycled toilet water, it could really hurt you — but probably not in the way you’re thinking. Advanced purification technology so thoroughly cleans wastewater of feces and other contaminants that it also strips out natural minerals, which the treatment facility then has to add back in. If it didn’t, that purified water would imperil you by sucking those minerals out of your body as it moves through your internal plumbing.
So if it’s perfectly safe to consume recycled toilet water, why aren’t Americans living in parched western states drinking more of it? A new report from researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Natural Resources Defense Council finds that seven western states that rely on the Colorado River are on average recycling just a quarter of their water, even as they fight each other and Indigenous tribes for access to the river amid worsening droughts. Populations are also booming in the Southwest, meaning there’s less water for more people.
The report finds that states are recycling wildly different proportions of their water. On the high end, Nevada reuses 85 percent, followed by Arizona at 52 percent. But other states lag far behind, including California (22 percent) and New Mexico (18 percent), with Colorado and Wyoming at less than 4 percent and Utah recycling next to nothing.
“Overall, we are not doing nearly enough to develop wastewater recycling in the seven states that are part of the Colorado River Basin,” said Noah Garrison, a water researcher at UCLA and co-author of the report. “We’re going to have a 2 million to 4 million acre-foot per year shortage in the amount of water that we’ve promised to be delivered from the Colorado River.” (An acre-foot is what it would take to cover an acre of land in a foot of water, equal to 326,000 gallons.)
The report found that if the states other than high-achieving Nevada and Arizona increased their wastewater reuse to 50 percent, they’d boost water availability by 1.3 million acre-feet every year. Experts think that it’s not a question of whether states need to reuse more toilet water but how quickly they can build the infrastructure as droughts worsen and populations swell.
At the same time, states need to redouble efforts to reduce their demand for water, experts say. The Southern Nevada Water Authority, for example, provides cash rebates for homeowners to replace their water-demanding lawns with natural landscaping, stocking them with native plants that flourish without sprinklers. Between conserving water and recycling more of it, western states have to renegotiate their relationship with the increasingly precious resource.
“It’s unbelievable to me that people don’t recognize that the answer is: You’re not going to get more water,” said John Helly, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who wasn’t involved in the report. “We’ve lulled ourselves into this sense of complacency about the criticality of water and it’s just starting to dawn on people that this is a serious problem.”
Yet the report notes that states vary significantly in their development and regulation of water recycling. For one, they treat wastewater to varying levels of purity. To get it ultra pure for drinking, human waste and other solids are removed before the water is treated with ozone to kill bacteria and viruses. Next the water is forced through fine membranes to catch other particles. A facility then hits the liquid with UV light, killing off any microbes that might remain, and adds back those missing minerals.
That process is expensive, however, as building a wastewater-treatment facility itself is costly, and it takes a lot of electricity to pump the water hard enough to get it through the filters. Alternatively, some water agencies will treat wastewater and pump the liquid underground into aquifers, where the earth filters it further. To use the water for golf courses and nonedible crops, they treat wastewater less extensively.
Absent guidance from the federal government, every state goes about this differently, with their own regulations for how clean water needs to be for potable or nonpotable use. Nevada, which receives an average of just 10 inches of rainfall a year, has an environmental division that issues permits for water reuse and oversees quality standards, along with a state fund that bankrolls projects. “It is a costly enterprise, and we really do need to see states and the federal government developing new funding streams or revenue streams in order to develop wastewater treatment,” Garrison said. “This is a readily available, permanent supply of water.”
Wastewater recycling can happen at a much smaller scale, too. A company called Epic Cleantec, based in San Francisco, makes a miniature treatment facility that fits inside high-rises. It pumps recycled water back into the units for non-potable use like filling toilets. While it takes many years to build a large treatment facility, these smaller systems come online in a matter of months and can reuse up to 95 percent of a building’s water.
Epic Cleantec says its systems and municipal plants can work in tandem as a sort of distributed network of wastewater recycling. “In the same way that we do with energy, where it’s not just on-site rooftop solar and large energy plants, it’s both of them together creating a more resilient system,” said Aaron Tartakovsky, Epic Cleantec’s CEO and co-founder. “To use a water pun, I think there’s a lot of untapped potential here.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-14 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How could Trump actions on education affect CT schools and students?,CT Mirror Explains,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/14/trump-education-department-ct-effects/,"CT education leaders have watched as Trump's administration rolled out executive orders, funding cuts and federal policy changes. Here's what we know so far.","Since the first days of President Donald Trump’s second term, education leaders in Connecticut have watched as the presidential administration rolled out a series of executive orders, funding cuts and changes to federal policy — many of which represent sharp turns for the students, schools and districts they oversee.
Connecticut lawmakers have been vocal about their fears of the worst case scenario: a reduction or outright elimination of the $550 million in federal funding the state relies on to support public K-12 education.
For now, the funding remains mostly intact. But several of Trump’s actions to date — on things like DEI, transgender students and campus protests — threaten federal funding reductions if schools and universities don’t comply.
Here’s what we know so far.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
During President Trump’s first week in office, he issued an order banning DEI across federal agencies. The following week, the president issued an executive order to eliminate “discriminatory treatment and indoctrination, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology” in K-12 schools, calling for federal funding reductions for schools that don’t comply. 
Earlier this month, the issue came to a head when the Department of Education sent a letter calling on state education officials across the country to “certify their compliance with their anti-discrimination obligations in order to continue receiving federal financial assistance.” At the moment, it remains unclear how the Connecticut Department of Education will respond to the request or whether Connecticut will face federal cuts.
The Defense Department has also halted race-conscious admissions at military academies, including the Coast Guard Academy in New London. In February, the Education Department issued a letter threatening to withhold funding from education institutions that take race into account in admissions and programming. In mid-March, Yale University was among dozens of colleges and universities listed in an Education Department announcement alleging the schools engaged in exclusionary practices in graduate admissions.
Dismantling the department
In early March, the Education Department announced it would reduce its ranks by roughly half. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong joined a group of states to sue the administration over the staff cuts, and the case is pending. 
On March 20, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the dismantling of the Education Department. Teachers unions quickly sued to block the order and members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation have vowed to take action. Trump has said the administration of student loans would be shifted to the Small Business Administration and special needs programs would be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services.
COVID-era funding
Last year, school districts across the country applied for extensions to spend the last remaining dollars of federal COVID-19 relief funding by March 2026 instead of its original deadline of January 2025. But in late March, the Trump administration froze that funding.
Connecticut’s last $14 million was earmarked mostly for programs within the state Department of Education, with just over $6 million of the funds already granted to roughly two dozen K-12 school districts. New London and Waterbury were expected to receive the bulk of those dollars.
The administration has also said it intends to cut funding for schools and universities that require students to be vaccinated against COVID.
Transgender students
During his first week in office, President Trump issued an order ending Title IX protections for transgender students. The following week, the Education Department complied, undoing rules set during the Biden administration. The Trump administration later issued an executive order banning transgender women and girls from competing in women’s sports. Institutions that don’t abide by the ban could see their funding cut, the administration has said.
In late March, the department sent a letter to states threatening to withhold federal funding if parents were not allowed to review student records, in particular any related to the student’s gender identity. In Connecticut, education advocates are seeking stronger protections for transgender students in the wake of the Trump administration’s actions.
Immigration enforcement
In January, the president announced that officers with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protections agencies could make arrests at schools, churches and hospitals — places that had long been considered “sensitive locations,” and barred from immigration enforcement.
Connecticut education officials released guidance to K-12 public schools on how local district leaders should respond to “immigration activities,” including in cases where federal immigration officers request student information or come onto school property.
School meals
Millions of dollars in anticipated funding that Connecticut schools and food banks planned to use to purchase fresh food from local farmers was canceled. The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed state agencies it would no longer run the pair of programs that spend $1 billion each year nationally: the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program and the Local Food for Schools program. 
Campus protests
In late January, the president pledged to cancel student visas of “all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” Weeks later, the Education Department warned 60 colleges and universities they could face repercussions if they fail “to protect Jewish students on campus.” Yale University was among the schools listed on the department’s announcement. Several international students who participated in protests have been detained.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4567-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-14 08:10:12.577072
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-14 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"The perforated wall between church, state and community",Doris Maldonado Mendez | Opinion Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/14/the-perforated-wall-between-church-state-and-community/,"When faith-based and community organizations are excluded from public discourse, vital services can suffer.","“With sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.” Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to members of the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802.

My values are deeply rooted in a love of God, Familia, and country. My mom was a devout Catholic and my father a proud veteran. I experienced Catholic education, peer leadership, and spiritual rites of passage which ultimately led me to teach Catechism for elementary children with special needs (including my own). 
I’ve set examples of Matthew’s golden rule for my children to “do unto others as you’d have done unto you” and established intentional ways that we individually and collectively help “pay it forward” in our community. An inherited call to spirituality and ancestry led me to the Yoruba belief in traditional religions and spiritual concepts of destiny and fate, which ultimately guided me to the inclusive teachings of Unitarian Universalism.


Preaching the golden rule has been significantly challenged this year.  The ripple effects of federal budget cuts are deeply personal for me as someone living with disabilities and navigating the challenges of raising children with medical complexities. Recently, I faced a cut to my own grant-funded work as Project Advisory Committee Lead with Family Voices National, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Project ECHO, and the Office of Minority Health. These organizations play a critical role in advocating for health equity and providing support for families like mine—families that rely on these resources for survival.
The loss of funding is more than just numbers on a page; it translates to real hardships. It limits access to life-saving medical equipment and medications, squeezes vital programs like SSDI and SSI that barely cover living expenses, and forces families into impossible decisions between paying bills or affording necessary care.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
These cuts also strike at the heart of systemic advocacy efforts, silencing voices that have fought tirelessly for inclusivity and equity. Community organizations are left scrambling to sustain services, while families and caregivers bear an overwhelming burden, often at the cost of their own health and well-being.
As past chair of the Accessibility and Inclusion Ministry of the Unitarian Society of Hartford and a worship associate, my family and I engaged in welcoming opportunities of nourishing spirit, building community, and working for justice through a multicultural and neighborly secular blanket. My children participated in civic engagement opportunities with peers and leaders practicing the seven Unitarian Universalist principles.
Community service through faith has been part of human culture since ancient times. Nonpartisan, community-led organizations provide sanctuaries of access, inclusion, and respect for the love of community and its inherent dignity.
When faith-based and community organizations are excluded from public discourse, vital services such as food pantries, housing support, and crisis intervention programs suffer, leaving vulnerable populations without essential aid. 
The lack of meaningful collaboration between government, community and faith organizations fosters division, creating echo chambers that exacerbate misinformation and reduce opportunities for liberty and justice dialogue between diverse groups.
Policies that fail to include faith and community-based organizations in decision-making processes risk neglecting the lived experiences and unique needs of underrepresented populations, further disenfranchising marginalized voices.
Without strong partnerships, voter participation, advocacy efforts, and grassroots movements lose momentum, limiting marginalized communities’ participation in policy and systemic change, and weakening collective civic engagement.
The absence of faith and community perspectives in governance diminishes moral and ethical considerations in policymaking, leading to legislation that prioritizes political gain over human dignity and equity.
I refuse to accept this as the status quo. Advocacy and collaboration must be amplified. Governments, businesses, and grassroots organizations must work together to create innovative solutions—whether through public-private partnerships or stronger protections for disability funding.  As the Constitution State, Connecticut has a responsibility to lead by example, guiding the nation toward stronger collaborative frameworks.  Many community centered groups are already doing this work.  
Since 1830, the Hartford Unitarian Association has long been a beacon of inclusivity and social justice. Through community programs, interfaith dialogues, and advocacy, the society has worked to foster mutual understanding and provide essential services to those in need. By collaborating with other organizations like the Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance, we have extended our reach, combining faith-based and secular efforts to create meaningful change. Established in 1876 as Congregation Beth Israel, the Charter Oak Cultural Center’s mission is to tikkun olam, repairing the world through acts of social justice through the arts and lifespan.
Community-led organizations like CoDE, Know thy Neighbor and others aim to further indivisible liberty and justice for all at a micro and macular level.
CoDE, the Coalition on Diversity and Equity, has played a crucial role in bridging the gaps between the state and ALL communities by providing equitable resources, creating opportunities for civic engagement, and advocating for inclusive policies. Our initiatives focus on the practice of indivisible liberty and justice for all by dismantling systemic barriers, ensuring equal representation, and amplifying voices.
Know thy Neighbor’s mission is to bring together Hartford residents with first responders  and others about community concerns, working together to take action that builds trusting relationships and achieves positive community-driven change. 
These groups continue to address the gaps in our social networks by practicing these steady habits:

Hosting community, interfaith and civic dialogues to address pressing social issues
Providing legal aid and advocacy for those facing denied indivisible liberty and justice
Offering mentorship programs to empower youth and emerging leaders
Partnering with local governments to implement policies that promote indivisible liberty and justice for All
Strengthening allyship through active listening, shared resources, and direct collaboration with ALL groups
Utilizing research-based strategies to identify systemic gaps and implement community-led interventions For the People and By the People.

For me, this fight is rooted in my values of faith, family, and community. Despite the challenges, I remain committed to preserving dignity, liberty and justice for marginalized communities. In the words of Isaiah, we are morally obligated as “repairers of the breach, restorers of streets to dwell in.” The system is broken, but not beyond repair as long as we hold these truths to be self-evident that no “state … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”   In solidarity, we solemnly remain “One Nation under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for ALL” because there is nothing about us without us.

(Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images)Florida attracts sleazeballs, creeps, and the criminally-inclined the way cookie crumbs attract roaches.
It’s always been like this: Al Capone wintered in Miami Beach; Richard Nixon escaped to his Key Biscayne compound so he could hang out with his mob-affiliated pal Bebe Rebozo; Charles Ponzi  made a name for himself for selling Florida swampland — impossible to build on— to unsuspecting Yankees.
More recently, another shady real-estate type, found liable for sexually assaulting journalist E. Jean Carroll and accused of sexual abuse (and worse) by dozens more women, bought a Palm Beach estate and now claims Florida as his home.
So, it’s hardly surprising “influencers” Andrew and Tristan Tate, British-American brothers facing charges of human trafficking and rape in Romania, flew to Florida the minute their travel restrictions were lifted last month — possibly because Trump’s special envoy pressured the Romanian government.
The Tates have fans in TrumpWorld, including lawyer Alina Habba (on the losing side of the E. Jean Carroll case) and Donald Trump Jr., who called their detention “absolute insanity.”
Elon Musk, too: He says Andrew Tate, a former kickboxer who believes women exist only to serve men, should be U.K. prime minister.
But in a rare moment of good sense, Gov. Ron DeSantis bucked TrumpWorld and told those stars of the manosphere they’re “not welcome” in Florida.
Moreover, the state attorney general is investigating certain accusations, including claims they lured a Florida woman to Romania and tried to coerce her into sex work.
Andrew Tate responded by taunting DeSantis on X: “Your wife will never win governor unless you arrest me, @GovRonDeSantis,” calling the governor a “communist” and declaring, “When Americans who are unfairly imprisoned abroad return home you betray them. You better nail me now.”
At least none of our institutions of higher learning have invited the Tates to speak on campus.
Yet.
Socratic dialog
You might keep an eye on New College, though.
Our once-renowned honors school has not exactly covered itself in glory over the past few years, what with dumping top-tier faculty, tanking in the rankings, admitting low-scoring jocks, mismanaging funds, and grossly over-paying its under-achieving president, but inviting British “comedian” Russell Brand to appear its “Socratic Stage Series” adds insult to injury.
Brand was supposed to be “in conversation” with NCF president Richard Corcoran on April 12.
New College announced the Brand appearance in February. On April 4, the British Crown Prosecution Service charged him with one count of rape, one count of indecent assault, one count of oral rape, and two counts of sexual assault.
In a press release, New College defended bringing in Brand, wrapping itself in the flag of free speech: “After thoughtful consideration, we have decided to move forward with Russell Brand’s scheduled appearance,” citing the institution’s responsibility “to ensure a space where ideas — especially those that invite dialogue such as the topic of cancel culture and free speech, can be explored with respect, critical thought, and intellectual integrity.”
Not quite 48 hours later, New College thought better of it, announcing this “important and possibly never more relevant” conversation would be rescheduled at a later date.
NCF blamed problems with the venue (problems which apparently didn’t exist a few days ago) and those pesky journalists: “the current media climate is a distraction from the deeper purpose of the event to explore free speech.”
Brand has a court date in London on May 2.
Magic amulet
Now, you might be wondering exactly what qualifies Brand to be a guest lecturer for a public college in Florida.
He’s best known as host of a “Big Brother” spinoff called “Big Brother’s Big Mouth,” as the star of several films, including “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” often-fired radio host, and general provocateur.
He used to be a progressive (of sorts), praising Barack Obama, meeting with the Dalai Lama, and saying rude things about George W. Bush, but has lately become a conspiracy theorist who, in 2024, took to selling a $250 “magic amulet” which supposedly keeps you safe from “all sorts of evil energies.”
Right.
There’s this thing we do in higher ed called “research.” You’d think a few minutes perusal of Russell Brand’s baby talk-titled memoir, “My Booky Wook” with gleeful accounts of spitting in a woman’s face and furiously smashing a sex worker’s phone because it kept ringing while they were in flagrante (a service “for which,” says Brand, “I’d paid a lot of money”) might suggest perhaps he’s not someone likely to enrich the culture.
None of this proves Brand is a rapist, but it’s pretty clear he’s a misogynist jerk.
Brand insists that while he was once epically promiscuous, all his liaisons were “consensual,” even the ones with teenagers.
Besides, he says, he has now been washed clean by the Holy Spirit, baptized last year in the River Thames by adventure reality TV star Bear Grylls.
Criminal investigation 
Well, the Lord may have forgiven him, but the justice system doesn’t work like that: In addition to charges in the U.K., Brand faces a U.S. civil suit and possible criminal investigation into allegations that he exposed himself and assaulted a woman on the set of the film “Arthur.”
The question remains: Why is New College spending taxpayer money on this guy?
Other “Socratic” speakers are (mostly) defensible: Steven Donziger, who famously sued Chevron over oil operations in Ecuador which wreaked monstrous environmental damage. (The oil company accused him of misconduct in the case; he spent three years in home detention for refusing to turn over his phone and trial records; Amnesty International fruitlessly urged former President Joe Biden to issue a pardon.)
Also scheduled for appearances at New College are Judith Butler, the distinguished gender theorist, and Stanley Fish, lawyer and literary scholar, disliked by both the right and the left.
There is also, as you’d expect, a bunch of conservatives ranging from the intellectually respectable — Mollie Hemingway, editor of “The Federalist” — to the anti-vax doctor Scott Atlas.
But casting Russell Brand as some free speech hero is flat out stupid.
Milton intervention
It’s not the first time NCF has embarrassed itself. In 2024 the college invited white supremacist “eugenicon” Steve Sailer, who says Black men are in thrall to a “primal African cult of fertility,” to “debate” Black historian Dr. Marvin Dunn.
As if you can argue “both sides” on racism. There are not two sides — unless you think the KKK makes a lot of good points.
When Hurricane Milton forced the cancellation of what promised to be a particularly unlovely spectacle, you could almost believe in the wrath of God.
Despite MAGA hissy fit-pitching and anti-DEI squawking over “censorship” and “indoctrination” on campus, conservative ideas are not suppressed or censored.
FSU recently hosted economist and Reagan acolyte Glenn Loury; the University of Florida’s Hamilton Center has showcased Republican pollsters and American Enterprise Institute luminaries.
This is as it should be.
But there’s a difference between a university fostering honest discussion of academic freedom, ideology, and prejudice, and promoting a man who could soon be convicted of sexual assault.
Scrubbing the record
Florida’s Republican junta has convinced itself higher education turns innocent students into tree-hugging transgender Marxists who read nothing but books on critical race theory.
Terrified they’ll be penalized financially and every other way, colleges and universities have busied themselves scrubbing websites of incendiary words such as “women,” “Black,” “institutional” and “trauma.”
FSU has deleted and “archived” its posts on high-achieving students before 2023, claiming, in fluent bureaucratic nonsense-speak, they did it to get rid of “outdated information to enhance user experience and ensuring our webpages load quickly and efficiently on all devices.”
In case you’re not buying that one, they’re also calling it “routine maintenance.”
A cynical person might think this is really about obscuring official praise of students who might be queer or working in currently disfavored fields of study.
A cynical person might also wonder if state government wants to use higher education to return us to an imagined past when white Christian men were in charge of everything and everything was absolutely great, especially for white Christian men.
One of the governor’s picks for the Board of Trustees at University of West Florida, an institution he calls “a left-wing college,” wanted to take us back to the 1950s.
Scott Yenor, an academic nonentity at Boise State in Idaho, thinks only “non-Jewish white men” should be in leadership positions.
He says “independent women” are “medicated, meddlesome and quarrelsome” and proclaims, “If we want a great nation, we should be preparing young women to become mothers,” not have successful careers, certainly not in the manly fields of science, medicine, and the law.
Even some of Florida’s loudest and proudest reactionaries objected to Yenor’s weird ideas about women and obvious antisemitism.
Sen. Randy Fine, the state’s only Jewish Republican legislator (until he was elected to Congress on April 1) raised the alarm.
Back to Idaho
Indeed, Yenor is so out there that several hundred citizens, including students, alumni, former trustees, and donors, held a town hall in Pensacola — deep red Pensacola — urging the Florida Senate to reject his nomination.
Former Republican legislators, business leaders, donors, local officials, and members of the Jewish community expressed dismay. UWF President Emerita Judy Bense urged people to tell the governor “this is wrong.”
The amazing thing is, they won. Yenor, who had not yet been confirmed by the Senate, withdrew from consideration.
Sen. Don Gaetz, father of the egregious Matt, celebrated Yenor’s decision: “Gentlemen don’t go where no one wants them.”
Unacquainted with what gentlemen do, the governor is throwing a tantrum, blaming Fine, whom he describes as “repellent,” snarling, “Let’s just consider the source. I mean, that same senator called me antisemitic,” and accusing others of distorting Yenor’s record, “trying to dredge up statements” he calls “flimsy.”
Booting Yenor back to Idaho is a small victory for UWF and the basic decency we should expect from Florida’s state institutions.
“Rescheduling” Brand is, too, although New College is probably beyond redemption: Opening the campus to white supremacists and accused rapists does not demonstrate a commitment to vigorous examination of social norms and political pieties, or a bold assertion of free speech.
It’s evidence of decay.

(Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’ 
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.


We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Photo by Jake Parrish/InvestigateWest)Last summer, Robert Dale Root was charged with violating a no-contact order to stay away from his partner. 
Unable to afford an attorney and facing a dwindling roster of Yakima County public defenders, Root waited three months for a public defender to represent him for the felony charge. His partner repeatedly asked to lift the order, to no avail, as Root posted bail twice — before landing back in jail for violating the order each time. 
He took off work for three arraignment hearings, but he showed up to the hearings without legal representation, only for his arraignment to be rescheduled for a later date. The attorney he was finally assigned met with him just once, complained of being flooded with other cases and left the office before Root’s case was resolved, about seven months after his initial arrest.
He’s since been assigned another attorney and sits in the county jail awaiting a trial date set for April 21.
Root’s wait in the bottlenecked queue for counsel in Yakima isn’t unusual. In fact, it was common last summer, according to court records reviewed by InvestigateWest. One woman arrested the same month as Root and facing a litany of charges related to theft and drug possession was arraigned eight times and waited five months for a public defender. Another defendant, charged with assault, waited five months. Another appeared at four arraignments without a public defender until his case was eventually dismissed. The list goes on.
“It’s not our fault they don’t have enough attorneys,” said Root, a 23-year-old descendant of the Yakama Nation. “We have to sit here and try to await trial because we’re innocent until proven guilty. … It’s just wrong.”
Lags in Yakima County’s court system reflect a breaking point in the state’s public defense system. A shortage of public defenders leaves indigent defendants waiting weeks, sometimes months for an attorney. These defendants often are left in the dark, oblivious to when or from whom they will have legal representation. In Washington, the issue varies by county — namely due to the state’s lack of financial support and the counties’ differing models of service.
“The Legislature has slowly choked the life out of local budgets,” said Derek Young, interim director of the Washington State Association of Counties. “We can’t afford proper staffing levels.”
In what some would call a worst-case scenario, Benton County released five criminal defendants, with charges including rape and other violent crimes, from jail last year because it lacked defense attorneys to represent them.
“That’s where their constitutional right becomes now a public safety problem,” Young said. “The date we’ve been warning (the state) about for a long time has arrived. It’ll start in those places that have the hardest time recruiting attorneys.”
The problem is particularly acute in Yakima County. The county is both being sued by defendants and is suing the state, along with several other counties and the Washington State Association of Counties, for failing to provide adequate funding for public defense services. Young said the decision is in appeal, and he expects another hearing in early May. The director of the Yakima County Department of Assigned Counsel, Paul Kelley, declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.
On Sept. 30, five plaintiffs who languished in Yakima County’s jail without an attorney, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a class-action lawsuit claiming that Yakima County failed to appoint counsel and unlawfully restrained those without legal representation. The plaintiffs faced “onerous conditions of release, and repeated court hearings — where they [were] forced to face the court without counsel — that [did] not move their case forward,” according to the complaint.
That suit came on the heels of a case in August 2024 in which Superior Court Judge Richard Bartheld declared that the defense shortage in Yakima — exacerbated by the departure of four attorneys, roughly a quarter of all of its public defenders — had reached “a crisis level.” In that court case, a woman charged with driving under the influence had lost her attorney and waited three more months for a new one. To prevent the case being dismissed, Bartheld went as far as to amend court rules, declaring that the time spent reappointing counsel would not count against trial deadlines. 
“When relief is not offered through executive or legislative action and the Supreme Court fails to address these issues in its rulemaking authority, it produces problems for trial courts that are unprecedented and unavoidable,” Bartheld said.
Underfunded and overburdened
Washington is among the few states that do not provide the majority of funding for public defense. 
In 1996, the state Legislature established the Office of Public Defense to provide supplemental representation for indigent defendants. Since 2005, the office has also been responsible for dispersing the limited state funding to counties — funding which does not surpass 3% of total spending for public defense services. Total state funding for counties in 2024 and 2025 was about $5.8 million each year.
County revenues collected from property and sales tax make up remaining funds, but in Washington, local governments can only increase their property tax revenue by 1% without voter-approved ballot measures, failing to keep pace with the rising costs of running a court.
“The total revenue that you can generate… [is] beneath the rate of inflation,” Young said. “It turns out your employees won’t work for only 1% increases year over year.”
In Ferry County, one of the least-populous counties in the state with about 7,500 residents, less than 18% of land is taxable. The rest is either reservation or national forest, making revenue from property tax particularly low. Public defense services are managed by county commissioners who contract with one attorney, located over an hour’s drive away.
“Facilities are extremely limited,” said Bob Dean, Ferry County commissioner. “Running [the public defense program] consists of basically, desperately seeking another lawyer if we lose this one.”
Recruitment is another hurdle. Public defenders have a taxing job. A high workload and relatively lower pay makes the job less appealing to law school graduates, said Colin Charbonneau, director of Spokane’s public defender’s office. On top of that, many are not apt to relocate somewhere rural.
In Benton County, “we do not have a law school here locally, the closest one is in Spokane, which is about two and a half hours east of us,” said Keith Johnson, director of the Benton County public defender’s office. “We compete with other counties for talent.”
InvestigateWest obtained 2023 grant applications sent to the Office of Public Defense from 10 rural and three urban counties. All counties, except one that didn’t respond to the prompt, voiced the same concern: Retention and recruitment are struggles.
“The increasing salaries in larger areas has decreased the available attorney[s] in rural communities,” Okanogan County reported in its grant application. “In addition, we continue to lack affordable housing.”
Lewis County blamed the state’s lack of funding for its issues. Its grant application said that “unfunded mandates are absolutely the biggest challenge for counties across the state” and that “other sources of funding will need consideration.”
For years, Yakima’s public defense office has tried to recruit more attorneys. County commissioners repeatedly approved new budgets to offer 20% pay increases, $12,000 in sign-on bonuses and retention bonuses for existing public defenders. Despite the attempts, few applied.

For years, there were warnings. Back in July 2022, Kelley began sending monthly emails to the Yakima Superior Court judge and the director of prosecuting attorneys explaining the difficulty hiring attorneys and that new case filings “outnumber[ed] the closing of felony cases.” In August 2022, Kelley decided to max out the county public defender office’s capacity at 160 felony cases a month, with leftover cases carried over to the next month. 
Seven months later, the leftover cases had grown to 223 — more than 150% of the office’s capacity — causing further delays for new case filings. 
It meant “indigent felony cases first appearing in Superior Court on and after May 19, 2023, will not have in-house or contracted felony qualified counsel available … before July,” Kelley said in an email dated May 31, 2023. At the time, two dozen defendants in-custody would wait until July for counsel.

Yakima County’s backlogged court directly affected its defendants, many of whom could not afford a private attorney. 
“The heavy caseloads harm marginalized clients — often young, non-white individuals involved in gangs with traumatic personal histories — who need experienced attorneys to navigate their complex situations,” Vanessa Martin, a longtime public defender in Western Washington, said in an email to the state Supreme Court concerning a proposal to adopt new caseload standards.
Mixed models
The display on Mac Jardine’s computer at the Grays Harbor County Department of Public Defense is a photo of Noah’s Ark. When Jardine was hired to be the first director of the program, she was asked to “build” the department. 
“I had no direction, and they had no direction,” Jardine said. “It’s like sending me out to build an ark, and my name ain’t Noah … I have built my office from scratch.” 
Because administration of indigent defense services is decentralized in Washington, counties are operating with mixed models. Less than half of Washington counties have an office dedicated to public defense. The state Office of Public Defense encourages counties to create offices, but costs for space, public defenders, a director and other administrative positions are beyond the means of many rural counties.
King County employs all of its public defenders through the county. Grays Harbor County uses a mixed model of county and contracted public defenders. Asotin County in the state’s southeast corner relies solely on contracted attorneys to deliver public defense services.
In 2022, Kittitas County in Central Washington opened its own public defense department with its first employee, Eileen Murphy, now director of the program. On top of managing the county office, Murphy carries a full caseload. She works “at least 60 hours a week,” in an office with “a lot of walk-in traffic” and “phones ring[ing] all day.” She hopes in the future to hire more positions.
“That’s just the reality of the job for me,” Murphy said. “There are still some policies and procedures I’d like to put into place, but dealing with my clients and their cases is… my first priority.”
Murphy said this institutionalized model of public defense is better than relying on solely contracting attorneys because it holds people accountable.
“There are more protections in offices, because you have supervisors, and you have people that can review your work,” said Liz Mustin, supervising attorney of criminal defense programs at the Office of Public Defense. “Prosecutors are county employees who get county benefits and retirement plans, and the [contracted] defenders are just kind of on their own.”
Critics of contract attorneys say they aren’t as invested in their indigent defendants because they have other cases that might be more financially rewarding through a private firm. But for rural counties, models like this become the only way these services are possible. 
“I think relying on contract attorneys is a little scary because you just really have to rely on the attorneys’ integrity and intelligence and experience,” said Lisa Pruitt, co-author of “Legal Deserts and Spatial Injustice,” a study on indigent defense programs in rural Washington counties. “There’s a lot at stake for people if something goes wrong.”
Desperate for attorneys, some rural counties offer almost twice what urban counties pay contract attorneys. Asotin, Grays Harbor and Whitman counties offer $150 an hour for contract attorneys. King County, by contrast, offers $85 an hour.
A make-or-break decision
Now, the state’s system is at a crossroad.
Recent efforts to resolve Washington’s public defender shortage have stalled in the Legislature — except for Senate Bill 5780, passed in 2024, which created the law student rural defense program allowing law students to gain internship experience in rural jurisdictions. Though not a cure-all for rural counties, it helps, attorneys say.
Yakima County Department of Assigned Counsel described the program as “an overwhelming success” after two students who interned one summer returned the following year and expressed their intention to join the office after graduation, according to its grant application. 
This year, Senate Bill 5404, a bill that would have revolutionized Washington’s public defense by making the state pay for virtually all public defense programs, fell flat. Many are now anxiously awaiting the state’s Supreme Court to decide on new workload standards, which would dramatically reduce the caseloads for public defenders. Last year, the Washington State Bar Association adopted the standards and asked the Supreme Court to do the same. The Supreme Court has no deadline to act.

After a wave of resignations from public defenders last summer, criminal defendants were arraigned multiple times and waited months to be assigned a public defender. (Photo by Jake Parrish/InvestigateWest)
If adopted, the new standards would set the maximum capacity for adult felony cases at 47 a year, less than a third of what it is today, but on a rolling basis over three years. 
Current standards, developed from a 1973 study, allow public defenders to take on up to 150 felony cases a year. But felony cases are more complex than they were 50 years ago and require the acumen of an experienced attorney. 
Public defenders say for a serious felony case, an attorney might sift through hours of body camera footage, order psychological evaluations, retain an investigator, create a defense strategy all while repeating the process for other clients and spending days in and out of court hearings. The stress adds up. People leave the field. Public defense administrators scramble to accommodate the constitutional right to counsel.
The state’s Office of Public Defense and King County have already adopted the standards, but counties are not required to abide by them until the Supreme Court affirms it.
“We know as a matter of fact that there is a crisis in public defense,” Matt Sanders, interim director of King County Department of Public Defense, said in the Supreme Court’s hearing on indigent defense standards. “The people who are harmed by this system are disproportionately people of color, the mentally unwell, LGBTQ members of our community. And we know if this court does not adopt these standards, that this ongoing crisis will continue unabated.”
The Washington State Bar Association asked for contractors to conduct a workload study last year and chose the same vendor who conducted a similar study in Oregon. The bar association says the study will conclude in late summer this year.  
There are many opponents, namely from rural counties, who say the standards would exacerbate the public defender shortage by mandating counties to hire more attorneys over a relatively short timeline without state funding. 
“The real problem is that the additional attorneys needed to bring the county in compliance with the amendments simply do not exist,” Albert Lin, prosecuting attorney for Okanogan County, said in a letter to the Supreme Court. “This is why I find the proposed amendments so perplexing — the solution to a supply problem is to create more demand?”
Over the last 20 years, three lawsuits in Washington have accused contracted public defenders of failing to provide adequate representation. Those lawsuits originated in rural counties that today feel like their concerns should prevent the Supreme Court from accepting proposed new standards that would significantly reduce public defenders caseloads and mandate new hires.
“To implement these standards as low as proposed will basically take away the very few attorneys that I have,” said Brooke Burns, Superior Court Judge for Asotin, Garfield and Columbia counties in Asotin County’s grant application. “Cases will have to be dismissed. This means that victims will not be made whole or felt to have secured justice. It will decrease community safety because defendants will have the knowledge that if there is no attorney, their crimes will go unpunished.”

Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said Sunday afternoon that his office was preparing to file charges against Balmer of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person.
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded police after entering the residence grounds and setting the fire with “homemade incendiary devices.” He was arrested Sunday afternoon shortly before the scheduled 4:30 p.m. news conference, police said.
“He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,” Bivens said “When I said that he was in the residence, he was inside for less than a minute. It all happened very quickly and he was back out.”

Shapiro announced on social media early Sunday that he and his family had been awakened around 2 a.m. by a member of his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
In a news conference outside the residence Sunday afternoon, Shapiro appeared briefly overcome with emotion as he spoke about the experience and thanked state police, Harrisburg firefighters and other first responders.
The smell of fire lingered in the air around the home, which overlooks the Susquehanna River on Front Street in downtown Harrisburg.
“Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we’ve received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” he said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.”
His tone turned to anger as he addressed what he described as a targeted attack on himself and his family.
“We don’t know the person’s specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith.
The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said.
Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
 ‘Large and complex crime scene’

The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI.
Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case.
While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone.
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said.
Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chain-link fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds.

State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said.
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing with searches being conducted throughout the day. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

Now, 84% of counties have such programs, with expectations of reaching 100% by the end of 2025. (Getty Images)As the CEO of the Indiana Public Health Association (IPHA), I want to emphasize the importance of stable and flexible Health First Indiana (HFI) funding. HFI was established to strengthen public health services across all 92 counties, allowing local communities to address critical health issues such as infant and maternal mortality, smoking cessation, lead poisoning  prevention, and chronic disease management. Discussions of cutting funds or adding restrictions to spending raises significant concerns about the future of public health in Indiana. 
Historically, Indiana has ranked near the bottom nationally in key public health indicators. Before HFI, many counties lacked the resources to implement comprehensive, evidence-based programs to improve community health. In fact, according to State Health Commissioner Lindsay Weaver, only 39% of counties had programs focused on improving birth outcomes before these funds were made available. Now, 84% of counties have such programs, with expectations of reaching 100% by the end of 2025. This progress is at risk if funding restrictions are imposed, preventing local health departments from using resources where they are needed most. 
A fundamental strength of HFI is its local approach. Each county in Indiana has unique public health challenges, and a one-size-fits-all mandate on how funds are spent could severely limit the effectiveness of health interventions. A rural county may need to focus on expanding access to maternal care, while an urban area may prioritize addressing youth mental health and  substance use disorder prevention. The ability to tailor interventions to community-specific needs is key to achieving long-term improvements in health outcomes. 
Moreover, investing in public health has clear economic benefits. When communities are healthier, health care costs decrease, workforce productivity increases, and overall quality of life  improves. Chronic diseases, many of which are preventable with strong public health initiatives, are among the leading drivers of health care costs. Ensuring counties can invest in prevention  programs — whether that’s providing vaccinations, addressing food insecurity, or improving  access to mental health services —ultimately saves taxpayer dollars in the long run. The Indiana University Indianapolis Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health released a preliminary report exploring cost savings from just three core service areas—prenatal care, blood pressure  screenings, and fall prevention services — and estimate over $141 million in direct and indirect cost savings from the first year of HFI implementation alone.  
We encourage policymakers to continue supporting local decision-making and evidence-based programming. HFI was designed with built-in reporting and accountability measures to ensure transparency and effectiveness — you can learn how your county’s HFI funds are being spent online here. Rather than restricting how funds are used, let’s focus on expanding successful  initiatives and reinforcing local public health infrastructure.
The Indiana Public Health Association urges lawmakers to honor the significant impact HFI has already had in improving public health across the state. We must allow local public health officials to continue their work without unnecessary limitations that could hinder progress. Through stable and flexible funding, we can build healthier communities, reduce long-term  health care costs, and achieve greater health equity for all Hoosiers.

As designed, the 340B program requires participating manufacturers to sell discounted drugs to providers seeing low-income and underserved populations. Between 2005 and 2023, the program’s total drug purchases grew from $2.4 billion to $66.3 billion — with the explosive growth exposing a rift between the pharmaceutical companies supplying the discounts and the hospitals receiving them.
  Sen. Charbonneau, R-Valparaiso, rolls up paperwork while listening to colleagues speak about his bill on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
In response, state legislators are considering a bill to establish reporting requirements on qualified 340B entities, with a special focus on the dozens of hospitals accessing low-priced medications. 
“Transparency has been kind of a key word for everything we’ve done this session — for the last couple of sessions — and this is focusing a light,” said Sen. Ed Charbonneau, who authored the proposal. “What’s going on is legal, but it is far askance from the purpose of what the whole thing was — to provide low-cost medications to the indigent people needing help.” 
Senators opted not to concur with House amendments, sending Senate Bill 118 to a conference committee to finalize negotiations. But the latest version would require certain health providers under the program report: aggregate drug acquisition costs and payments, pharmacy dispensing payments, claims, how 340B savings were used, patient makeup and more. 
But for some of the small hospitals using the program, every dollar saved is vital to continue their services. 
“We don’t have the economies of scale that larger tertiary centers have. We have to make do with very little oftentimes,” said Brenda Reeta, the CEO of the Greene County General Hospital. “The cuts are getting deep enough now that it’s going to be bordering on … not just cutting service lines but, ‘Can we even stay open?’” 
 Criticisms of the program

In committee testimony, much of the program’s criticism can be summarized by William S. Smith, a senior fellow overseeing life science initiatives at the Pioneer Institute think tank in Boston. 
Smith presented roughly 15 slides before both Senate and House committees in January and March describing how hospitals, clinics and pharmacies can acquire medications at a “deep, deep” discount and then bill private insurers the full price — keeping the difference in a practice known as arbitrage. 
“Arbitrage drives this and that creates all sorts of bad incentives for the program because hospitals have every reason to bring in fully insured patients and not to treat uninsured patients,” Smith told senators in January. 
As evidence of this practice, Smith pointed to the opening of contract pharmacies affiliated with 340B entities in wealthy communities with high rates of private insurance. 
  The use of the 340B program has skyrocketed, as seen in this chart from KFF.
“Jeff Bezos could walk into a 340B pharmacy and get a 340B drug,” Smith said. “It should be targeted for low-income patients or uninsured patients, in my view.”
An Indiana one-pager from Pioneer concludes that more than half of these contract pharmacies are in affluent neighborhoods, dispensing drugs on behalf of 340B entities. Some of the state’s largest nonprofit hospitals use contract pharmacies based in California and Hawaii, a point of contention for Pioneer. 
Additionally, Smith criticized a decline in reported charity care. Lawmakers have amended the bill to exclude reporting requirements for 340 entities like Health Resources and Services Administration clinics. Programs under that umbrella include programs like the Damien Center’s services for Hoosiers with HIV or the Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center.
Such clinics testified that they are already subject to stricter reporting requirements and auditing than hospitals. 
“I think clinics are different than hospitals. The clinics, generally, run things better. They’re audited on their charity care,” Smith said. “… and some hospitals are under-reimbursed by Medicaid and they really depend on 340B. That’s why I like (Senate Bill 118) because it doesn’t undercut the program. It just says, ‘What’s going on? How much money are you making?’”
Before House lawmakers in March, Smith doubled down, targeting larger hospital systems for additional scrutiny. 
“They’re cutting back on their charity care and … collecting tens of millions of dollars in revenue from 340B. I’d like to find out which hospitals are doing the right thing and which ones are not and a little transparency would help,” Smith said. 
Such concerns have reached Gov. Mike Braun as well, who issued an executive order in January ordering Health and Family Services Secretary Gloria Sachdev to examine the program and determine what oversight the state could pursue. Such a review is set to be finalized by the end of October. 
 Response from hospitals

Pushing back, hospitals said the savings from 340B weren’t ever meant to go directly to patients — something Smith also said. But rather, hospital administrator said, it offsets other programming. 
“If we focused on charity care, it suggests that our savings should be solely used to support charity care versus stretching scarce resources,” said Dawn Moore, a vice president and chief pharmacy officer with Community Health Network testifying on behalf of the Indiana Hospital Association. 
Moore additionally noted that charity care “only” considered services that were billed and then written off, leaving out free clinics, patient navigation services and more. 340B savings were generated when billing a private insurer, since the program can’t be applied to medications under Medicaid — hence why contract pharmacies may not be located in low-income areas. 
An obscure drug discount program stifles use of federal lifeline by rural hospitals

“We set up or provide services all throughout. However, because we generate a savings from locations where we have commercially insured patients, we take those savings and reinvest them where they’re needed,” Moore said.
Reetz, with the Greene County hospital, estimated that her hospital got roughly $500,000 in benefits from 340B but spent nearly half of that on self-auditing and administration. Though comparatively small, having that cushion allowed her system to keep its obstetrics and gynecology service lines open as well as cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. 
“We are one of the few rural communities that still has full OB services … It’s very costly to keep an OB department open and we have chosen to do that because, for us, it would be over an hour away for most of our community members to travel to deliver a baby,” said Reetz. “Within the last couple of weeks, we had a person come in that did not plan to deliver at our hospital but the baby was coming right now. 
“It was a complicated pregnancy and had she not been able to have an emergency (caesarean) section right then and there, the baby would have most definitely not made it. And most likely the mom too,” Reetz continued. 
Additional reporting requirements could eat into that money recouped from 340B, Reetz worried, on top of the other reporting and transparency requirements imposed on hospitals. Unlike other programs, no tax dollars are spent under the 340B program. 
“I don’t necessarily get why they’re trying to push for more transparency, because I believe it’s already as transparent as we can possibly be with it. It is just going to further dip into how much we actually are able to benefit from the program by making the administration of it even more costly,” Reetz said.

The Republican candidates for governor are largely opposed to abortion, though that hasn't stopped it from being a campaign issue. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Former radio show host Bill Spadea, a Republican who’s running for governor, raised eyebrows earlier this month when he told supporters during a campaign stop that abortion would not be an issue in the general election.
His campaign rivals swarmed, challenging his anti-abortion bona fides.
Spadea, though, told the New Jersey Monitor in a recent interview that he merely meant that abortion is a “distraction” Democrats likely will use to draw attention away from Jersey-specific issues that matter more to voters, like the high cost of living, crime, transportation woes, and immigration enforcement.
“I think the Democrats would love to make it an issue, because they think they can win by painting a false narrative that somehow pro-life candidates are anti-women,” Spadea said. “I do not think it’s going to be a top issue. And if the Democrats try to make it one, which I believe they will, especially if Mikie Sherrill is their nominee, it will serve as a distraction on the issues that New Jerseyans are really talking about.”
His GOP rivals, including former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, and former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, disagree.
“This is always going to be an issue because of the deep passion on both sides,” Bramnick said.
Kranjac saw Spadea’s comments about abortion as unacceptably dismissive for a candidate who landed endorsements from the national and state Right to Life groups.
“I will make it an issue every day,” Kranjac said. “It’s really important to change our culture of death and get New Jersey out of the abortion business.”

Republicans are hoping they can win the seat now held by Gov. Phil Murphy, a two-term Democrat who cannot seek a third term in November. But first they must make it through the June 10 primary to win their party’s nomination.
Bramnick proclaims himself pro-choice. When Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021, he said he would sign a bill protecting abortion rights if the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade (it did the following year). Both Bramnick and Ciattarelli say getting an abortion should be a decision that’s between a woman, her family, her doctors, and her faith.
All the leading GOP candidates oppose or have qualms with a law Murphy signed in 2022 to codify abortion rights in New Jersey, largely over an aversion to late-term abortions.
“I think they went farther than Roe v. Wade, and that’s why I abstained on that codification,” Bramnick said.
Ciattarelli would ban elective abortions after 20 weeks, while Bramnick said he opposes late-term abortions except in cases of medical emergencies. Kranjac said he would ban abortions after 20 weeks without exception during his first year in office, with the ban creeping earlier in pregnancy over time in line with his goal of “protecting life from conception to natural death.”
Spadea didn’t draw the line at any specific week, but said: “I am in line with mainstream America, which is: Late-term and up-to-birth abortion is abhorrent, and it will be very positive to see that limitation put in New Jersey.”
A 2022 Pew Research Center poll found that most Americans support abortion rights, but opposition grows at later stages of pregnancy.
All the leading GOP candidates for governor back requiring parental notification for minors who seek abortions, with Spadea supporting exceptions for rape and incest.
“The fact that a 16-year-old in New Jersey needs her parents’ permission to get her ears pierced, but not get an abortion is absurd,” Ciattarelli’s campaign website says.
Kranjac would appoint anti-abortion judges as part of his strategy on the issue.
Ciattarelli, Spadea, and Kranjac want to cut public funding for abortion, with Spadea and Kranjac saying they would cut funding for Planned Parenthood and send that support instead to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers, which the Murphy administration has labeled deceptive.
“As governor, I’m going to work very hard to empower pregnancy resource centers (for) young women, especially these young women who go to these centers that are from abusive relationships, don’t have any resources, they’re scared to death, they may be unsure of who exactly the father is, the dad’s left the scene,” Spadea said. “Just terrible circumstances for these young women, and they’re not given any choice.”

Last week, the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation added another 6,000 products to that list that should have been pulled in 2023 because they were all made with an ingredient produced by the company at the heart of the recall, Robertsville-based Delta Extraction.
The new “threats” were found after the division was ordered in February by the state’s administrative hearing commission to release any Midwest Magic brand products from its 2023 recall list. During that review, the division discovered additional marijuana products containing a THC oil that Delta Extraction made using “unregulated cannabis,” the division stated in a Thursday press release.
“Regarding risks to the public, the department recalled these products for the same reason it issued the original, related recall: It identified a potential threat to health and safety,” said Amy Moore, the divisions director, in an email to The Independent.

However, there have been no adverse reactions reported for any of the product in the original or updated recall, she said.

“The initial recall was a large and complex endeavor requiring expert application of system functionality and program processes,” she said. “The department has made improvements in both areas since that time and continues to improve in ways that ensure future recalls can better identify all relevant product at initial issuance.”
Delta Extraction is a licensed cannabis manufacturing facility that specializes in making THC distillate, a highly potent and pure form of THC used for things like vape pens, infused pre-rolled joints and edibles. About 100 other manufacturers bought the distillate in question in spring 2023 and went on to make thousands of products. 
In August 2023, the division suspended Delta Extraction’s license after finding the company’s distillate was made with untested “marijuana or converted hemp from outside of a Missouri licensed cultivation facility.” 
The state also issued the product recall.
Delta Extraction loses appeal of its revoked license following Missouri cannabis recall

A few months later, the state rolled back its recall of nearly 15,000 Midwest Magic products and allowed them to return to the dispensary shelves. Though part owner of the Delta facility, Midwest Magic owners successfully argued that the brand didn’t use the distillate in its products. 
A company called A Joint Operation owns the other 50% of Delta Extraction.
In February, Delta Extraction lost its appeal of its license suspension, but it was awarded a renewed search for Midwest Magic products on the recall list. The Thursday update released about 120 Midwest Magic products from dispensaries and manufacturing facilities. The update also allowed testing labs to release samples of several hundred recalled products so they can be destroyed.
Ted Maritz, co-owner of Midwest Magic, said the company had already written off the released items as a loss.
“I’m not going to ask any stores for payment or anything,” Maritz said. “Everyone’s gone through hell for this.”
While the ordered search had a small impact on Midwest Magic, it is having a big impact on some dispensaries and manufacturers carrying the 6,200 products. 
The recall list actually represents product tags used by the state’s tracing system called Metrc. Each tag in dispensaries typically represents a case of 10 to 12 units. And Metrc tags for manufacturing facilities represent ingredients that could make thousands or millions of units. 
One Kansas City manufacturer had almost 700 ingredients recalled Thursday. 
Josh Corson, co-owner of A Joint Operation, said he had not yet heard about the updated recall, in a text message Friday to The Independent and could not immediately comment.
Over the last two years, several companies have opted to destroy the products to make more room in their storage areas. 
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the division, said there was a slight increase for destruction requests since February through April, following the commission’s decision and totaling about 200 requests. However the division is “unable to identify whether these requests are specific to the February decision,” she said.  
The units remaining on hold for the Delta Extraction recall, which have not been destroyed, total nearly 157,000 items. That includes 4,000 THC concentrate items that equal 378,000 grams of oil, along with about 13,000 grams of marijuana flower. It also includes 18,000 infused edibles, more than 40,000 pre-rolled joints and 90,000 vape cartridges. 
In Delta’s appeal, the company argued the process it used to make the distillate was safe and legal. 
Delta Extraction admitted to importing a large amount of THC-A — a non-psychoactive compound of the cannabis plant that becomes intoxicating when heated — purportedly extracted from hemp plants. The company’s contractor would mix it with a smaller amount of THC-A extracted from Missouri-regulated marijuana. 
Delta argued the hemp-derived THC-A should fall under the same rules as added ingredients, like flavors or the non-intoxicating cannabis compound CBD, because hemp is not a federally controlled substance like marijuana. It was taken off the federal controlled substance list in the 2018 farm bill.
But Carole Iles of Missouri’s administrative hearing commission, wrote in her 137-page ruling that THC-A becomes intoxicating through the exact same process no matter if it’s extracted from hemp or marijuana, so the state is correct in regulating the THC the same as marijuana. 
That means it must be grown and manufactured in licensed Missouri facilities, Iles concluded, and tracked from the time the seed goes into the soil in the Metrc system.
“THC originating from other sources,” she wrote, “is prohibited.” 
Chuck Hatfield, former attorney for Delta Extraction, said licensed facilities have the ability to challenge these new recalls of the products on their shelves. 
“They probably should,” Hatfield said. “Because DCR has had such difficulty figuring out which products should be recalled, no licensee can be sure which products it can sell.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Greenhouse-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 07:02:19.991224

Eric Schmitt speaks to reporters after the Governor's Ham Breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia in August 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt is confused about what his job is — or unwilling to do it.
Asked recently about the Trump Administration impounding $8.5 million of Title X funds granted to the Missouri Family Health Council to provide contraception, cancer screenings and STI testing at 52 clinics across the state, Schmitt sought to downplay the panic about Trump’s broader impounding of funds.
Schmitt said he gets asked questions about what Trump might do to us, but says “those things never happen. There’s an effort to sort of gin up outrage all the time.”
On the withholding of Title X funds specifically, Schmitt said he would be “happy to look at it more closely. I just think this idea that somehow everything’s in jeopardy, it’s just not true.”
“Now do Guatemalan sex changes need to go? Yeah, we don’t need to fund that,” he continued. “Do we need to fund DEI in Burma? No, we don’t need to do that. Do we need to fund DEI Sesame Street in Iraq? We don’t need to do that, that’s part of the problem, though, right? All of this stuff is just going out the door, nobody’s looked at it, it’s been really irresponsible.”
That’s a lot of dishonesty to unpack, but the bottom line is that everything is in fact in jeopardy and it’s Schmitt’s job to do something about it. 
Forgive my stating the obvious, but we have three branches of government and Schmitt is a member of the legislative branch. It’s his job to pass laws and allocate funding. The president doesn’t get to ignore the laws that Congress has passed. Yet Schmitt is trying to absolve Trump and Elon Musk’s illegal withholding of funding by playing dumb about the essential programs that Trump’s theft is wrecking. 
Congress enacted Title X over 50 years ago to fund necessary reproductive health care for low-income individuals. If Schmitt is genuinely unfamiliar with Title X, that is embarrassing for him and for Missouri. More likely, he is fully aware that increasing numbers of his constituents are scared or angry.
Schmitt is presumably repeating debunked claims about Sesame Street and “Guatemalan sex changes” to distract from the fact that life saving programs are being gutted. 
For example, funding for vaccine outreach is being withheld at a moment when we have a resurgence of measles, including in nearby states, that has killed children. The feds are withholding $255 million intended for public health programs in Missouri, and millions of our medical research dollars. 
But setting aside the relative merits of any particular program — if Congress funded it, Trump doesn’t get to just take it away.
Congressional Republicans, rather than demanding Trump execute the laws they have passed, have been lobbying Trump for relief for favored constituents, like farmers, from his impoundments and tariffs. 
Begging the king for favors is not how things are supposed to work in our constitutional system. 
It isn’t legal for Trump to rip up the budget because this is a representative democracy. The budget is the product of negotiations and compromises made by legislators representing the interests of people across the U.S. — not just the president’s favorite people.
A distaste for taking hard votes and saying hard things is a longstanding problem in Congress that has concentrated too much power in the executive branch. But this is an abdication of Congress’s duties like we’ve never seen before. 
Though our representatives have sometimes acknowledged the pain Trump is causing, they have done next to nothing to stop it. Trump’s tariffs (which are likely illegal because he is using emergency powers when there is no emergency) could be stopped by Congress. 
Instead, House Republicans, including all of Missouri’s, voted to amend House rules so that they cannot take a vote on removing the tariffs. They know their constituents are in trouble, but they are unwilling to do their jobs representing them if it means risking the wrath of Trump. 
In the Senate, four Republicans did vote to end the “national emergency” supposedly justifying Trump’s tariffs on Canada. Missouri’s senators were not among them.
Trump’s carnival of lawlessness has led to nearly 150 lawsuits seeking to remove tariffs or restore funding, but the courts will not be enough to save us. 
If clinics across the state close, kids go hungry, and people die of preventable diseases, our cowardly legislators will be as much to blame as Trump.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/081524_schmitt1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-14 07:02:19.991224

Months later, he ended the statewide measure. And he refused calls for a statewide mask mandate.
Instead, Idaho’s governor handed off most pandemic control measures to local governments. Some required masks and limited public gatherings at times.
This year — two years after the federal health emergency for COVID ended — the Republican supermajority-controlled Legislature stripped public health powers local governments did and didn’t use. Two new laws ban government mask mandates, along with medical mandates for vaccines, medical diseases diagnosis or treatment.
Those are among a handful of laws passed by the Idaho Legislature this year that will limit local governments’ policymaking powers.

The new laws deal with a range of issues — from banning more strict local child care regulations, limiting flags flown at government offices, and requiring big cities to regulate “public camping.”
It’s part of a longer trend of Idaho state lawmakers limiting local governments’ powers — like limiting raises to property taxes, and stopping localities from banning plastic bags or raising minimum wages.
“There is this ever present tug of war between ‘What is the proper role of local government?’ and ‘What is the proper role of the state government in telling the local government where their boundaries are?’” Senate President Pro Tempore Kelly Anthon told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “And I think that that is going to continue forever.”

 Defining preemption: How states limit local decisionmaking

In the public policy world, moves by a higher level of government to limit the power of lower government are known as preemption.
In other words, it’s when a state blocks, or preempts, a local government from taking a certain action or pursuing a certain kind of policy.
Idaho Republican elected officials have long said they value local control and limited government. But they often carve out exceptions when they preempt local power.
“When you have Republicans saying that ‘It’s the government closest to the people that governs best,’ but yet they insert themselves as often as they do every year in the business of locals, I would say that they say one thing and then often do another,” Association of Idaho Cities Executive Director Kelley Packer told the Sun in an interview.
The Association of Idaho Cities says at least 14 Idaho bills this year sought to preempt local decisionmaking.
Sometimes, preemption is appropriate, said Packer, who used to be a Republican state lawmaker. She pointed to a bill this year that will block cities from requiring electric vehicle chargers in new developments.
“We as a city or any city should not be telling other elected officials or private developers that they have to put something in their development plans that doesn’t impact the health and safety of the city’s residents,” Packer said.
To Anthon, the top Idaho Senate Republican who has served in the Legislature for 10 years, deciding whether preemption is appropriate depends on the issue.
“A Republican would say ‘We absolutely support local control, so long as it doesn’t step on constitutional rights, the rule of law and … the constitutionally mandated powers of the state Legislature,’” said Anthon, a Republican from Rupert.
But to Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, Idaho’s pattern of preemption laws “exposes” the Republican value of local governance as “complete fraud.”
“They have no interest in local government. They want government that aligns with their ideologies,” said Rubel, a Boise Democrat who has served in the Legislature for 11 years.
She rattled off examples: blocking local governments from flying LGBTQ+ pride flags, preventing local governments from responding to climate change, and blocking federal grants meant to help child care.
Idaho’s Republican control makes the state an interesting case study for preemption, Boise State University political science professor Alexandra Artiles told the Sun.
“On the one hand, preemption can contradict ‘small government’ values or the idea that city councils, for instance, can better tailor policies to localized needs,” she wrote in an email. “On the other hand, Idaho is one of the few states without constitutional Home Rule, a legal framework that helps to protect local governments from state preemption.”

 What the Idaho Legislature did this year

Idaho’s new laws were among over a dozen bills state lawmakers considered this year to limit local decision-making.
Here’s a rundown of the new Idaho local preemption laws, signed by Gov. Brad Little:
Child care regulations
House Bill 243’s big policy shift is that it loosens Idaho’s state-set minimum child care staff-to-child ratios, effectively letting a staff member care for more children at a given time. That shift will make Idaho’s child-to-staff ratios the 45th loosest in the nation, up from 41st loosest in the nation, Idaho Voices for Children Executive Director Christine Tiddens previously told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
But on a local policy front, the bill also blocks local governments from having child care regulations that are more strict than what the state sets. 
The bill does that by repealing language in Idaho law that allowed for stricter local policy. The new law takes effect July 1.
Only nine cities license day cares, Packer said. That is largely in bigger cities — in response to emergency calls from parents whose kids got hurt, she said.
Mask mandates
House Bill 32 bans mask requirements for infectious disease by schools and Idaho government entities. The law took effect immediately after Little signed it into law in early March. 
Electrical vehicles
House Bill 86 preempts cities from requiring electrical vehicle charging stations or parking spots. The law took effect immediately after Little signed it into law on March 11.
Public camping
Senate Bill 1141 will ban public camping or sleeping in Idaho’s largest cities, essentially targeting people experiencing homelessness sleeping in public. The law allows the Idaho attorney general to civilly enforce the law against cities or county highway districts that knowingly violate the law. 
The bill takes effect July 1.
Flag restrictions
House Bill 96 restricts state and local government entities to only display official domestic government and military flags. Schools, colleges and universities are exempted from the flag bill’s restrictions.
While House lawmakers didn’t specifically mention it in the House’s floor debate, Boise City Hall has displayed the LGBTQ+ pride flag. The city continues to fly the flag, the Idaho Statesman reported Friday, despite the law already taking effect. 
Cars first, sidewalks and bike paths second
Two bills, Senate Bill 1140 and Senate Bill 1144, require highway districts to tailor new projects to cars — limiting new pedestrian or bicycle infrastructure, BoiseDev reported. 
Medical mandates
Senate Bill 1210 will create a broad medical mandate ban. It bars Idaho businesses, government entities, schools and colleges from restricting entry, employment or services based on requirements for medical interventions — like vaccines, medical diagnosis or treatment.
The law takes effect July 1.

 Idaho’s public health preemption leaves state less prepared for future pandemics, some say

Preemption is common in public health, Artiles, the Boise State professor, explains. In a previous research paper, she found governors issued over 1,200 preemptions related to COVID in less than the first two years of the pandemic.

But some officials worry Idaho’s public health preemptions this year leave the state less prepared to respond to future pandemics.
Most cities didn’t even require masks, and none of them required vaccines for entry to city halls, Packer said. (Public health districts in Idaho — essentially regional health authorities — did at times mandate masks and limit gatherings.) 
But the Association of Idaho Cities has pushed back on the mask mandate ban because, Packer said, “locals are the ones that have to answer immediately to any disaster that happens within the city or the county.”
“We don’t know what might come down the pike next — what we might be faced with,” Packer said.
COVID was unexpected, and left public officials to face tough choices. Some people wanted public health restrictions, and others wanted to be left alone, Packer said.

Rubel thinks the new laws leave Idaho less prepared to deal with a future pandemic. She remembers the days that thousands of Americans died each day from COVID. A future pandemic might be even worse, she said.
“I hope we never see another pandemic in our lifetimes. But chances are, we probably will — with population growth and all the factors being what they are,” Rubel said. “I don’t know what we can fall back on at this point. Everything has been dismantled.”
A health freedom philosophy influenced bills in the Legislature this year, Anthon said. That’s along with a sentiment that the government had too heavy a hand in responding to the COVID pandemic, he added.
“That was the sentiment of a majority of the members of the Legislature this year. … And a belief that when you have to make these medical or health care decisions, it’s better done on an individual basis. And that if you give people the proper information, they will make those decisions on an individual basis better,” Anthon said. “And that there still can be a government reaction to stop the crisis, if you’ll better inform people.”

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)A tip of the hat to Oklahoma’s state senators who managed to do some good governing that, for once, actually would help improve women’s health. 
These brave lawmakers voted to allow women to access six months’s worth of birth control at a time. That would make life infinitely easier for tens of thousands of Oklahomans who rely on contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancies or to treat other medical problems such as acne, irregular periods or endometriosis.
Any legislation aimed at safely blocking unplanned pregnancies should be an easy win for lawmakers who have all but banned abortions and who abhor the idea of women traveling out of state or taking medicine to end pregnancies. 
But apparently even the idea of easing women’s access to birth control was still a bridge too far for a 13-member bloc of Republicans who spent considerable time fearmongering and bashing their constituents who utilize safe sex practices.
In their minds, men and women who rely on extremely safe and common contraceptives are murderers because they’re preventing the fertilization of a human embryo. 
I’ve been called a lot of things in my life, but I think that’s the first time I’ve been accused of murder.
This is a good reminder that legislators should really think before they speak. KFF reported that last year, 82% of reproductive-aged women used a contraceptive. Oral birth control and condoms were the most common. 
At one time, I utilized oral contraceptives for family planning purposes. My doctor and I – not my elected representatives – determined daily medication was the best option for me. The oral birth control pills my doctor prescribed required that I take them at the same time each day for them to be effective.
At the end of each month, I would cringe because I had to make a special trip to the pharmacy to refill the prescription. Anybody who has ventured to a pharmacy knows it can be an arduous process.
There was a period of time when my insurance company allowed me to get a two-month supply at once, which was a small miracle. But at some point that benefit vanished.
That’s one reason I was so thrilled to hear that lawmakers were considering legislation that would enshrine that convenience into law threefold.
But rather than focusing on the good that it would do, some of our lawmakers focused on insulting not only women’s honor by accusing them of murder, but their intelligence.
They railed about how “very dangerous” contraceptives are.
Republican Sen. Dusty Deevers went so far as to insist that women on birth control have smaller-than-normal brains and increased rates of depression, anger and suicide. He also said birth control pills cause women’s sex drives to decrease, leading to less intercourse. And he warned of increased rates of blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, and cervical cancer.
Using contraception is a choice. And it should always remain an accessible choice — for both men and women who want to lower their chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection or becoming a parent.
Contraception is not for everyone. I respect the decision of women who choose not to use it for whatever reason just as I respect the decision of women who need access to it.
And yes, there are very low risks to using contraceptives – just like there are with any medication. But as it turns out, women face higher risks of blood clots and stroke while pregnant compared with being on birth control. I wonder why lawmakers conveniently forgot to mention that little nugget.
I took acetaminophen while writing this column because legislators’ arguments were making my small brain hurt. Out of curiosity I decided to read about the possible side effects of generic Tylenol. It turns out that it can cause bloody stool, produce sores on the lips, or make eyes or skin turn yellow.
And since men in the Oklahoma Legislature feel the need to focus on medication that primarily affects women, I decided to look into one for them. Complications of a popular men’s drug to treat erectile dysfunction include risks such as vision changes and hearing loss.
There’s a risk to everything in life. Some are greater than others. But that’s why medications are prescribed in consultation with our trusted physicians, and each medication comes with a disclaimer. 
Oftentimes the benefits outweigh the risks.
Most rational people understand that you can’t murder what doesn’t exist, and just because someone is engaged in sexual intercourse doesn’t mean they’re automatically going to fertilize an embryo. Just ask the families who are struggling to conceive. Experts place the odds of becoming pregnant at around 15% to 25% each month though things like age and sexual frequency could impact that.
Luckily, a bipartisan coalition of Republicans and Democrats saw through the charade, because there was a brief moment when I thought the Democrat-proposed bill would meet a terrible demise.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Now we must wait and see if our House legislators and governor can match that intestinal fortitude.
We women are watching.

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.
Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Getty Images)Lawmakers in several states are pushing bills to prohibit unauthorized sales of hard-to-get restaurant reservations.
Proposed bills in California, Florida, Illinois and Louisiana take aim at online platforms such as Appointment Trader that allow diners to sell coveted reservations on the open market — sometimes without a restaurant’s knowledge.
In Louisiana, the issue gained attention surrounding February’s Super Bowl, when one customer paid more than $2,000 for a table at a top New Orleans restaurant, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.
Proponents of the platforms say these services provide customer flexibility and can boost restaurant business. But restaurant groups have opposed their entry into the market, arguing that they undermine the dining experience and can leave restaurants with empty tables.
The Illinois and Louisiana legislation follows New York state’s Restaurant Reservation Anti-Piracy Act, which went into effect in February. The law aims at curbing the “black market” in which reservations are scooped up as soon as they go live, Gothamist reported.
The Louisiana Restaurant Association asked state lawmakers to file a similar measure.
Wendy Waren, spokesperson for the association, told the Louisiana Illuminator that online platforms are selling reservations without restaurant’s permission or knowledge. If no one purchases reservations, tables can sit empty, preventing legitimate customers from getting a reservation, Waren said.
“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”
The Republican-sponsored bill, which would require platforms to have contracts with restaurants, is pending before the state House Commerce Committee.
A similar bill just won unanimous approval from the Illinois state House and now moves onto the state Senate for consideration.
The legislation would require a written agreement between restaurants and reservation platforms and would create a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation of the new law.
State Rep. Margaret Croke, the Democrat who sponsored the bill, characterized the move as a “commonsense” measure to protect restaurants and consumers alike.
“At a time when local restaurants are operating with extremely tight margins and working to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, they shouldn’t have to deal with third-party services snatching up their reservations and selling them at a premium, which leads to no-shows and confusion that only hurts their bottom lines,” Croke said in a statement.
The laws do not affect a restaurant’s ability to contract with reservation platforms such as OpenTable and Resy, which have applauded state crackdowns on other third-party sites.
Jonas Frey, who founded Appointment Trader, told the New York Times he launched the platform to help people get tables for a “fair market price.”
Last summer, he acknowledged that computer bots making reservations and then selling them were an issue, and said he had tried to prevent them from exploiting the website. But he said his website had only become popular because it was already difficult to get a reservation, especially in the New York City area.

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.
During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.



 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.
Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.



 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.
State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

(Courtesy of Noah Philson)LINCOLN – A former state senator and decorated U.S. Army veteran is headed again to Ukraine in hopes of providing reassurance that Americans still support the country’s fight for freedom against Russia.
This month, former Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon is making his fifth trip to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, and he feels it might be the most precarious.

The war, he said, has morphed from a battle at the front of artillery and tanks, into an exchange of cheap but dangerous drones and Russian “glide bombs” that can’t be detected by air defense systems.
“It’s a difficult place to go right now,” Brewer told the Examiner. “We want to see [Ukraine] win this war, and we want to do everything we can to boost their morale. I think they’re struggling right now.”
An additional goal of the latest trip, he said, is to make connections with agricultural officials in Ukraine. Nebraska, with its farm building and equipment sector, could play an important role in rebuilding the country, according to Brewer.
“If we don’t do anything until the war ends, we’ll lose that opportunity,” he said.
Don Hutchens, a retired head of the Nebraska Corn Board, is among those traveling to Ukraine this time. A Lincoln-based television reporter, John Grinvalds, is coming again to document the trip.
Brewer, an expert sniper who was wounded twice during six tours of duty in Afghanistan, used his previous trips to Ukraine to serve as an unofficial representative of the U.S. and as a military observer who relayed information gleaned from officials and soldiers at the front to the Nebraska delegation in Congress and the State Department.
The information included the effectiveness of American aid, ammunition and weapons and what else the Ukrainians might need to repel the invasion.
But this trip — a year after the last one — will be different because of the dramatic shift in U.S. policy toward Ukraine after President Donald Trump took office. Trump suspended $1 billion in American aid to Ukraine, and, in a combative White House meeting last month, scolded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over his insistence that Russia could not be trusted.
Trump, later, stated that Zelenskyy was “not ready for peace.” Meanwhile, negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin have failed to result in a complete cease fire or peace deal.

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump claimed that he could end the war in Ukraine before he took office or within 24 hours of becoming president. The Associated Press recently reported that Trump has admitted those boasts were a “little bit sarcastic,” though the president was also quoted that he was optimistic that he could broker an end to the war.
Brewer, in an interview Friday, said the contentious White House exchange between Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance was unfortunate.
“That’s something that needs to happen in a back room,” Brewer said of the heated debate before cameras.
That exchange, the senator said, helped boost Zelenskyy’s popularity ratings, but has put America in “a different light” across Europe and in Ukraine. During his past visits, Brewer said that when people saw the United States flag on his shoulder, they would come up and express thanks and provide hugs.
“You were always thought of in a pretty good light as an American…,” he said. “A good guy, who’s always going to be there.”
”We’re kind of in a precarious place right now. A lot of Europe is scratching their head and not seeing us as the same ally as they had before.”
Brewer said he hopes his latest visit will help assure the Ukrainians that “no one is abandoning them.”

“There’s a new president in the White House, and they have a little different look at this war,” he added. “It doesn’t change that what they’re doing is commendable.”
Despite the suspension of U.S. aid and armaments, Brewer believes that the Ukrainians are “winning” in some areas, inflicting heavy casualties, while bracing for an offensive from Russia later this month.
The war, he said, is now being fought with low-cost drones and glide bombs that avoid detection because they have no engines to produce a heat signature. Poisonous gases accompany some Russian missiles, Brewer said, and Ukraine has been forced to become more choosy when deploying expensive anti-missile systems.
While the Russian territory captured by Ukraine has largely been reclaimed by Putin’s army, it has come at a heavy cost of perhaps 50,000 Russian soldiers lost in the past month, according to Brewer.
“They’re losing as many people in a day as we lost in Afghanistan in 20 years,” Brewer said.
Help is coming from Europe, he said. F-16 fighter jets recently arrived from The Netherlands, as have gas masks from Britain, Brewer said. Germany has been asked to provide missiles to replace the American Tomahawks.
If those are provided, it could be a “game changer,” he said.
Can there be peace? Brewer said he doesn’t see it soon, given that Russia is gearing up for a huge offensive push.
But by this fall, if Ukraine can hang on, he said that most observers believe that Russia will have exhausted its military assets, and leaders will be ready to strike a peace deal.
Brewer said he doesn’t see any quit in the Ukrainian soldiers he’s met at the front, some of whom are 50 years old or older.
“It’s all because they grew up in communism, and they know the consequences of giving up,” he said. “They’d rather die than see their kids and grandkids grow up in that system.”

(Photo courtesy of Richard Schaefer)It was a day like any other when Richard Schaefer entered a Madison health care clinic to receive harm reduction supplies. Over 10 years, Schaefer had tried recovering from what began with dependence on a prescription for the pain killer Percocet and later spiraled into an all-consuming heroin addiction. As Schaefer waited for his supplies, he noticed an advertisement seeking volunteers for a study into whether therapy assisted by psilocybin – the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms – could unshackle people from addiction. 
“I’ve tried all types of rehabs,” said Schaefer when he spoke recently with the Wisconsin Examiner. Schaefer is 42, off heroin and training to be a peer support specialist. But from rehab clinics in Oshkosh and Wauwatosa to a 30-day program in the Racine County Jail, old-school complete abstinence and medication-assisted treatment using suboxone, Schaefer had tried it all. “I don’t know if it was more of the timing of being ready to quit or just finding something that actually works for me,” he said. “Something different, an alternative route…This study really changed my life, to tell you the truth.”

Although overdose deaths are down in every state and the District of Columbia for the first time since the fentanyl crisis began, millions of people continue to struggle with opioid use disorder nationwide. With demand for treatment still high, the University of Wisconsin Transdisciplinary Center for Research in Psychoactive Substances (TCRPS) is working on finding solutions. Using psilocybin, the team at UW-Madison is developing groundbreaking new therapies tailor-made for people like Schaefer. Advertisements for the study, which focuses on opioid and methamphetamine addiction, can be found in Madison health care clinics like the one Schaefer visited and even on signs on city buses.  
“We already have seen evidence that psilocybin can do some remarkable things to improve the patients’ ability to gain and process important insights about their lives and experiences,” Paul Hutson, a professor and founding director of TCRPS, told UW News in 2023. “We’re excited to see what it can do along those same lines for patients struggling with substance abuse, many of whom have overlapping mental health conditions.” 
A bipartisan bill that began circulating last session in the Wisconsin Legislature aimed to make psychedelic drug treatment available to veterans suffering from PTSD. Commenting on a psilocybin study at UW-Madison that aims to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in combat veterans, UW researcher and professor Dr. Cody Wenthur told Wisconsin Examiner that conducting trials with an inclusive cross-section of subjects is important. 
Although funding cuts by the Trump Administration have undermined research efforts across the country, UW’s psilocybin study is not at risk, university officials say. A university spokesperson said that the study’s funding does not come from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and thus is “insulated” from cuts to NIH funding. 
Research has shown that psilocybin has the potential to rewire the human brain, for people with depression. The creation of new neuro-pathways aided by psilocybin, combined with therapy, could help treat substance use disorder, which also changes the brain over time to reinforce addictive behavior.
Nationwide millions of people struggle with an opioid use disorder of some kind. Wisconsin alone annually loses thousands of lives to drug overdoses, with a large portion of those deaths linked with variants of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. By 2038, Wisconsin is expected to receive over $780 million in settlement funding from lawsuits against the companies that seeded the overdose crisis by funneling large volumes of addictive medications into communities. That funding could be used to repair the lives of people and the health of their communities.

Before he started taking Percoset, Schaefer was a college-educated operations manager at a furniture company, who’d grown up in Racine County. A husband, father and homeowner, he was climbing the ladder in his company when he was prescribed the pain killers. “Everything just kind of quickly fell apart,” said Schaefer, “within about six months to a year I lost all that.” 
During those six months his use of the medication became a recreational habit, then developed into a heroin addiction. Once needles came into the picture, “then it’s just no going back,” Schaefer said. “I ended up going down the drain. I lost my marriage, I lost custody of my kids on an overdose, and then I lost my job — my career I was at for 10 years. And then I lost my house to a foreclosure.” The degradation of his life was swift. He recalled  being kicked out of two sober houses. Eventually, he said, “I ended up on the streets.”
The doors of perception 
Schaefer was immediately intrigued when he saw an advertisement for the psilocybin study. He was already on a suboxone regimen in December 2023, which he said helped him get “on the other side of the wall” from his addiction. He entered the study the following month after contacting the research team. Numerous physical health assessments, phone calls, interviews and meetings followed. 
Schaefer was connected with “two really great therapists,” Travis Fox, a doctor in psychology and Nikki Zellner, a licensed clinical social worker. Their compassion and patience formed the bedrock for his recovery. He had to meet them once a week for a month, in addition to meeting other requirements. 










When you look at it as medicine rather than a drug, then we can have a different view on it.


– Richard Schaefer


“They really got to know me and really bring out, or work on, issues that I had suppressed in my life, going back to childhood.” Schaefer said. Fox and Zellner “helped me to learn to love myself again,” he added. It was an alternative approach to therapy that Schaefer hadn’t seen in other recovery programs. “They accepted me for who I am, and helped me to learn that it’s OK to be myself,” he said. “To find the freedom of making a choice, it wasn’t all about abstinence, which a lot of programs are.” Schaefer said that “somehow, with making it my choice, I’ve become a new person and really found a new freedom with that, and really blossomed and come a long ways.” 
By April, Schaefer was ready to step into the experience of psilocybin-based therapy. Early in the morning he caught a cab to the UW nursing school. After one final physical check-up and conversation with doctors, Schaefer was led to a space which he called “the sacred room there.” In that comfortable room surrounded by artwork and with a couch and spaces for Schaefer and the therapists to sit, Schaefer took “the medicine” and his journey began. 
“They didn’t tell me what to call it,” said Schaefer, speaking of the psilocybin he took. “When you look at it as medicine rather than a drug, then we can have a different view on it.”
Taking his shoes off as he entered the room, Schaefer lay back on the couch, took a tablet, donned a blindfold and waited as about 20 minutes passed. 
“I remember the first session for me was kind of like a movie,” he said. “Like different scenes kept coming to me, you know? Different waves kept coming to me. And some of it was different scenes from life, some of it made sense, or some of it I’m still trying to make sense of what they were. But I realized a lot of things in that first session alone.”
“I think I was learning to find myself,” he said of the experience. A persistent sense of comfort, peace and acceptance stayed with Schaefer after that first session. His ego had been muted, “and I just had this new sense that things were OK,” he said. “I began to have a new outlook on life then.”

Sometimes participants in the psilocybin trials need a bathroom break or to pull out and communicate about what is happening. Zellner and Fox were never far away, and were open to talking to him while he was undergoing the journey. “It’s hard to put words on things while you’re having the medicine in you,” said Schaefer. “I go into it and would like to tell them all these things going on, and to be recorded, and jot down and stuff, but it’s like you can’t find the words to say it.”
“You’re kind of in another world,” he added, saying there may not actually be human language to describe some of the experience. The second dose was even more profound. The “scenes” returned with astonishing vividness. Schaefer recalled going through stages of what felt like collective “human sadness” as well as happiness and joy. 
“There was like a buildup from down and dark to the absolute most bright light and loving energy that I’d ever experienced,” he said. It was in that peak moment “when I felt that I was in the presence of a higher power,” which manifested as a sort of “god” or “energy that was in front of me.” He said he felt a distinctly separate, intelligent presence throughout his sessions, “like things were being taught to me and shown to me.” 
Whatever it was, the presence gave him “the most awesome comforting feeling I’ve ever felt in my life,” Schaefer recalled. The feeling melted away as Schaefer descended from that blissful state. 
Integration 
In many ways, the hard work begins after the psychedelic experience ends. With the help of their therapists, study participants must attempt to integrate and process what they learned during the sessions. “The integration was powerful because of the therapists being there, to immediately process things coming to your mind,” said Schaefer. 
After each session, Schaefer was walked back to the hospital where he was given some alone time for the night. He never interacted with any other study participants. The next morning, Schaefer met with Fox and Zellner again for a clearer, deeper dive into the prior day’s session. Another follow up came about a week later. “And again, man, that has been such a life-changing experience having a psychedelic medicine with therapists,” Schaefer said, emphasizing that without proper integration and therapy after psychedelic experiences, “you’re lost.” 
Today, Schaefer is clean from heroin and opioids and living a healthier life. Undergoing the psilocybin study at UW-Madison has inspired him to pursue a career as a certified peer support specialist, for which he’s currently finishing training. He aims to become an advocate for harm reduction medications and alternative psychedelic therapies for addiction recovery.
“I would say it’s not for everybody, but for some people who’ve tried different approaches and it hasn’t worked, and they’re serious about changing their life and having an open mind, then this could really be a profound experience to help them go in a new direction,” said Schaefer. 
He hopes that both treatment providers and people struggling with addiction remember that recovery takes patience, compassion, and that it doesn’t have to rely on an abstinence-only philosophy. “It might take 20 times … trying different approaches,” he said. 
Yet in Wisconsin, alternative options are not widely available. States like Colorado are already working to expand psychedelic-based treatment centers, as well as to legalize and decriminalize psilocybin. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Legislature remains reluctant to explore bills to even legalize medicinal cannabis. Schaefer hopes that more people struggling with opioid addiction get the chance that he did. “I’d say it’s already changed my life in so many ways.”

Last Dec. 16, 2024, the Twin Falls County Historic Preservation Commission received the following message: “We are pleased to inform you that Twin Falls County Historic Preservation Commission’s A250ID grant application has been selected for award. Thank you for your thoughtful and complete application to commemorate this milestone for our nation and state. We applaud your organization’s service to your community. Congratulations!… We are grateful for your partnership in advancing the ideals of the American Revolution – equality, liberty, and justice – through meaningful community engagement and recognizing, appreciating, and commemorating Idaho’s journey in America’s legacy
The historic preservation commission had applied for and was awarded $25,000 America250 in Idaho grant, only to have the grant program abruptly cancelled by the Legislature. The 31 applicants, having been awarded grants, and being completely unaware of the Legislature’s new terms and conditions, should be entitled to receive the funds promised under the original rules that encouraged the 31 organizations to apply in the first place.
On March 24, 2025, the historic preservation commission is then informed by the Idaho State Legislature that “After careful consideration of legislative intent, the grant program through America250 is cancelled.”  No details or reasoning are provided for the cancellation.  The March 24 cancellation letter goes on to proclaim love for Idaho and its history, stating that “We appreciate your organization’s role in preserving and sharing Idaho’s story …”
The historic preservation commission volunteers have dedicated over seven years and hundreds of hours of donated time, with the support and encouragement of SHPO, Twin Falls County commissioners, Idaho Heritage Trust, and Preservation Twin Falls in an effort to establish a National Register Historic Mining District preserving a series of Chinese placer gold mining sites dating to ca. 1870-1881 and ca.1933-40 Depression-era located in the Snake River Canyon between the Perrine and Hansen bridges. 
Our initially accepted project application seemed to perfectly correlate with House Concurrent Resolution 31’s stated criteria: “Idaho, known as the ‘Gem State,’ occupies a unique place in the mosaic of American history, with significant historical milestones, eras, innovations, and advancements …”  
The 1870s, when the United States was commemorating the Revolution’s centennial, was a dynamic time when southern Idaho was fundamentally changed by the California gold rush, the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, and the new Transpacific trade and immigration networks extending from Guangdong (Canton) and Hong Kong to San Francisco and the Snake River Canyon.
One of our strengths as a community and a state has been the investment in cultural and historical preservation.  The America250 in Idaho grant projects would have paid huge, long-term dividends in preserving and promoting Idaho’s historic legacy and public education. 
Volunteer organizations such as the Twin Falls County Historic Preservation Commission, Lincoln County Historical Society, and the Boise Contemporary Theater rely heavily on grants such as America250 in Idaho to preserve and share Idaho’s story.  
The abrupt cancellation of these projects has implications extending far beyond the balance sheets; they threaten the very fabric of the communities they serve. 
The historic preservation commission’s goals align with the stated criteria in HCR 31 to “encourage Idahoans to reflect on American and state history and heritage, develop deeper connections within their communities, and advance Idaho’s contributions and values for the benefit of our children and future generations.”  
The historic preservation commission’s volunteer commissioners are committed to following through with the National Register nomination for the Snake River Canyon Historic Mining District, and it is our hope we can continue to count on the Idaho Legislature’s support for grass-roots, community-based historic preservation projects.

In a rarely filed and sometimes sharply worded “motion for rehearing,” state prosecutors maintain that the Appeals Court erred in granting a dismissal last month of the theft by deception charge faced by former director Trevor Jones.

The 21-page request, signed by acting Solicitor General Zachary Viglianco, argues that was wrong to dismiss the felony charge without hearing arguments by the AG’s office, and that the dismissal was premature by not giving the AG’s office 10 days to contest it.
The court granted a “summary dismissal” of the charge faced by Jones, thus discharging the prosecution without hearing arguments from the AG’s office.
“Inexplicably,” the AG’s request states, “the court granted Jones’ motion two days before the state’s response deadline had run. That was error. And one with profound consequences.”
“The court’s premature ruling,” the motion continues, “signals to litigants that they cannot rely on the straightforward adherence to and application of the court’s own rules.”
Jones’ lawyer disagrees
On Thursday, a lawyer representing Jones, Michael Wilson of Omaha, asked the Appeals Court to uphold the dismissal, arguing the the AG’s office relied on the wrong court precedents in seeking to revive its prosecution.
The response and the request for rehearing, filed April 3, are the latest twists in the prosecution of Jones. He is accused of misdirecting $270,000 in donations from a private foundation into another foundation he controlled, rather than using the money, as intended, to cover agency financial losses from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Jones resigned the $164,800-a-year director’s job in 2022, shortly before a State Auditor’s report raised questions about the legality of the funds diversion.
In January, Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong tossed out the felony charge faced by Jones, ruling that state prosecutors had failed to bring him to trial within the state’s speedy trial deadline.
Then, last month, Nebraska Court of Appeals Judge Frankie Moore granted a dismissal of the state’s appeal, ruling that state prosecutors had failed to follow proper procedure in appealing the lower court’s dismissal.
State prosecutors, via the motion for rehearing, are now asking the Appeals Court to reconsider and to let them revive the case against Jones.
The AG’s office, in its recent motion, argued that dismissing the case — which it called “a high-profile criminal case involving a public official” — on technical grounds without allowing the state to present any argument undercuts the “the fair administration of justice” and the opportunity to hear “two sides to every story.”
No action yet
The Appeals Court had not issued a response to the state’s rehearing motion as of late this week.
When the case was dismissed last month, Jones’ lead attorney Mallory Hughes of Omaha, told the Examiner that she had been “very confident” that the Court of Appeals would dismiss the case and was equally confident that further appeals would not be successful.

Jones, 52, had headed the agency he renamed “History Nebraska” for six years before his resignation. Gov. Jim Pillen has since revived the agency’s long-time name, the Nebraska State Historical Society and installed as director a former Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard, Daryl Bohac.
Eric Hamilton, who had served as Solicitor General for the AG’s office since 2023, recently left that post to take a job with the U.S. Department of Justice in the Trump Administration.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Fourth-generation Middle Tennessee cattle farmer Cole Liggett lined up with scientists and environmental advocates in March to urge Tennessee lawmakers not to gut the state’s historically strong protections for wetlands.
Wetlands protection has been good business for Liggett. In addition to raising cattle, he’s a manager at Headwaters Reserve, a firm that developers pay to preserve and restore wetlands and streams so they can destroy them elsewhere, called mitigation banking. If lawmakers follow through on a plan to deregulate an estimated 80% of the state’s isolated wetlands, that will upend the industry in Tennessee and drive up prices for developers still required to pay for mitigation, Liggett testified.
Liggett works in a growing industry that operates more than 2,500 mitigation banks nationwide, earning an estimated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019, according to a 2023 study funded by the Ecological Restoration Business Association. 
The industry is built on demand spurred by the 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act, which requires developers to offset their damage to wetlands by building or restoring wetlands nearby.
But recent federal actions to shrink the scope of that law are pushing states to choose how strictly they will regulate wetlands. The consequences of those decisions not only threaten further degradation of land, water and wildlife, but also the fortunes of an industry that has made a big business out of conservation.
Environmentalists: Second attempt at wetlands bill would leave 80% vulnerable to development

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from wetlands that don’t have a surface connection to navigable waters, which means bigger rivers and lakes. President Donald Trump’s Administration has vowed to ease regulation, allowing developers to ditch and drain all but the wettest wetlands without permits or mitigation. Environmentalists fear that a recent order to speed up around 600 energy projects nationwide could limit requirements to compensate for the destruction of wetlands.
Some states, such as North Carolina and Indiana, have loosened regulations since the Sackett decision. In March, Kentucky lawmakers passed legislation to do the same, overriding Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
Tennessee’s wetlands regulations predate the federal Clean Water Act protections passed in the 1970s, but pending legislation could roll back much of that protection, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The Tennessee Ecological Restoration Association, which represents Liggett and other mitigation bankers in Tennessee and the southeast, told the Tennessee Lookout that this will directly impact the growing mitigation industry. “We will see a decrease in demand for credits if aquatic resources are deregulated.”
Those concerns aren’t shared by everyone in mitigation banking. The national industry is more worried about the defunding of agencies that oversee banks and the prospect of a recession.
William Coleman’s California-based ecological consulting firm Eco-Asset Solutions and Innovations does much of its business in states that have active wetlands mitigation banking programs.
“My company has not seen any downturn in business,” Coleman, the firm’s founder and president, said. ‘Landowners are still very interested in the revenue opportunities mitigation banking offers.”

States limiting wetlands protections could risk long-term industry investments
Just outside of Memphis, a chorus of frogs on a roughly 250-acre tract of former farmland nearly drowns out the traffic on nearby Austin Peay Highway. Environmental consulting firm EnSafe planted about 54,000 trees on the once flood-prone fields in 2018 and will be responsible for its upkeep until the wetland is mature and healthy – anywhere from seven to 10 years. After that, the land will go to a partnering land trust, where it will be conserved in perpetuity.
“Granted, there is a business piece to what we do, but restoring things to the way they were is also pretty cool … There will be a pocket here forever,” EnSafe principal Paul Stoddard said.
The West Tennessee Wetlands Mitigation Bank has sold credits to Amazon to offset a new delivery center in Fayette County. A contractor purchased credits to compensate for a 2-million-square-foot distribution facility called “Project Iron Giant,” according to records kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one of the federal agencies tasked with overseeing wetlands regulations.
TERA estimates that mitigation businesses have poured more than $1 billion into around 130 mitigation bank investments across Tennessee.
“The beauty of mitigation credits is that the developer just writes a check and they’re done. All the monitoring and reporting and maintenance and stuff is up to the bank,” EnSafe Senior Ecologist Jimmy Groton said.
That process makes mitigation banking a high-risk industry, according to Liggett. Regardless of whether they sell credits, banks are required to maintain their wetlands for at least seven years. The proposed regulatory rollback on Tennessee’s wetlands would mean an 80% decrease in demand for mitigation businesses, he testified to Tennessee lawmakers on March 26.
“Such a drastic decrease in the demand after such a high investment … has potential to drive up credit prices as a necessity to avoid potential financial insolvencies,” Liggett said.
Hillary Bonham, a principal at environmental consulting firm Baetis Restoration Partners, has experience as both a residential developer and mitigation banker. She told Tennessee lawmakers that the current average price of a credit in Tennessee is around $50,000. Reducing regulations and hampering demand will likely cause the credits that remain to be “exponentially more expensive when they are needed.”
In Georgia, where isolated wetlands are not regulated, a single credit can range from $750,000 to $1.1 million according to the Georgia Alabama Land Trust In Lieu Fee Program, Bonham said.
 States can further protect isolated wetlands that no longer count as Waters of the U.S.

Mitigation banks have been the preferred way to offset wetland destruction for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps since 2008, and the industry has ballooned rapidly since the first entrepreneurial banks were established in the early 1990s.
John Paul Woodley, Jr. helped issue the Army Corps of Engineers’ 2008 mitigation rule while serving as assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. He’s also the immediate past chair of the board of the National Environmental Banking Association, a trade association with around 100 members nationwide.
Some people expected to see the Sackett decision have a dramatic impact on mitigation banking, he said, but two limiting factors prevented a panic within the industry.










For every wetland that is destroyed, we must see at least three acres of wetlands being built, which would not happen during an emergency process.


– Matt Rota, Healthy Gulf


First, when the decision was made, developers already well into the permit process could either choose to move forward under the previous terms or go back to the drawing board. Most businesses didn’t want to start over, so many pending permits under review by the Corps proceeded as though nothing had happened, Woodley said.
Second, states have significant control over the regulation of state waters.
“Many states have just said, ‘We don’t care about that. We have our own jurisdiction, and we’re not limited by what the Clean Water Act says is the waters of the United States … If the U.S. doesn’t want to protect those waters, that’s fine and dandy. We will,’” Woodley said.
Some states have more isolated wetlands than others, he added, and those states will have to decide whether to protect those resources. Woodley thinks they ultimately will.
Generally, coastal wetlands will maintain federal protection because of their connection to the navigable waters of the ocean. But experts fear that some swamps and marshlands, once protected, may now face development due to human-made flood-control structures, such as levees or berms, that could be construed as legal separations between wetlands and waters of the U.S.
How President Trump’s push to expedite wetlands permitting process could backfire
President Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” led the Corps to fast-track review for more than 600 permits. 
Environmental advocates say that could come at the expense of wetlands. 
“Any damages to wetlands due to this emergency must be mitigated properly,” said Matt Rota, senior policy director for Healthy Gulf, a nonprofit advocating for communities along the Gulf Coast. “For every wetland that is destroyed, we must see at least three acres of wetlands being built, which would not happen during an emergency process.”
Those in the industry see other actions by the administration as slowing down environmental permitting, posing a different kind of threat. Trump’s first administration made funding cuts to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps that ultimately increased the time it took to review pending permits. Longer review periods can mean less return on investment for landowners, Coleman said.
“That meant there were just not enough bodies to review the applications that were on the table … so there was a tremendous delay,” he said. 
Coleman’s company found that an average two- to three-year review period stretched into four or five years during Trump’s first term. 










We have learned the hard way that each acre of wetlands that is destroyed and replaced with concrete worsens our flooding problems and increases our climate risks.


– Kristen Schlemmer, Bayou City Waterkeeper


Woodley said demand for mitigation banks is driven largely by development pressure. In Virginia, where he’s based, data centers are a big contributor. Some of the mitigation banking industry’s biggest customers are state transportation departments and the oil and gas industry—roadways and pipelines often have less flexibility to build elsewhere.
“Anything that takes place that causes an economic downturn, that causes people to retrench and postpone their development plans … that’s the risk to the mitigation industry,” Woodley said. “They had a very difficult time around 2008 … the number of permits applied for declined, and at the same time, the number of the requirements for mitigation took a downturn.”
In Gulf States like Louisiana, which is home to 40% of wetlands in the continental U.S. and has sustained 80% of national wetland losses, environmental advocates warn about the consequences of filling in wetlands through emergency permitting without ensuring proper mitigation. 
“We have learned the hard way that each acre of wetlands that is destroyed and replaced with concrete worsens our flooding problems and increases our climate risks,” said Kristen Schlemmer, senior legal director of the Bayou City Waterkeeper, a nonprofit working to protect communities impacted by water pollution and flooding in Houston.
Some wetlands mitigation banking businesses have begun to diversify their offerings to include conservation-based credits for protecting the habitats of endangered species, carbon sequestration or nutrient banking to prevent excessive runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus.

The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.


During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities. 










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network advocacy director


Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
Private detention oversight
Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
Troubling conditions
Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.


State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.

For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.











We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith



Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

In 2023, Michigan Democrats passed a number of clean energy laws, including requiring energy companies to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040, and granting the state’s energy regulator the authority to approve permits for large-scale renewable energy and battery storage projects, which was previously exclusive to local governments.
Under the law, which took effect on Nov. 29, 2024, developers are required to work with municipalities whose permitting process mirrors the new requirements, giving the two parties 120 days to reach an agreement. The parties can also apply for a 120 day extension. 
However, if the municipality fails to approve or deny the application within a timely manner, if the local zoning board adopts standards stricter than the health and safety standards outlined in the law, or if the local zoning board denies an application that complies with the standards outlined in the law, the developer can submit a permitting application to the Michigan Public Service Commission, or MPSC, which regulates Michigan’s energy utilities. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the complaint, Otsego County failed to adopt a renewable energy ordinance that complies with the requirements of the state law. Additionally, the plaintiffs argue that because the exceptions for submitting an application to MPSC do not apply, RWE Solar Development LLC, the developer for the project, cannot move forward with construction of its “45th Parallel Solar” project until any challenges to the permit are resolved. 
Earlier this year, the project faced backlash from 50 Republican House Representatives and Democratic State Rep. Karen Whitsett of Detroit, over an effort to lease more than 420 acres of state-managed land for the project from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. 
However, Patricia Kakridas, senior manager for media and public relations for RWE Clean Energy, told the Michigan Advance in January that the project would be developed on land leased from two private landowners and does not include state land in its footprint. 
Kakridas also indicated the decision not to lease state land was not a recent determination, telling the Advance “We did not just make that determination. We started working with two private landowners in 2019 and during the development process, we conducted outreach to all landowners adjacent to the project location, including DNR. Ultimately, we decided to move forward with leasing property from the two private landowners for this particular project.”
Advocates rally for clean energy as lawmakers continue to tweak legislation

David Delaney, who represents the plaintiffs challenging the project, told the Michigan Advance that the plaintiffs include individuals whose property adjoin the site for the solar development, alongside residents living nearby and residents of Otsego County who expect the county to comply with the law. He expects many other residents will join the case.
Alongside challenging the permit for the project, the complaint also raises concerns with the state law, arguing its standards for “dark sky-friendly lighting solutions” and “dark sky-friendly lighting technology” are unconstitutionally broad. It also asks the court to declare the energy zoning law’s ban on localities adopting zoning standards that are stricter than those outlined within the legislation, an “invalid exercise of state legislative authority.”
Additionally the complaint argues the zoning law violates both the U.S. Constitution and the Michigan state constitution, pointing to an Oct. 10 order from the Michigan Public Service Commissions which the plaintiffs say redefines terms and procedures within the state law. 
“[The law] confers broad sweeping authority to the MPSC. [It] provides no standards to channel the scope of the MPSC’s broad authority. [It] provides the MPSC with indefinite powers,” the complaint reads, asking the court to declare both the law and the MPSC’s order unconstitutional. 
“The Michigan Public Service Commission is in the executive branch under the governor, and so in their order from 2024 they started to rewrite the Act 233 legislation. And that certainly isn’t their bailiwick, that’s what the House and Senate do. They write the law,” Delaney said. 
“So [the MPSC] made an adjustment there to say, ‘You know what, if you didn’t adopt a CREO — that’s the compatible renewable energy ordinance — it’s okay. You can have your own zoning ordinance, or you can draft a new one, or use the one that you already have in place.’ The problem with that is, is that the state law doesn’t provide for that,” Delaney said.
While nearly 80 municipalities have already filed a suit with the Michigan Court of Appeals challenging the MPSC’s order, Delaney said his client’s concern is that it does not address the state law. 
 “If the Court of Appeals sided with the counties and the townships, the MPSC would just draft another order and another order and another order. So you’re kind of going around the tree, if you will, when you’re not getting to the heart of the issue,” Delaney said. 
In an email, Kakridas told the Advance that RWE does not comment on ongoing litigation. 
“We look forward to delivering electricity and substantial economic benefits and tax revenue to Otsego County from our investment in the 45th Parallel project.” Kakridas said.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Revised textbooks on the five Native American tribes that share land with North Dakota will be ready in time for next school year.
For about three decades, the books went without updates due to a lack of funding, said Lucy Fredericks, director of Indian and multicultural education for the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction.
In 2023, the agency began work on editing the books with the help of federal grant money.
The revision process was a joint effort among the Department of Public Instruction, the five tribes, higher education institutions across the state and other educational and cultural organizations.
“We wouldn’t be able to get it done without our partnerships,” Fredericks said at a Thursday night reception at United Tribes Technical College celebrating the books’ completion.

The Indigenous Education Coalition — a group that included some of the series’ original authors — and Sacred Pipe Resource Center took the lead on revising the text, according to a project timeline provided by the Department of Public Instruction. They fielded input from tribal colleges, tribal education and historic preservation offices as well as other groups. Updates included incorporating more recent historical events into the textbooks.
“Really, at the heart of this is Indigenous peoples telling their own stories,” said Sashay Schettler, assistant director for Indian and multicultural education at the Department of Public Instruction.
The six-part series includes one introductory textbook and books focusing on each of the five tribes — including an all-new book on the history and culture of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate.
The state initially held off on including Sisseton-Wahpeton since its administrative center is in South Dakota. The idea was that South Dakota could produce a textbook of its own, but that never happened.
So the Department of Public Instruction during the revision process reached out to the tribe to see if it wanted to join the North Dakota textbook series.
Nick Asbury, website content specialist for the agency, said he anticipated it taking at least a couple years to write the book from scratch. The tribe managed to write it in 90 days so it could release alongside the other updated editions, he said.
“I have never seen anything like that,” Asbury said. “It was amazing to see.”

Though the series is written for a K-12 audience, higher ed institutions rely on them for information, too.
The ebooks will be available for free online this summer, according to the Department of Public Instruction. Print editions will be rolled out to schools this fall and also will be available for purchase. 
The original editions of the textbooks are available for free on most ebook platforms.
The agency hopes to revise the books every three to five years going forward. 
Recent grad sees a gap in educational quality for tribal students

Under a law adopted by the state Legislature in 2021, North Dakota K-12 schools are required to teach Native history.
State survey data collected in 2023 indicates schools may be struggling to meet that requirement. The survey found that 75% of teachers and 89% of administrators were aware of the legislation. Additionally, 57% of teachers and 67% of administrators said they were aware of tribal history resources published by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction.
The project was made possible in part because of federal grant funding. Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler noted during the event that the future of some of the Department of Public Instruction’s federal grants remains uncertain.
The agency hopes the new books will become a staple for North Dakota history classes.
“These books today provide a comprehensive and rich resource of material that our educators can use in teaching Native American culture, history and traditions in our state,” Baesler said.

Once, the story goes, he almost drowned while exploring at a nearby pond, a pond now located on the Lincoln Country Club golf course grounds.


A show for Eiseley fans
A musical opera created by Eiseley scholar and performer John Cimino will be performed in May in Omaha and Scottsbluff.
The piece is based on Eiseley’s book, “The Star Thrower,” which highlights the author’s beliefs that “we are of Nature, not above Nature.”
“An Evening with Loren Eiseley’s ‘The Star Thrower’ “ will be performed May 23 at the Western Nebraska Community College recital hall in Scottsbluff at 7:30 p.m. MDT, and on May 27 at 7:30 p.m. CDT at the Strauss Performing Arts Center on the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
Cimino, based in New York, is an award-winning composer and concert artist who has performed throughout the U.S. and Europe. He has performed alongside the famous tenor, Luciano Pavarotti, as well as at the International Verdi Festival in Italy, the Wexford Festival in Ireland and the New York City Opera. He is an advocate for the arts in education and professional life, and now serves as president and CEO of Associated Solo Artists.
— Paul Hammel


On Friday, Lincoln officials and Eiseley fans gathered to dedicate a state historical marker along the small stream in Irvingdale Park, a stream that helped inspire the writings of an author once praised by Publishers Weekly as “the modern Thoreau.”
Eiseley, who died in 1977, was an anthropologist, philosopher and natural sciences writer who grew up in Lincoln. After drifting across the West, he graduated from the University of Nebraska with English and geology/anthropology degrees. Eiseley served as editor of the “Prairie Schooner” literary magazine at NU, and participated in digs for fossils and human artifacts across the western part of the state and southwestern U.S.
He later earned a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania, and later taught at the University of Kansas and Oberlin (Ohio) College. Eiseley eventually returned to Penn. At his death, he was the Benjamin Franklin professor of anthropology and history of science.
With 36 honorary degrees, he was said to be the most decorated professor at the University of Pennsylvania since Ben Franklin.
His essays, written in a poetic style, eventually found a wider audience, as did his books, which included “The Immense Journey,” “The Star Thrower” and “The Unexpected Universe.” His friend, science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, said that Eiseley’s writings “changed my life.”
Bing Chen, a long-time engineering professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and president of the Loren Eiseley Society, praised Eiseley at the dedication ceremony as a “great American author” whose writings are “timeless” and still very relevant today given global warming and climate change.
Chen quoted from his writings: “We have joined a caravan … and we will see as far as we can. But we cannot in our lifetime, see all that we wish to see, or learn all that we hunger to know.”
Gaylor Baird said it was fitting that a historical marker be placed along a stream in Lincoln that influenced Eiseley’s writings and philosophy.
His most famous quote, she said, was “If there is magic in this world, it is contained in water” — a quote that was placed on the historical marker.
“I hope this marker inspires people of all ages to pause, to look around — put down their phones — and feel some of the magic in these green spaces that Loren Eiseley felt,” Gaylor Baird said.
She added that a special exhibit on Eiseley’s life had just opened at the Eiseley Branch Library in Lincoln.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Wetlands? Who needs ‘em? They aren’t soaring mountain peaks offering panoramic views. They aren’t ancient trees older than the nation we live in. Yet wetlands are important. Many would say they suffer from ugly duckling syndrome compared to other natural features, but as this former farm boy will tell you, the ugliest hogs always taste the best, and things that aren’t much to look at often have the most value.
Tennessee wetlands for sale? How we got here.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. EPA stripped federal protection from so-called “isolated” wetlands, or wetlands that lack a surface connection to other bodies of water. In addition to removing federal protections for half of the 118 million wetland acres in the U.S., the ruling set the stage for state legislatures to drastically reshape environmental policy.
Around the same time SCOTUS announced their ruling, Collierville Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan put forth a bill that would limit state oversight on 432,850 wetland acres. That’s more than half of Tennessee’s 787,000 acres of critical wetland ecosystems. The bill targets “isolated” wetlands as identified in the SCOTUS ruling, even though such wetlands are not truly isolated, as they often share groundwater connections with essential waterways and aquifers.
Though he didn’t disclose it in the bill, Vaughan is a real estate developer who stands to benefit from reduced wetland regulation. He’s butted heads before with the state’s wetland regulating agency — the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and he was associated with a development project in 2019 that illegally drained and filled a wetland.

In addition to TDEC voicing concerns about the bill, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) cautioned the bill could lead to an increase in flooding and that the state has suffered its wettest years in history since 2019 with flood events that caused loss of life and billions of dollars in property damage.
Wetlands are essential to Tennessee communities
Wetlands provide a bulwark against droughts and flooding. They replenish aquifers, filter groundwater, and recharge streams, rivers, and lakes. Given their biological makeup, wetlands maintain critical biodiversity and provide essential habitat for organisms that higher orders of life depend on.
Vaughan’s bill received enough pushback in 2024 to send it to a legislative summer study session. But now the bill is back, edited with a few revisions that environmental advocates say don’t pass muster. The amended bill now proposes deregulating wetlands that are less than two acres in size, which would still mean putting most of the state’s wetlands at risk.
All of Tennessee’s wetlands are essential, regardless of their size. According to George Nolan, Director of the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Tennessee office, “An acre of wetlands can hold more than a million gallons of water. The proposed legislation favors the interests of developers over the safety of future flood victims and pocketbooks of Tennessee taxpayers. This is no time to repeal laws that have protected our wetlands for the last 50 years.”
Other opposition groups include the Memphis advocacy organization Protect Our Aquifers and the Maryville-based Tennessee Stormwater Association (TNSA).
“There is little debate in the stormwater community about the value of wetlands as key instruments of maintaining water quality and mitigating flooding,” said Aaron Rogge, TNSA president. “This will be a major change to how the state manages its water resources, and likely one that we’ll look back on as a product of our current political climate.”
Middle Tennessee’s Harpeth Conservancy also voiced opposition by drawing up an analysis of how wetlands benefit communities. Examining just one region, the Harpeth Conservancy outlined 16,000 at-risk wetlands along Middle Tennessee’s Duck River, the state’s longest river and the most biodiverse waterway in North America. The Duck River (which 250,000 Tennesseans depend on for drinking water) relies on nearby wetlands for drought and flood mitigation. If those wetlands were destroyed, the resulting droughts and floods could devastate communities throughout the Duck River watershed.
Republican legislators are willing to risk future prosperity for short-term gain
Under Tennessee’s current regulatory framework, a developer must pay hefty mitigation fees to obtain a permit to destroy wetlands in a projected build site. The fees are then used to restore wetlands in other parts of the state, thus balancing out what is lost by a single construction project.
Duck River, Tennessee waterways could see regulation rollbacks under two proposed bills

Though imperfect, the current model works. Development corporations operate exclusively to maximize profits and return on investment to shareholders — concerns like the health of the environment and the safety of communities are invisible on a corporation’s balance sheet. However, being required to pay hefty mitigation fees does matter, as it reduces incentives for developers to build on wetlands.
If Vaughan’s amended bill passes, it will gut wetland regulations and remove those essential financial disincentives.
Protect wetlands today, elect new leaders tomorrow
Wetlands do something even the greatest engineers could never hope to accomplish with all the tools of mankind at their disposal. They absorb flood waters at a scale that’s difficult to fathom, something all Tennesseans should care about as the state continues to experience year after year of heavy rainfall. Destroying wetlands for development may make some individuals a lot of money in the short term, but the loss of these essential lands will be felt during the rainy seasons to come.
President Theodore Roosevelt once said, “To waste and destroy natural resources is to skin and exhaust the land and undermine the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to our children.” Vaughan and his co-sponsors may care more about short-term profits than long-term prosperity, but Tennesseans of all political stripes should stand in bipartisan opposition to the piecemeal commodification of wetlands that, though some may refer to them as the metaphorical “ugly hog in the barn,” nevertheless provide us with as much value as the most breathtaking Tennessee landscapes.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A balanced state budget, more money for correctional facilities and proposed constitutional amendments form just part of the lengthy agenda awaiting Arkansas lawmakers on Monday for a planned three-day work week. 
“We’ve got a lot of work yet to do, so just be prepared that Monday will be a long day and a long evening,” House Speaker Brian Evans, R-Cabot, told the chamber Thursday. “We’re getting close to wrapping this session up and landing this plane. I’m really proud of the job that you’ve done.”
The 95th General Assembly is scheduled to complete most of its work on Wednesday, then recess for a couple of weeks before returning to formally end the session.
In the Senate, the hope is that committees will finish their work by the time the chamber convenes at 10:30 a.m. Monday, said Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs. He added that the chamber could take a break for committee meetings if needed.

After speaking to the House parliamentarian, Hester said Thursday that amended bills passed off the Senate floor Monday will still have time to make it through the legislative process. Hester also said he was open to batching bills, a process that allows multiple bills to be voted on together.
The Senate could have as many as 100 bills on its calendar Monday, according to Hester, who said Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be slower. 
“We’re going to run right through the finish line,” Hester said.
The House adjourned before 5 p.m. Thursday, leaving dozens of Senate bills on the calendar to be taken up this week. Evans said he made this decision after conferring with House committee chairs.
“We felt like the trade-off for a long day Monday [was] being a little rested over the weekend, and cooler heads prevailing would be better than just trying to force stuff through this evening,” Evans told reporters after adjournment.

The Senate bills slated for House votes include one that environmental advocates feared would endanger a moratorium on large animal farms in the Buffalo River watershed. Senate Bill 290 would have to receive Senate approval again since it was amended in the House.
Evans said the governor’s office has told him she supports SB 290, which was amended several times since its introduction in February after negotiations between stakeholders and elected officials.
“I think each [side] had to give a little bit, but in doing so, they brought a better piece of legislation forward,” he said.

 Joint Budget and constitutional amendments

A critical piece of legislation that has yet to receive House and Senate approval is the Revenue Stabilization Act, or the balanced budget for fiscal year 2026. The proposal is nearly identical to the budget Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders proposed in November, Evans said.
The budget totals $6.49 billion and raises spending by 2.89%. The Joint Budget Committee is expected to approve the legislation, House Bill 2003 and Senate Bill 637, at Monday’s 9 a.m. meeting.
Joint Budget is also set to consider Senate Bill 633, filed last week by Sen. Joshua Bryant, R-Rogers. SB 633 would transfer $250 million from general revenue to a set-aside fund for correctional facilities. The Legislature placed $330 million into the fund in 2023 for expanding prison capacity.
A $750 million appropriation bill to support construction of a 3,000-bed state prison in Franklin County is likely dead after the Senate failed five times to garner enough support for the measure. 

Arkansas lawmakers consider other funding methods as they abandon sixth prison appropriation vote


Additionally, the House and Senate will finalize which proposed constitutional amendments the Legislature will refer to the 2026 statewide ballot. On Thursday, the Senate approved a proposal to affirm that the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution “is a natural, fundamental, and individual right that shall not be infringed.” The measure must receive House committee approval before going to the full House.
The full Senate is expected to vote this week on the House’s proposed amendment, which would affirm that only U.S. citizens can vote in Arkansas. Noncitizen voting is already illegal, and proposed measures to further prevent this failed in the House in March.
The Legislature can refer up to three amendments to voters each election cycle, so lawmakers may also consider a third proposal before the legislative session ends.
 More committee action

Several committees are scheduled to deviate from their typical biweekly meeting schedules in order to finish business this week. For example, the House Education Committee usually meets Tuesdays but will meet at 11 a.m. Monday.
The committee is scheduled to consider Senate Bill 625, which would place some additional restrictions on Education Freedom Account program funding. The state voucher program, one of Sanders’ priorities during her first year in office, allows state funding to be used for qualifying expenses, such as private school tuition and extracurricular activities.

The latter caused controversy last year when a Fayetteville stable encouraged homeschoolers via social media to use their EFA funds for horseback riding lessons. Among other things, SB 625 would prohibit spending more than 25% of allocated funds on extracurriculars. The same limit would be placed on transportation expenses.
Bill sponsor Sen. Breanne Davis, R-Russellville, told the Senate Thursday the goal is to ensure the money goes toward education-related items. Participants in the 2025-2026 academic year, the third year of the EFA program and the first time it will be open to all Arkansas students, will receive up to $6,864 annually.
The Senate Judiciary Committee’s agenda for 10 a.m. Monday includes Rep. Mary Bentley’s House Bill 1916, a proposed amendment to her Protecting Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023. The Perryville Republican seeks to add mental health treatment to the law’s list of gender-affirming healthcare for which doctors who treat transgender minors could face civil liability.
Bentley introduced HB 1916 a day before she withdrew House Bill 1668, which she had previously agreed to amend. That bill would have created civil liability for any adult who aids a minor’s “social transitioning,” but lawmakers, the attorney general’s office and members of the public said the bill infringed on the right to freedom of expression.
Bentley has sponsored several bills related to transgender Arkansans in the past few legislative sessions. She is the House sponsor of Senate Bill 486, which would allow Arkansans to sue for damages if they encounter someone assigned male at birth in a women’s bathroom, changing room, shelter or correctional facility. The House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs is scheduled to meet twice Monday and is expected to take up SB 486.
The State Agencies committee is also set to hear a bill that outlines a petition process to allow voters to decide whether their local water system contains fluoride, while the House Public Health, Labor and Welfare Committee is scheduled to hear a proposed repeal of the statewide mandate for public water system fluoridation.
Arkansas lawmakers consider suggestions to improve underfunded scrap tire recycling program

The former bill is Senate Bill 613, and Evans said he expects it to pass the House if it passes the State Agencies committee, which is scheduled to meet twice Monday.
“It seems to me that there’s a lot of favor in that one because of the efforts that have been put forth by all the stakeholders in that to get some compromised language,” Evans said.
Meanwhile, the Senate’s equivalent public health panel is set to meet Monday at the call of chairwoman Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. One bill on its agenda is House Bill 1982, which would remove a prohibition on used tire retailers imposing fees, in addition to an existing rim removal fee, to cover their costs. The state’s underfunded scrap tire recycling program has been a regular topic of legislative debate for the past few years.
Lawmakers in both chambers have also been considering three bills pertaining to minors’ social media use, which Sanders has expressed support for regulating.

House Bill 1717 would ban technology companies from collecting data from Arkansas minors except under specific circumstances. The House Committee on Aging, Children and Youth, and Legislative Affairs passed the bill in March and will consider an amended version Monday.
Senate Bill 612 would create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if content on those platforms harms their children. The amended bill is likely to receive a House vote Monday and would need to pass the Senate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to reach Sanders’ desk before the session ends. The Judiciary Committee is currently not scheduled to meet again after Monday.
Senate Bill 611 would amend the Social Media Safety Act of 2023, an enjoined law that required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. It would need to follow a similar process as SB 612 to reach Sanders’ desk. The Senate Committee on Insurance and Commerce, which passed SB 611 before it was amended, was not scheduled to meet this week as of Sunday.

“I was elected to keep my seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court, and I am committed to fighting tirelessly to ensure that the will of North Carolina voters is respected,” Riggs told an audience at NC Central University’s law school on Saturday. “The eyes of the country are on the people of this state,” she said. “Because we are people of resilience, we are people of community, we’re going to show the country what it looks like to fight in tough times.”
Riggs was the final speaker at the “In Our Court” conference, sponsored by Common Cause NC, the American Constitution Society, Emancipate NC, Democracy NC, and about a half dozen other groups. 
On Friday, a majority on the state Supreme Court decided that thousands of absentee ballots cast by members of the military and overseas voters should have included their photo IDs. The court said those voters would have 30 days to provide IDs after the state Board of Elections mails notices. People who don’t provide ID would have their votes in the state Supreme Court election thrown out. 
The court majority decided a few hundred votes from people who live overseas and are connected to the state through their parents should be erased from the Supreme Court race total. 
Riggs, the Democratic incumbent, leads Republican challenger Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin by 734 votes. Her lead in last November’s election has been confirmed in two recounts. In an effort to unseat her, Griffin sued the state Board of Elections to have more than 60,000 votes tossed out. Most of the voter challenges were based on Griffin’s claims of incomplete registrations. 
A Supreme Court’s 4-2 majority reduced the votes in jeopardy to those cast by military and overseas absentee voters.  
Riggs immediately asked federal District Judge Richard Myers for a preliminary injunction, basically to freeze action in case. 
Myers on Saturday ordered the elections board to follow the state court’s instructions for notifying voters what they have to do to have their votes count, but not to certify the election until hearing more from the court. 
The board is to tell Myers by Tuesday how many voters could be affected and which counties they’re in. Myers also set a schedule for written arguments.
The exact number of overseas and military voters affected is unclear. In her dissent, Justice Anita Earls wrote that at least 2,000 to 7,000 military and overseas voters could be affected. Those challenged military and overseas votes could be limited to Guilford County or could include overseas votes from a handful of other heavily Democratic counties Griffin added to his protest. 
“They may be military members who have been serving on battlefronts in war zones,” Riggs said Saturday. “They are foreign service officers who are working to make this whole entire world a safer place to live,” she said. 
The state’s military and overseas voting law is modeled after a federal law meant to encourage service people to vote. These voters were told they did not need to include photo ID with their ballots. Most use an electronic portal that does not allow voters to submit a photo. The majority on the Supreme Court said the state Board should have required overseas voters to supply photo ID.

While Riggs has focused her comments on military voters who may be disenfranchised, the challenged group also includes a high proportion of college-aged voters. 
Griffin has included in his challenge overseas voters from Durham, Forsyth, Buncombe, and Guilford — all counties with significant student populations. The challenged overseas voters in these are five times more likely to be Democrats, said Gunther Peck, founder and co-director of the Student Voting Rights Lab at Duke and NC Central universities. The lab’s analysis found that challenged voters in this group are 4.6 times more likely to be between the ages of 18 and 25 than over the age of 65.
More than 260 Duke students living aboard and voted absentee had their votes challenged, Peck said.
Ann Webb, Common Cause NC policy director, said there are still questions the federal court can decide. A big one is whether it’s fair to single out military and overseas voters from a select group of counties.
The “gaping question” of which counties are supposed to be included needs to be resolved, Webb said, and may end up back in state court.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4490-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 06:11:59.796557

(Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.



	During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.


State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

Riggs, a 75-year-old recreational fisherman and retired electrician who lives in Westerly, applied anyway.
“I feel that in order to have your voice heard when it comes to fisheries management, you’re either on the table or on the plate,” Riggs said in an interview. “I prefer to be at the table.”

His seat at the table is now secured; he is one of nine new members the CRMC named to its Fishermen’s Advisory Board (FAB) after a single, unanimous vote on April 8. The advisory panel has been inactive since all of its former members resigned together in August 2023 to protest what they viewed as the CRMC’s kowtowing to offshore wind project developers at the expense of local fishermen. 
Will the same frustrations bubble up? The first test comes this week, as the new panel begins negotiations with SouthCoast Wind, which has applied for a permit to run transmission lines from its wind turbines up the Sakonnet River and out Mount Hope Bay. 
Rich Hittinger, a former FAB member who led the mass resignation effort two years ago, isn’t optimistic. 
“We were asked to review a lot of applications and give input that took a lot of time and effort, but then the council really did not care what our input was,” said Hittinger, who is first vice chair of the Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association.
He had discouraged Riggs from joining the panel. 
“I think nothing has changed structurally at the CRMC, so I told him that most likely, you will spend a lot of time on these projects and your input will not be considered,” Hittinger said.
Marisa Desautel, the attorney hired to represent the fishing advisory panel in prior negotiations with offshore wind developers, felt the same way.
“The process is the same as it was then — there’s no policy in place other than the language written in the [CRMC rulebook],” Desautel said. 
But Desautel said she would be interested in serving as the attorney for the FAB again if she were asked.

The CRMC through its Ocean Special Area Management Plan (SAMP), created in 2011,  requires input from fishing representatives on any large-scale offshore development. The advisory panel is meant to minimize negative impacts to fishing habitats by offering input on project locations, construction schedules, and other details. And, it can request an attempt to negotiate compensation from developers to offset projected losses to commercial and recreational fishermen from their projects.
But federal regulations limit what the state coastal agency, and its advisory bodies, can do about offshore wind. The CRMC can affirm whether or not a federal offshore wind project complies with state regulations, but the real control lies with the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which dictates where projects are built, environmental and economic impacts, and construction and operating plans.
Jeffrey Willis, executive director for the CRMC, acknowledged in an interview that state coastal regulators often had little authority over matters the FAB brought to the council in the past.  
Prior interactions between citizen volunteers and deep-pocketed international companies behind wind projects felt off-balance to Jim Boyd, who served 22 years at CRMC before retiring as its deputy director in 2022. 
“It felt like there was a stacked deck, if you will,” Boyd said.
David v. Goliath
Rhode Island coastal regulators can’t change federal lease and mitigation policies. But they can reduce friction by having FAB members attend fewer meetings for negotiations on offshore wind projects, Willis said. 
“With the old FAB, those guys were super-involved,” Willis said. “They would come every Thursday night for a couple of hours and put their hearts and souls into it, and in the end, they felt they weren’t getting their point across,” Willis said. “We didn’t want to repeat that burnout.”
Willis acknowledged that this won’t fix the difficult-to-calculate financial piece of wind negotiations, which rely on federal fishery landings data that typically does not capture the lived experience of local recreational and commercial fishermen.
“Compensation is one of the hardest discussions to have,” he said.
The new board members are preparing to wade into that difficult discussion on the SouthCoast Wind project, a 147-turbine wind farm planned off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. The CRMC in December 2023 approved the broad strokes of a plan to run the wind farm’s power lines through Rhode Island waters to reach land at Brayton Point in Somerset, Massachusetts. 
Cables would extend up the Sakonnet River and out Mount Hope Bay — much closer to local fishing grounds than the turbines off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard.

The former fishing advisory board members had already resigned by the time of its decision, so there was no attempt to determine compensation to offset fishing losses.
The CRMC is now reviewing a separate permit application related to the SouthCoast underwater cable lines. An initial meeting between the project developers, the CRMC and the new FAB members is planned for this week, though no date had been confirmed yet, Willis said.
“When the Ocean SAMP was adopted 15 years ago, the whole emphasis was on the offshore impacts,” Boyd said. “There was no consideration of inshore fisheries because there was so much unknown. But now, we know that the SouthCoast export cables are going to be coming into our waters. We need to have representation for that.”
In a statement, SouthCoast Wind welcomed the restoration of the FAB.
“SouthCoast looks forward to meeting with the new FAB members in the coming weeks and continuing to move forward with the Rhode Island CRMC permitting process,” Rebecca Ullman, a company spokesperson, said in an email Friday.
Volunteers step up to the plate
Willis originally reached out to two different area fishing groups to see if they were interested in joining FAB. Both declined. A series of emails to industry listservs earlier this year yielded more success — 12 applicants, including one proposed alternate. 
“I was pleasantly surprised,” Willis said. “I was worried about the possibility that, given the history of what happened with the old FAB, we would have a hard time.” 
Unlike fellow recreational fisherman, Riggs sees the benefits to offshore wind development. He claims the underwater foundations and cables for other projects near Block Island have increased his catch.
“It creates a structure for fish to congregate to and feed at,” Riggs said.










I feel that in order to have your voice heard when it comes to fisheries management, you’re either on the table or on the plate. I prefer to be at the table.


– Jim Riggs, 75, a Westerly recreational fisherman and new member of the Rhode Island Fishermen’s Advisory Board


A self-proclaimed conservationist, Riggs hoped his experience on the water, as well as his avid consumption of news about the wind industry, would help protect Rhode Island’s prized ocean ecosystem. Other volunteers who applied to join the advisory panel also expressed their interest in protecting the state coastal environment, according to letters and emails submitted to the CRMC.
The agency’s regulations allow for up to 20 members on the fishing advisory panel, including up to two representatives each for six categories of fishing; up to two representatives of seafood processing facilities; and up to six Massachusetts fishermen who fish in waters subject to Rhode Island coastal regulations.
  The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council voted to confirm 11 members, including one alternate, to the volunteer Fishermen’s Advisory Board (FAB) in a single, unanimous vote on Tuesday, April 8. One withdrew after the vote, leaving nine regular members and one alternate. (Screenshot)
All 12 applicants, including the one alternate, were approved as new members, except for one initial candidate who withdrew his name prior to the confirmation, Laura Dwyer, a CRMC spokesperson said. One of the 11 people confirmed Tuesday, Isaiah Alvarez, subsequently decided not to continue as a board member, he said in a text message Thursday night. Alvarez did not respond to questions about his decision.
Half of the applicants identified as recreational or commercial fishermen, including several with former military experience in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard. Another, Patrick Dowling, managing partner at D’Amico Burchfield LLP in Providence, has a bachelor’s degree in environmental science from the University of Rhode Island and concentrated in environmental law at the Vermont Law School, he said in an email to the council. 
Jennifer Scappatura-Harrington, owner of Quonnie Siren Oyster Company in Charlestown, hopes to offer a voice for the state’s aquaculture industry and women in fishing, she wrote in an email to the council. 
Dowling and Scappatura-Harrington did not return calls for comment.



Who’s on the FAB?
One of the 10 board members who was confirmed on April 8 dropped out, leaving nine.

Wayne Banks, a recreational fisherman, retired electronics engineer for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport, and former member of the Jamestown Harbor Commission

The district superintendent is concerned about the plan’s finer points when it comes to data sharing. (Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Some systems get too complex. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley thinks that has happened with overlapping information technology (IT) and data systems across the city’s government and public schools, which have been under state control since 2019.   
“We should all want the best resources, the best experts, working together,” Smiley said at the Zuccolo Recreation Center on Federal Hill during the April 10 release of “Providence’s Plan for Our Schools: Building a Brighter Future.” 
The report is the city’s first concerted effort to describe how it will resume and maintain control of its schools when the state takeover ends sometime in the next two years. Five of its 63 pages are dedicated to recommendations on how the city thinks IT and data practices should be structured after local control returns.
Smiley wants to align the city and district more closely, and to eliminate redundant software or data collection. “These are opportunities for both efficiency and higher quality services,” he said Thursday.
Among the more ambitious ideas is to broaden the kinds of student data shared between district, city and third-parties to improve city offerings at recreation centers. 
Schools and rec centers “serve the same youth and provide interconnected services, but they frequently use different data collection platforms to track student attendance,” the report notes. “The City will explore where it may merge Recreation Department and PPSD [Providence Public School District] platforms to reduce the number of duplicative systems and improve communication.”
Also on the city’s wish list for local control: A more streamlined model for IT management, with the report stating it wants to investigate which “roles and functions or contracts…may be duplicative” between city and district.
“All of us are vulnerable to cyberattacks. It’s a global trend, as you well know,” Smiley told reporters Thursday. “The city’s IT department will help the school department’s team and vice versa, so we can better protect our students’ data, our employees’ data.”
The mayor’s report notes that “PPSD’s IT department is currently understaffed…[and] no PPSD employee directly oversees the network, and the work has been outsourced to consultants.” An interim IT director has been in place since July 2024, according to a district contract. But the most recent PPSD organizational chart, created after that contract, still shows the top IT position as vacant.
The district also had IT troubles in September 2024, when a ransomware attack on PPSD’s internal systems exposed about 200 gigabytes of district files, including confidential and personal information of staff and students. 
Now the city wants to “enhance long-term sustainability and data security,” according to its new report. “This reliance on external contractors presents risks, including reduced control over internal processes, potential delays in addressing technical issues, and a lack of institutional knowledge of IT systems within PPSD.”

Privacy concerns
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green expressed concern that the city’s plan as-is might violate state law. PPSD Superintendent Javier Montañez is concerned the data sharing aspects may violate federal law, too. 
“The report suggests sharing of student and family data with city structures that would conflict with federal privacy laws,” Montañez wrote in an April 10 letter to the Providence schools community.
The current plan needs “greater specificity, more detailed action steps, and accountable timelines and individuals,” Montañez wrote, and dubbed the report itself an exercise in redundancy, as it “proposes even more City control in day-to-day operations of the District, not less.”
Privacy concerns would fall under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which mandates that schools can’t usually share minor students’ personal information without written consent from parents or guardians. 
The city’s proposal explicitly states that any new data sharing efforts “will comply with relevant federal education data laws,” including FERPA and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA).
A cheat sheet from the U.S. Department of Education notes the four most common exceptions to written consent for students’ personal data. It can be collected in a database if proper safeguards are in place, and researchers and auditors can access student data in certain contexts. 
School officials can access students’ personal information as long as there is “legitimate educational interest” involved, FERPA dictates. And an outside party can be considered a “school official” if it “performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use employees.” PPSD uses similar language in its 2024 template for data sharing contracts.

California is trying
Providence is not the first city or state to attempt integrating select data between municipal and district powers. There’s much guidance on how to construct data sharing agreements. Scale can complicate speed, as has been the case in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom campaigned in 2019 and 2022 for a statewide educational data system that would track students’ progress from preschool through employment. CalMatters reported that as of March 2025, the system is still not ready for public consumption, with one expert citing “an abundance of caution regarding students’ privacy” as a major reason for the delay. 
But Providence operates at a much smaller scale than the Golden State, and the city’s local control report gives one case study of how the district and a third-party entity successfully cooperated to share necessary data. In 2024, the city received $200,000 from the state education department to team up with the Providence After School Alliance and deliver out-of-school programming at two underperforming PPSD middle schools, as part of Gov. Dan McKee’s Learn365 initiative. 
The alliance entered into a data-sharing agreement with the district for information regarding demographics like multilingual learners and free and reduced lunch recipients who participate in the after-school programming. The idea is to “implement a targeted and responsive program that aligns with PPSD’s district-wide priorities…as well as help inform future after-school programming that integrates both academic learning and enrichment,” according to the city report.
It’s also not the first data agreement the alliance and the district have shared. According to a 2012 brief from The Wallace Foundation on “Data-Sharing Strategies That Work,” PPSD and the after school alliance took seven years to forge a different agreement. The brief notes that by making the alliance “a quasi-district entity that’s providing a service…that the district would provide itself but can’t,” the arrangement was able to satisfy FERPA requirements. 
The city and district already use the same public records request software, NextRequest. People seeking information on PPSD send a request through the city’s portal, and the city’s clerical staff satisfy the request.
Smiley and his office have stressed that the report is not final or prescriptive. Spokespeople for both PPSD and the Mayor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

(Getty Images) As a graduate teaching assistant at the University of Kentucky teaching the first-year writing sequence, I facilitate students’ transition to college. I am often the first instructor who knows their names, who sits with them in office hours, and who helps guide them toward the resources necessary for their success. I teach, but I also mentor, triage, and support. I do this at the same time that I am writing my dissertation and advancing my scholarship, and I do this all for $17,000 a year.
For the 2024-2025 fiscal year, the University of Kentucky touted a budget of more than $8 billion. Both President Eli Capilouto and Provost Robert DiPaola have annual salaries exceeding $1 million each. Meanwhile, UK graduate workers — graduate students who teach, do research, and perform essential labor that keeps the University running — make an average of $19,000 a year. 
The MIT living wage calculator estimates that the living wage for a single person with no children living in Lexington is $41,000 a year. Year after year, the University claims that it values and supports its graduate students, but its words do not reflect its actions, and we continue to struggle living on low wages.
On April 9, the University of Kentucky announced new baseline graduate stipends for fiscal year 2026, with baselines increasing across departments by an average of 11%. This is a step in the right direction, but it is still not enough; even the highest baseline still falls below the Lexington living wage. 
Moreover, graduate workers on nine-month contracts (who do not work and are not paid over the summer) will still earn below the baseline. All graduate workers, including those on nine-month contracts, need a living wage. The University of Kentucky cannot function without graduate workers, and teaching assistants (TAs) are essential in providing meaningful education for undergraduates and meeting learning outcomes. It’s time UK pays us what it owes us.
Graduate teaching assistants greatly enhance the undergraduate experience. A student’s first semester can impact the course of their entire education, and as TAs, it is our responsibility to make sure they feel confident, supported, and welcomed at the University of Kentucky. I have written recommendation letters for scholarships, internships, and even graduate school, and my former students continue to update me with their personal and professional successes. Teaching assistants at the University of Kentucky are highly trained, skilled, and qualified, and they change lives every single day.
Moreover, undergraduate students at UK deserve TAs who can provide their very best teaching, and TAs can only do this when we are financially supported. 
When we accept our positions, we sign away our right to seek off-campus employment, despite the fact that our stipends are largely too low to live on. Many TAs, like me, can work on-campus jobs for up to eight hours a week, though we have to jump through dozens of hoops to be able to do so. I cannot do my best teaching when I am worrying about whether or not I will have enough money to feed myself. I cannot do my best teaching the morning after a closing shift, when I am running on little sleep. If the University of Kentucky values our undergraduates, if we want our TAs to be performing at their highest capacity, it must pay us a living wage.
University of Kentucky administrators believe that graduate teaching assistants do not need higher wages because we are only part time trainees. They expect that the tuition waiver, the experience, and the passion we have for teaching is compensation enough. My tuition waiver, my experience, and my passion do not pay my rent. 
TAs work hard creating syllabi, planning and delivering lessons, grading, working with students individually in office hours, and caring for and supporting students in crisis. All the while, we are expected to prepare for our exams, write our dissertations, and apply for jobs. Certainly, TAs receive important training at the University of Kentucky, but we also perform essential labor. 
Without TAs who are supported and financially secure, undergraduate education will suffer. 
Since United Campus Workers (UCW) chartered at UK in 2020, administrators have consistently refused to meet with union members, citing the argument that we are an outside organization. We are not. We are just workers, and these are our demands: $25K baseline stipends for all graduate workers by 2025 without cutting teaching assistant or research assistant lines; an end to discriminatory fees for international students; and a long-term plan to continue adjusting stipends to the cost of living. 
If the University of Kentucky wants to be a leader in the state and in the Southeastern Conference, and if it values undergraduate education, it must pay its graduate workers a living wage.

(NPS/Public domain)As a retired pediatrician, recent recipient of a diploma in climate medicine at the University of Colorado, and board chair of Healthy Air and Water Colorado, I am deeply concerned by recent developments threatening our community’s health.
The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a rollback of its critical endangerment finding, a cornerstone of U.S. climate policy that identifies greenhouse gas emissions as a significant threat to public health and welfare. Despite these challenging times and the daily flood of news from Washington, D.C., this backward action requires our full attention.

This finding is foundational to the essential protections provided by the Clean Air Act. Rolling it back directly undermines the health and safety of every community across the country. Public health is fundamentally nonpartisan — pollution doesn’t differentiate between party affiliation, red and blue states, or rural and urban communities. This policy change threatens every American’s health.
The consequences of weakening these protections are clear: increased toxins in our air and water and heightened pollution in neighborhoods where families live, work, and play. The result is unmistakable: lifelong harm to human health, leading directly to increased rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses, alongside elevated cardiovascular disease risks.
As a pediatrician, I’ve seen firsthand the devastating impacts pollution can have on especially vulnerable children. But there is something we can do about it, especially here in Colorado.
Unlike the troubling federal rollbacks, our state continues to  proactively safeguard public health and our environment. In January, Colorado identified five priority air toxics that require urgent action. This week, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment will release draft rules to manage air toxics and methane emissions specifically from community landfills — a significant source of pollutants.
These local efforts demonstrate a meaningful commitment to protecting public health and maintaining clean air. Yet, they rely heavily on public support and advocacy. Our collective voices matter immensely, and active participation from citizens is critical to maintaining the progress we’ve made and advocating for further positive change. Now is the time for Coloradans to speak up and engage with state lawmakers and regulators to ensure all Coloradans, especially our vulnerable children, are protected from preventable environmental harm.
Public health is not — and should never be — a partisan issue. Colorado must continue to prioritize clean air initiatives and comprehensive pollution control measures, ensuring Colorado remains a national leader in protecting public health.

This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
Developers plan to build Kentucky’s first ‘hyperscale’ data center in Louisville

“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Driving surge in demand for power, data centers eye Kentucky

Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Heavy reliance on coal has eroded a KY economic advantage. Can Trump reverse the trend?

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.
Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

“I believe higher education has been and remains an enormous source of strength for our state and nation,” Hans said. “[But] the public confidence in higher education nationally has fallen, reflecting a broad trend of weakening trust in institutions of all kinds.”
Hans said even with that perception, the system owes it to future generations to fortify North Carolina’s critical engines of knowledge, mobility, and culture.

“In the long history of American public life, periods of ease and harmony are the exception, not the rule. We need universities built for all seasons ready to thrive and play their part in the grand American experiment,” Hans advised.
But being ‘built for all seasons’ did not perhaps envision an administration in Washington determined to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education while threatening to strip federal funding from all universities that refused to comply with its mandates.
In March, Johns Hopkins University announced plans to slash 2,000 jobs as the Trump administration made deep cuts to international aid programs. Columbia University saw $400 million in grants and contracts cancelled due to the university’s alleged “inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Cornell University faces the loss of $1 billion in federal funding. And Raleigh’s News & Observer reports 13 research projects at UNC-Chapel Hill were terminated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Without mentioning the institutions now in the crosshairs, Hans told the Board of Governors that to maintain public trust, it was crucial to stay focused on the core educational mission.
Hans said by following the university system’s strategic plan with a focus on affordability and on-time graduation, the system is seeing improvements in the areas that matter to the state.
“We’ve also taken steps to minimize distractions in this fraught era, again to the focus. Our early adoption of institutional neutrality has allowed campus leaders to focus on their educational roles instead of constantly chasing the news cycle.”
Hans made no mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion, but he did not need to. It’s been almost a year since the UNC Board of Governors voted to repeal the system’s DEI policy.
Legislation that cleared the state Senate last week would further expand restrictions for DEI on North Carolina’s college campuses to include the banning of instruction in “divisive concepts.”
“I’m proud to say the UNC system was ahead of the curve on these critical questions that so many other universities across the country are right now struggling with,” Hans told his colleagues.
Moving forward, Hans said the university system will need to avoid overreaching its mission, lower administrative spending, and find ways to operate more efficiently.
Standing up to ‘strong forces’
Shayna Hill, chair of the UNC System Staff Assembly, used her time before Hans and the governors last Thursday to remind them that there should be space to discuss thorny, complex subjects, even when it can be a messy process.
“Sometimes we get passionate and heated. And sometimes what we advocate for doesn’t make it into the work that we do. But we always come to the table with a desire to make our institutions better,” she said.
But Hill said that ‘strong forces’ right now collectively give the staff pause.
“Some of us are worried about how we will sustain our research. Some of us are worried if students will still have the same options when it comes to financial aid. Some of us are worried about our funding and staffing levels. Some of us are worried about the rising cost of absolutely everything.”

Hill said she was personally distressed by news reports that at least two-thirds of the staff of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, are expected to be laid off.
“I am familiar with the research done to study cancer rates in firefighters as some of this work is done in my own department. This is noble and important research, and I couldn’t help but feeling like we were abandoning these brave folks who worked so hard to keep us safe.”
It felt like a gut punch. She cried briefly at her desk.
Hill reminded the board that UNC staff and faculty fervently believe in their work, even when strong forces seek to disrupt their mission.
“We believe that we can help improve our world through the projects, research and education that takes place in our departments and our institutions. So, when we feel defeated or depressed, we find ways to hold each other up, to elevate each other and to continue to serve the state of North Carolina with love, guts and passion. It is what we are supposed to do.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UNC-CH_Photo_ClaytonHenkel_-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-04-14 06:11:59.796557

(Allan Swart/Getty Images)Seven years of expensive legal wrangling over displaying the Ten Commandments outside of the State Capitol — which opened the door for Satanists to demand their own display of a goat-headed winged creature named Baphomet — should have taught Arkansas legislators the folly of trying to sanction religious messages in a secular republic.
Instead, Arkansas Republicans have launched another pointless adventure in gesture politics by voting to require public schools to post the Ten Commandments — a list that oddly grew from 10 to 12 in an effort to camouflage religious dogma as “historical” text to survive constitutional scrutiny in federal court.
The 10 Commandments bill, sponsored by Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, has been sent to Gov. Sarah Sanders for her signature after passing the House and Senate. It’s the latest example of something that we see far too often at the Capitol: Legislation initiated by political activists from outside of Arkansas — in this case, a father-son duo from Texas — that costs taxpayers money and makes us look ridiculous.
The insurmountable problem in setting out a list of commandments acceptable for public display is that there is no historical or theological agreement about what the 10 Commandments actually are. Most Protestants use a slightly different list than do Catholics and Lutherans, while Jews use yet a third set. Different faiths also number them differently. 
The complexity of the task did not, alas, raise any apparent concerns about its wisdom. Instead, the commandment numbers were just stripped away, and the remaining differences finessed by snatching bits and pieces from all three versions of the Judeo-Christian ethical menu. 
As you can see from the bill’s text, the result is 12 unnumbered commandments, although the first item on the list — “I am the Lord thy God,” a nod to the Jewish version — might be more of a statement of authority than a command.
The list also trims away language used in the biblical passages in Exodus and Deuteronomy on which the commandments are based, including an exhortation not to covet our neighbor’s donkey, although not coveting his cattle still made the cut.
We might be tempted to call this the Razorback Revised Version of the 10 Commandments, except the list follows word-for-word a similar law passed by lawmakers in neighboring Louisiana last year that was quickly blocked by a federal judge.
The version used in Louisiana and in Dotson and Brown’s bill is recognizably Protestant enough to cause problems in federal court. The language is drawn from the post-Reformation King James Version of the Bible, and it includes a prohibition on making “graven images” that Catholics don’t include (which some conservative Protestants cite as evidence of Catholics’ embrace of idolatry.)
The capriciousness of this process was perhaps best summed up on the House floor by one of the only two Republicans who voted against the bill, Rep. Steve Unger, R-Springdale, a former military chaplain: “I’m afraid what this does is it takes something holy and makes it trivial.” 
There is nothing wrong, per se, with promoting ethical precepts. We should all be able to agree that murder, stealing, lying and adultery are destructive and ought to be discouraged, that Mom and Dad should be given their props, and that coveting what other people have is a waste of energy that only leads to discontent (the latter being a central tenet of Buddhism.)
But here, those ethical standards are embedded within an overtly sectarian framework. They flow from the authority of a deity, not merely from the desire to be decent human beings and treat each other with respect.
Arguing that a list that starts out with “I am the Lord Thy God,” prohibits idolatry right off the bat and demands recognition of a Sabbath is not a religious teaching is in a word incredible, as is the idea that passive exposure to the 10 Commandments on a classroom wall will somehow make students better people in the absence of more hands-on ethical instruction. Or get them to stop worshipping Baal.
This particular bill of goods was sold to Arkansas legislators by David and Tim Barton, a father and son team from Texas who lead WallBuilders, a group that promotes the pseudohistory that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and opposes the separation of church and state.
Dotson and Brown let the Bartons explain the rationale for the bill during committee hearings, where they insisted that it was simply a way to revive the 10 Commandments as an historical artifact.
Tim Barton illustrated this claim by noting that the commandments were published in the 17th century New England Primer and in the McGuffy Readers, a textbook popular in the middle of the 19th century: “If there’s something we’ve always done in America, it’s probably fine to keep doing it.”
Of course, there were a lot of things that we did in America until the Supreme Court told us we had to stop, which it did 45 years ago in striking down a Kentucky law mandating display of the 10 Commandments in public schools.
The Bartons are resting their hopes on a different outcome this time around because of a 2022 Supreme Court decision that said school officials could not prevent a high school football coach from leading post-game prayers with his players.
Most Arkansas legislators were assuaged by this argument. But voluntary prayer that takes place in a school setting is a much different animal than mandating that public schools post religious dogma.
Indeed, Rep. Nicole Clowney, D-Fayetteville, warned her colleagues, to no avail, that the Supreme Court has consistently maintained promoting religious messages in schools has a “coercive” impact on students that is constitutionally impermissible — an argument echoed by the judge who struck down Louisiana’s law.
Of course, it’s easy for the Bartons to advocate for moving full steam ahead in defiance of binding Supreme Court precedent because, if Arkansas gets dragged into federal court, they won’t be on the hook for the legal costs. We will. 
Indeed, gesture politics can be a rather expensive hobby, which ought to be a compelling argument for Arkansas legislators to stop indulging in it. But, hey, somebody has to protect our cattle from all that unneighborly coveting.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)As Virginia barrels toward a high-stakes House of Delegates election in November, a dozen Republican incumbents are quietly banding together in what they’re calling the Purple Caucus — an informal alliance of lawmakers fighting for political survival in the increasingly competitive terrain of suburban and swing districts.
It’s a defensive maneuver born out of shifting political dynamics and the lingering effects of the state’s 2021 redistricting, which redrew the legislative map in ways that now expose more Republican-held districts to Democratic threats. 
Adding fuel to the fire is the broader national climate, driven by the economic turbulence under President Donald Trump’s second term that has become a backdrop Democrats are weaponizing on the campaign trail.
In February, Virginia Democrats launched a pointed ad campaign zeroing in on GOP incumbents in vulnerable seats. 
The digital spots sought to link Republicans to tech billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump appointed to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). As a photo of Trump and Musk flashes on the screen, the narrator accuses, “Virginia Republicans are following the leader — cutting taxes for them. Leaving us to foot the bill.”
Even in a tough political year for Democrats, Kamala Harris in November carried 59 of the state’s 100 House districts, according to the Virginia-based State Navigate site. 
Meanwhile, Republicans are holding several seats where Trump either lost outright or failed to clear a majority — and even more where his margin hovered just above 50%. These figures suggest the GOP is defending ground it once considered safe.
By contrast, Democrats are on steadier footing: none of their legislators represent districts that Trump carried, and only a handful are in districts where Harris’ margin of victory was below 55%.
One of the Republicans feeling that pressure is Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County. Her redrawn District 71 — encompassing Williamsburg and parts of James City and New Kent counties — has trended blue in recent cycles. In 2024, Harris edged Trump there by nearly five points, and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican challenger Hung Cao by a similar margin.

Batten has taken the lead in organizing the group of Republicans in competitive districts, saying the idea came about in part because Democrats seemed to single them out in early attacks. 
“We kind of came up with it based on the composition of our districts,” she said, “but after the legislative session, the Democrat caucus did some hit pieces with YouTube ads targeting 12 members of our caucus.”
She described the Purple Caucus as informal — more like a support network than a strategic war room. 
“We don’t have actual caucus meetings where we get together or anything like that,” Batten said. “We chit-chat back and forth, but that’s about it.”
Still, members share tactics and tips. Many are new to office, and Batten said the group provides a venue for swapping campaign insights.
“If any of us find some best practices or have some good ideas that we think would be useful,” she added, “then we try to share those and collaborate with each other.”
In her own race, Batten has worked closely with Richmond-based consultant Brett Feinstein — but noted she’s also looped him in to help other Purple Caucus members. 
“Obviously I’m in a competitive district, and he does some work for me,” she explained. “And anything that I think would be useful to other members in competitive districts, I share that with him, too.”
House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, acknowledged the group’s existence but described it in minimalist terms. 
“It’s an informal gathering of members who may be more vulnerable than others and find themselves in swing districts or suburban districts,” he said. “There’s nothing magical about it — just people who have a common interest in, of course, winning reelection and representing their districts.”
 Swing district pressure mounts

Besides Batten, other Republicans in districts Trump lost include Del. David Owen, R-Henrico (House District 57); Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield (HD75); Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg (HD82); Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake (HD89); Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton (HD86); Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield (HD73); and Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William (HD22).
Several others represent districts Trump won with razor-thin margins, including Del. Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun (HD30), and Del. Chad Green, R-York (HD69). Also on the watchlist are Delegates Paul Milde (HD64), Bobby Orrock (HD66), Anne Ferrell Tata (HD99), Rob Bloxom (HD100), and Tony Wilt (HD34) — all representing areas where Trump carried between 52% and 55%.
Political scientist Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington sees this as part of a larger trend. He said when parties become more ideologically rigid, lawmakers from swing districts can start to feel squeezed. 
“This is a constant problem,” Farnsworth said. “For years, Congress had what they called the Blue Dog Caucus, where more moderate Democrats tried to chart a different course than the party leadership.”
He added that as Virginia politics more closely mimic the hyper-partisan combat of Washington, it makes sense that centrist Republicans are looking for ways to stay afloat. 
“It behooves any political party to make people feel welcome if at all possible,” Farnsworth said. “An open split within the party would not be helpful for the party’s fortunes in November.”
But signs of strain are already surfacing. Batten said her relationship with Gilbert, the caucus leader, is distant — and that she’s felt a lack of support. 
“I don’t really have any communication with Todd, he does not communicate with me,” she said. Though she sees him during every legislative session, she added, “outside of that, I honestly couldn’t begin to tell you the last time we had a one-on-one conversation.”
Batten, pointing to what she described as Gilbert’s growing detachment during the 2024 legislative session, said he “seems very much like he has a foot out of the door.” 
She noted that his disengagement has been especially evident in recent months — a period during which Gilbert also submitted his name for consideration to become the next U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. 
“As the leader, he sort of drives the train when it comes to fundraising and all of that,” Batten added. “And that can be challenging.”
 GOP leadership tensions surface

Gilbert pushed back on the idea that he’s not doing enough for swing-district Republicans. 
“That’s certainly not my perception,” he said. “I think I have always been hyper-aware of the fact that our fortunes lie in these purple swing districts.”

His broader concern, Gilbert said, has been reminding colleagues from deep-red districts that winning back the GOP’s legislative majority hinges on what happens in marginal seats.
“But there are not just purple districts on one side,” he said. “There are people that are also vulnerable in the Democratic offices.”
Gilbert also rejected any notion that he’s disengaged from his role as minority leader, insisting he remains fully committed. 
“I absolutely have not checked out,” he said. “There are certainly people who fancy themselves the leader who don’t have that responsibility and who choose to act out in other ways, and criticizing me is one way of doing that.”
Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, a member of the Purple Caucus, said he has no complaints about Gilbert’s leadership or his engagement with members in competitive districts. 
“Members of the caucus support each other,” he said. “We recognize that everybody comes from a different district and everybody has to run in their community, and that’s been very well supported.”
When he was first elected to the House in 2023, Obenshain narrowly defeated Democrat Lily Franklin with just 50.31% of the vote — despite Trump and the ultimately unsuccessful Cao carrying the district. 
Obenshain is slated for a rematch with Franklin in November. He said the GOP caucus has long understood that lawmakers from different parts of the state can’t all run the same playbook. 
“The concerns in my district are different from the ones in Tidewater or Northern Virginia,” he said. “But we all support each other.”
And while he acknowledged the Purple Caucus exists, Obenshain dismissed the idea that it’s anything out of the ordinary. 
“I don’t think there’s anything really unusual or unique about it,” he said. “When you have things in common with folks in other districts, you kind of talk about that.”
Unlike their Republican counterparts, House Democrats have not formed a similar coalition.
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said the first he heard of the Purple Caucus was when asked about it for this story — and he didn’t mince words. 
“There is a Purple Caucus? They aren’t red and they aren’t blue?” he said, chuckling. “And Delegate Batten is supposed to be moderate now? That’s funny, because she’s not moderate. She’s as extreme as everybody else.”
Scott said Republicans creating new caucuses shows internal disarray. 
“They’re wrong on the issues,” he said, “and they probably need to create another caucus — a common sense caucus — because right now they’re too terrified of Trump to do anything to change course.”
Ken Nunnenkamp, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, offered a more pragmatic view. He said groups like the Purple Caucus are normal in a campaign cycle and don’t indicate disunity. 
“I think the word caucus is always an interesting term, because people start to use a caucus for anything,” he said. “But I don’t think there’s anything strange about legislators grouping to talk about campaign strategies.”
Nunnenkamp emphasized that the most competitive districts — the very ones where many Purple Caucus members are running — were also the most expensive races in 2023, and he expects the same in 2025. 
But with Republicans now unified behind Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears as the party’s gubernatorial nominee, Nunnenkamp said the party has sharpened its focus. 
“Now that we have a nominee for governor, everyone is now rowing in the same direction,” he said, “trying to win back the House of Delegates, and that does involve holding all of our competitive seats and picking up a couple of new seats.”

(Getty image)AARP’s mission is to empower people to choose how we live as we age. Financial security in retirement is essential to that empowerment. That’s why AARP works hard to ensure that people don’t lose their nest eggs to fraud. Unfortunately, fraud is everywhere — be it grandparent scams, government impostor scams, romance scams, investment scams, the list goes on — and one of the fastest-growing ways criminals are stealing money from their victims is by directing them to cryptocurrency ATMs to deposit funds.
These machines, also known as “crypto kiosks” or “virtual currency kiosks,” look like bank ATMs, and can be found in retail locations in convenience stores, supermarkets, gas stations and smoke shops in most neighborhoods. They allow people to conduct legitimate cryptocurrency transactions, but criminals are increasingly using them to carry out fraudulent activity. In fact, since 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports a tenfold increase in funds lost in the United States to scammers using crypto ATMs. Rhode Island State Police report an explosive increase in cryptocurrency fraud. There were three cases reported in 2023; 40 cases in 2024; and already 23 cases in the first three months of 2025 – on track to nearly triple this year. And all of the victims were over 50 years old.
Why are crypto ATMs being used in scams? For one, criminals exploit the fact that most of us are unfamiliar with them and can easily convince us that they are legitimate “federal payment kiosks,” as one victim of a “jury duty” scam was told.  
Second, as there are no daily transaction limits, crypto ATMs can be an incredibly lucrative payment vehicle for criminals. Westerly Police Chief Paul Gingerella, in testimony submitted to the Rhode Island Senate Commerce Committee, reported his department has, as an example, “investigated cases where individuals have deposited and lost $40,000 in just two days and multiple instances of $15,000 or more losses in a single day.”










Rhode Island State Police report an explosive increase in cryptocurrency fraud. There were three cases reported in 2023; 40 cases in 2024; and already 23 cases in the first three months of 2025 – on track to nearly triple this year. And all of the victims were over 50 years old.


Finally, the kiosks quickly move the victim’s cash into tough-to-trace cryptocurrency accounts owned by criminals, vastly increasing the likelihood that the criminals will get away with their crime. Unlike banks, which offer some protection, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies means that if you get scammed, it’s very hard to get your money back. This total lack of consumer protection is a tremendous concern.
AARP Rhode Island has worked with Sen. Victoria Gu, a Westerly Democrat, and Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, to introduce legislation that, if passed, will ensure that these machines are less attractive to criminals looking to steal the life savings of older Rhode Islanders and ensure that victims have recourse. It would require extensive disclosures prior to transactions, implement a daily transaction limit, require a detailed receipt, require licensing and quarterly reporting to the Department of Business Regulation — and implement a refund policy in instances of fraud. 
AARP Rhode Island applauds the House of Representatives for its overwhelming passage of House Bill 5121 on April 10. We now look forward to working with Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and the Senate to pass Senate Bill 16 and urge them to act soon before one more older Rhode Islander loses their hard-earned savings. Rhode Islanders must be protected from the financial devastation wrought by criminals who bleed them dry.

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Two months after a deadline imposed by lawmakers, the Virginia Department of Education published four of its five overdue reports, detailing progress on funding programs, how school divisions perform under quality standards and outcomes for special education students in private day schools. 
Two of the reports published by the department included summaries on teacher salaries compared with other states and how funds are used in several programs to provide students with extra help with their studies and learning to read. The other reports were summaries on how localities are meeting the Standards of Quality, or the set minimum requirements to support school divisions, and on the outcome data for students with disabilities who are enrolled in private schools.
The fifth report, which is still outstanding, is survey results of school-level teaching conditions and the impact such conditions have on teacher retention and student achievement.
The reports, typically requested by lawmakers, help them make legislative and funding decisions.
When the reports reached a two-month delay, on March 2, state lawmakers contacted the agency, specifically Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera and then-Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons, about the delayed reports. 
Within a week, Coons signed four completed reports, between March 6-10. 
The following week, Coons resigned from her position.
Since then, the agency has welcomed Emily Anne Gullickson as the superintendent of public instruction. Gullickson’s appointment will be considered by the General Assembly.
Questions linger after Coons’ sudden resignation from Va. education department

In response to the Mercury’s questions, the Department of Education did not explain why the reports were delayed or how four of them were able to be produced so quickly once lawmakers pushed for their submission. The Department said it “sends assigned reports to the General Assembly immediately upon completion.”
Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, signed the letter directed to Coons and Guidera in March requesting the reports that provide “critical information” that they said will be essential for future discussions. 
The two lawmakers, who chair their respective education committees in the Senate and House, requested a timeline for completion and submission of each report. Instead, the agency published four of the five reports without the two receiving a response as to why the reports took as long as they did to be published.
“The reality is that there’s clearly a lot of internal strife inside of the administration. That’s why there’s been so much turnover at the superintendent level and within the department,” Rasoul said. “I think that there are many good people, both within the administration and in the legislature, who are trying to just focus on improving Virginia schools. However, there are too many folks, including the governor, who have just hyper-politicized every move in education.”
In addition to the overdue reports, Hashmi said the list of delays also includes a delay in the release the results of the state assessments “for parents and students and teachers to take a look at an individual student’s performance” and the teaching guidelines for the history and social science standards to help provide resources for teachers before the fall. 
“They were supposed to be available at least last year, and here we are still waiting for them,” Hashmi said.
She said past reports under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration have also included errors and have had quality issues. 
“I’m hoping that we’ll see some changes now under a new leadership,” she said.

This progress puts Virginia close to becoming the nation’s largest no-kill state, a lifesaving milestone that can be accomplished with continued support from residents across the commonwealth. 
To close the gap and achieve no-kill, Virginians can prioritize three key strategies: adoption, prevention and collaboration.
If 5,726 more households – just 0.2% – had adopted a pet from a shelter instead of purchasing from breeders, pet stores or online retailers last year, we would have reached a statewide 90% save rate. Virginia’s shelters are brimming with wonderful pets of all ages, shapes, sizes and personalities, each waiting for a loving home.

Equally critical to adoption is preventing animals from entering shelters in the first place. Pet guardians should spay and neuter their companions; humanely manage unowned, free-roaming community cat populations; and proactively utilize shelter-provided resources designed to keep pets in loving homes. 
And lastly, the animal welfare community needs to intensify its collaborative efforts, delivering help and support to under-resourced shelters and facilitating pet transfers to alleviate capacity issues when they arise. 
The Richmond SPCA became no-kill in 2002, and we are driven to create and sustain a no-kill community. We help achieve this by providing high-volume spay and neuter services, pet food pantries, crisis boarding, low-cost veterinary care and training while also directly sheltering, rehabilitating, and rehoming 4,000 animals annually. And, over the last 10 years, we have welcomed about 25,000 animals into our care from more than 50 Virginia partners, easing the burden of overcrowding.
No-kill for Virginia is not an aspiration. It’s an imminent reality. We are on the cusp of guaranteeing a future where every healthy and treatable animal in Virginia’s shelters finds a home. We are the solution – every one of us. And together we can accomplish no-kill for the homeless animals in our shelters because they deserve nothing less.

Mohan, a junior at Brecksville–Broadview Heights High School in Cuyahoga County, wants to be a doctor and no longer has any interest in going to medical school in Ohio. 
“DEI and medical education has always been really important to having equitable doctors and equitable healthcare,” she said. “If that’s not the environment that I’m going to be in when I get to medical school, I don’t want to be here at all in Ohio.”
The new law will ban diversity efforts, regulate classroom discussion, prohibit faculty strikes, and regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, among other things. The law applies to public universities and community colleges and is set to take effect in June. 
Mohan is now looking into applying to Northwestern University and schools in Chicago and New York “ because they do have more liberal policies, especially with DEI,” she said. 
Michelle Huang, a junior at Olentangy Liberty High School in Delaware County, still plans on applying to Ohio State, but admits she’s less motivated to attend. She is also thinking about applying to the University of Michigan and schools on the East and West coasts. 
“It is just really daunting to see how much is being done against DEI and being done against systems that are put in place for a reason and that are helping us currently,” Huang said. “It’s just really disheartening to see this happen in Ohio.”
She wants to pursue political science and economics in college and eventually go to law school. Huang was one of the more than 1,500 people who submitted opponent testimony against S.B. 1. 
Claire Witalec, a freshman at Laurel School in Cuyahoga County, is curious to see how the new law will have changed higher education in Ohio by the time she starts applying to colleges in a couple of years. 
“By the time I’m attending college, if views are being stifled in Ohio, I would definitely want to think about out-of-state options, but I think it really depends on how this bill evolves over the next few years,” she said. 
Mayya Sharma, a sophomore at Cuyahoga Falls High School in Summit County, said she is curious to see how universities implement the new law and “how restrictive that might be.”
“Now that this bill is passed, it’s really pushed me to go to colleges and states that have more, kinder DEI policies,” Sharma said. 
John O’Keefe, president of Ohio University’s American Association of University Professors chapter, thinks the new law will give students pause before applying to Ohio universities. 
“This really sends a message to so many potential students that they’re not welcome and this is not a place for them,” he said.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)A measure moving through the Ohio Senate would direct public schools to display historical documents like the Declaration of Independence or the Bill of Rights. It also includes the Ten Commandments, a religious document. The measure is one example in a wave of state legislation attempting to roll back a bright line separating religious displays from public school classrooms.
The proposals take their cue from a bill in Louisiana requiring the display of the Ten Commandments. Five school districts challenged that law. A district court judge blocked it from taking effect, but only in those districts. The case is currently before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Ten Commandments law in Kentucky. But following a 2022 decision in favor of a high school football coach who regularly prayed with players at games, religious organizations sense an opening.
A Stateline report earlier this year found legislation modeled on Louisiana’s bill in 15 states. That list doesn’t include Ohio’s measure.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

What it does
The sponsor, Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, contends the bill will expose students to documents that have “served as the backbone of our legal and moral traditions as a people.” Schools can also set up monuments inscribed with one of the documents on the list.
An amendment, adopted last week, directs classrooms to display at least four of the approved documents for all classes from 4th grade to 12th.
The lineup includes what you’d expect. In addition to the Declaration and the Bill of Rights the Constitution is an option. But several others, while significant, are a bit of a stretch for a grade school classroom. Schools could display the Articles of Confederation or the Northwest Ordinance. They could go back even further to the Mayflower Compact or Magna Carta.
“Simply put,” Johnson argued, “This legislation intends to reintroduce disciplined historic principles — those same principles upon which our Founding Fathers drew inspiration and put to writing — back to the classroom.”
Classes could also display the United States or Ohio motto. Both were established in the 1950s more than a century after the last Founding Father died.
Support and pushback
For all Johnson’s insistence on legal traditions and historic principles, his supporters give the game away. Among those urging lawmakers to pass the bill, there are no historians or legal scholars, no societies dedicated to the founding or to teaching young people.
Instead, there are just three groups, all of them Christian organizations, backing the effort: The Family Research Council, Christian Business Partnership, and Ohio Christian Alliance.
Last week Ohio Christian Alliance President Chris Long testified that the displays offer “a complement” to existing social studies curriculum. “Students remember better when they have visual aids,” he said.
Democrats on the committee asked whether they should leave decisions about displays to the teachers actually leading classes. Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, drew comparison to the Christian Alliance’s longstanding offer to provide state lawmakers with a framed copy of the Ten Commandments.
“Do you think that might be the way to go in this case?” he asked, suggesting school districts should have the same choice.
Sen. Catherine Ingram, D-Cincinnati, zeroed in on a provision setting a July 1, 2026 deadline, but only for displays stemming from donations. Although Republicans on the panel didn’t offer a straight answer, it appears the deadline would apply to all displays. The measure requires districts to determine the overall cost and then accept either donated funds or donated displays to meet the requirements.
The measure received much harsher criticism at an earlier hearing. Gary Daniels, chief lobbyist for the ACLU of Ohio, rejected arguments that the Ten Commandments are one choice among many, or fundamental the country’s founding. The organizations supporting the bill will start lobbying districts if the bill passes, he argued, and commandments about worship, respecting parents or prohibiting adultery have nothing to do with the founding of the United States.
In short, he said, the bill is “a plainly obvious attempt to impose explicit religious beliefs and practices on young, captive audiences in our public schools.”

(Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images) The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

 
During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.

 
Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network advocacy director


Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

 
State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

(Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC) Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

But Ohio House Republicans have nixed it in their version of the state budget passed last week.
Republican state Rep. Brian Stewart, the Ohio House Finance Committee chairman, said the House’s budget proposal passed Wednesday includes a $226 million increase from 2025 public education funding amounts.
Democratic legislators and education researchers say that still leaves public school funding underfunded by billions over the next two years, with more than 300 districts only receiving increases of $50 per student.
Gov. Mike DeWine’s budget proposal funded public education through the Fair School Funding Plan model, but his budget didn’t account for inflation, leaving advocates (and the plan’s co-creator) pressing for money to cover those costs.

The Ohio House went another way, forgoing the funding model that’s been in place for the last two budget cycles and was set to see its third and final phase-in this budget cycle.
The House draft included a provision that Republican leaders said provide property tax relief.
The measure would require the County Budget Commission to lower property tax rates in school districts with cash reserves equalling more than 30% of their operating costs, which critics of the plan say would force districts to dip into their reserves.
Ohio House Republicans increased funding for private school voucher programs.That includes a maximum award for the Autism Scholarship and the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship, and the establishment of an education savings account for private school education.
House Democrats and public school advocates are against the changes.
Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, a co-sponsor of past Fair School Funding Plan legislation, said the proposed House funding model is “based not on what it costs to educate a child, but what the General Assembly decides that it feels like paying for education.”
New Philadelphia City Schools would receive $8.5 million over the next two years based on the House’s budget plan, but the removal of the Fair School Funding Plan model would cost them nearly as much, one of the district’s board members said
“When we can’t count on steady support from the state, eventually we could have to make cuts or ask voters to pass more levies — something no one wants to do,” said Jennifer Schrock, a board member and member of the All in For Ohio Kids Coalition, a public school advocacy group.
Researchers at the think tank Policy Matters Ohio said the budget “underfunds Ohio public schools by $2.75 billion over the biennium” with the removal of the previous funding model.
Policy Matters Executive Director Hannah Halbert said 323 districts in the state would see a mere $50 more per student in the next two years.
“Representatives are heading home on recess having put their names on a bill that gives Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam $600 million and Ohio kids 50 bucks,” Halbert said.
She was referring to $600 million Republicans put in the House budget to underwrite a new football stadium for the Browns’ billionaire owners.
The budget draft would establish a new system for private school voucher dollars.
In an addition not included in the governor’s proposal, the House brought in a new system for “comparing the performance data of state scholarship students enrolled at the chartered nonpublic schools with the data of similar students in nearby schools.”
The Ohio Department of Education and Workforce already tracks enrollment numbers for public and private schools, along with breakdowns based on scholarship recipients. It would be tasked with continuing that work, noting total enrollment at private schools, the number of scholarships students, the type of scholarship and the the amount of state support the school received.
Applicants for the private school voucher scholarships would be required to include the school in which they were previously enrolled before applying for the scholarship.
Also a part of the data collection would be the number of students receiving various voucher scholarships such as EdChoice, EdChoice expansion and Cleveland scholarships, with the information separated by family income “as the data is available,” according to budget documents.
The Ohio Senate is now holding budget hearings and working toward its own draft, which legislators have said may be released next month.

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.
Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

(Screenshot, National Inventory of Dams)Unlike most states, New Hampshire owns a significant portion of dams within its borders — 276 of more than 2,600. Sustainably funding their upkeep poses challenges that lawmakers are still trying to solve.
Current revenues make the rehabilitation schedule for the state-owned dams a century long, according to a study committee report published in the fall, amounting to about $414 million. Some are more urgent than others; for instance, of the 64 state-owned dams classified as “high hazard” — meaning their failure could result in loss of life — 33 are in poor condition, according to the chief engineer at the Department of Environmental Services’ Dam Bureau.
Dam upkeep has been largely funded through capital improvement appropriations, but the department has sought a more sustainable funding model, prompting the study committee and a bill this session that offered a path for more reliable funds. That bill has been retained in committee, however, as lawmakers continue to weigh what that model should be.
“It’s imperative, in my view, that we find a sustainable funding source,” DES Commissioner Robert R. Scott told lawmakers at a committee hearing in February. “I will say, the actual mechanism of how the funding happens, we’re agnostic at this point. We just want to make sure that ultimately we get to a point where we can find a sustainable way to fund these dams and make sure, again, New Hampshire’s economy and people are safe and sustained.”
If a dam is in an unsafe condition, Scott said, “it is possible we will be forced to unilaterally lower the level of that dam to make it safe.” 
He added: “This is not a case where if things aren’t funded, it’s OK. The dam deteriorates whether you fund it or not, stating the obvious, I know.”
There’s likely thousands of properties and road crossings that would be impacted if state-owned dams failed, Corey Clark, the bureau’s chief engineer, told lawmakers. But he also noted that only 27 of the state-owned dams are flood control structures, meaning about 90% aren’t for flood retention. “There would likely be less of a risk to those downstream individuals if that dam wasn’t in place,” Clark said. “Because that dam is there, the water body is created; the threat is created.”
More of the state-owned dams have been classified as “high hazard” over time — roughly doubling over the last 20 years — because of people moving downstream of them. This classification doesn’t actually say anything about the condition of the dam, but rather describes the risk it poses if it were to ever fail. And, Clark told lawmakers, a higher hazard dam must meet higher thresholds for handling storm events and other criteria, meaning they require work to meet those standards after being reclassified. 
Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte recommended the Legislature appropriate $10.81 million in capital improvements for dam repairs and reconstruction in House Bill 25. “The Dam Bureau has seen an increase in capital appropriations over the last several budget cycles due to the ongoing needs at state-owned dams,” Clark said in an email. He told lawmakers the bureau currently relies “solely” on capital funds for major repair projects. 
In 2019, that capital appropriation was over $4.14 million; in 2021, it was $8.1 million; and in 2023, because of a $30 million influx of federal funds, it was $750,000, Clark said. 
“This is not a knock on the General Court, but the level of funding we’ve been receiving puts us on a 100-year cycle to rehabilitate the 276 dams,” Scott said, “and that … was very concerning for me.”
The money being appropriated this year “will be used to address issues at several state-owned dams from preparing designs to performing construction,” Clark said. Still, while “this will certainly help address the backlog of capital needs at state-owned dams,” he said, “it is likely that more funding will be needed in the future to fully address the needs at these dams.” Of the $414 million needed, $300 million is for the 64 state-owned high hazard dams alone, he said.
Another budget bill, House Bill 2, proposes increasing annual registration and permitting fees for dams, paid by public and private owners, and sets up a mechanism so the fees increase automatically each year starting in 2027 in line with changes in consumer prices. These fees go to the bureau’s dam safety program, Clark said, which “is responsible for ensuring that over 2,600 regulated dams in the state are constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with dam safety regulations,” as well as “reviewing and approving all emergency action plans required for significant and high hazard dams and with assisting state and local officials and dam owners during times of flooding or dam related emergencies.”
The program’s work is funded through registration and permitting fees, as well as the general fund. With the fee increases, the program “will be able to continue providing the same services to dam owners and the public without the need for state general fund appropriations,” Clark said. These are the first time the fees, introduced in 1990, have been increased since 2007, he said.
The study committee launched this summer sought to find a sustainable solution to funding repairs. The bipartisan group of lawmakers held five public hearings on the topic of the state-owned dams, and ultimately recommended fees aimed at prime beneficiaries of dams – boaters and those on waterfront properties. 
But the proposal faced an uphill battle in the Legislature. The House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee voted to retain House Bill 629, which aims to implement those recommendations. In online testimony submissions, 26 were opposed and seven in support. A number of those against the bill felt it was unfair to waterfront property owners and could pose substantial financial burdens for some, arguing that others use and benefit from the water bodies.
Sara Holland, a real estate broker and chair of the public policy committee of the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, said funding the maintenance should be a “collective responsibility not solely borne by a subset of property owners.”
“Targeting only waterfront property owners for dam maintenance funding is inequitable as it disregards the broader community that benefits from the dam’s existence,” Holland said, “including recreational users and businesses that gain from tourism and water resources.”
Part of the department’s goal at this juncture, its commissioner said, is to raise awareness.
“I truly believe the average citizen doesn’t really think about the dam that’s holding up the impoundment,” Scott said. “I’m here to tell you … unless you’re using a canoe or a kayak, I guarantee you that water body you’re putting your boat in, for example, is supported by a dam.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-16-at-4.21.22-PM-1024x776.png,,,2025-04-14 05:03:26.461108

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)If you think primary elections don’t matter all that much, I’m living proof that—at least in school board elections in Pennsylvania—you are quite mistaken.
The primary is coming up in May, and many school board races will be won or lost as a result.
Because candidates for board director can cross-file with both major parties in the primary, those who do so are at a significant advantage in the general election, as in November many voters cast their ballots for candidates according to party affiliation. Even though straight-ticket voting is no longer allowed in Pennsylvania, cross-filed candidates are likely to get substantial party-line votes from both Republicans and Democrats, if only because “school board races can be low-information races,” and often newcomers are entirely unknown.
More importantly, because no party may offer more candidates on its slate than there are seats to be filled, each candidate who successfully cross-files effectively reduces the competition in the general election. 
If there are unfilled party slots after the primary, the parties have the right to fill those with candidates of their choice. But during the primary itself, the people speak, and it actually is one of the few chances we all have to make a real political difference in our local communities. Furthermore, write-in candidates have a real uphill battle, especially since stickers are no longer allowed, “because the ballot-scanning machines cannot read them and may become jammed.”
I myself was elected four times in large measure because when I ran, I cross-filed in the primary in May and thus won a slot on the general election ballot the following November representing both parties.  As a practicing Quaker, I’ve never belonged to a political party because of what I perceive as their inherently divisive nature. 
I’ve been willing to accept the nomination of both parties, however, and tried to keep that in mind. I did my best to follow the leadings of my conscience as I attempted to serve in the best interest of all the children and all the constituents in my Adams County district. I expect the same of all elected officials, and schools are where the rubber really hits the road for a lot of us politically.

My experience on my board suggests to me that many school districts are trying hard to put the best interests of their students first and to try to be good stewards of local tax dollars. Taxes and education are volatile subjects, however, and there is no pleasing everybody. Hard choices have to be made, and someone will always be unhappy. School directors also are unpaid volunteers by definition in the commonwealth, and by statute only may be reimbursed for a few legitimate expenses.
Many of my colleagues on our board over the years refused even reimbursement. That’s because the folks on most boards serve in order to do right by the kids and the community. I say that even of the ones I don’t particularly like and with whom I may heartily disagree. Nobody with any sense runs for school board to get rich, and those with an ax to grind seldom last very long: It ends up being a whole lot of squeeze for precious little juice. It’s hard work and a thankless task, and the decisions involved often provoke heated emotions.
Please keep that in mind when you rebuke board directors, even if you feel you must. 
When you are first elected to a school board, it often takes a year or two to really get your head around how things work and how schools are funded and build their budgets. Then, you realize that, considering federal and state mandates, the realities of educational funding in Pennsylvania, the needs of children in your community, and the perspectives of taxpayers, boards often have quite a bit less latitude to act than it seems from the outside. 
Plus, a majority of the nine-person board has to vote in favor of whatever the decision is, and all decisions are —quite rightly — entirely public, except for parts of certain very limited personnel or student issues. The public aspect is crucial, and I am very much in favor of the Sunshine Act. I simply mention it because it is a reality of the position of school director that one becomes something of a local lightning rod. It can get ugly and personal, and not everyone is suited to the position for those reasons.  It’s also very hard to make positive changes, and one generally has to take the long view and work incrementally.

That said, it’s relatively easy to mess things up in a hurry.
There has been quite a lot in the news recently about the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education, and what the impact of the demise of that entity might mean to Pennsylvania students. The Department of Education is an easy target, because many folks chafe at the fact that it provides a lot of regulation but relatively little funding, although the funding it does distribute to less affluent districts is in fact quite significant and vital.
Just because the agency is being downsized, however, doesn’t mean federal education laws will disappear. We still have obligations to children living in poverty and children with special needs that are not going to magically go away, and they carry the weight of the law. One of the stated reasons for getting rid of oversight at the Federal level is to “shift more power over education to the states” and communities. 
School boards thus will have less guidance, but more responsibility.
So this year, your primary ballot means more than ever. Educate yourself, and then vote to support education in Pennsylvania. Examples abound of communities that ignored school board elections only to find themselves saddled with a board that was out of touch with taxpayers.
Your vote counts. Cast it for the candidates of your choice 
Tuesday, May 20, is the primary. Polls are open on election day from 7 in the morning until 8 in the evening. The last day to register to vote is May 5, and the last day to request a mail-in or absentee ballot is May 13.

Court challenges are being raised, but some are planning to return to their hazardous homelands, advocates said.
Since early 2023, about 900,000 came to the United States in the way that many Americans say they want: They followed the rules and they got in line. Then the Trump administration abruptly changed those rules.
Amid heavy numbers of border crossings, the Biden administration in January 2023 launched the CBP One app. It allowed people seeking asylum to register outside the country, wait to be admitted, receive work permits and then wait some more while their asylum claims were heard. 
But the Department of Homeland Security last week notified many CBP One users that they had to leave the country “immediately,” but it didn’t specify how many received such notices. Many have been told they need be gone by April 24.
The administration stopped taking new registrations through the app as soon as Trump took office in January.
The administration is also trying to revoke the temporary protected status of hundreds of thousands of migrants from 17 troubled countries. And on Thursday, the New York Times reported that it was trying to take Social Security numbers away from migrants with legal status. The goal is to get them to “self deport” by denying access to basic services such as bank accounts and credit cards, the paper reported.
The moves are said to be part of a flood-the-zone strategy that has immigrant advocates scrambling.
Fleeing oppression
Christy Staats, an Ohio-based organizer with the National Immigration Forum, estimated that thousands in the Buckeye State are affected by the CBP One revocation in all regions — including Amish country. She said a Nicaraguan family living in a rural part of Ohio called her in a panic.
Staats didn’t name the family or say where they lived for fear of arousing the government’s attention. She said that as of Thursday, the family was planning to go back to Nicaragua.
“They bought a car here,” Staats said. “They spent all this time waiting and not working until they got their work permit. They’re working. They’re paying taxes and all of the sudden their legal status gets ripped out from under them. It’s been really, really unsettling.”
That’s especially true given the reason the family sought asylum in the first place. 
The longstanding socialist government of Nicaragua has become increasingly oppressive in recent years. The U.S. State Department reported that in 2023 it engaged in “arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by prison guards and parapolice; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detentions; serious problems with the independence of the judiciary; political prisoners… “
It added that the Ortega government imposed “serious restrictions on free expression and media freedom, including threats of violence against journalists, unjustified arrests and prosecution of journalists, and censorship; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association…”
That could be a particular problem for the family Staats has been working with.
“They played by the rules,” she said. “They got in line. Nicaragua has been in a very concerning state for quite a few years with their communist dictator restricting more and more freedoms. They had a couple of run-ins related to free speech. The government was watching them. The husband was pulled in by the police. They were very concerned that something more significant would happen. They’ve been jailing journalists like crazy for quite a few years.”
Confusing limbo
Adding to the uncertainty, the Associated Press reported late Thursday that a federal judge in Boston would at least temporarily stop Trump from ending the humanitarian paroles of people from Nicaragua, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela.
Meanwhile, people from other countries who received humanitarian parole through the CBP One app were getting vague and threatening letters from the government. 
Erin Piper of Detroit has been working for years to get the extended family of friends she made through her children out of Afghanistan. On Friday morning, she said some received letters the previous evening that said “Do not attempt to stay in the United States — the federal government will find you.”
If the goal was to frighten them, it succeeded, Piper said.
“My friends are all having difficulty reaching their attorneys (who are likely being flooded with calls) to understand if their asylum cases are enough to keep them here without fear of deportation, but they are all incredibly scared,” Piper said in a text message. “The letter they received has only raised more questions.”
In an interview on Thursday, Piper said that the 21 Afghans she’s helped have known too much fear as it is. 
In 2020, the United States pulled troops out of Afghanistan, leaving the fanatical Taliban in charge. The group is well known for its extreme repression of women and girls, ethnic minorities and anybody who worked with the American armed forces during their 20-year presence in the country.
“Profoundly grateful”
Piper’s kids befriended those of an Afghan family who had immigrated to Michigan before the withdrawal. When Kabul fell, she learned that their extended family was in extreme distress back in Afghanistan.
For two years she worked with a non-governmental organization to get them visas, first to Pakistan, and then to Brazil.
“It was a really huge effort, logistically and financially,” Piper said. “I was supported a lot by my own local church and a Christian organization. I worked with a military veteran who helped us do a very successful fundraiser with a corporate sponsor. It was definitely a herculean effort logistically, financially and in many other ways.”
It was hard to find work in Brazil, so the extended family made its way through the deadly Darien Gap and made the rest of the harrowing trip through Central America and Mexico. Once there, they got in line using the CBP One app.
After getting to Michigan and getting work permits, the adults took unfilled factory jobs, and the kids went to school and learned English. A teenage girl is going to high school — something the Taliban would never allow.
“They’re barely scraping by,” Piper said. “But they’re here and thrilled to be here without the fear of persecution because of their ethnicity or their support for democracy. The women have equal rights here. Some have been able to work and support their families. That’s been really exciting for them. Their lives are far from easy, but they’re profoundly grateful to be here.”
Staats of the National Immigration Forum said there’s something deeply unjust in suddenly telling people who came legally that they have to go back to places they fled.
“A lot of Americans want people to play by the rules,” she said. “I’ve heard 10,000 times, ‘I want people to get in line. They should have to wait for their turn.’ They did. They waited in line until they got their turn. This program was telling asylum seekers not to just come to the border. So they waited — some for a long time. They had a credible-fear interview when they came in at their allocated time.”
“And now their status is being revoked very suddenly,” Staats said. “Anybody who wants an immigration system where we know who people are when they come in should be very concerned.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The increasing political divide is weaving itself into how to best sustain public forests and maximize their contribution to society.
Recent calls to significantly reduce or halt all timber harvesting — as well as others to radically open more acres for harvesting on public lands — frame our choice as either 1) save forests by eliminating human use or 2) embrace extraction that solely serves economic gain. This is a false choice.
Many options lie between these two extremes, including the one the Northern Forest Center believes is best: Public forests in our region can be managed to remain healthy and productive carbon sinks and habitats, while also providing wood we need for our daily lives.
Here in the Northeast, some invoke climate change to justify halting forestry and forest product production. This is a shortsighted and ultimately counterproductive call that undermines holistic environmental sustainability. This flawed, over-simplified strategy fails to consider the strong forest management on public lands in this region, the global impacts of resource consumption, and the environmental consequences of shifting demand to alternative materials and other places.
If not wood, what?
Our current reliance on materials derived from fossil fuels is profoundly impacting the planet. We know the production, transportation, and use of plastics, steel, and concrete contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and resource depletion. And produce lots of trash.
When steel, concrete, heating oil, and plastic came on the scene, they quickly overshadowed the time-tested, wood-based alternatives in our backyard. Compared to other materials, wood stands out for its superior environmental credentials. Unlike fossil-derived materials, wood is renewable and biodegradable. And trees offer invaluable climate benefits including absorbing and storing carbon — benefits that persist in durable products even after wood is harvested. Wood is naturally a part of a more circular ecological system; fossil fuel is not.
Across northern New England, we produce more than 289,000 tons of plastic waste annually. If we replaced just 10% of that packaging with wood-based, molded-fiber packaging, we would reduce that waste by an equivalent of more than 100 Statues of Liberty. And if we shifted just 10% of our construction materials from concrete and steel to wood, we could save approximately 65 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually — comparable to the annual emissions from over 13 million cars.
At present, Americans consume 1,095 pounds of wood per year. The reality is that global demand for wood products is increasing, not decreasing — and this reality presents a need and an opportunity. Recycling and reduced consumption must also be part of the answer, but the reality is there is no way to supply our huge daily demand for wood products without harvesting trees. With models predicting a 37% increase in global wood demand by 2050, New England can be a sustainable and reliable source — from both public and private lands — to meet this need. If we do not continue to use forest products, our consumption of fossil-fuel products will grow exponentially.
Wood from away is not the solution
Suggesting that wood should “come from somewhere else” doesn’t equate to less tree cutting; it simply shifts the burden to other regions, often to places with weaker environmental regulations and worker protections. This is not a solution; it is a transfer of responsibility that yields no positive outcome for the environment and a loss for local economies and landowners. And there is the added environmental and economic impact of transporting the wood here. It’s a lose-lose-lose.
Instead, let’s follow the example of local food by celebrating and relying on local forests, well-managed by people working and living in this region. Forest management here at home can better supply regional wood demands while enhancing ecological and community resilience against climate change, promoting biodiversity, and nurturing cultural connections to the land. A recent study of wood sources and uses in New England, “Beyond the Illusion of Preservation,” provides data to prove this point.
The region is positioned to adapt to a new forest future. Let’s have a more productive conversation about our relationship to forests — both public and private. Public lands play an important role for society and should not be controlled by extreme views on management or use; they are increasingly more critical as we confront our past choices and consider how we reduce overall consumption with diverse and innovative uses of wood that enable us to reduce our reliance on concrete, steel, fuel oil, and plastics while maintaining a resilient forest landscape.
Let’s stop arguing about false choices. Let’s celebrate our public forests, the people who steward them, and the benefits of sustainable forestry. By choosing local wood products, we ensure the vitality of the forest, the people who depend on it, and generations to come.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/forestmanage-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-14 05:03:26.461108

The use of economic tariffs to promote fairer trade and better outcomes for workers, consumers and the environment is not a new or bad idea.
In a world in which some countries rely on slave labor and treat the earth’s air and water like a garbage dump, thoughtfully designed and implemented tariffs can be a useful policy option.
Unfortunately, President Trump has been doing no such thing. Instead, he’s imposing tariffs in a chaotic and likely unlawful way based on little more than his daily whims.
And the outcomes have been disastrous.
North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis is typical of the Republican politicians who could help but lack the guts to do so. He’s co-sponsored a bill rein in Trump, but as he well knows it has no chance. Once again, his mission is to seem rather than to be.
The bottom line: Trump’s half-baked tariffs are wreaking economic havoc for millions of Americans and lining the pockets of his billionaire pals. And so long as politicians like Senator Tillis continue to enable him, the chaos will continue.

Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside.
Pennsylvania State Police Col. Chris Paris identified the 38-year-old as Cody Balmer. Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said Sunday afternoon that his office was preparing to file charges against Balmer of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person.
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded police after entering the residence grounds and setting the fire with “homemade incendiary devices.” He was arrested Sunday afternoon shortly before the scheduled 4:30 p.m. news conference, police said.
“He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,” Bivens said “When I said that he was in the residence, he was inside for less than a minute. It all happened very quickly and he was back out.”

  Governor Josh Shapiro and the Pennsylvania State Police provide an update on the act of arson that took place at the Governor’s Residence.
Shapiro announced on social media early Sunday that he and his family had been awakened around 2 a.m. a member of his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
In a news conference outside the residence Sunday afternoon, Shapiro appeared briefly overcome with emotion as he spoke about the experience and thanked state police, Harrisburg firefighters and other first responders. The smell of fire lingered in the air around the home, which overlooks the Susquehanna River on Front Street in downtown Harrisburg.
“Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we’ve received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” he said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.”
His tone turned to anger as he addressed what he described as a targeted attack on himself and his family.
“We don’t know the person’s specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith. The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said. Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
 ‘Large and complex crime scene’

The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI. Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case. While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone.
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said. Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chainlink fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds.

State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing with searches being conducted throughout the day. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are collecting signatures in the hopes of trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Senate Bill 1 into law on March 28 which bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, set rules around classroom discussion, creates post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things.
“After waiting for another organization or body to take up the lead on a state referendum, it became clear that no one was stepping forward,” the S.B. 1 State Referendum website said. “It was also clear that efforts prior to the passage of S.B. 1 were going largely ignored by the legislators.”

S.B. 1, which affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, is set to take effect at the end of June. In the meantime, a referendum petition can be filed and the legislation would be paused. 
The next step is to get an initial written petition signed by 1,000 registered Ohio voters submitted to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who must verify the number of valid signatures within 10 business days of receiving the petition. After that, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost must certify if he believes the petition summary is a “fair and truthful statement” of the law. 
If those steps get approved, the signature gathering process can begin. The petitioners would need about 248,092 signatures — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures must be from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. 
“A state referendum is our last opportunity to make our legislature know that we do not want to destroy higher education in Ohio,” according to the S.B. 1 referendum website. “We want to retain collective bargaining rights for faculty.”
The last referendum that passed in Ohio was when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law in 2011.

[…]","Photo by WEWS.A provision passed in the Ohio House’s budget that schools say will require them to go back to the voters more frequently to ask for money.
“I think this is the most consequential budget that I’ve been in, and this is now my 17th year in the General Assembly,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said. “It does more things, on more fronts, than any budget that I’ve ever had been involved in.”
Huffman and most of his Republican colleagues cheered the state passing its $60 billion 2-year budget, helping fund the new Browns stadium, but cutting millions of dollars from public libraries and schools.
Parma City Schools Superintendent Charles Smialek continues to break down the impact on public schools.
“We always talked about a slippery slope, and I think that the slope is covered in oil at this point,” Smialek said.
The superintendent has been speaking to me for months about his concerns now that the state is slashing hundreds of millions in expected public school funding, but he said another aspect of the budget bill will cause additional problems for districts.
“Schools are just sitting on a lot more money than they can spend,” Huffman said.
According to the House GOP, schools have carried over $10.5 billion, which should be going back to the residents. The bill would require counties to cut property tax rates, distributing back unspent cash, if school districts save more than 30% of the previous year’s budget.
“We simply looked at this as saying, ‘Here’s lots of money that isn’t being used and that can provide the property tax relief right now,'” the speaker continued.
Those reserves are essential, Smialek said, because they have to prepare for inflation and increasing costs for resources, energy and gas — plus pay raises for teachers and staff.
Parma’s current carryover rate is 26%, but the administrator added that they will need to go over if their levy fails this May.
“If we were at 32%, we had to give that money back — that’s going to make us come back and just ask for it back again from local taxpayers,” he said. “It really becomes almost a tug of war.”
If schools have larger reserves, that means voters don’t need to worry as much about levies.
“For us to have to give back a cash balance because there’s this perception that we’re hoarding cash just belies common sense,” he said.
Some districts worry about what happens when they are saving for larger projects — such as a move or a total renovation — and they need more than 30%. Huffman said that wouldn’t be an issue.
“Right now school districts can take money out of their operating fund and segregate it for those kinds of projects,” the speaker said, noting that there are capital funds.
When moving money around, Smialek said that you can move operating funds to capital, but you can’t move it back. Giving an example, he said that if someone is building a new school, they can anticipate a certain number of increase in enrollment or teachers — but there is never a for sure.
“You want to be able to budget for that, you want to be able to afford that,” he said. “You don’t want to have to wait until that year and go out to your, community and say, ‘Oh my gosh, we knew this was coming, but we weren’t able to carry the cash over, we weren’t able to have the savings, and so now we need more money from you.'”
The Ohio Education Association reports that right now, about 80% of school districts will be impacted due to the 30% cutoff. This will continue a cycle of voters rejecting levies, on top of state spending cuts, Smialek said.
The result? Schools will be forced to cut jobs and classes.
“If we don’t have those funds, you continue to squeeze your labor force, you continue to make cuts that impact kids every day,” Smialek said.
The budget isn’t final, as it heads to the GOP-controlled Senate for review.

Ohio legislators are considering bills that would bar local governments from having a say in permitting projects that capture carbon dioxide emissions and inject them underground. The legislation could even force some landowners to let their property be used for carbon dioxide storage.
The framework proposed in the twin bills being considered by the state House and Senate starkly contrasts with Ohio’s approach to wind and solar farms, most of which can be blocked by counties.
Instead, carbon capture and storage projects would follow a process similar to what’s used for oil and gas drilling, in which property owners must allow development on or below their land if enough neighbors support it.
At least one large energy company, Tenaska, is already talking to Ohio landowners about obtaining rights to drill wells and store carbon dioxide from industrial and energy operations deep underground. An executive with the firm said the legislation would provide ​“clarity” for its planned carbon storage hub serving Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
“This project will provide manufacturers, industrial facilities, and other businesses in this region with a solution to address growing environmental regulations and climate goals,” said Ali Kairys, senior director of project development for Tenaska.
The company is in discussions with various carbon-emitting businesses, including steel refineries, ethanol plants, and power plants. The Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub could also be a potential customer, Kairys said.
In Ohio, Tenaska is eyeing Harrison, Jefferson, and Carroll counties as prime places to store CO2 underground. The three counties are among the state’s top oil and gas producers and have a history of coal mining. Tenaska initially hopes to store captured carbon dioxide in the Knox formation, which ranges from 8,500 feet to 12,000 feet below the Earth’s surface, Kairys said. Second-stage storage would use another formation roughly 5,500 to 8,000 feet underground.
Other carbon sequestration projects could be on the horizon. The Great Plains Institute has identified roughly three dozen industrial facilities across the state as candidates for carbon capture projects. And even though the Trump administration is relaxing the environmental regulations that may motivate such efforts, 45Q tax credits expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act incentivize companies nationwide to develop storage projects.
Ohio’s House Bill 170 and Senate Bill 136 would give the state Department of Natural Resources ​“sole and exclusive authority to regulate carbon sequestration,” a power the agency also has over oil and gas production via existing law. The Ohio Supreme Court has interpreted the oil and gas law’s language to block local government regulation of drilling, even through general zoning rules that apply to other businesses.
If passed, the bills would similarly deprive counties and townships of any say over sequestration, said Bev Reed, an organizer for the Buckeye Environmental Network. ​“It’s … another really tragic thing that the Legislature is forcing on us.”
The bills would also authorize a ​“consolidation” process that operators can undertake to force landowners to allow carbon dioxide storage in their property’s subsurface ​“pore space” if owners of 70% of the remaining area for an injection project have signed on. The process is similar to that for unitization, which lets oil and gas companies drill through dissenting landowners’ properties.
The chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources’ oil and gas management division would be required to grant consolidation if it was ​“reasonably necessary to facilitate the underground storage of carbon dioxide.” A landowner could only object on the grounds that the facility’s design threatens ​“a commercially valuable mineral,” such as oil, gas, or coal.
“You don’t get to object and say this is dangerous, this is ill-conceived or for any other reason,” said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a professor at Cleveland State University College of Law. ​“Reasonably necessary is a very low standard” for forcing property owners to give up the use of their pore space, she added.
Asked to respond to advocacy groups’ complaints that the process is unfair, Tenaska’s Kairys focused instead on landowners’ potential for income.


















“A [carbon capture and storage] project allows landowners to benefit from an untapped revenue stream — leasing pore space deep below the surface. This is a passive income stream that has little to no impact on the surface use of the land,” Kairys said. The bills’ structure for compensating landowners ​“mirrors existing state law for individuals being paid for their mineral rights,” she added.
The bills call for compensation, but it’s subject to adjustments for the developer’s expenses. Companies in oil and gas unitization cases often get to recoup twice their costs before they have to pay landowners more than the law’s minimum 12.5% royalty. Neither HB 170 nor SB 136 requires any minimum payment to landowners. Yet once carbon dioxide is stored underground, landowners presumably couldn’t use or drill through the storage formation.
The bills are currently in the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy Committee. Primary sponsors are all Republicans: Sen. Tim Schaffer, Sen. Brian Chavez, Rep. Bob Peterson, and Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel.
“Make no mistake, carbon capture storage technology is here,” Robb Blasdel testified before the House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday. ​“This General Assembly must act to ensure Ohioans’ rights are protected and their voices are heard.” More hearings are expected in coming weeks.
Critics have dozens of questions, including whether sequestration projects make economic sense and whether they will significantly reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
“It’s very expensive to retrofit [industrial] facilities to be able to capture the carbon — and very energy-intensive,” Reed said. The process may even cumulatively add carbon pollution to the atmosphere, after accounting for the emissions produced when capturing the CO2 and injecting it underground, she noted.
Other questions deal with feared drops in property values, chemicals used in the carbon sequestration process, and the huge amounts of water that carbon capture technologies require.
People also worry about the potential for carbon dioxide to escape from underground storage or related pipelines, said Randi Pokladnik, an environmental scientist and volunteer for Save Ohio Parks.
Tenaska’s project will include a detailed emergency response plan, Kairys said, adding that carbon dioxide is not flammable. ​“At extremely high concentrations, carbon dioxide temporarily displaces oxygen. However, carbon dioxide dissipates very, very quickly.”
Dozens of people were hospitalized in Satartia, Mississippi, in 2020 when a carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured. Another carbon dioxide pipeline leaked last year near Sulphur, Louisiana.
Companies have injected carbon dioxide underground for years to stimulate extra production from oil and gas wells, but it has never been done at the large scale proposed now, Pokladnik said. She worries that gas could migrate upward through fractures in overlying rock layers or other wells, including many old, abandoned oil wells whose locations may be unknown.
“We’re in a world where we don’t have any expertise,” Pokladnik said.

When do you call failure success?
When you have a supermajority of Republicans in the Kansas Legislature.
Whatever else you might have heard about the 2025 session, it was a disastrous bellyflop into a swimming pool full of curdled milk. Lawmakers wrapped up their work on Friday, leaving the state crueler, sicker, poorer and weaker. A bill mugging transgender kids made it into law. So did a bill promising tax cuts but threatening fiscal ruin. Public health officials’ power to fight illness was restricted. Special education students were left out to dry.
It was, as I just wrote, a nauseating catastrophe.
But it’s just what Republicans wanted. Boasting strengthened supermajorities in their respective chambers, House Speaker Dan Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson rode roughshod over Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly during the two-day veto session. Few backbench Republicans dared speak up or challenge leadership.
On the House side, members apparently met in secret nearly every day, giving and taking marching orders. Committees heard precious little actual debate. Bills speeded through and landed on the floor, where they passed with scant discussion. Meanwhile, the whole affair wrapped up in the middle of April, leaving little time for serious consideration or compromise.
You might expect Democrats to raise holy heck about this state of affairs, and some did. But others tried to model reasonableness, while their opponents modeled radicalism.
Since returning to Kansas in the summer of 2016, I’ve endured nine sessions of the Kansas Legislature. Never have I witnessed such a disconnect between what was actually achieved and what members believed they had done. Republican lawmakers gloried in their wins.
Everyone else was left in their dust, fearing what might come next.

Schwab roasts Masterson
You could witness a hint of unrest, however, in Secretary of State Scott Schwab‘s emergent campaign for governor.
The Republican announced early this year, and he could well face Masterson in the Republican primary. He blasted out a press release Friday that should leave the Senate president at least a bit concerned.
“Leadership repeatedly assured voters that cutting property taxes would be one of the first bills out of the chute in 2025,” the release reads. “Kansans would receive a reprieve, and taxes would be kept in check. But when it came time to lead, both the governor and leadership came up short. Instead of giving Kansans a break, they gave them a bill backed by Senate leadership. The result? A paltry $25.88 tax break signed by the governor for someone owning a $150,000 home. Not enough to fill the gas tank or have the lawn mowed, let alone make life more affordable for families or seniors on fixed incomes.”
Let the man cook.
He continued, later in the release: “Kansans expected better. Kansans expected leadership that would address runaway property tax increases, arrest out-of-control valuations, and restore confidence that they can afford the homes they live in — not rent them from the government.”

Final batch of questions
I’ve started asking questions aplenty in my Statehouse scraps columns this year, both for my own amusement and to cover further ground. Here’s what came to mind over veto session.

Have Republicans finally lost their fear of being blamed for a Gov. Sam Brownback-styled fiscal disaster? Or have they just forgotten?
After all the drama surrounding Rep. Ford Carr’s disciplinary hearings, isn’t it interesting how the whole situation seemed to fade away once the panel had to settle on doing something?
Will Statehouse Democrats recalibrate before next session? If they have so little legislative power, what do they have to lose by attacking Republicans with a bit more glee?
Will Kelly call a special session of April revenue estimates come in under expectations? How much with leadership bellyache if she does so?
How on earth could next session be worse than this one? I ask a version of this question every year, and the Legislature seldom disappoints me. Still, how?

Secret secrets
Hawkins never allowed journalists back into the press box on the House floor. Despite our coverage, and despite the many reporters just doing their jobs at the Statehouse, the speaker decided to put his animus toward facts ahead of serving the public.
Over in the Senate, Masterson continued a similar policy unfurled in 2022. More than three years on, he appears to have paid no price for limiting access.
Meanwhile, House Republicans met secretly. Reporters were ejected from caucus meetings on multiple occasions, all for the simple act of trying to inform members of the public about what their representatives were doing.
You might like what the 2025 Kansas Legislature did. You might, as I do, detest it.
At the very least, lawmakers and their leaders should have the courage to do it in the sunlight.
With this column, Statehouse scraps wraps its 2025 run. It will resume when the Kansas Legislature does, in January 2026.

The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.
!function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();
Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director


Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
Trump’s mass deportation plan could rely on state cooperation

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

Jim Pillen and some Nebraska legislative leaders seem poised to make it harder to use SNAP benefits to buy candy and pop. (Stock photo by Johner Images/Getty Images)Gov. Jim Pillen and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services CEO, Dr. Steve Corsi, are on the record that soda pop and candy are sugar highs that over time can lead to serious health-related lows. Good call. 
A letter of intent from the governor to the USDA asserts the state’s want to join a number of other states who ban SNAP recipients from using their benefits for pop and candy. Nice: Now do everybody else. 
That’s because the Pillen/Corsi argument is that pop and candy are unhealthy, especially for children. No one is claiming otherwise, plus the scientists have the receipts to back it up. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that adult obesity continues to rise. Its latest numbers, reported in the fall of 2024, showed that 35% of adults in 23 states had obesity, including Nebraska at 36.6%. A decade earlier no state was above that threshold. 
Childhood obesity
Among children the obesity rate has risen to nearly one in five kids dealing with the consequences of unhealthy weight. According to the CDC, the cost of childhood obesity checks in at $1.3 billion. 
Diabetes among children has reached historic numbers, too. According to research published in the “Journal of Diabetes,” Type 2 diabetes in children aged 10-19 has doubled in the past decade, and Type 1 Diabetes has grown from 20 to 22 children per 100,000.
Although diabetes and obesity are disproportionately higher in low-income communities, no one on the poverty-to-wealth continuum is immune from the persistence of both maladies. Restricting SNAP beneficiaries may address one particular income group, but if pop and sugar are bad for poor kids, they are bad for rich ones, too.
Others have tried
Several attempts at previous nutritional causes and movements have been met with fierce and forceful pushback, accompanied by fevered charges of nanny-state overreach.
In 2012, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed banning sugary drinks over 16 ounces in the Big Apple. Yes, hell did break loose. No, the ban never went into effect. 
The nation’s soft drink industry eventually prevailed in the New York Supreme Court, which ruled the city’s Board of Health, which pushed Bloomberg’s idea, failed to stay in its lane. To wit: New Yorkers, like the rest of us, can still supersize their sweet drinks.
In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama launched “Let’s Move,” a program to offset the march of childhood obesity in America. In addition to encouraging exercise, Obama also worked with Congress to lower the level of fats, calories, salt, sugar and sodium and increase the amount of fruits and veggies students found in the school cafeteria line. You would have thought she slipped state secrets to our adversaries. The pushback was intense and personal from talk radio to the blogosphere, including a Fox News contributor who argued that Obama needed to “drop a few pounds” before trafficking in nutritional advice. 
Sadly, such bilge still passes for argument today.
Eventually, Congress passed a law that allowed schools to opt out of the healthier standards because what’s a good idea — helping kids eat healthier — without a way to get around it. 
Taxpayer funds
Sure, taxpayers foot the food bill for SNAP recipients, but we also pay the federal freight for scores of others who benefit from government largess. What would be the reaction if we required all those with tax breaks or direct subsidies from the feds not to not use said benefits for jelly beans, Dr. Pepper, et al? 
While Nebraska’s letter of intent may be in line with a national focus coming in part from federal health officials, taking cues from Washington may not always be in the state’s best interest, a lesson perhaps learned in the recent “blue dot” vote in the Nebraska Legislature.
Finally, if we’re talking about getting healthy food to children, we should also be discussing the prevalence of food deserts in the state. Food deserts are generally defined as areas where access to “affordable, healthy food options (especially fresh fruits and vegetables) is restricted or nonexistent due to the absence of grocery stores within convenient traveling distance.” 
Instead, residents in these areas often end up buying food designed for a longer shelf life and all too often filled with sugar and other preservatives.
Although often associated with urban areas, food deserts, according to the Center for Rural Affairs, can be found in 11 Nebraska counties: Blaine, Custer, Duel, Dundy, Grant, Hitchcock, Hooker, Jefferson, Keya Paha, Morrill and Sioux.
Yes, let’s talk about nutritious food for kids. But if we want an even healthier Nebraska, don’t stop with SNAP.

Image by Midjourney AIYoung adults across Georgia will soon be passing that major milestone: walking across the stage, taking their diplomas in hand and basking in the applause after their names are read.
Most friends and family members cheering from the stands won’t give the person behind the voice a second thought, but in some Georgia colleges, there may be more to those announcers than meets the ear, and some rising graduates say they’re not happy about it.
At least three universities in the state have reported using services that incorporate artificial intelligence to read the names of students preparing to turn over their tassels, including the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech and Kennesaw State University.
Tassel, the company these universities use, boasts a database with phonetic pronunciation components for over 100,000 names, according to its website. The software is trained on thousands of previously recorded names from voice artists, which Tassel says results in a natural and authentic reading with a lower chance of flubs or mispronunciations.
UGA communications director James Hataway said the university uses Tassel’s services for graduate commencement ceremonies – individual student names are not read at undergraduate commencements – and that it also allows students to create personalized graduation slides for the program.
“UGA has coordinated with this company and its predecessor–Marching Order–since 2020, and it has been a great benefit to the flow of the commencement ceremony,” he said.
Graduates at schools that use Tassel get the opportunity to review the pronunciation of their name before the ceremony, and if the system can’t get it right, they can record the name and send it to the company to ensure it is pronounced correctly.
“We now utilize AI to generate names when possible,” according to a company FAQ. “The synthetic voices are based on real voice artists, who will still be engaged to create new recordings if a graduate’s name is not pronounced to their satisfaction at first.”
Some Georgia students say the thought of an AI generated voice reading out their name on their big day seems wrong.
An online petition at Change.org urging the University of North Georgia not to use the software for its upcoming commencement ceremonies has garnered more than 1,800 signatures.
“Graduation is so much more than just another school event to set up and take down within a week,” the petition reads. “It is a celebration of each student’s success, a reflection of how much they have grown, and the ultimate payoff for their hard work. What UNG plans to do does not represent how a university should handle recognizing their graduating students as they advance to the next chapters of their lives.”
Petition signers echoed those sentiments, and some called it hypocrisy for the university to use AI in this way while taking a hard line against its use by students.
The school made headlines last year after a student was put on probation after a teacher accused her of using AI to write a class paper. The student said she wrote the paper herself and only used software to check her spelling, grammar and punctuation.
UNG communications director Clark Leonard said the school hopes the new technology will make the ceremony more special for students.
“Our focus is never on any one element in isolation — it’s about the full experience and finding thoughtful ways to make this special day even more personal, inclusive, and celebratory for every graduate,” he said. “For example, this technology allows us to synchronize each graduate’s name with video board displays, on-screen captions, and the announcement itself, creating a more consistent, accessible and respectful moment for every student crossing the stage.”
Georgia State University professor Arun Rai, co-founder and director of the university’s Center for Digital Innovation and a member of the Georgia Technology Authority’s AI Advisory Council, said as artificial intelligence technology improves, we should expect to see it integrate more and more into established traditions like graduations.
When it’s used correctly, he said, it can help solve logistical or accessibility challenges like making sure names are pronounced correctly and integrating with on-screen captions or other assistive technologies..
“That said, I understand why students might feel slighted or worry that an AI voice removes the personal connection they’ve looked forward to — especially on a day as emotionally significant as graduation,” he said. “Hearing your name read aloud by another human being who shares your sense of pride can feel more meaningful and communal. It’s not just about the words, but the tone of voice, the excitement, and the sense that a fellow person is celebrating right along with you.”
Rai said universities should seek to strike a balance between tradition and innovation and welcome student feedback .
“I’d reassure students that their university experience—and the relationships they’ve built—shouldn’t be overshadowed by this single use of AI,” he said. “At the same time, it’s completely fair for them to expect a ceremony that feels personal and special. If there’s been a communication gap or if students believe the focus on efficiency is overriding tradition, it’s worth raising those concerns, as they’re doing.”
“Ultimately, commencement should recognize the human stories of resilience, achievement, and growth—an AI tool is only helpful if it respects and enhances that experience,” he added.

For the first time since the post-2020 presidential election, Georgia Republican state lawmakers did not pass a bill during this year’s session that included controversial changes to the way votes are cast or tallied.
When Lt. Gov. Burt Jones sent senators home a little after 9 p.m. on April 4, it not only seemed to catch many senators off guard, but it also briefly left the House in disarray. The abrupt ending likely killed the main election bill’s chances in 2025, raising questions about what new rules could be in place in time for the 2026 election year highlighted by races for governor, U.S. Senate, attorney general and all 236 state legislative races.
The most significant GOP election bill for the session was among the dozens of bills left in limbo. It will still be active when lawmakers return for the second half of the two-year legislative cycle next January.
The House adjourned before legislators were presented with a substitute version of House Bill 397 that cleared the Senate after the addition of several proposals such as expanding State Election Board powers and banning Georgia from participation in a multi-state voter rolls data sharing partnership. Instead, the House passed a resolution on the last day of the 2025 Legislature creating a study committee that will examine election rules later this year.
The 2026 legislative session will begin with the House retaining control over SB 397 and Senate Bill 214, which would give voters the option of filling out ballots with pencils or pens instead of using electronic voting machine touchscreens when they cast votes at polling stations.
The possibility of a switch to hand-marked paper ballots will be a topic later this year after House legislators created a study committee to review Georgia’s Dominion Voting System’s touchscreen system.
The Coalition for Good Governance is warning legislators they shouldn’t take further action to remove QR codes from being used in paper ballot tabulation.
“County election officials are now trapped,” coalition executive director Marilyn Marks said. “They are legally prohibited from using QR codes after July 1, 2026 — but given no money or direction from the state on how to comply — a tab that could be more than $70 million according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Any attempt to install new hardware and software would need to begin in early 2026, and funding and acquisition of equipment would be required this year.”
Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns led the Republican members of the committee to defer any consideration of hand-marked paper ballots until 2029. Burns has said the study committee this fall will begin planning out the transition to human readable text for paper ballots.
The transition has been deferred from QR codes to  human readable text for paper ballots.
The possibility of a switch to hand-marked paper ballots will be a topic later this year after House legislators created a study committee to review Georgia’s Dominion Voting System’s touchscreen system.
Sylvania Republican Sen. Max Burns sponsored SB 214, which would allow voters to request ballots similar to absentee ballots when they visit a polling place during early voting or on an Election Day.
Leading up to Sine Die, the Coalition for Good Governance warned legislators against not taking further action to remove QR codes from being used in paper ballot tabulation.
“County election officials are now trapped,” coalition executive director Marilyn Marks wrote in a newsletter email. “They are legally prohibited from using QR codes after July 1, 2026 — but given no money or direction from the state on how to comply — a tab that could be more than $70 million according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Any attempt to install new hardware and software would need to begin in early 2026, and funding and acquisition of equipment would be required this year.”
Raffensperger has asked for legislators to implement a much less expensive software update instead of removing QR codes from ballots.
The Georgia Republican Party and right-wing election watchdog groups like VoterGa have pushed for state election changes that will give the controversial State Election Board more autonomy over election rulemaking and administrative independence from the secretary of state’s office. Three of the five board members are staunchly  loyal to President Donald Trump.
Democratic lawmakers have objected to HB 397’s provision banning voters from dropping off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day. Critics have also raised concerns about expanded election board rulemaking powers despite the bill proposing to prohibit rulemaking within 60 days of an election.
Another contested section of the bill is over the plan for the state to transition from participating in the Electronic Registration Information Center, an organization that currently provides two dozen states a database to help maintain accurate voter rolls.
“They claim the rolls are littered with the names of people who have moved from the addresses on their registrations and are no longer eligible to vote, but ignore that the evidence they point to is often insufficient under our laws to trigger removal of voters from rolls,” Atlanta Democratic Rep. Saira Draper wrote as the legislative session was down.
There will be a condensed window for next year for legislators passing new election rules that could be implemented in the time for a 2026 election cycle that begins with primaries in May.
Draper has been outspoken about her being dismayed by the recent majority GOP legislature passing election legislation to “assuage election denier concerns.
“We must always push back on narratives based on misinformation and fear-mongering,” she said.
The State Election Board is set to meet Monday to hire a new executive director

Sen. Bernie Sanders brought his “Fight Oligarchy” tour to deep-red Utah on Sunday, delivering a fiery speech that went after President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, other billionaires, corporations, and the top 1%. 
During Sanders’ speech, shouts of “eat the rich” and “tax the rich” were repeatedly tossed out from a crowd that nearly filled the Jon M. Huntsman Center stadium at the University of Utah’s campus in Salt Lake City. Though Utah is a Republican-controlled state, its capital of Salt Lake City is a democratic stronghold — and there, frustrated Utah Democrats turned out in troves. 
Sanders’ team estimated 20,000 attended. The arena has a roughly 15,000-seat capacity, according to the university. An estimated 1,000 more packed the arena floor, and about 4,000 crowded outside the arena, according to Sanders’ team. 
Sanders, alongside another one of the country’s leading progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, urged Utahns and Americans to stand up against what they described as a democracy falling victim to corporate interests and greed — as well as politics that are dividing working-class Americans rather than uniting them. 
“We do not want a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, for the billionaire class,” Sanders said to ear-splitting cheers that at times drowned out his voice. “We want a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%.”

‘Dangerous moment’ of billionaire control
Sanders delivered a similar line to the one that made headlines from his speech one day earlier, in Los Angeles, where he told a crowd of 36,000 — his biggest yet, according to his team — that America is facing a “dangerous” time. He accused Trump of moving the country “rapidly toward an authoritarian form of society,” the L.A. Times reported. 
“We are living in the most dangerous moment in modern history of this country. … We are living in a moment where a handful of billionaires control our government,” he told the Salt Lake City crowd, which responded with booming boos. 
Ocasio-Cortez said “this moment didn’t come out of nowhere.”
“It has been a long time coming,” she said. “The destruction of our rights and democracy is directly tied to the growing and extreme wealth inequality that has been building in America for years.”

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez also urged Utahns and Americans alike to demand change to the nation’s campaign finance laws, which they said have enabled the wealthy to control Washington, D.C. for too long.  
At one point, Sanders, an independent, went after the party he caucuses with, saying “corruption exists” not just with Republicans, but “in the Democratic party as well.”
“For too many years Democrats have not had the courage to take on powerful special interests,” he said. 
While urging Utahns to turn their ire against billionaires and corporations — especially when it comes to pharmaceutical companies and the health care system — Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez both also urged progressives to resist “hate” and work to find common ground with their fellow Americans, rather than fall into political “traps” that divide them. 
“This movement isn’t about partisan labels or purity tests,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But it is about class solidarity.” 
“I do know that 99% is a larger number than 1%,” Sanders said. “If we stand together and not let them divide us up by the color of our skin, or where we were born, or sexual orientation —  if we stand together, we can defeat Trumpism and defeat the authoritarians and the oligarchy.”

What is the ‘Fight Oligarchy’ tour?
Utah was one stop of many on Sanders’ tour out West for his Fight Oligarchy tour, which his website described as an effort to “have real discussions across America on how we move forward to take on the Oligarchs and corporate interests who have so much power and influence in this country.” 
Sanders’ visit to Salt Lake City came the day after he also made a surprise appearance at the star-studded Coachella music festival in California, where he told young Americans “the future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation,” CBS News reported. 
Though Sanders drew a big crowd in Los Angeles, Politico reported his progressive movement is “on its heels,” describing California — the biggest state that Sanders won during his failed presidential bid in 2020 — as “more like the wilderness than the promised land.” The outlet noted that progressive efforts in even deep blue California to enact single-payer health care and other policies have “fizzled,” with prominent Democrats including Gov. Gavin Newsom leaning center. 
“In the nation’s blue bastion of California, the influence of progressivism during the Trump era has waned,” Politico reported. “Progressive priorities are being challenged not just by conservatives, but centrists who cast the left as contributing to problems around homelessness and crime. And Democrats in California now find themselves merely trying to hold onto gains they have made amid major threats to federal funding from President Donald Trump, an escalation of deportations and aggressive rhetoric on crime.”

Beyond Sanders’ win of the 2020 California Democratic presidential primary, Democrats at the time didn’t embrace him for their presidential nominee, going instead with former President Joe Biden, who successfully beat Trump that year. 
Still, Sanders is one of the most prominent progressive faces in American politics today. Over his decades in the political arena, Sanders has gone from a party outsider and democratic socialist to a front-line act in the progressive movement. He is the longest-serving registered independent in the U.S. Congress, but he caucuses with the Democrats. 
He and Ocasio-Cortez, headlined the tour, which embraced populism from a progressive lens. While Trump employed populist rhetoric against Washington D.C. “elites,” Sanders and AOC’s tour took aim at the influence of billionaires and corporations in American politics — in particular Trump and Elon Musk’s foray into controlling federal spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 
The “Fight Oligarchy” tour comes as the Democrats look to find a foothold in a bleak political landscape, fresh off the heels of a blistering loss during the 2024 election that saw Trump recapture the White House as Republicans swept up control of the House and Senate. 
In wake of those losses, the Democratic Party’s popularity has also hit an all-time low, according to an NBC poll last month, with just 27% of registered voters saying they have positive views of the party.

Utah Democrats join rally 
Several prominent Utah Democrats attended Sunday’s rally, including Caroline Gleich, who last year unsuccessfully ran to represent Utah in the U.S. Senate. She lost to Sen. John Curtis, a Republican.
Beaming at the crowd, Gleich said she got “chills” from the turnout. 
“This is Utah rising,” she said. “Utah is about to become the battleground state of the future.” 
Gleich and state Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Salt Lake City, urged Utah progressives to not get discouraged by their state’s Republican-dominated politics. 
Blouin delivered fiery opening remarks, saying that what he’s always liked about Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez is “they know how to stand up to bullies.” 
“Here in Utah, we know a thing or two about bullies,” he said, to loud cheers. He went on to accuse Gov. Spencer Cox of being a “cowardly governor trying to bully us into being nicer,” and he said the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature has a “habit of bullying refugees and immigrants.” 
Other elected Salt Lake City Democrats joined the crowd, including House Minority Leader Angela Romero and Rep. Ashlee Matthews. As Sanders exited the stage, he stopped to greet both of the women, while Romero held Matthews’ baby son, Joey Matthews, in her arms.

Much of Sanders’ and Ocasio-Cortez’s message focused on young Americans. Vasey Payne, 18, a senior at East High School in Salt Lake City, came to the rally, saying she was initially surprised to learn that Sanders would bring his tour to conservative Utah, but she was encouraged by the thousands of like-minded Utahns who showed up. 
Payne said she’s a registered Democrat, though she added that sometimes she doesn’t fully align with the party itself, saying she sees herself as “very far left just because of the way our government has been pushing further right.” 
“I don’t know, in 2025, somehow empathy has become a radical take,” she said. “I just tend to believe that people should be able to do what they want without fear … and be able to afford housing and health care and food. Which for some reason makes me a radical.” 
Not everyone who attended was a Democrat. A Republican, Lea Vanderlin, 33, came from Ogden to the rally dressed in a Lady Liberty costume. She said under Trump, “it feels like liberty is not for all but for some.” 
“So I’m here to resist,” she said. 
Vanderlin said Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez’s message should resonate with all working-class Americans — regardless of whether they’re conservative or liberal. She said she’s a registered Republican, but tries to vote for “moderates.” 
To her, America’s “wealth gap” is a time bomb. If it’s not defused, it could spell disaster. 
“Every major empire has fallen because the middle class has thinned,” she said. “That’s something everybody should be worried about. It’s a road map for trouble.”

As you and your baby are getting ready to leave the hospital after birth, a mini crash course on all things from how to change a diaper to how to feed a baby is taught. But what is not brought up is the very high likelihood that your healthy baby may be hospitalized if exposed to respiratory syncytial virus, better known as RSV.
According to the CDC, RSV is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the U.S. It’s estimated that 58,000-80,000 children younger than five years old are hospitalized each year due to RSV. What’s so scary about RSV is that babies and kids are dying from this virus. Something as simple as a runny nose and cough can turn lethal in hours. Approximately 100-300 deaths occur each year in children younger than five. These statistics are unnerving and only continuing to rise.

Sophia Bochenek
Infants depend on their caregivers to keep them safe. Starting in 2023, The RSV vaccine has been available for infants being born into or during the RSV season. The vaccine has changed the way prevention against RSV has looked in the past two years. So how effective is the vaccine? The vaccine was 90% effective in preventing infants from being hospitalized with RSV. Like any illness, the severity of RSV can range from mild to severe but receiving the vaccine drastically reduces the likelihood of experiencing severe symptoms.
 With cases spreading at rates higher than ever before, RSV is getting more attention in both the media and the medical field. The RSV pathogen is increasing in society, specifically over the past 10-20 years. As social distancing and quarantines have seemed to slow down since the pandemic and more in person interaction has resumed, the spread of germs has run ramped. Simple things like handwashing and covering a cough once again have taken a seat on the back burner.
RSV sets itself apart from the common cold. What makes RSV so dangerous to infants is that RSV specifically affects the way babies breathe, putting their health in jeopardy. Babies have an immature immune system that has little exposure to outside pathogens. The virus can lead to decreased feeding, dehydration, and most severe, ineffective breathing. Infants are considered to be a fragile population as they aren’t able to advocate for themselves and they also are immunocompromised. As the caregiver, it’s crucial to look for early warning signs of illness and get medical care as soon as possible.
Although we can’t control what others chose to do about handwashing and social distancing, we can decide to protect our infants with vaccination. To think that one vaccine can cut the chances of being hospitalized with a virus down by 90% seems like a no-brainer. Having an extra line of defense against the virus gives parents an extra sense of security. 
With so many things to worry about as a parent, don’t let RSV be another item on the list.

Connecticut is at the end of the line for all sources of imported energy, and we do not have coal, oil or gas locally to tap into. Deregulation was thought to have been an improvement to our high prices many years ago but has turned out to be a failure for the paying public.
Deregulation has been good for the aggregators that replaced Enron, charging nine to 11 cents when they buy from gas plants at three cents. Tariffs on Canadian electricity will drive up costs as well. Why couldn’t the state or Eversource contract directly from the plants to purchase power on our behalf, leaving out the middleman? The Connecticut Business and Industry Association has done this at significant savings for some members, and with a much longer fixed-price period.

Chip Beckett
Eversource is judged on local distribution, not controlling the cost of supply, transmission and public benefits. Individually we can affect our supply costs and transmission. Public benefits are deemed important, and whether paid by tax dollars or ratepayers, the costs are unlikely to change as most is fixed-price supply from the Millstone nuclear power plant which saved us a lot in previous years.
Local sources also eliminate or decrease demand charges when the weather is extreme, also allowing for required transmitted power to be less than currently needed. Transmission being lessened or even eliminated saves us money individually and collectively. We still need transmission capabilities to move things around, but minimizing its use saves us money.
We only have two energy sources readily available to Connecticut: sun and wind. We, the public should work to offset our own use as well as the commercial/industrial uses that are locally controlled. I do not think everyone can add their own electricity, but many more homes could, as a positive long-term investment, just like a new roof does. 
While funds are tied up for this investment, solar arrays lock in the price for 20-25 years while electric prices regularly rise with no end in sight. Can everyone afford this? No, but many more could with the proper incentives and regulatory guidance. Homegrown energy at your home or business will minimize your individual burden.
Onshore wind on a small scale may also be effective. I regularly see the windmill in New Haven off the side of the bridge, spinning and making electricity for the plant owner. We have wind on our shore and hilltops. Couldn’t we have a local distribution system capable of accepting and moving around locally produced electricity as a matter of right rather than regulatory review that can be years long? 
It would minimize imported power coming on transmission lines and add to supply. Can Eversource and United Illuminating install distributed batteries so the local grid can accept power peaks and valleys from distributed generation? Solar can be expanded on more roofs, but also parking lots as carports, shading cars from sun, rain and snow as well as producing electricity. 
Connecticut has miles of highway rights of way that other states utilize for panels, like Massachusetts. Can we encourage large buildings of factories and malls to utilize solar panels? Even if they don’t want to do it themselves, could the state and real estate owners rent the space to solar installers on a long term basis? It would save green field development in our farmland, forests and open spaces. 
Could PURA have the limits on home rooftop solar be dropped, so people can put as much as they want, instead of being limited to 102% of their estimated use?
Nuclear power has many advocates, but it would be at least 15 years before anything could come on line, so that will not help us in the short run. We need solutions that help now and the near future.
The final note would be that gas plants are around but can run out in cold snaps — probably best viewed as a transitional source of electricity so the lights don’t go off, Connecticut should build storage to hold gas when the pipelines are not well utilized in the summer, so we have plenty in the winter. It would be far cheaper than counting on LNG shipments to our ports.
Connecticut has solutions to our energy problems. Somewhere and someone will see changes with more solar and wind, new fossil or nuclear plants, pipelines or storage. If we collectively do not want the lights to go out, we will have to accept change in some fashion. We can’t count on other states to fix our issues, not have them save us money. We must act ourselves for our own and collective benefit.

We’ll move quickly to correct the record and provide the best information we have at the time.
State police are investigating a fire at the governor residence in Harrisburg as arson.
Gov. Josh Shapiro said troopers woke him and his family up around 2:00 a.m. Sunday morning to evacuate. Harrisburg city firefighters extinguished the blaze at residence along North Front Street. The governor posted details about the incident on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished. Every day, we stand with the law enforcement and first responders who run towards danger to protect our communities,” Shapiro said. “Last night, they did so for our family – and Lori and I are eternally grateful to them for keeping us safe.”

The fire occurred on the first night of Passover, the eight-day Jewish holiday marking the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Shapiro is Jewish.
State House Republican Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford/Fulton) condemned the alleged arson attack.
“The preliminary details about last night’s arson attack at the Governor’s Residence are beyond disturbing and I condemn this, and every act of political violence, in the strongest terms,” he said. “I am glad to hear Gov. Shapiro and his family are safe and no injuries resulted from what appears to be a heinous act.”
Former GOP Governor Mark Schweiker called the attack, “a despicable act of cowardice.”
“Kathy and I hope all Pennsylvanians will join us in keeping Josh, Lori and their family in their prayers,” Schweiker said in a statement. “We thank the firefighters who bravely responded to the fire, as well as the Pennsylvania State Police and all law enforcement for their ongoing efforts to bring the coward who attacked the People’s House to justice.”
State police, which is leading the investigation, says the blaze caused a significant amount of damage to a portion of the home.

As Gov. Josh Shapiro held a press conference to announce an arrest in the incident, he stood in front of a large reception room that had been set up for a Passover Seder. It was blackened and charred. The wreckage could be seen though busted windows and doors.
It was almost unrecognizable from the night before when the governor, who is Jewish, held a Seder for family and friends to mark the first night of the Passover holiday. A photo of the preparation posted to his Facebook page on Saturday showed a Seder plate on a gold table cloth, an open bottle of wine and copies of the Haggadah, a Jewish text about the Hebrews’ exodus from Egypt brought out every year for the holiday.
Hours after the Seder ended, Shapiro said he and his family were woken up by a member of his security detail banging on his door. The state trooper said they had to evacuate immediately. Someone had broken into the residence, set the reception room ablaze with a homemade incendiary device, and was able to get out before being apprehended. According to State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens, the attack appeared planned and methodical.
Shapiro, his wife and children, their two dogs and another family that was staying with them were all evacuated safely. The fire was extinguished.
So far, no motive has been determined, and it’s unclear if the attack was at all related to the holiday or Shapiro’s Jewish heritage, though a suspect, 38-year-old Cody Balmer, is in custody.
Speaking to the press from a podium on the lawn, Shapiro was visibly emotional. He said the event traumatized his family and the governor’s residence staff.

“If this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday,” Shapiro said. “If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community who joined us for a Passover Seder in that room last night, hear me on this: We celebrated our faith last night proudly, and in a few hours we will celebrate our second Seder of Passover.”
“We’ll clean this up, we’ll get it repaired, we’ll get it rebuilt, we’ll get rid of that smell of fire and smoke, and we’ll be back very soon,” Shapiro added. “We’ll be back to welcome the community into this residence.”

Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside.
Pennsylvania State Police Col. Chris Paris identified the 38-year-old as Cody Balmer. Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said Sunday afternoon that his office was preparing to file charges against Balmer of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person.
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded police after entering the residence grounds and setting the fire with “homemade incendiary devices.” He was arrested Sunday afternoon shortly before the scheduled 4:30 p.m. news conference, police said.
“He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry,” Biven said “When I said that he was in the residence, he was inside for less than a minute. It all happened very quickly and he was back out.”
Shapiro announced on social media early Sunday that he and his family had been awakened around 2 a.m. a member of his security detail and directed to evacuate the residence.
  Governor Josh Shapiro and the Pennsylvania State Police provide an update on the act of arson that took place at the Governor’s Residence.
In a news conference outside the residence Sunday afternoon, Shapiro appeared briefly overcome with emotion as he spoke about the experience and thanked state police, Harrisburg firefighters and other first responders. The smell of fire lingered in the air around the home, which overlooks the Susquehanna River on Front Street in downtown Harrisburg.
“Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers and the messages of support that we’ve received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” he said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light. We appreciate the light that you have shined upon us.”
His tone turned to anger as he addressed what he described as a targeted attack on himself and his family.
“We don’t know the person’s specific motive yet, but we do know a few truths. First, this type of violence is not okay,” Shapiro said. “This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another, it is not okay, and it has to stop.”

“Second, if this individual was trying to deter me from doing my job as your governor, rest assured, I will find a way to work even harder than I was just yesterday for the good people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
He also addressed the possibility that the attack was motivated by his Jewish faith. The fire happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover at the residence and Shapiro was set to host Seder again Sunday night, he said. Tables with gold and white tablecloths set for the meal could be seen through broken windows in the home.
“No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly,” Shapiro said.
 ‘Large and complex crime scene’

The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was instrumental in preventing loss of life, Paris said, noting that the fire is under investigation by a major case team from the state police, Harrisburg police, Capitol police and the FBI. Paris said he has received offers of assistance from federal law enforcement officials including U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Investigators are still working to piece together the sequence of events around the fire, but it is being treated as an arson case. While Balmer is expected to be charged with aggravated arson, attempted murder and terrorism, Paris said he does not anticipate conspiracy charges, which indicates investigators believe he acted alone.
“I feel very confident in telling you that it occurred over an extremely brief period of time, several minutes, and the quick action of those troopers last night immediately shifted to the safety of the governor and his family and his extended family,” Paris said. Shapiro later declined to say which family members were staying at the governor’s residence Saturday night.
Outside the governor’s residence, a section of the perimeter fence had been temporarily repaired with a panel of chainlink fencing. Paris said the breach is where Balmer is suspected to have entered the grounds. 
State police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer evaded state police who detected the breach and were searching for him.
“While they were searching, he attacked the residence – broke in and set the fires. So that was all playing out over a period of several minutes,” Bivens said, adding that Balmer used homemade incendiary devices, but declined to elaborate. A review of security measures at the residence is underway, he said
“We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,” Bivens said.
Bivens said the investigation is ongoing with searches being conducted throughout the day. A decision will be made whether additional federal charges are warranted, Bivens said.

Shapiro and his family. It is being investigated as arson. (Ian Karbal/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Elected officials from across the state have been sending their support to Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family – in the wake of a targeted attack on the governor’s residence.
Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday, a Republican, said on Sunday morning hours before an arrest was made that he’s “relieved that Governor Shapiro and his family are safe after an arsonist set fire to the Governor’s residence overnight.”
“I join all Pennsylvanians in praying for the Shapiro family following this criminal act,” Sunday wrote. “I’m grateful for the first responders who quickly responded. The Office of Attorney General stands ready with any resources needed to find the culprit of this senseless act of violence.”
Former GOP Governor Mark Schweiker called the attack, “a despicable act of cowardice.”
“Kathy and I hope all Pennsylvanians will join us in keeping Josh, Lori and their family in their prayers,” Schweiker said in a statement. “We thank the firefighters who bravely responded to the fire, as well as the Pennsylvania State Police and all law enforcement for their ongoing efforts to bring the coward who attacked the People’s House to justice.”
U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District) said he’s “horrified by the arson” attack that took place. 
“There is absolutely no place for this kind of violence in our state or our country,” Boyle said. “I’m relieved the governor and his family are safe, and I’m grateful to the first responders who acted quickly.”
Pennsylvania House Speaker Joanna McClinton, a Democrat from Philadelphia, said she was “appalled by the dangerous & despicable attack.”
“Cowardly acts of violence meant to stoke fear have no place in our state,” McClinton wrote. “I am grateful to our first responders who responded ensured that the Shapiro family & others were safe.”
Several Republicans, who are weighing a run for governor next year, also offered words of support to Shapiro.
“I’m thankful Governor Shapiro and his family are safe,” state Treasurer Stacy Garrity wrote early on Sunday afternoon. “I want to thank law enforcement and first responders for their swift response.”
U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) issued a lengthy statement saying that “violence has no place in our politics—none.”
“I’m thankful that Governor Shapiro and his family are safe following last night’s terrible incident. No elected official or their loved ones—regardless of party—should ever have their safety threatened for serving the public,” Meuser wrote. “We live in a country where we resolve our differences through debate, elections, and the rule of law—not through fear, intimidation, or violence.”
Meuser went on to describe it as an “attack on the values we all share as Americans,” and added that “it is particularly disgraceful that this occurred on Passover—a sacred time of faith, freedom, and reflection.”
GOP State Sen. Doug Mastriano, who lost to Shapiro in the 2022 race for governor and is reportedly considering another bid for the office, seemingly offered a different response on Sunday afternoon.
“He has a detachment of state police there 24/7 and a ten foot fence with complete surveillance……,” Mastriano wrote on X in response to an article from the New York Post about the incident.
Mastriano has since deleted that post and has not issued a statement on his social media accounts following the press conference announcing that a Harrisburg man has been arrested in connection to the attack.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/governor-josh-shapiro-fire-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-13 19:04:25.225132

State police are investigating a fire at the governor residence in Harrisburg as arson.
Governor Josh Shapiro said troopers woke him and his family up around 2:00 a.m. Sunday morning to evacuate. Harrisburg city firefighters extinguished the blaze at residence along North Front Street. The governor posted details about the incident on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished. Every day, we stand with the law enforcement and first responders who run towards danger to protect our communities,” Shapiro said. “Last night, they did so for our family – and Lori and I are eternally grateful to them for keeping us safe.”
The fire occurred on the first night of Passover, the eight-day Jewish holiday marking the emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. Shapiro is Jewish.
“This morning’s arson attack at the Pennsylvania Governor’s Residence, which threatened the lives of Gov. Shapiro and his family, is a despicable act of cowardice. Kathy and I hope all Pennsylvanians will join us in keeping Josh, Lori and their family in their prayers,” former Governor Marl Schweiker said in a statement. “We thank the firefighters who bravely responded to the fire, as well as the Pennsylvania State Police and all law enforcement for their ongoing efforts to bring the coward who attacked the People’s House to justice.”

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will remove gender dysphoria from disabilities protected under federal law, but it’s still unclear whether 17 Republican state attorneys general will continue a related lawsuit that could dismantle federal protections for all people with disabilities.
Last fall, Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the federal government over the Biden administration’s addition of a gender identity-related disorder to the disabilities protected under a portion of federal law known as Section 504.
Republican attorneys general from 16 other states joined the lawsuit: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.
But they  faced a swift backlash earlier this year. Disability advocates pointed to parts of their lawsuit that asked the court to find all of Section 504 unconstitutional, not just the update that included gender dysphoria.
If the court agrees, advocates fear that schools, workplaces, hospitals and other entities could refuse to provide disability accommodations they’ve been required to provide for the past 50 years.
AGs hurried to distance themselves. Arkansas Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin, Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and others adamantly denied that interpretation and said their only goal was to remove protections for people with gender dysphoria.
The new HHS ruling seems to achieve what the AGs said they wanted. It essentially declares that the Biden update adding gender dysphoria to disability law can’t be enforced.
But the broad language of the lawsuit leaves open the possibility, some experts say, for the court to strike down the entirety of Section 504 protections.
The state AGs’ position should become clearer in a few days. They’re scheduled to file an update with the court on April 21.

Cowan and his colleagues at the nonprofit Habitat Media wondered where all of this plastic was coming from—and why so much of it is manufactured in the United States. With “Single-Use Planet,” their new documentary premiering on PBS in April, they hope to answer those questions.
The documentary tells the stories of two states with a major stake in the plastics economy: Louisiana and Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania segment focuses on Beaver County’s Shell ethane cracker plant, a massive facility for manufacturing plastics that began operations in the fall of 2022.
Since then, residents living nearby have complained about noise, odors and light pollution, and local activists are concerned that Shell is exacerbating the region’s existing plastic pollution problems.

In a previous statement to Inside Climate News, a Shell spokesperson said the company was “committed to the health and well-being of its employees and the surrounding community,” and said the company was working to improve so that it “can be the good environmental steward, neighbor, and business partner this region wants and deserves.” Though Shell was lured to Pennsylvania with more than $1.6 billion in tax subsidies, new research shows that the promised economic boom has failed to materialize.
“There are stories of explorers trying to find the headwaters of the Amazon River, and it takes them to the Andes, to these tributaries way up in the steep slopes of those mountains,” Cowan said. “I liken that to what we’ve done with this story. We took it all the way to the headwaters of plastic to answer, where does this stuff come from?”
Inside Climate News spoke with Cowan about the origins of the project and what he and his team learned about the Shell plant. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
ICC: How did you decide to focus on Pennsylvania and Louisiana for this film?
Steve Cowan: Trying to figure out where all this plastic was coming from, our first stop was the petrochemical facilities, these giant ethane crackers that produce plastic from natural gas and fossil fuels. We talked to people that live nearby in these communities, and a lot of the people aren’t too happy with it.


In Louisiana, the [companies] site these facilities in areas with marginalized communities, where they don’t expect there’s going to be a lot of complaints and pushback. That was our Louisiana story, and then we went further upstream, because the Mississippi River eventually becomes the Ohio River through Appalachia. We checked out the … Shell ethane cracker plant in Beaver County, and we talked with community members there, many of whom wish that that plant never arrived.
To feed the plant, they need ethane. It’s an ethane cracker, and that’s natural gas. There’s a lot of fracking that goes on in Pennsylvania and Ohio and West Virginia, and some people aren’t so happy with that either.


ICC: I think a lot of people don’t realize that plastics manufacturing is fed by fracking wells.
Cowan: We made that connection, and we asked this community, well, how did Shell end up here? If half the people are horrified by it, how did it happen? And they all said, “It was a $1.6 billion subsidy provided by our legislators in our state capital in Harrisburg. They’re the ones that invited … Shell. They’re the ones that championed and enabled the whole thing.” So we went further upstream to Harrisburg and met some of these lawmakers.
In Harrisburg, talking with these legislators, the biggest part of their funding is coming from fossil fuel, natural gas and petrochemical companies, and so they need that money. We tried in the film not to villainize these lawmakers, in part because it takes so much money to get elected, and average citizens don’t have the kind of cash they need to buy all the TV ads and everything they have to do to win a seat in the House or the Senate or the governor’s mansion.
So they have their go-to sources [of funding]. They don’t even have to go ask for it. The lobbyists are coming in and offering it, and it’s just this low-hanging fruit. Whether it be a subsidy bill or whether it be some kind of law to ease regulations and oversight of the industries, the lobbyists draft the legislation, they take it to the lawmakers and the lawmakers make policy out of them. These are the true headwaters of plastic.
We did meet some lawmakers in Harrisburg that are in the film, like Sen. Katie Muth or Chris Rabb from Philadelphia in the House, and they’re actually more in touch with the realities that a lot of their constituents have to face. They’re in the minority, though. That’s the problem. They vote against this, or they try to get some legislation going to bring in renewables, and they can’t even get the bills out on the floor. They’re powerless because they’re in the minority.
And the reason they stay in the minority is because this river of money is going to legislators who sign on with fossil fuels and plastic. It’s a worrisome thing, and I don’t see how, especially since the last election, it’s going to end any time soon.
ICC: What do you hope viewers will take away from “Single-Use Planet”?
Cowan: Change isn’t going to come from the top down. These people that have figured out how to stay in power, they’re not going to sponsor legislation to lessen the impact of industry or to change our electoral system. Change has to come from the bottom up.
And that’s actually how it happened in France–they have general strikes. They shut the whole economy down. And it’s forced a lot of reforms in France, and I don’t know if that’s what’s coming to the U.S. or not, but I hope that people realize that they need to get more involved. People need to engage these issues, rather than just going about their daily lives and hoping somehow that their elected representatives in Harrisburg or Baton Rouge or Washington, D.C., are going to do anything about this. They’re not.

Nearly three years after dousing the flames at the state’s largest waste incinerator, officials are still searching for way to deal with the mess created by the thousands of tons of trash local residents produce each day.
For the most part, the trash that was once burned to create electricity and ash at the Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority in Hartford is now being placed onto tractor-trailers and rail cars and shipped hundreds of miles away to landfills in Pennsylvania and Ohio — a costly and ecologically-damaging solution that has many critics and few fans.
And while state officials have reported some progress getting people to divert things like food scraps and plastic bottles out of the waste stream, the scale of Connecticut’s trash problem has only grown.
MIRA’s closure in 2022 resulted in 640,000 tons of trash being sent out of state that year. By the next year, Connecticut was exporting 41% of all its municipal solid waste, roughly 940,000 tons of trash, according to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
Connecticut isn’t the only state exporting its trash. With limited space in Midwestern landfills, the state’s municipalities and haulers are facing rising rates to ship trash beyond its borders. Those costs get passed along to Connecticut residents through taxes and collection fees, according to DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes.
“It is escalating and it’s going to escalate over time,” Dykes said. “The crisis is in the sense that we need to take urgent action, because developing new programs, new solutions to regain self sufficiency and replace that disposal capacity that the MIRA plan represented, takes time.”
 Finding — and funding — a plan

The trash problem has also befuddled state lawmakers, who have been largely unsuccessful in their efforts to pass a long-term solution.
Two years ago, municipal leaders objected to a proposal by Gov. Ned Lamont that would have charged cities and towns up to $5 for every ton of trash they ship out of state, in order to raise money to help build new facilities capable of handling trash within the state. Instead, lawmakers settled on a plan to authorize up to $500 million in bonding, through the Connecticut Green Bank, should the state ever settle on a plan to build a new waste-to-energy facility. That money remains unspent.
The latest attempt to address the issue this year, House Bill 6917, takes a more modest approach.
The legislation would charge a fee of $1.50 on every ton of waste shipped out of state. Currently, that fee is only being applied to waste that is burned at the state’s four remaining waste-to-energy facilities. In addition, it removes language within state law that diverts up to $2.8 million collected each year from those existing fees into the state’s general fund. Instead, all of that money would go to a sustainable materials management account where it is earmarked for local waste-reduction projects.
“What we’re trying to do in this bill is actually to get parity between waste that’s processed in and out of state, so that we get a bit more money into that program,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who is leading the legislature’s efforts on waste this session as co-chair of the Environment Committee.
The bill would also require that large producers of food waste — including supermarkets, wholesalers, food manufacturers and conference centers — adopt their own written policy for the donation of excess food, further reducing what they throw away.
Critics of the legislation, however, argue that adding fees wouldn’t serve as an incentive to handle trash in-state if there’s nowhere to put it. Beyond Connecticut’s existing waste-to-energy facilities, recycling centers and a handful of composting options, the state has no permanent, active landfills accepting household trash.
“You’re trying to collect money. Let’s have a plan first, and then we can talk about about funding that plan,” said Brian O’Connor, the director of public policy for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. “There’s no long-term strategy from [DEEP] at this point.”
In written testimony filed on an early version of the bill, Lewis Dubuque of the National Waste and Recycling Association questioned whether the fee would be applied to other materials beyond municipal solid waste that are disposed of at incinerators or shipped out of state.
“In any event, such a fee will naturally be passed on to the customer and, given the claims that the disposal of material is becoming more expensive in challenging fiscal times, the NWRA questions why the imposition of a new fee on the consumer is warranted,” Dubuque said. Dubuque did not respond to multiple requests for additional comment.
For environmental advocates, the bill represents an initial step toward reducing the amount of trash being shipped across state lines to slowly decompose in a landfill, which many see as the worst possible solution.
“If you think about diesel trucks and how much greenhouse gas emissions they’re emitting every single day driving from central Connecticut to Ohio and Pennsylvania, that is a significant amount of carbon dioxide, and it’s not moving us towards our our climate change goals that we set for ourselves,” said Julianna Larue, an organizer with the Sierra Club. “We’re going backwards, right?”
In addition to the climate considerations, residents who live in the vicinity of those landfills have said they’re fed up dealing with the smell. In some cases they’ve even pushed to close the facilities.
Lawmakers are also weighing other proposals this session intended to reduce the amount of waste produced in Connecticut and the associated environmental impacts.
House Bill 6229 would ban single-use plastics and polystyrene containers, which critics argue clog up the waste stream, starting in 2026. Past efforts to ban or phase out those plastics have failed in the face of opposition from the restaurant and hospitality industry. Another, Senate Bill 80, seeks to place tougher standards on the burning of medical waste following complaints from residents living close to a waste-to-energy facility in Bristol.
All three bills have passed out of the Environment Committee and are either awaiting fiscal review or have been referred to the Appropriations Committee.
Parker said he expects H.B. 6917 to generate between $1 million and $3 million a year for waste diversion efforts. That’s far less than what Lamont’s original 2023 legislation would have raised — an estimated $11 million.
“The truth is that some of these projects, you know, cost a lot of money,” Parker said. “We’re going to be reasonable about what’s going to be funded here. It’s not going to be the be-all, end-all to the solution.”

Pilot programs
Barring a plan to build any major new waste-processing facilities in Connecticut, efforts to confront the trash problem have mostly focused on getting specific items such as food scraps and plastic out of the waste stream.
To that end, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection last month awarded $15 million in grants to nine municipalities to fund infrastructure projects related to recycling and composting.
In New Haven, for example, the city plans to build a new $3.3 million sorting facility at the transfer station, within the footprint of the old incinerator.
Starting in 2027, officials will distribute colored, biodegradable trash bags to residents on local garbage routes, instructing those residents to fill the bags with compostable materials like leftover scraps of food or coffee grounds. The bags will be picked up from curbside bins along with other garbage on trash day, then taken to the local sorting station. Once sorted, the organic waste will be sent off to a digester facility to be turned into biogas, and, eventually, compost.
The goal, officials say, is to divert roughly one-fifth of the city’s residential trash — the heavy, soggy and dense food scraps — away from Connecticut’s overloaded municipal waste stream.
“Most of the trash here … goes to Bridgeport and is burned,” Mayor Justin Elicker said during a press conference announcing the project earlier this month. “That is clearly not the best solution for compostable materials that could be used for such better purposes.”
If it is successful, New Haven’s program will follow on the heels of larger cities such as New York which began a mandatory composting program on April 1.

In an attempt to encourage towns to find innovative ways to reduce their solid waste stream, lawmakers created the sustainable materials management account in 2022. Since then, the program has awarded about $5.2 million in funding for local pilot programs focused on organics diversion and pricing models that charge residents based on the amount of trash they throw away.
Some of those pilots have already concluded with DEEP officials reporting promising results. Between 2021 and 2023, Connecticut saw a 368% increase in food scrap diversion, with 37,549 tons of waste sent for composting in the latter year.
Several towns including Middletown, Woodbury, Madison, Kent and others have also opted to continue their program beyond the pilot period, according to DEEP.
Speaking to reporters in New Haven last month, Dykes said lessons from those pilots informed state officials as they were reviewing applications for the most recent round of infrastructure grants — which included the New Haven sorting facility, a food-waste collection program in Manchester and a commercial-scale composting facility in southeastern Connecticut. In addition to the nine projects that were selected for funding, Dykes said a dozen other applications were submitted.
“It just goes to show how many communities and municipalities are really leaning into finding these solutions and want to implement common-sense solutions to recycle and divert organics,” Dykes said. “And so we’re hopeful that this will just be the beginning of more funding rounds.”
Still, some officials overseeing the handling of municipal waste say that local grant-funded programs do not go far enough to address the full scale of the state’s waste issues.
Jennifer Heaton-Jones, the executive director of western Connecticut’s Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority, said that lawmakers needed to take a more “holistic” approach to addressing the issue including better education campaigns, requiring towns to offer access to food scrap diversion programs and expanding capacity to handle waste locally.
“This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior and making better decisions about material management, from their homes to the curb to the transfer station,” she said.
Heaton-Jones did praise some aspects of the legislation drafted by lawmakers this year, including $500,000 to help DEEP enforce a law requiring large producers of food waste to utilize composting facilities and $250,000 to support an informational campaign run by the Recycle CT Foundation.
“I feel like we’re not going to solve the waste issue with the state, obviously, with this bill,” Heaton-Jones said. “I mean, there’s some good things in it… but we need more than that.”
H.B. 6917 also requires that DEEP study the feasibility of a proposal to make the manufacturers of consumer packaging pay for some or all of the costs of handling that material once it’s thrown away — also known as extended producer responsibility. Connecticut has EPR programs in place for hard-to-recycle items such as mattresses, tires and mercury thermostats, and advocates argue that the ubiquitous presence of packaging in the waste stream has exacerbated the state’s existing trash problems.










This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior.


– Jennifer Heaton-Jones, Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority


That proposal, even as a study, drew objections from waste haulers and recyclers who argued DEEP should first update its nearly decade-old survey of all the material that ends up in Connecticut’s waste stream.
The ranking Republican on the Environment Committee, state Rep. Pat Callahan, R-New Fairfield, echoed those concerns at a meeting last month when he said lawmakers should wait for the results of a new assessment before they “figure out what further work needs to be done.”
To address some of those concerns, Parker said the language in the bill was adjusted to postpone the packaging study by a year, so it would coincide with DEEP‘s next waste characterization study.
“The big picture is we’re just continuing to move this conversation forward,” Parker said, calling the bill “a work in progress.”
State Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, compared the current crisis to the situation facing Connecticut in the late 1980s, when she served as chair of the Environment Committee. At the time, aging landfills such as Hartford’s notorious “Mount Trashmore” served as eyesores and sources of pollution in local drinking water.
To close the landfills, Connecticut implemented a mandatory recycling law in 1991 and partnered with private companies to build its network of waste-to-energy facilities with enough capacity to burn as much trash as the state could produce, without needing to import more trash from elsewhere to stay profitable.
Lawmakers also established a $1-per-ton fee — later raised to $1.50 — on trash sent to those facilities to support their continued operations. That system, she said, worked for nearly three decades until the age of the facilities and the diversion of revenues from fees into the state’s general fund caused them to close or reduce their output.
By expanding the fee to trash shipped out of state and using it to fund compost and recycling programs, Mushinsky said she believes Connecticut can again reach a point where it can handle whatever trash is left over, whether through waste-to-energy incineration or some other emerging technology.
“It’s not rocket science, you just need money to do it,” Mushinsky said.

HOMEWOOD — Ellen McLaughlin said she wasn’t speaking for herself.
“I speak for the salamanders,” she told those gathered at a community meeting in late March.
McLaughlin, a retired Samford University biology professor, was one of dozens who showed up at the Homewood Senior Center to express their frustration over a proposed “town square” development that will threaten the habitat of spotted salamanders in the Birmingham suburb.
Flanked by oil paintings of wildflower fields and a waterfall, she made her views well known.
“They require a certain habitat, and to destroy that habitat is going to destroy that population of salamanders,” she told those in attendance, including representatives of Landmark Development, the company overseeing the project on behalf of the university. “So it’s imperative that we keep that.”
McLaughlin wasn’t alone in her concerns. Again and again, residents and other stakeholders present at the community meeting hosted by the development company brought up the plight of the amphibian that has, over time, become part of the character of Homewood, home of a salamander festival held annually for two decades.
Bob Dunn, CEO of Landmark Development, said in an interview that he understands residents’ concerns but that he can’t promise that there will be no impact to the spotted salamanders and the vernal pools where they lay their eggs each year.

“Could we encroach on portions of the habitat? As you look at the plan, there are areas where there’s some encroachment,” he said. “But we think the mitigating opportunities will more than compensate for the type of encroachment we’re talking about.”
Residents, biologists and members of the university community interviewed by Inside Climate News largely disagree. Currently proposed plans don’t leave room for changes that would protect the salamanders’ current habitat, they argue, putting at risk the survival of a population that’s called the city home for generations.

A salamander’s tale

The spotted salamander has long been a unique part of Homewood’s history.
Since at least the 1960s, and likely much longer, experts say, the amphibians have spent much of their time burrowing on the slopes of Shades Mountain, making their homes beneath the fallen leaves and limbs of the forest.
Once a year, as temperatures in Alabama begin to climb, the amphibians migrate from the mountain’s slopes across South Lakeshore Drive, a two-lane road, to the springtime, “vernal” pools located in a narrow patch of woods adjacent to existing sports fields that line Shades Creek.

The trek is not always simple. Most often, the salamanders embark on their journey at night, and typically in heavy rains—likely as a way to keep wet and avoid predators.
James Seay Brown Jr., a retired folklorist and natural historian who worked at Samford, wrote about Homewood’s relationship with the spotted salamander in his book, “Distracted by Alabama: Tangled Threads of Natural History, Local History and Folklore.”
When Brown arrived at Samford in 1971, the university’s environmental community was already tracking the salamanders and their annual migration. Brown quickly became obsessed with their yearly trek, and the fixation rubbed off on others over time.
Soon, Brown recruited his wife Michelle to serve as a sort of salamander Paul Revere—tasked with calling a list of interested locals when her husband had confirmed that the amphibians were on the move.
In 2002, Brown awoke to a heavy rain around three in the morning, traveled down to the migration site and confirmed the annual journey had begun. He alerted Michelle, who he said became nervous about calling one person in particular on the list — a Samford executive — so late at night. The executive’s wife answered, surprised by a woman’s voice on the other end of the line, but awkwardly agreed to share the news with her husband. The executive soon showed up for the crossing. So did his wife.
“And here were highly placed administrators of [University of Alabama at Birmingham] and Samford, plus otherwise upstanding businesspeople, professionals, and good family folks, all willing to risk their reputations by such behavior—though I might note some brought children as an excuse,” Brown wrote. “My wife later remarked drily that the ranks of insanity were growing. This may also have been the reaction of Homewood’s mayor at that time, Barry McCulley, when he first heard about it from some police report about flashlights in the woods near the high school at eleven o’clock at night and suspicious answers to straightforward police questions.”

By 2003, the excitement and intrigue over the annual salamander crossing had reached its peak, and city officials in April of that year officially designated a nearly half-mile stretch of South Lakeshore Drive as a salamander crossing—painted crosswalks and street signs included.
By the next year, the city hosted the first Salamander Festival, a tradition that’s continued to this day. In 2024, more than 900 attendees flocked to Homewood for the event, according to organizers.
In 2008, the city of Homewood took another step that aided the salamander—designating around 65 acres of land along South Lakeshore Drive, opposite the breeding pools, as a protected natural area: Homewood Nature Preserve.
Now, though, residents of Homewood fear the worst—that the desire for development will outweigh the need for environmental stewardship of the amphibians’ habitat. That’s why residents like Ellen McLaughlin say they will speak for the salamander.

A Creekside development

March’s community meeting at the Homewood Senior Center was partly a result of the city’s planning commission encouraging Landmark Development to more deeply engage with citizens over their concerns, according to city officials.
The development, called Creekside, is billed by the developer as a “dynamic, walkable, livable town square environment” that will feature everything from “trendy shops to delightful eateries.”
The project is part of Samford University’s “Samford Horizons” initiative, which the university touts as “a visionary master plan to ensure Samford remains among the world’s most respected Christ-centered universities.”
Samford, founded by the Alabama Baptist State Convention in 1841 as Howard College, has increased enrollment for the past 16 years in a row. University officials have said the proposed Creekside development will help to accommodate that growth, providing additional housing, retail options and sport facilities.
At the March meeting, members of the public were vocal about their opposition to the project. No one expressed support for the developer’s proposal.
Of particular concern to residents is a proposed 10-story hotel—which would be the tallest building in the city—and the implications for traffic, stormwater management and environmental stewardship as it relates to the spotted salamander.
Historically, the university has often found itself in tension with city officials and residents over development. Echoes of that tension surfaced in the community meeting.
“Samford wants to do this to us,” Becky Smith, a Homewood resident, said in a deep Southern drawl. “We don’t want you coming down here to tell us what you’re going to do to us.”

The framing of the new development as providing a new “town square” for Homewood belies Samford’s claims that it wants to develop a closer relationship with the city, she argued.
“Samford has said they want to be more a part of Homewood,” Smith said. “This is trying to make Homewood more a part of Samford.”
After those comments, Colin Coyne, Samford’s vice president for finance, business affairs and strategy, spoke up, telling community members that the university’s past friction with the community that surrounds it is not lost on him.
“I acknowledge the fact that we’ve not always been the best neighbors,” Coyne said. “But we have to start somewhere. This is our best attempt.”
Dunn, who spoke on behalf of Landmark at the meeting, said that the developer would do its best to mitigate the impact of the Creekside project on the spotted salamander’s springtime habitat. Landmark would certainly not be able to guarantee, however, that its engineering fixes would solve every problem, he said.
“It’s about really elevating issues that we have to stay focused on to continue to work to find good solutions that balance out all of the issues that go into a development,” he said. “We solve over here for the salamanders, and it creates an issue somewhere else. You’ve just got to find a balance.”

A threat to the salamander

The day after the meeting, Megan Gibbons put on her boots and waded into a place she feels at home, and where the salamanders do, too: the vernal pools just north of South Lakeshore Drive. There, she carefully reached into the water again and again, searching for the salamander egg masses she’s fighting to protect.
It’s here, in the shadow of Shades Mountain, near the shores of Shades Creek, where Gibbons, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has done some of her best teaching. It’s here, in the stagnant springtime pools, shaded by the trees overhead, where she’s sparked the passions of students from across the country. And it’s not just for their benefit that she wants these salamanders to survive. It’s for the next generation of salamanders, too.

It doesn’t take Gibbons long to find an egg mass. She smiles as she holds out the jelly-like blob that can contain between 10 and 100 eggs. Through the translucent membranes, you can see the tiny salamanders beginning to take shape— amphibians that will soon hatch and make their first journey over to the slopes of Shades Mountain.
“This one’s pretty far along,” she says of the egg mass, pointing out the various points of interest. “You can see its little body, and you can see its little fluffy gills coming out the side of its head.”
In this environment, Gibbons is doing what she loves best—teaching. It had been the same the evening before, when Gibbons—not then in her wading boots—had stood studiously along one wall of the meeting room, an educational poster about the salamander habitat at her side. One by one, she spoke to residents who approached her, explaining the risks posed by the impending development.
A day later, as she stood holding the egg mass, she weighed again what was at risk. It’s about balance, Dunn had said at the meeting. Balance in favor of what, Gibbons wondered.
“They’re going to make a lot of money from this,” Gibbons said of the developer. “What do we get out of this? What do the salamanders get out of this? I get to see the animal I love destroyed. That’s what I get.”

Soon, Gibbons had carefully replaced the egg mass into the vernal pool and climbed back to the adjacent roadway. A passerby, a retiree named Barbara Koehler, stopped to ask if Gibbons was looking for salamanders. She’d been at the meeting with the developer, too, she said, and didn’t like much of what she heard.










“What do we get out of this? What do the salamanders get out of this? I get to see the animal I love destroyed. That’s what I get.”

“I think the guy from Landmark was smooth,” she said. “He was good at glossing over the issue. He knows exactly what he should say to get people to think he’s not going to do exactly what he knows he’s going to do.”
Throughout the meeting, Dunn had emphasized that direct community engagement was not technically a required part of development in Homewood, Koehler recalled. Any construction could move forward simply with the necessary approvals from the Homewood City Council. Engagement would be ideal, Dunn said, but was not a mandate. To Koehler and Gibbons, that felt like a threat—an insinuation that meaningful community engagement could stop at any time if it suited the developer.
Koehler, a self-described birder and naturalist, said she’s opposed to the development.
“It’s just not a good idea,” she said. Her gaze soon pointed to the skyline, darting from tree to tree as birds chirped eagerly in the daylight sun. “This is worth protecting.”
Finding a way forward
What Dunn said about a lack of required input from residents is largely true.
On April 1, Dunn attended a meeting of the planning commission, a body required to recommend either approval or denial of the development plan by the Homewood City Council. Only Dunn—no residents or other stakeholders—was allowed to speak, according to a Homewood recording of the session. The CEO characterized the feedback he’d received from residents as “overwhelmingly positive.”
During the presentation, however, Dunn announced the publication of a report containing potential adjustments to the original development plan based on comments from residents. Ninety-two percent of written comments were about environmental stewardship, according to the developer’s own numbers.
The adjustments in the updated document include potential consideration of a “repositioning” of proposed sports fields that were slated to cover nearly the entire area from Shades Creek to South Lakeshore Drive, though representatives at the March meeting had noted that reducing the fields’ size wouldn’t be feasible given NCAA requirements for field dimensions. Plans for at least two salamander tunnels under South Lakeshore are also outlined in the updated plan—a potential pathway for the amphibians to cross the road without the risk of crossing traffic above ground.
Gibbons said in an interview that she’s not convinced that such slight adjustments will protect a species that has continually been left behind by commercial and residential development, not just in Homewood, but across the state and country. The risk of harming the species outweighs what’s to be gained by more and more development, she said.

Winslow Armstead, a member of the planning commission, pushed Dunn on providing more complete responses to residents’ questions and concerns, particularly when construction on the project could begin as early as this fall.
“I’m still sort of at a loss for the answers on some of those questions,” he told Dunn.
But ultimately, the planning commission recommended approval of the developer’s plan. It is set to be considered by the Homewood City Council in the coming weeks.
Continued engagement with Landmark Development is the best option for influencing what happens beside Shades Creek and Shades Mountain, particularly in today’s political climate, said David Butler, executive director of Cahaba Riverkeeper.
“There’s been a lot of hope that some federal or state agency would come in to help, but all of our environmental protections have been eroded,” he said. “All of the regulatory frameworks we’ve relied on have been broken down, and so we’re really going to have to go through and do a lot of that protection work on our own.”
That work, Butler said, can include direct discussions with developers—emphasizing to those proposing new growth that environmental stewardship must be a firm commitment from the beginning.
When it comes to Landmark and the Homewood project, Butler said he’s optimistic. Landmark reached out to Cahaba Riverkeeper, an environmental nonprofit, even before the first planning meeting, he said.
“I’m encouraged,” Butler said. “We would prefer no development, but that’s not a realistic position to take here. Development is going to happen. But at least we’re at the table. At least we have input.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s new Republican Party chairman is a former Democrat, but he’s been a Republican for nine years. Now he’s concerned about “Republicans In Name Only,” or RINOs, and wants to weed them out. 
“RINOs are a real thing,” Jim Eschenbaum said. “People say, ‘Don’t call us RINOs.’ Well, If you’re supporting abortion or gun control in any way, or any kind of sequestering of First Amendment rights, well, that does not align with conservative principles.”
Eschenbaum is a 62-year-old Hand County commissioner and farmer. He was a registered Democrat for 32 years until he and his wife switched when Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. 
“We said we couldn’t align with that one, so we were already planning to vote for Trump, and we both switched and became Republicans,” he said.
Change is ‘eminent’: Property-rights fight transforms this year’s SD Legislature

Eschenbaum got more politically engaged while fighting Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed $9 billion carbon capture pipeline, which he calls a “boondoggle.” The project would transport carbon dioxide emissions from dozens of ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where the carbon could also be used to extract oil from old wells. For the carbon it sequesters underground, the project could qualify for billions in federal tax credits for removing heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere.
The project’s need for eminent domain has motivated staunch opposition in South Dakota. Eminent domain is a method of forcing landowners to provide access to their land, in exchange for compensation determined by a court. 
Members of a grassroots movement against the pipeline’s use of eminent domain have had a big impact on South Dakota politics. They helped oust 14 state Republican lawmakers in last June’s primary election; referred what pipeline critics considered a pro-pipeline law to the ballot in November, where voters rejected it; and helped pass a law earlier this year barring carbon pipeline companies from using eminent domain.
Eschenbaum was a leading figure in the ballot referendum campaign.
“That did indeed gain me a lot of public exposure,” Eschenbaum said. “I did public informational meetings all over the state before the general election.”
Eschenbaum said the people he met along the way encouraged him to run for state Republican Party chairman. Some of those same people were becoming more active in the party themselves, and were shifting the party’s power balance to members of the anti-pipeline movement.
“They said we need good, honest, outspoken leadership,” he said. “I always tell people the truth is easy to speak. It’s not tough to speak what you believe.”
The state party elects a chair during the first meeting of its state central committee in each odd-numbered year. Voters include Republican county chairs, vice-chairs, state committee members and other designated officials. 
Eschenbaum was elected chairman in February and recently spoke with South Dakota Searchlight. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Many Republican donors now give money directly to causes or candidates rather than the state party. Is the state party organization relevant anymore, and why does it exist?
It is, because of the state organization, the county organizations, the county precinct committeemen and committeewomen, and the elected Republican officials in the county who are part of that county central committee.

It exists, most importantly, because of its party platform. That party platform is amended by the entire group of people, which would include precinct committeemen and committeewomen who go to the state convention. 
That platform shows what the South Dakota GOP stands for, and then I think our elected officials should be held to the task of promoting and voting along the lines of that platform. And so there is a purpose. 
I agree that people are funding candidates now instead of just throwing all the money to the state or state party. And I am perfectly OK with that. We don’t need any more money thrown to the state GOP than what we need to operate.
And we’ve already taken $77,000 out of the annual operating costs of the state GOP. Reggie Rhoden, Governor Rhoden’s son, was executive director and he was being paid $5,400 a month. He resigned at the meeting on February 22, when we did the elections. And we have decided thus far that we don’t need an executive director. Nobody knows that he was doing much.
What makes someone a Republican? 
I think you should be a constitutional conservative. And what I mean by constitutional conservative is that you vote and represent Republicans based on the two constitutions: the South Dakota Constitution and the U.S. Constitution, which everyone raises their right hand and swears an oath to when they’re sworn in. And then our party platform, which is conservative values. 
I have even proposed a South Dakota GOP scorecard. I don’t know if the state central committee will decide to do it, but it would be based on just those three principles, the two constitutions and the party platform.
How do you define the factions in the Republican Party? 
Well, it’s establishment power players and power to the people. 
The average Joes are realizing they have a voice. It comes from that 2024 primary. A lot of those candidates that got voted out, those incumbents that got voted out, had all kinds of money behind them from the ethanol plants and Summit Carbon Solutions. And the people got out and talked to people. This is what party politics should be. This is what government should be.
Do you want to unify Republicans? 
The best thing I can do to bring them all together is be open and honest and communicative with them, and I’ve been doing that.
I feel like the South Dakota GOP has been run by just a few power players, and they really didn’t want a new voice or input. I’ve stated this so many times: They ask for our money and our vote, but they don’t want our voice. They don’t want us involved in the process, and that’s just a terrible thought when you’ve got a state central committee that’s composed of about 200 members and the bylaws.
The bylaws make it clear to me that the chairman’s job is to facilitate the operations and decision-making of the state central committee. The state central committee should have the power, not the chairman or any other executive director or anything. The state central committee’s discussions and decision-making should guide the party.

And that’s what I ran on. I ran on a campaign of power to the people and being accessible to the people, and so far it’s going good. 
Some of these counties that did not want me elected are starting to talk to me. There was quite a while there that they didn’t like this farmer from Hand County getting in amongst the politicians.
But I said our state motto for God’s sake is “Under God the People Rule,” and some of these politicians, they get elected to office, they get a fat head about what it is they want to do or who they want to benefit, or using government to do business, and that’s not what government is intended to be. It’s supposed to be a minimal service to the people, and it just keeps growing and growing and growing and getting more authoritarian and powerful, and that’s not what our founders intended it to be, in my opinion. 
Why were you a Democrat? Why did you become a Republican?
My wife and I were both raised in Catholic Democrat families. And what do young people do if they haven’t really gotten themselves involved in politics in high school and started making decisions of which way they’re going to go? You register the same as your parents were. 
Well, as abortion became a bigger topic, my wife and I both agreed we wouldn’t support any Democrat that supported abortion.
The Democratic Party that we aligned with was more of that JFK kind of a Democrat that worked for the working class and common people. The party got away from that. They just got further and further away from it. They just keep stepping to the left even more all the time and supporting all kinds of foolishness that the Republican Party does not support.
Is there anything you’d like to add?
I’m extremely involved as chairman — like I said, responsive to people. I’m trying to make every Lincoln Day Dinner [a fundraising event for county Republican parties] across the state that I can possibly get to.
These are complaints that I heard about the previous chair or previous administration. You’d have a Lincoln Day Dinner, give plenty of notice for it, and they’re like, “No, very busy that day.”
If you take a job like this, you have to commit the time that it takes to do it right. I don’t know why that didn’t happen previously. It could be speculated probably two or three different ways. 
I said when I took this job, “I will not be a butt kisser to any politicians. I’m working for the people to elect good politicians.”
Just because you’re elected to office currently does not guarantee you’re going to get reelected to office again. It just doesn’t.

Where legislatures have refused to boost pay and benefits for workers, advocates have often taken the fight straight to voters. In recent years voters in Michigan, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly backed higher state minimum wages and guaranteed paid sick leave at the polls. But despite that strong showing of support, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are now trying to water down or even roll back the measures their constituents approved.
In November, 58% of Missouri voters approved Proposition A, which raises the state minimum wage to $15 by 2026 and requires employers to provide paid sick leave. That level of support, said Missouri Jobs with Justice Policy Director Richard Von Glahn, stems from the fact that the measure “speaks to the experiences that voters have in their lives and where the economy is not working for them.” Typically, when his organization was out gathering signatures, voters expressed surprise that the minimum wage was not already $15 an hour and that paid sick leave was not already a guarantee. The vote shows it was “the clear will of what voters want,” Von Glahn said.
But in March the Missouri House passed legislation repealing the paid sick leave measure and undoing the state’s decades-long practice of regularly updating the minimum wage to keep up with inflation. If the bill becomes law, wage increases will cease in January 2027. To justify such changes, Republican state Rep. Mitch Boggs said, “Of course the people voted for it. It would be like asking your teenager if he wanted a checkbook. They’re going to vote for it every time.”
Republican state Rep. Scott Miller put it another way: “Just because 57% of the people that voted that day, voted in favor of something, that doesn’t make it right,” he said, adding, “They’re taking away the choice of businesses to engage in [the] free market.”
It’s not just lawmakers trying to undo the will of the voters, however. A group of businesses and individuals have asked the state Supreme Court to strike down the measure entirely, arguing that it violates the state Constitution’s single subject requirement. In their lawsuit they claim that wages and paid sick time are separate issues that should not have been combined in a single measure. Von Glahn pushed back on that argument: “Wages for hours worked and wages for paid sick time, that’s part of total compensation,” Von Glahn said. “As a working person, if I have money in my check, do I care if it’s from paid sick days or from hours that I worked?”
Nebraska voters passed their own paid sick leave ballot measure by a staggering 74% this past November. A majority of voters in every legislative district supported it, and the support was higher than for the lawmakers themselves. That’s not the only measure state lawmakers want to change, however. In 2022, nearly 59% of voters approved a measure that will raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 and keep increasing it in later years to keep up with inflation.
“Nebraskans really care about their neighbors,” Jo Giles, executive director of the Women’s Fund of Omaha, said of the support both measures received. Paid sick leave, she said, is “a common sense solution.” As in Missouri, many voters she spoke to while gathering signatures were surprised it wasn’t already guaranteed.
And yet efforts to get lawmakers to take action themselves had not succeeded. “We tried for many years,” Giles said, including during the height of the pandemic when workers were getting sick by the thousands. But bills never moved forward. “After many, many attempts, we determined, ‘OK, we’re not going to get it through the Legislature, so let’s ask the people what they want,’” Giles said. “It was pretty clear what the people wanted: They wanted paid sick leave, they wanted to increase the minimum wage.”










“What does that mean for our overall democracy if people cannot exercise their voice and implement policies that are popular?” 


– Jo Giles, Women’s Fund of Omaha


That hasn’t stopped Nebraska lawmakers from seeking to change the measures approved by their constituents. Last year, two state lawmakers introduced bills to exempt young workers from the higher wage. Nebraska’s Legislature is officially nonpartisan, but one of the lawmakers was aligned with Democrats and the other with Republicans. The effort failed to advance in the Legislature.
This session, those two lawmakers and others are seeking to weaken both the minimum wage and sick leave policies. Legislative Bill 698, introduced by a Republican-aligned senator, would exempt companies with 10 or fewer employees from the paid sick leave requirement. Yet the measure voters passed already makes an allowance for small businesses by allowing those with 20 or fewer employees to provide their workers with fewer days of leave. The bill would also exempt agricultural workers and those under 16 while eliminating employees’ right to sue their employers if they aren’t given the leave they’re owed. Giles argued that these changes gut “the core aspects” of the initiative.
Another bill introduced this year, Legislative Bill 258, meanwhile, would allow employers to pay people younger than 19 a lower minimum wage and would eliminate future minimum wage increases.
Beyond the impact on workers themselves, Giles thinks lawmakers’ actions could harm the entire state. “What does that mean for our overall democracy if people cannot exercise their voice and implement policies that are popular?” she said. Residents’ votes “should be honored.”
In both Missouri and Nebraska, conservative lawmakers have led the charge to roll back ballot measures. In Michigan, Democrats have joined the effort.
Back in 2012, Mothering Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for issues impacting women of color, started pushing for a paid sick leave bill in the state Legislature, but Republicans stood in the way. It became clear that “if we wanted to get this done, we would have to go straight to voters,” said Danielle Atkinson, founder of Mothering Justice. Her group was poised to do so, submitting over 280,000 signatures to put both paid sick leave and a higher minimum wage on the ballot in 2018. There was “always overwhelming support” from voters, she said, because it “was extremely popular and needed.”
But then the Republican-controlled Legislature stepped in that September. Over united Democratic opposition in the state Senate but with some Democratic support in the state House, lawmakers passed legislation to raise the minimum wage and institute a paid sick leave requirement before voters had the chance to weigh in. That wasn’t because lawmakers agreed with the ballot measures; they did so explicitly to come back and gut both measures later on, something that would have been much harder had the issues passed by ballot measure.










“We had an opportunity to be a pretty big part of a larger movement to eliminate a sub-minimum wage, and we missed it.”


– Danielle Atkinson, Mothering Justice


State Senate Republican Majority Leader Arlan B. Meekhof explained the vote this way: “The Senate adopted the policy to preserve the ability for this legislature and future legislatures to amend the statute to better fit our state and our economy.”
And lawmakers did in fact later amend the legislation by voting to delay the minimum wage increase by nearly a decade, scrap future inflation adjustments and preserve a lower tipped minimum wage. Lawmakers also exempted employers with fewer than 50 employees from paid sick leave and scaled it back for everyone else.
The groups behind the ballot measures fought back in the courts, arguing that what lawmakers did violated the state Constitution. That took “time, energy” and “a considerable amount of resources,” Atkinson said. “But we thought it was important to fight for the will of the people and direct democracy.” Last summer, it seemed they had finally won: The state supreme court found the Legislature had indeed violated the state Constitution and reinstated the original wage and sick leave measures. The new benefits were set to go into effect on Feb. 21. “We were extremely hopeful,” Atkinson said. “We were like, ‘Great, on to the next fight.’”
But the Legislature wasn’t done intervening. An hour before midnight on Feb. 20, lawmakers passed bills to preserve a lower tipped minimum wage, delay implementation of paid sick leave, exempt young and temporary seasonal workers, reduce guaranteed unpaid time off for employees of small businesses and strip workers of the right to sue employers for violating the new rights. This time, nearly half of Democrats in both chambers joined with all Republicans to pass the measures, and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed them into law.
The governor had “heard concerns about implementation of the new law,” according to a statement from spokesperson Stacey LaRouche, while the bill was under consideration, and supported “a bipartisan deal that protects servers and wait staff, while also providing certainty to small businesses and helping Michigan remain competitive.”
Business groups, particularly the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association, had lobbied hard for the tipped minimum wage changes. It was “very clear” that lawmakers of both parties “were being influenced by the business community,” Atkinson said. “The restaurant industry did a very good job of manufacturing outrage.”
Atkinson is frustrated that those tactics succeeded. “Michigan is a place where we’re known for workers’ rights, and we had an opportunity to be a pretty big part of a larger movement to eliminate a sub-minimum wage, and we missed it,” she noted, referring to the lower wage employers can pay tipped employees.
Having Democrats join in was even worse. “When you see Democrats introducing legislation that’s undermining workers’ rights, it makes … an easier target for Republicans to do the same,” she said. “It’s really unfortunate that that came from members of a party that claims to be for workers’ rights.”

“If there is the will, there’s always a way” Grall told the Phoenix after the measure passed the Senate 29-7 on Wednesday. “At least it’s going to be with [the House] now, and we’ll see if any other solutions are proposed.”
Grall’s is one of several high-profile proposals in limbo at this point in the 2025 Florida legislative session, having passed through one chamber going nowhere in the other. 
And with two-thirds of the regular legislative session now in the books, the outcome of some for these bills look cloudy at best. Yet those involved in the legislative process don’t dare say they are dead just yet.
“I would say there’s a lot of time left in the session,” Senate President Ben Albritton said this week when asked about the timeline for such bills and whether he might jumpstart their passage through the Senate.
“You’re asking me if I’m specifically open to the idea of referring a House bill that we receive it to say, Rules or Appropriations to have that bill heard and potentially move?” he said in repeating an inquiry with reporters on Wednesday. “The answer is yes.”
Guns
Among bills that the Senate President himself has been asked about on an almost weekly basis is HB 759, which would would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. Three measures in the Senate include that provision, but none of them have had a committee hearing.
Albritton has refused to commit to whether he might consider it — unlike his predecessor, Kathleen Passidomo, who was explicit in rejecting that idea during the past two sessions, when she was presiding officer.
“We’ve heard through back channels that there might be a bill to use as a bargaining chip with the House. Possibly for the budget or something else,” said Luis Valdes, Florida state director of Gun Owners of America.
“If that’s the case, Gun Owners of America aren’t actually fond of that, because using Second Amendment rights as a bargaining chip for something else is wrong, especially when hundreds of thousands of Floridians have had their rights violated by this law.”
Second Amendment enthusiasts were hyped before the session that their long-awaited hope that Florida would join the overwhelming number of states that allow for open carry would finally be realized, but Albritton shut down that thought in November.
Education
Then there’s SB 166, the public school “deregulation” bill sponsored in the Senate by North Florida Republican Corey Simon. Under this legislation, Florida high schoolers would not need to pass algebra or English final exams to graduate. The bill looks to “level the playing field amid other school-choice options,” Albritton said in a news release.
There is no House companion for the proposal.
Hands-free distracted driving
A year ago, Tallahassee Democratic Rep. Allison Tant’s distracted-driving bill cleared all three of its committees before dying on the House floor. Its Senate companion, however, was blocked in committees and never received a hearing.
Flash forward to 2025 and the exact opposite is happening: Sen. Grall’s bill cleared all of its three committee assignments before passing in the Senate by a two-thirds majority this week, while its House equivalent has yet to be heard in either of its two assigned committees.
Yet advocates aren’t ready to throw in the towel just yet, noting that the bill has been sent to the House in messages, making it available for action there.

“We are extremely hopeful that Rep. Perez will bring this forth, since he represents Miami-Dade, one of 11 counties that have passed a hands-free resolution asking lawmakers to act,” said a spokesperson for the Anthony Phoenix Branca Foundation, a group led by Demetrius Branca, who visited lawmakers around the state earlier this year in hopes of getting  them to pass the bill this year. A distracted driver killed Branca’s son in 2014.
 Health Care
The House has championed a number of scope-of-practice expansions this session but the Senate does not seem interested in doing the same. For instance, the House passed legislation allowing certified registered nurse anesthetists to work without having a written supervisory protocol with a physician.



The bill (HB 649) passed the House on April 3 on a 77-30 vote. Conversely, the Senate companion (SB 718) has been referred to three committees but has been heard by none.


 On the precipice


Other  bills that have soared through one chamber but are gaining no traction in the other, such as the “right to repair” legislation sponsored by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow in the Senate (SB 1132).
The measure would require manufacturers to more freely provide access to tools, manuals, and parts needed to repair certain agriculture and portable wireless equipment. It’s House companion, sponsored by Tampa Bay Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner (HB 235), hasn’t received a single hearing in any of the committees it was assigned to.



There’s the E-Verify measure (HB 955), which would require all Florida businesses to use the system to check the legal status of employees, which has cleared both of the committees that it was assigned to in the House. If approved, it would change existing law, which requires only businesses with 25 employees or more to employ the program.
However, E-Verify hasn’t moved at all in the Senate. Sarasota County Republican Sen. Joe Gruters told the Phoenix late Friday that the proposal is still viable in that chamber.

But that day of mass action was fueled by weeks of local demonstrations that have united a diverse coalition of people who say they are energized to take a stand.
Many of these community events have been organized by local activists who are raising alarm at the growing threats to Social Security and other programs that are being dismantled by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Others have been led by local labor unions that are protesting the assault on workers, exemplified by mass firings, dismantling of collective bargaining rights, and efforts to privatize government services. 
The Maine protests echo the national movement to “Fight the Oligarchy” being led by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Since March, the progressive duo has traveled to swing districts across the country, drawing historically large crowds to their rallies. At the events, the pair calls out the billionaire take-over of America, galvanizing huge swaths of everyday voters to become “brawlers” for the working class.

Grassroots Maine activists battle against billionaires
In the months since Trump took office, disparate grassroots groups have coalesced into a united movement, holding more than fifteen weekly actions across the state. These efforts led to the sizable “Hands Off” protests, which took place in more than 20 Maine cities and towns on April 5.
Many of the local groups are associated with national organizations including Indivisible, MoveOn and 50501. Despite that, local leaders emphasize a decentralized approach, allowing wide swaths of people to engage in communities closest to their homes.
“The point of having protests all over the place is people can actually get to them, and that resentment and the feelings of protest are everywhere,” said Elizabeth Leonard, who helps organize the weekly Takedown Tesla protest at the electric vehicle charging station in Waterville. “That’s why I want to keep organizing here.”
When Leonard, a retired Colby College history professor, started leading the Tuesday actions in February, only about 10-12 people showed up. Now, more than 50 people regularly attend, which she attributes to word-of-mouth organizing within local churches, colleges and community newsletters, as well as utilizing alternative social media sites like Bluesky.
Leonard said a lot of people are attracted to the action because Musk has blessed them with “a very possible goal” of pushing Tesla’s stock price down, which they hope will reduce the CEO’s influence over American democracy.
“We can chip away at Musk’s credibility as this genius and great businessman who is going to save the country,” Leonard said. “If he can’t hold his company together, then it’s likely he is going to trash the country like he is trashing Tesla.”
Many of the other local protests are similarly focused on the outsized power that Musk, Trump and other wealthy individuals have on the U.S. government.
However, Leonard noted that cuts to Social Security and other programs that many Mainers rely on will likely draw in others, as evidenced by many of the signs at last week’s mass demonstrations.
“I think the attack on Social Security is going to wake a lot of people up who are still sleeping,” Leonard said. “When their Social Security checks don’t come in, that will affect people across ages.”

Labor unions getting the word out
Unions and workers more broadly have been on the receiving end of many of the Trump administration’s actions, which have sparked informational pickets, labor protests and press conferences in several Maine towns. 
Last month, Trump took direct aim at unions with an executive action that rolled back collective bargaining rights with an executive order banning the agreements at government agencies with “national security interests.”
Local labor leaders say such actions are likely to galvanize workers.
“As history has shown, the labor movement can be an extremely powerful force against repressive regimes and totalitarian governments, which is why Musk and the Trump administration are fixated on taking away our rights and attacking our unions,” AFL-CIO President Matt Schlobohm said. “We will not stand by as our democracy is dismantled.”
On March 20, local postal worker unions participated in a national day of action with rallies in Bangor and Portland to inform people about efforts to privatize the U.S. Postal Service.
“We are out here to tell people hands off the Postal Service,” said Robert Perocchi, president of Bangor Area Local 536 of the American Postal Workers Union, who was among roughly 100 people that gathered outside the Bangor post office. He said such actions are important to educate people about how their lives are shaped by decisions made in Washington, D.C.. 
Since the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act, the USPS has been self-funded, relying on revenue from postage and other sales rather than tax-payer money for their operations, despite contrary claims from Musk and the Trump administration. 
“The USPS is a public service we offer. The Trump administration is looking to sell it off to the rich and privatize it,” Perocchi said, noting that rural areas will be most impacted with the likely closure of smaller post offices. “It’s going to be about profits instead of service.”
Other demonstrations organized by local labor groups have drawn similarly robust support. In mid-March, the Maine State Nurses Association organized a protest against cuts to Medicaid that they said would “deteriorate services in the region.” More than 100 nurses, caregivers and patients gathered outside U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ Portland office to present a $4.1 billion check made out to the “billionaire class” paid for by “working people.” 
The check represented the amount of Maine Medicaid funding that could be at risk if Congress passes Republicans’ tax and spending plan, which would extend the president’s 2017 tax cuts and calls for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the Medicaid and Medicare health programs, to find at least $880 billion in cost savings.
Social Security workers have also organized events to call attention to efforts led by Musk to cut the agency, including plans to reduce phone services, fire staff and close field offices, including in Maine.
“We are greatly concerned that the DOGE team is pressuring the administration to make deep cuts in staff,” Christine Lizotte, a claims specialist and secretary treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1164, said at a recent press event in Hallowell. “That will delay payments, cause more errors and could even crash the whole system within months.”
Schlobohm with the Maine AFL-CIO said Maine’s labor movement will continue to lead efforts pushing back on the Trump administration.
“Hundreds of Maine union workers and our allies have taken to the streets to fight against the illegal and unconstitutional attacks on our democratic institutions and public services by billionaire Elon Musk,” Schlobohm said. “We are united in our resolve to protect Social Security, rural health care and nursing homes, the U.S. Postal Service and services for our veterans.”

As Montana pediatricians, we know that cutting Medicaid to this extent won’t just affect children covered by Medicaid. It will be felt by every child, in every community.
Picture this: your child was just diagnosed with a life-altering chronic disease, but there is no specialty care available in the state. Or your newborn arrived earlier than expected, and there’s not a NICU bed available due to a hospital’s cuts to capacity.
Cuts to Medicaid and Healthy Montana Kids make these situations ever more likely. These programs are deeply important to the health of the children in the state. Medicaid and Healthy Montana Kids provide coverage for more than 94,000 children throughout Montana.
Medicaid coverage for kids also makes the difference between local hospitals having pediatric services and not having them. Medicaid covers 40% of births in Montana and 58% of children with special health care needs and disabilities, which means it is a critical source of funding for hospitals and clinics that provide pediatric services. Significant cuts such as those currently proposed would push many past the tipping point – directly resulting in an increased number of children and their families who need to leave Montana in order to treat life-threatening or chronic illnesses. 
Infrastructure for critically ill children in particular is fragile. There are only three small pediatric intensive care units in the state, and upending one of these hospital systems with funding cuts could mean closing one or more of these units, leaving Montana with even less access to stabilization of pediatric patients having an emergency.
As pediatricians, we want to avoid seeing families lose insurance coverage and hospitals lose services. And even more than that: We want to make sure we’re investing in our children. Evidence shows that Medicaid funding has long-term benefits. Children covered by Medicaid miss fewer school days, are more likely to graduate high school, be healthier adults and earn higher wages.
In fact, this year Montana’s state legislature has just reauthorized a Medicaid program covering 75,000 adults. A bipartisan majority recognized the importance of good health to Montana’s working families, as well as Medicaid’s significant long-term benefits to the state economy and rural health care infrastructure. This is a program that does so much good for so many people. We cannot afford to make the slashing cuts proposed right now in Congress.
Pediatricians urge Montana’s Congressional delegation to protect Medicaid and Healthy Montana Kids in the federal budget. We also urge our fellow Montanans to reach out and tell them how important Medicaid is to you and your family. Our children deserve access to health care when they need it — and to a healthy future.

Republicans looking to cut federal spending on Medicaid are eyeing work requirements as one possible option. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Under an emerging Republican plan to require some Medicaid recipients to work, between 4.6 million and 5.2 million adults ages 19 to 55 could lose their health care coverage, according to a new analysis.
The study, conducted by Urban Institute researchers with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, calculated that up to 39% of the 13.3 million adults in that age group who became eligible for Medicaid when their states expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act would lose coverage if Congress required states to impose work rules.
The report suggests that most of those people would lose coverage not because they aren’t complying with the rules, but because they would struggle to report their compliance to the state.
“Most adults who would lose eligibility for federal Medicaid funding are working, engaged in work-related activities, or could qualify for exemptions not readily identifiable through state databases but could still face disenrollment because of the reporting requirements,” it states. The study identified several barriers to reporting, including lack of broadband access and lack of transportation.
Forty states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA. Overall, nearly 72 million people, about a fifth of Americans, are enrolled in the program for low-income people, which is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Traditional Medicaid insurance was mainly available to children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. But the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare, allowed states to extend coverage to adults making up to 138% of the federal poverty level — about $21,000 a year for a single person.
Nationwide, more than 21 million people with low incomes have health insurance because of expanded Medicaid eligibility.
U.S. House Republicans in February pushed through a budget plan, now under consideration in the Senate, that would require about $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. The budget doesn’t contain specifics on how that target would be met. But work requirements are a likely money-saving option: A 2023 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that imposing work rules on Medicaid recipients ages 19 to 55 who are not parents or caregivers would cut federal spending by an estimated $109 billion over the next 10 years.
The Congressional Budget Office based that projection on a plan the GOP-controlled U.S. House approved in 2023. That bill, the likely blueprint for the work requirements Republicans are considering now, would have required adults ages 19-55 to work, participate in a job training program or perform community service for at least 80 hours per month for three or more months in a calendar year. Parents and caretakers of dependent children, and those unable to work because of a health condition, would have been exempt.
Many Republican-led states are eager to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients. Thirteen states received permission to impose work rules on at least some Medicaid enrollees during the first Trump administration. Nine additional states requested permission to enact Medicaid work requirements during Trump’s earlier term but had not won approval by the time it ended.
When the Biden administration came into office, it rescinded all the approvals.
Supporters say requiring Medicaid recipients to work, study or train for a career gives them a boost toward self-sufficiency and financial stability. Critics, however, say such rules end up hurting far more people than they help.
The researchers from the Urban Institute mostly based their analysis on the experience of Arkansas, which in June 2018 became the first state to require some Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer, go to school or participate in job training to receive benefits. By the time a federal judge halted the policy in April 2019, 18,000 adults had lost coverage.
The researchers also looked at New Hampshire, which began implementing a work requirement but halted the program in July 2019 before suspending anyone’s coverage.
“What was found in a lot of qualitative research on the previous work requirement programs is that a lot of people were unaware of the policy, or they didn’t understand the policy,” said Michael Karpman, an Urban Institute researcher who co-authored the study.
“People who need coverage the most would do the most to try to maintain it. On the other hand, those people could also face the most difficulty with the administrative barriers,” Karpman said.
In a 2020 study examining how Arkansas’ last experience with work requirements played out, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health “found no evidence that the policy succeeded in its stated goal of promoting work and instead found substantial evidence of harm to health care coverage and access.”
Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in January that she would ask the federal government for permission to institute work requirements, regardless of what Congress decides. The state submitted the request last week.
Arkansas Republican state Rep. Aaron Pilkington, who serves on the health committee in his chamber, said lawmakers “learned our lesson from the last go-round.”
Pilkington said that under the new proposal, the state will only pause coverage instead of canceling it, giving recipients an opportunity to prove they are complying. And, he said, the online portal for reporting will be a lot more user-friendly.
“I think it’s a reasonable thing to ask for able-bodied people to look for work, or try to obtain work,” Pilkington said.
But Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, said even the new version would be a challenge for many enrollees. Many people on Medicaid are juggling multiple jobs, and having to report to the state every month would be a significant burden.
“Especially for a rural state like Arkansas, work requirements fail to take into account a lot of the realities that people may face,” Harper said. She added that “with the overall job market, job opportunities may or may not be available in some of these rural towns.”

Dunixi Guereca of Omaha, both new Nebraska lawmakers this year, hold a town hall in South Omaha on Saturday. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — A town hall in South Omaha, hosted by two freshmen Nebraska state lawmakers, drew about 50 people and questions ranging from local and state to national matters.
State Sens. Margo Juarez and Dunixi Guereca of Omaha, in the first of what they said will be more joint community meetings, said that on some issues they will be a link to help constituents resolve problems with city or other officials.
After a nearly two-hour session, the senators said they believed a key goal was accomplished — providing an open forum for people in their districts to express whatever concerns them.
“I realize there’s frustrations with there not being more attention paid here in the community. Obviously that is why we are here today,” Juarez at one point told the group gathered in an auditorium at Omaha South High School.
  Anxiety

Among those in the audience were Roger Garcia, Douglas County Board chairman, Yanira Garcia, board member of the Regional Metro Transit Board, and Don Preister, a Bellevue City Councilman and founding member of the South Omaha Neighborhood Alliance.

“What we saw also is some real anxiety about what is going on on the federal level,” said Guereca, referring to questions raised about actions of the Trump administration.
One audience member cited the president’s resistance to judicial orders and how that filters to his community and Latinos. Others commented on the demise of Juarez’s previous priority bill, Legislative Bill 299, which partly sought to allow immigrants — those with legal permission to work in the U.S. but who lack permanent residency — access to unemployment insurance benefits their employers pay into.
Juarez explained to the group that the bill was crushed under the weight of a Trump administration threat that the state could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid.
On state-related issues, perhaps the loudest reaction followed comments about the Legislature’s actions seeking to weaken voter-passed protections for paid sick leave. 
In November, nearly 75% of Nebraska voters approved a ballot measure requiring businesses with over 20 employees to pay sick leave to eligible workers based on hours worked. A bill making its way through the Legislature seeks additional carveouts that would not require paid sick leave for workers ages 14 and 15, seasonal ag workers or workers in businesses with 10 or fewer employees.
An audience member questioned why state lawmakers believe they need to make the law “better.”
“I think if we voted for it, it’s already better. Do they just think we can‘t be trusted with voting?” she said.
Guereca and Juarez said they oppose changing the voter-approved law. 
“We will continue to fight it,” Guereca said, saying that negotiations on the bill continue in the Legislature that wraps up its session in early June. 
A few audience members asked about the status of a Guereca bill that would allow local researchers quicker access to health data collected by the Nebraska Department of Human Services.
Guereca said that DHHS cites a “legal technicality” that effectively keeps local researchers waiting for the data a couple of years, when it is released by federal health officials. He is seeking to get Legislative Bill 446 on a path for passage yet this year, to allow certain qualified researchers quicker access to “de-identified data.” 
“If we’re looking for alarming trends, waiting two years isn’t going to cut it,” he said.
 Pay raise for lawmakers?

The senators were somewhat divided on a movement that could raise the pay for lawmakers.

Guereca said he was opposed: “I knew what I was getting into,” he said.
For Juarez, she said she is still contemplating, as she believes the $12,000 annual salary is a deterrent to running for the office, particularly for young people, and has created a legislative body that is not “a good representation of the state.”
“I was able to run, not because I’m wealthy, but because I am retired so I have other monthly income coming in,” she said.
Among other topics that surfaced were federal actions targeting immigrants. A South Omaha resident questioned the Omaha Police Department’s impound lot operations. A 24th Street merchant aired frustrations with the homeless population frightening customers.
“We don’t have in South Omaha a consistent ongoing voice of unity, of unified outrage, to confront government when it does things, not just nationally but locally,” said South Omaha activist Ben Salazar.
Juarez and Guereca talked about other bills they have championed, the lawmaking process and invited participants to weigh in on how often they want town halls.
One woman suggested at least once a month — ”because of the speed at which things are happening (nationally) that impact what you’re doing.”

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Opposing views among environmental groups and coastal scientists in Louisiana have spurred intense debates over the use of treated sewage to restore Louisiana’s wetlands. The conflicts could jeopardize some decades-long efforts to restore the state’s disappearing coast.
Wetlands are sometimes referred to as the kidneys of the earth — and for good reason. They keep water clean by filtering out pollutants and managing the amount of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, that can lead to the harmful algae blooms that create “dead zones” without the oxygen needed to support aquatic life.  
Wetlands can even be created to treat wastewater processed from sewage treatment plants. The practice can avoid polluting rivers and streams while providing valuable habitat. 
But in Louisiana, the use of natural wetlands for wastewater treatment is a topic rife with controversy. 
Originally pitched as a method of coastal restoration, a natural assimilation wetland is typically an area of degraded forested swamp or marshland where disinfected treated sewage water is pumped in an effort to push away saltwater, provide nutrients for the growth of plants and trees, and reverse the sinking and eroding of the land. Louisiana’s 3 million acres of wetlands, which include coastal marshes and swamps, are lost at the rate of roughly 75 square kilometers annually and are on pace to disappear entirely within 200 years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Both federal and state regulators permit local wastewater utilities to use natural wetlands for assimilation. One of the sites, located in Breaux Bridge, began in the 1940s as the city’s solution to discharging its treated wastewater. But it wasn’t until around the 1980s when LSU scientists began using and studying assimilation wetlands as a way to rebuild Louisiana’s coast. There are now 15 such assimilation sites across the state.
Local utilities and scientists, led by wetlands ecologist John Day, believe assimilation sites have been largely successful in restoring wetlands. Day is one of the LSU researchers who spearheaded their use for coastal restoration. He founded Comite Resources, a company of environmental scientists who work on coastal restoration projects and currently monitor a few of the assimilation wetland sites.  
On the other side of the debate is Eugene Turner, emeritus professor of coastal sciences at LSU, who says assimilation is killing rather than restoring wetlands. Turner has a vocal public following, including organizations such as the Ponchartrain Conservancy and Louisiana Wildlife Federation, that has rallied around his argument: Feeding treated wastewater to Louisiana’s wetlands hurts rather than helps.
Such disagreements are a normal and even necessary part of science, but Day and his colleagues say Turner’s side is venturing outside the scientific process and lobbying state lawmakers to halt the projects in an “undemocratic” manner. 
On March 18, Turner gave a presentation to the Louisiana House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment, claiming assimilation is a failure. He urged lawmakers to defund work on the South Slough Wetland project, just south of Ponchatoula. Much of the money for it comes from federal grants. 
Six out of the nine assimilation areas LDEQ monitors passed their long-term health assessments, according to the agency’s 2024 report. Wetland health is determined in the report solely by the amount of vegetation growth at the site, called net primary productivity, evaluated over a period of five years. The South Slough Wetland is one of the six sites that passed its evaluation.

Turner’s claims received no pushback at the time because, according to Day, no other coastal scientists were invited to the hearing or even aware that the wetlands projects were up for discussion. 
Turner did the same thing at a legislative hearing last year, catching the scientific community by surprise with misleading testimony that no one got a chance to refute, Day said in an interview. 
“It’s happened twice, and it’s undemocratic,” he said. “They never alert the larger scientific community that’s interested in this.”
Turner disputed the idea he’s doing anything underhanded and accused Day of trying to protect his funding source. Comite Resources provides the monitoring services for the site, though Day said he hasn’t received a paycheck from the company in nearly 20 years. 
“What is undemocratic? Testifying at a legislative session? Speaking up with facts?” Turner said in an interview. “Is publishing in open access scientific journals undemocratic? Democracy includes public discourse in this country.”
Representatives from the Ponchartrain Conservancy and Louisiana Wildlife Federation also attended the March 18 meeting and gave testimony supporting Turner’s position to pull money back from wetland assimilation projects. While the organizations supported the idea in the past, they have since changed their stance. 
Ponchartrain Conservancy executive director Kristi Trail said she thinks Louisiana should stop issuing permits for new assimilation projects.
Both organizations cite many of Turner’s arguments and are calling for treatment plants associated with assimilation projects to improve the quality level of the water they discharge into manufactured wetland areas. They also argue that the water may need to be mixed between assimilation wetlands and an open water body in an effort to protect wetlands against long periods of exposure to extra nutrients. 
Ponchatoula state Rep. Kim Coates asked Louisiana Department of Equality Secretary Aurelia Giacometto, who was also at the March hearing, to respond to Turner’s claims. Giacometto told Coates the agency could get back to her later if she submits her questions in writing.  
Coates expressed some frustration with Giacometto’s lack of response during the hearing. She reiterated that in a phone interview several days later, saying she was “disappointed” LDEQ came to the hearing unprepared to discuss the work it has been doing. 
Giacometto was at the hearing to discuss the agency’s waste tire program. No one from the committee had asked LDEQ to prepare for a discussion on wastewater wetlands, the agency’s communications division said in an email. Coates had not yet sent questions to the agency as of April 13, according to LDEQ. 
Why Louisiana’s wetlands are disappearing
Coastal researchers say one of Louisiana’s greatest environmental threats is coastal erosion. The state has experienced significant deterioration of wetlands along its coast, eroding barrier islands that provide natural hurricane protection, threatening vital habitat for fish and wildlife and losing an ecosystem that absorbs greenhouse gases and is one of the earth’s greatest carbon sinks.
Researchers have found geological evidence that the Mississippi River went through natural cycles of flooding and course meandering prior to the construction of levees. Like the tail of a snake, the river would frequently whip back and forth, changing its position and forming new deltas across the coast roughly every millennium. 
These natural cycles created the wetlands along Louisiana’s coast. The building of levees locked the Mississippi River in place, preventing it from depositing its nutrient-rich freshwater and sediments across the region’s natural coastal plain, according to studies by LSU coastal scientists Harry Roberts and Irv Mendelssohn.  
Through their research, Day and Turner have made significant contributions to science’s general consensus on Louisiana’s land loss, which points to climate change, sea-level rise, hurricanes and various human activities such as oil drilling, canal dredging and perhaps most significantly, the building of levees. 
However, Turner agrees with only part of this theory and has spent much of his research arguing that canal dredging, above all else, is the primary cause of land loss. He points to more than 35,000 canals that have lacerated Louisiana’s coastal wetlands, with massive amounts of soil dredged away for oil and gas operations and shipping lanes.
Turner has positioned himself against the consensus’ view of how to solve Louisiana’s coastal crisis, criticizing river diversion and wetland assimilation projects as costly and ignorant. He has published papers pointing out the large amounts of taxpayer money spent on such work and arguing that backfilling dredged canals is an easier and more cost-effective solution to restore the coast. 
Day agrees that canal dredging has had a detrimental effect on the coast, but he said Turner has taken an extreme position by dismissing all the other causes of wetland loss.

Real or fake
Part of the controversy surrounding Louisiana’s wetland assimilation projects lies in the difference between natural wetlands and artificial ones constructed for sewage assimilation. 
Constructed wetlands are usually contained within a perimeter of concrete walls, making it easier for people to control the exact amount of water and nutrients that enters and exits a system. These engineered areas are used much more commonly around the world to treat wastewater. 
Louisiana is one of few places that sends wastewater effluent to natural wetlands. Florida has a similar program intended to reuse wastewater and, in some capacity, restore wetland health. Both constructed and natural wetlands are used to treat the wastewater, but natural wetlands have stricter monitoring rules and allow smaller amounts of nutrients to be discharged. 
Assimilation wetlands are similar to river diversions but on a smaller and less expensive scale, proponents say. In theory, both methods rebuild wetlands by introducing freshwater, nutrients and sediment into a degrading marsh, encouraging more plants to take root and allowing soil to accumulate over time.
Day and other supporters of natural assimilation wetlands argue resources shouldn’t be spent on expensive artificial wetland systems when those resources can be used to save the state’s natural wetlands.  
With the Mississippi River delta sinking and the sea level rising, Louisiana’s wetlands need to rise at at least the same rate to stop from disappearing, Day said.
Dr. Rachel Hunter, a wetlands ecologist with Comite Resources, said the method provides nutrients and freshwater to a hydrologically isolated wetland.
“So normally, where that water may be stagnant, you’re getting water flowing through the area, and those nutrients and that fresh water will stimulate primary productivity,” Hunter said.
If regulators were to require sewage treatment plants to provide cleaner water for assimilation wastewater, proponents say it could cause the projects to fail. Increasing treatment reduces the amount of sediment pumped into a site to rebuild the land. 
One of the most controversial assimilation sites is the South Slough Wetland just north of Pass Manchac, in Coates’ district. Owned by the city of Hammond, it opened in 2006 and almost immediately generated public suspicion because marsh deterioration occurred at the site the following year, leaving mostly standing water in the area.
The initial deterioration at the Hammond site was attributed to nutria eating the vegetation, but the site rebounded after the project managers killed more than 2,000 nutria there, Day said.
Turner, a natural assimilation wetlands critic, argues wastewater overloaded with nutrients inundates the marsh. That weakens its soil strength and speeds up the rate of plant decomposition, causing wetlands to break apart, he said. 
He dismissed claims that nutria are responsible for destroying new wetlands and doubled down on the unpredictability of a natural wetland making it hard to manage nutrient overload.
“It’s very undefined,” Turner said, adding that without restraints on how effluent enters and leaves the marsh, wastewater nutrients have overloaded the system. 
In his presentation to lawmakers on March 18, he displayed a photo of the site that showed what he said were dying trees and vegetation. Healthier looking vegetation was growing in the adjacent area north of the discharge pipe that does not receive any effluent.
The picture was taken in 2009, however, and Day accused Turner of using an outdated photograph and said he hasn’t cited any data to show that effluent or nutrients are being affected by a lack of artificial containment structures. 
The Illuminator visited the South Slough Wetland on March 20 and 25 and took drone photographs that show what appears to be thriving vegetation in the assimilation site, in contrast to mostly brown vegetation in the area north of the pipeline that does not receive wastewater. Proponents say this is a sign of the project’s success.

Where wastewater goes
Those on either side of the issue can present convincing arguments, but often lost in the debate is what might happen if the projects are shuttered.
Charles Borchers IV, Hammond’s director of administration, said the opponents of the assimilation site never talk about alternatives for disposing the city’s treated wastewater.
“A lot of people don’t understand where wastewater goes after they flush their toilet … It has to go somewhere,” Borchers said. “It’s not like it just sits at the wastewater treatment plant and just goes away.”
If not for the assimilation wetland, the city would be discharging its wastewater into a river, lake or some other body of water, he said. 
Borchers was also upset when he learned lawmakers had a hearing in which Hammond’s project was criticized and no one was there to defend it. Like Day and Hunter, city officials only learned about the hearing when they received calls from the Illuminator.  
“The city’s position is that the science is on our side,” Borchers said.
He considers the site healthy and growing and said the city has its own scientist who monitors the water quality and reports the data to LDEQ on a regular basis. 
“You can go to Google Earth and look at that area evolve over time,” Borchers said. “It’s got more vegetation, and it’s more green now than it was in 2005.”
Turner, the Louisiana Wildlife Federation and Ponchartrain Conservancy called for a full review of the natural wetland assimilation program at the legislative meeting in March, urging LDEQ to discontinue permits for natural wetlands assimilation projects. Day supported the idea of a review, saying the science supports the projects.
“I’m all in favor of it, but let’s have full involvement of everybody in there,” Day said.

Connecticut produces more trash than it can handle.
Nearly three years after dousing the flames at the state’s largest waste incinerator, officials are still searching for way to deal with the mess created by the thousands of tons of trash local residents produce each day.
For the most part, the trash that was once burned to create electricity and ash at the Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority in Hartford is now being placed onto tractor-trailers and rail cars and shipped hundreds of miles away to landfills in Pennsylvania and Ohio — a costly and ecologically-damaging solution that has many critics and few fans.
And while state officials have reported some progress getting people to divert things like food scraps and plastic bottles out of the waste stream, the scale of Connecticut’s trash problem has only grown.
MIRA’s closure in 2022 resulted in 640,000 tons of trash being sent out of state that year. By the next year, Connecticut was exporting 41% of all its municipal solid waste, roughly 940,000 tons of trash, according to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
Connecticut isn’t the only state exporting its trash. With limited space in Midwestern landfills, the state’s municipalities and haulers are facing rising rates to ship trash beyond its borders. Those costs get passed along to Connecticut residents through taxes and collection fees, according to DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes. 
“It is escalating and it’s going to escalate over time,” Dykes said. “The crisis is in the sense that we need to take urgent action, because developing new programs, new solutions to regain self sufficiency and replace that disposal capacity that the MIRA plan represented, takes time.”

Finding — and funding — a plan
The trash problem has also befuddled state lawmakers, who have been largely unsuccessful in their efforts to pass a long-term solution.
Two years ago, municipal leaders objected to a proposal by Gov. Ned Lamont that would have charged cities and towns up to $5 for every ton of trash they ship out of state, in order to raise money to help build new facilities capable of handling trash within the state. Instead, lawmakers settled on a plan to authorize up to $500 million in bonding, through the Connecticut Green Bank, should the state ever settle on a plan to build a new waste-to-energy facility. That money remains unspent.
The latest attempt to address the issue this year, House Bill 6917, takes a more modest approach.
The legislation would charge a fee of $1.50 on every ton of waste shipped out of state. Currently, that fee is only being applied to waste that is burned at the state’s four remaining waste-to-energy facilities. In addition, it removes language within state law that diverts up to $2.8 million collected each year from those existing fees into the state’s general fund. Instead, all of that money would go to a sustainable materials management account where it is earmarked for local waste-reduction projects.
“What we’re trying to do in this bill is actually to get parity between waste that’s processed in and out of state, so that we get a bit more money into that program,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, who is leading the legislature’s efforts on waste this session as co-chair of the Environment Committee.
The bill would also require that large producers of food waste — including supermarkets, wholesalers, food manufacturers and conference centers — adopt their own written policy for the donation of excess food, further reducing what they throw away.
“We’re going backwards, right?”Julianna Larue, the Sierra Club
Critics of the legislation, however, argue that adding fees wouldn’t serve as an incentive to handle trash in-state if there’s nowhere to put it. Beyond Connecticut’s existing waste-to-energy facilities, recycling centers and a handful of composting options, the state has no permanent, active landfills accepting household trash.
“You’re trying to collect money. Let’s have a plan first, and then we can talk about about funding that plan,” said Brian O’Connor, the director of public policy for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. “There’s no long-term strategy from [DEEP] at this point.”
In written testimony filed on an early version of the bill, Lewis Dubuque of the National Waste and Recycling Association questioned whether the fee would be applied to other materials beyond municipal solid waste that are disposed of at incinerators or shipped out of state. 
“In any event, such a fee will naturally be passed on to the customer and, given the claims that the disposal of material is becoming more expensive in challenging fiscal times, the NWRA questions why the imposition of a new fee on the consumer is warranted,” Dubuque said. Dubuque did not respond to multiple requests for additional comment.
For environmental advocates, the bill represents an initial step toward reducing the amount of trash being shipped across state lines to slowly decompose in a landfill, which many see as the worst possible solution. 
“If you think about diesel trucks and how much greenhouse gas emissions they’re emitting every single day driving from central Connecticut to Ohio and Pennsylvania, that is a significant amount of carbon dioxide, and it’s not moving us towards our our climate change goals that we set for ourselves,” said Julianna Larue, an organizer with the Sierra Club. “We’re going backwards, right?”
In addition to the climate considerations, residents who live in the vicinity of those landfills have said they’re fed up dealing with the smell. In some cases they’ve even pushed to close the facilities.
Lawmakers are also weighing other proposals this session intended to reduce the amount of waste produced in Connecticut and the associated environmental impacts.
House Bill 6229 would ban single-use plastics and polystyrene containers, which critics argue clog up the waste stream, starting in 2026. Past efforts to ban or phase out those plastics have failed in the face of opposition from the restaurant and hospitality industry. Another, Senate Bill 80, seeks to place tougher standards on the burning of medical waste following complaints from residents living close to a waste-to-energy facility in Bristol.
All three bills have passed out of the Environment Committee and are either awaiting fiscal review or have been referred to the Appropriations Committee. 
Parker said he expects H.B. 6917 to generate between $1 million and $3 million a year for waste diversion efforts. That’s far less than what Lamont’s original 2023 legislation would have raised — an estimated $11 million. 
“The truth is that some of these projects, you know, cost a lot of money,” Parker said. “We’re going to be reasonable about what’s going to be funded here. It’s not going to be the be-all, end-all to the solution.”

Pilot programs
Barring a plan to build any major new waste-processing facilities in Connecticut, efforts to confront the trash problem have mostly focused on getting specific items such as food scraps and plastic out of the waste stream.
To that end, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection last month awarded $15 million in grants to nine municipalities to fund infrastructure projects related to recycling and composting.
In New Haven, for example, the city plans to build a new $3.3 million sorting facility at the transfer station, within the footprint of the old incinerator.
Starting in 2027, officials will distribute colored, biodegradable trash bags to residents on local garbage routes, instructing those residents to fill the bags with compostable materials like leftover scraps of food or coffee grounds. The bags will be picked up from curbside bins along with other garbage on trash day, then taken to the local sorting station. Once sorted, the organic waste will be sent off to a digester facility to be turned into biogas, and, eventually, compost.
The goal, officials say, is to divert roughly one-fifth of the city’s residential trash — the heavy, soggy and dense food scraps — away from Connecticut’s overloaded municipal waste stream.
“Most of the trash here … goes to Bridgeport and is burned,” Mayor Justin Elicker said during a press conference announcing the project earlier this month. “That is clearly not the best solution for compostable materials that could be used for such better purposes.”
If it is successful, New Haven’s program will follow on the heels of larger cities such as New York which began a mandatory composting program on April 1.

In an attempt to encourage towns to find innovative ways to reduce their solid waste stream, lawmakers created the sustainable materials management account in 2022. Since then, the program has awarded about $5.2 million in funding for local pilot programs focused on organics diversion and pricing models that charge residents based on the amount of trash they throw away.
Some of those pilots have already concluded with DEEP officials reporting promising results. Between 2021 and 2023, Connecticut saw a 368% increase in food scrap diversion, with 37,549 tons of waste sent for composting in the latter year.
Several towns including Middletown, Woodbury, Madison, Kent and others have also opted to continue their program beyond the pilot period, according to DEEP. 
Speaking to reporters in New Haven last month, Dykes said lessons from those pilots informed state officials as they were reviewing applications for the most recent round of infrastructure grants — which included the New Haven sorting facility, a food-waste collection program in Manchester and a commercial-scale composting facility in southeastern Connecticut. In addition to the nine projects that were selected for funding, Dykes said a dozen other applications were submitted.
“It just goes to show how many communities and municipalities are really leaning into finding these solutions and want to implement common-sense solutions to recycle and divert organics,” Dykes said. “And so we’re hopeful that this will just be the beginning of more funding rounds.”
Still, some officials overseeing the handling of municipal waste say that local grant-funded programs do not go far enough to address the full scale of the state’s waste issues.
Jennifer Heaton-Jones, the executive director of western Connecticut’s Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority, said that lawmakers needed to take a more “holistic” approach to addressing the issue including better education campaigns, requiring towns to offer access to food scrap diversion programs and expanding capacity to handle waste locally. 
“This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior and making better decisions about material management, from their homes to the curb to the transfer station,” she said. 
Heaton-Jones did praise some aspects of the legislation drafted by lawmakers this year, including $500,000 to help DEEP enforce a law requiring large producers of food waste to utilize composting facilities and $250,000 to support an informational campaign run by the Recycle CT Foundation.
“I feel like we’re not going to solve the waste issue with the state, obviously, with this bill,” Heaton-Jones said. “I mean, there’s some good things in it… but we need more than that.”
H.B. 6917 also requires that DEEP study the feasibility of a proposal to make the manufacturers of consumer packaging pay for some or all of the costs of handling that material once it’s thrown away — also known as extended producer responsibility. Connecticut has EPR programs in place for hard-to-recycle items such as mattresses, tires and mercury thermostats, and advocates argue that the ubiquitous presence of packaging in the waste stream has exacerbated the state’s existing trash problems.
“This is about residents of the state of Connecticut changing their behavior .”Jennifer Heaton-Jones, Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority
That proposal, even as a study, drew objections from waste haulers and recyclers who argued DEEP should first update its nearly decade-old survey of all the material that ends up in Connecticut’s waste stream.
The ranking Republican on the Environment Committee, state Rep. Pat Callahan, R-New Fairfield, echoed those concerns at a meeting last month when he said lawmakers should wait for the results of a new assessment before they “figure out what further work needs to be done.”
To address some of those concerns, Parker said the language in the bill was adjusted to postpone the packaging study by a year, so it would coincide with DEEP‘s next waste characterization study.
“The big picture is we’re just continuing to move this conversation forward,” Parker said, calling the bill “a work in progress.”
State Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, compared the current crisis to the situation facing Connecticut in the late 1980s, when she served as chair of the Environment Committee. At the time, aging landfills such as Hartford’s notorious “Mount Trashmore” served as eyesores and sources of pollution in local drinking water.
To close the landfills, Connecticut implemented a mandatory recycling law in 1991 and partnered with private companies to build its network of waste-to-energy facilities with enough capacity to burn as much trash as the state could produce, without needing to import more trash from elsewhere to stay profitable.
Lawmakers also established a $1-per-ton fee — later raised to $1.50 — on trash sent to those facilities to support their continued operations. That system, she said, worked for nearly three decades until the age of the facilities and the diversion of revenues from fees into the state’s general fund caused them to close or reduce their output.
By expanding the fee to trash shipped out of state and using it to fund compost and recycling programs, Mushinsky said she believes Connecticut can again reach a point where it can handle whatever trash is left over, whether through waste-to-energy incineration or some other emerging technology.
“It’s not rocket science, you just need money to do it,” Mushinsky said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0410_SR_TrashCenter_127-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-13 05:01:58.449526

On my desk is a printing block from one of the Little Blue Books, produced in the millions by the Haldeman-Julius plant in Girard, Kansas. It’s a chunk of metal and wood, and it still has black ink crusted around its reverse characters. Numbered 1020 in the series and used to print the title page of a 1926 essay by iconoclast botanist Luther Burbank, the block is a piece of history speaking from the dead but not yet distant past.
It is a bit of permanence in an increasingly ethereal world of thought.
More on that later.
I picked up the printing block during my first year or so as a reporter for the Pittsburg Morning Sun, a small daily in Southeast Kansas. I don’t recall exactly where the block came from, but I likely bought it at some yard sale, because in those days it wasn’t uncommon to find jetsam from the old Haldeman-Julius publishing empire.
Beginning in 1919, the plant began churning out the Little Blue Books for mail-order at a few cents each, a “university in print.” The little books were the creation of Emanuel Julius, who was just 26 when he stepped off the train at Girard. An Eastern intellectual and writer with no formal education, and the second generation of an immigrant Ukrainian Jewish family, Julius must have seemed an odd character to the town’s residents. As a reporter, he had covered the New York Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, in which 146 mostly immigrant workers died. Now he had come to join the staff of The Appeal to Reason, the largest socialist newspaper in the country.
I remember local historian Gene DeGruson first telling me the story of the Appeal to Reason, and of the coal mining area’s rich history of socialism. The newspaper was founded by J.A. Wayland, who had relocated the weekly from Kansas City, Missouri, to cut costs.  Socialism was a significant American movement from its roots in the utopian communities of the 19th century through the presidential campaigns of Eugene V. Debs, who was convicted and imprisoned for sedition late in life. During World War I, the socialist movement — which had been strongly anti-military — began to wane.
Meanwhile, Emanuel Julius had married Marcet Haldeman, the free-thinking, wealthy and writerly daughter of a local banker. At the suggestion of Marcet’s aunt, the social reformer Jane Addams, the couple hyphenated their names.
In 1917, the Appeal was sold to Emanual and Marcet Haldeman-Julius, and the couple reimagined the newspaper for a new progressive era. Emanuel also embarked on a publishing venture that he had thought about since he was a teenager and “The Ballad of Reading Gaol” had sustained him during a cold winter’s day. His goal was to bring classics of literature to the masses in pocket-sized editions at an affordable price. In 1919, the Haldeman-Julius plant began publishing the little books. They originally had red covers, but eventually Haldeman-Julius settled on blue covers, and Oscar Wilde’s long poem would become No. 2 in the series.
The price? A nickel. By mail order.
The Little Blue Books, which preceded mass market paperbacks by a decade or two, were an unqualified success. They were carried in the pockets of hobos, working people, and aspiring writers from Saul Bellow to Louis L’Amour. E. Haldeman-Julius bolstered the classic (and royalty-free) books with new material and often used suggestive or shocking titles for appeal. No. 1402, by Arkansas socialist Clay Fulks, is “How I Went to the Devil.” No. 907, by researcher William J. Fielding, is “Sexual Obsessions of Saints and Mystics.” Collectively, the little books sold in the hundreds of millions, making E. and Marcet Haldeman-Julius not only rich, but also famous.
The couple collaborated on an ambitious set of literary projects, including the novel “Dust.” Published in 1921 by Brentano’s, New York, the work was hailed as an important work of American realistic fiction.
In his 2017 biography of E. Haldeman-Julius, historian R. Alton Lee argues that from 1920 to 1950, Girard was the “literary and publishing Mecca of the United States, and thus the international center for Western civilization.” At the height of his success, E. Haldeman-Julius knew every major author, many of the minor ones, and even if the important political figures of the day didn’t speak to him directly, they read his books. His life, Lee said, was full of scandal, disappointment, and ultimately tragedy.
What E. Haldeman-Julius left behind was a publishing and marketing revolution that changed us, a revolution that made available to every working man and woman the greatest thinkers of every age, including their own. The evidence is in the printing plates and the millions of books they produced, which are collected and catalogued by universities but which you can still find at yard sales across the country.
I was reminded of the value of non-volatile media the other day when I went to a used vinyl record store in Lawrence and redeemed a gift certificate from a friend. The place was not quaint, but authentic. The ancient floors creaked underfoot, and a shop cat roamed at will. One of the things I found was something I hadn’t realized I needed: a 1966 LP entitled “Whistle Echoes of the Ohio and Mississippi River Steamboats, Vol. 2.” One of my current writing projects is about a steamboat plying rivers of the American West.
The record has such treasures as “the plaintive call of the KATIE STOCKDALE” and the steam calliope of the “DELTA QUEEN.” The album features extensive notes, including this: “The joy of this record is that the performers who blow the whistles, sing the songs and play the music are exuberant rivermen and shore watchers along the willow-fringed winding channels of the Mississippi River System.”
Yes, I am such a research nerd that this $3 LP was the cherry on top of a good day. There was pleasure holding it in my hands, of reading the copy, of not having to deal with a menu or a scroll bar to navigate its secrets. But there was something else that occurred to me on the drive home.
There were no advertisements jiggling on the screen, no pop-ups to block, and no algorithm attempting to predict what I was most likely to buy or click on next. I had found the album by good old-fashioned browsing, not the kind you do on a device. I did not have to fight unseen agents attempting to steer my attention to other products, other sites, other candidates.
It felt like freedom.
The album was inviolable.
Like a newspaper or a magazine or a book, the album could be crushed or shredded or burned, but short of destruction its contents could not easily be altered. As we venture further into our current dystopian landscape, I suspect this resistance to alteration will prove an advantage. In past weeks, government websites have been scrubbed to conform to political orthodoxy. The malleable nature of the web makes it easy to remove historical references that might fall under the forbidden category of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Mentions of transgender and queer people were struck, for example, from a National Park Service web page for the Stonewall monument in New York.
Such straightwashing is mandated by executive order.
For better or worse, we live in a digital age, and our perception of reality is created by what appears on our screens. It is appalling to us now that the government is scrubbing official content in this way, but I suspect we could acclimate quickly. There are, of course, archives that store past versions of web pages, but browsing is difficult. You have to know what you’re looking for. Think your digital content is safe? You can’t even archive your Kindle library anymore, because Amazon now prevents downloads to your computer of the books you’ve already bought. Your content automatically changes to reflect updates — or deletions. We don’t own digital content, we just rent it.
If you want to keep something, you’d better buy the actual book.
Making a connection with a physical book is a reminder that you and it are of the world. There is comfort in the feel and smell and heft of books, new and old. They were our first mass medium and they remain vital in communicating important, world-changing ideas. Most of us can readily name the handful of books that shaped our lives. Near the top of my list is 1975’s “The Monkey Wrench Gang.”
Yes,  this seems an old-fashioned idea, this longing for physical media, and just what you’d expect from a writer who advocates for AM radio and old stereo receivers. But the danger posed by cultural amnesia is real, and social media has far too much influence on current politics.
Barbara F. Walters, author of “How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them,” has said that since social media emerged in 2010, the number of global democracies have decreased. To help prevent civil wars, she said, social media should be regulated. It’s not that people shouldn’t be allowed to post whatever they want, she argues, but that tech companies shouldn’t be allowed to push extreme material to wide audiences.
“People ask me: ‘What’s the single easiest thing that the United States could do to reduce our risk of civil war?’ And my answer is always the same,” she said in an interview cited by Business Insider. “Regulate social media.”
The history of mass media has always been turbulent, right back to the invention of the printing press and the explosion of literacy that created the modern world. In many ways, the challenges we face today are similar, but with a significant difference: The Gutenberg revolution did not have unseen agents behind each page manipulating readers for attention. A thirst for knowledge was motivation enough to turn each page.
We have failed to use new technologies responsibly — both as creators and as consumers. Never mind the easy access to pornography, as that has been with us at the start of just about every media revolution. No, it’s the malleability of new media that invites authoritarians to purge or discourage “improper ideology” that is the real danger.
If we cannot stem the shifting sand of new media, we will be buried by it.
I don’t know what E. Haldeman-Julius would make of our current situation, but I’ll bet he would recruit the best writers to offer commentary. In his time, he had Will Durant and Upton Sinclair in his stable. Perhaps in a future time a scholar will sift through the digital remains of our age and note a few voices still worth listening to, even on something as old-fashioned as a Web page.
The undoing of E. Haldeman-Julius began in February 1948, when a couple of small-time crooks broke into the printing plant in Girard. The thieves, Raymond Lee and his older brother, Joseph, found a tin can in which Haldeman-Julius had hidden $40,218 in currency and silver. That would be like stealing half a million in today’s money.
Haldeman-Julius reported the theft to the police. He was then investigated for tax fraud, because he had claimed an income of far less in preceding years. During his trial, in 1951, his defense attorney claimed his self-taught client knew little about accounting. “Nobody but a writer,” the Associated Press reported the attorney as saying, “would keep $40,000 in a tin can safe.”
Haldeman-Julius was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to six months in prison. He and Marcet had divorced in 1933; she died eight years later, age 51. Emanuel married Susan Haney, a secretary in the publishing office.
Out on bond while awaiting appeal, Haldeman-Julius was found dead in the swimming pool of his home July 31, 1951. He was 62. Unlike Gatsby, he had died of natural causes. The age of the Little Blue Books had passed, but the printing plant in Girard kept limping along until 1978, when a presumed bottle rocket burned it to the ground.
The Haldeman-Julius legacy remains, an inviolable record for future generations. Scattered in university collections and the homes and minds and hearts of the curious and the bookish, it endures as a testament to where we’ve been. The canon is both sacred and profane, trash and treasure, a curious mix of socialism and capitalism.
In other words, it’s like us. Who we were — and who we are now, and what we hope to become — is worth preserving. No matter how much others may want us to forget.
Some things are worth holding on to.

If you’re upset with ICE’s deportations, isn’t your anger better directed at them?","Connecticut’s favorite local airline, Avelo, is in trouble for making a strategic business decision: taking a long-term contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to fly deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security.
Starting in May they’re dedicating three of their 20 737 jets to fly from Mesa, Ariz. to destinations both in the U.S. and overseas (presumably flying over the “Gulf of America”) possibly even heading to El Salvador to deliver deportees to prisons there. 


The public reaction, while understandable, is misplaced.
Avelo has enjoyed amazing success flying out of New Haven’s Tweed airport, growing from 50,000 passengers in 2019 to a current 600,000 happy flyers. They fly to 31 different destinations and have recently added flights from Bradley International airport.
The convenience of flying from a local airport and the super-low fares have made Avelo immensely popular, so the deal with ICE has some fans upset. It’s almost as if Patagonia took a contract to design prison guard uniforms: it’s way “off brand.”
But remember, Avelo is a common carrier airline. Their business is flying planes, not passing judgement on passengers or destinations.
They’ve flown hundreds of charter flights for everything from sports teams to tour groups. They’ve even flown deportation flights for ICE during the Biden administration… and nobody complained.
In fact, Avelo started as a charter airline, Casino Express (later renamed as Xtra Airlines), ferrying gamblers to Nevada. They even provided charters for the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016. This is their business: flying.
Avelo has been receiving financial support from the state in the form of a tax exemption on its aviation fuel. The City of New Haven has been fawning over them as a hometown success story (even though the airline is officially headquartered in Texas). But all that has now changed.
Now there are calls for a passenger boycott and financial penalties. But hey… isn’t this anger misplaced?
If you’re upset with ICE’s deportations, isn’t your anger better directed at them? Where are the legal appeals? Penalizing or boycotting Avelo won’t stop the deportations. 
There are many U.S.-flagged airlines taking the ICE charter contracts, including the reinvented Eastern Airlines which converted a 767 used for the New England Patriots to handle deportations to Brazil and Venezuela.
Avelo says this deal with ICE was a business decision. Though profitable, Avelo (like other no-frills airlines) pinches pennies. They don’t fly everywhere, every day… only on the heavier travel days when they can pack their planes and make a buck.
Taking on the ICE charters, they say, is a way of subsidizing their low fares as we face an economic recession and keeping their employees on payroll. In fact, they’re looking to hire new flight attendants for their Mesa, Ariz. operations, paying $28 an hour.
If protesters would “read the room” they’d realize that many of Avelo’s passengers probably support the deportations. After all, President Trump is only doing what he promised and what got him elected.
As I’ve said before, Americans deserve the government they elect.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SRR_Avelo-protest040925_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-13 05:01:58.449526

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia lawmakers wrapped up the legislative session Saturday, completing action on 247 of the 2,460 bills that were introduced over 60 days. 
Overall, the 2025 legislative session was marked by party disagreements within the GOP supermajority as well as tension between lawmakers and Gov. Patrick Morrisey. Lawmakers and Morrisey first disagreed on whether the state was facing a $400 million budget deficit, then many of his priority bills were shot down.
Despite that, in a news release hours before sine die, Morrisey said his agenda was approved by the West Virginia Legislature. 
“When I took office just three months ago, I promised to address West Virginia’s challenges head on, bringing the type of change that moves the needle and invigorates our state,” the Republican governor said.
Morrisey’s State of the State address — as well as multiple executive orders levied in his first few days in office — gave lawmakers pretty clear insight into what policy priorities — like religious exemptions to the state’s strict childhood vaccine laws and a ban on diversity programs in state government — the new governor wanted to see passed in his first legislative session.
But getting those policies across the finish line proved challenging and, in some cases, unsuccessful. 
Swift action on ‘defining gender’ bill
The GOP-led Legislature swiftly passed Morrisey’s bill that will for the first time define the terms “man” and “woman” in state code by a person’s biological sex. It was the first priority to make it the governor’s desk, and he held a ceremonial bill signing with former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines, who has spoken out against trans women in sports. 
The measure, Senate Bill 456, will also restrict transgender individuals’ access to spaces like bathrooms or locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
There is no empirical evidence to support claims that trans people commit harassment or assault against others when using bathrooms or facilities that align with their gender identity. Instead, people who are trans are more likely to be victims of such attacks when forced to use facilities that don’t match their gender identity.
Certificate of Need repeal dies early 
Morrisey’s push for repealing the Certificate of Need process in the state died early in the session when the House Committee on Health and Human Resources — on Feb. 24 — voted against House Bill 2007, meaning it never went to the floor for a full vote.
HB 2007 was one of the first tests for Morrisey’s influence in the Legislature, and specifically among members of the House. Several lawmakers who held concerns about repealing the certificate of need process told members of the media, in interviews and elsewhere, that they did not appreciate the strategies employed by the governor and his staff while they attempted to whip votes in support of the legislation.
“[Completely repealing CON] is one of the governor’s priority bills, but the governor is trying to, for lack of better words, force people to vote his way just because it’s his way and sending people around, pulling people out of committees to talk to them, to try to get them to switch their vote — we’ve gotten off to a bad start,” said Del. Scot Heckert, R-Wood, said on HD Media’s Outside the Echo Chamber in February. “… When you start telling people what to do ‘or else’ — especially West Virginia people — that doesn’t go very well.”
A month later, Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, attempted to discharge the bill from the Health Committee and to the House floor. After a brief fight over rules and constitutionality of that motion, the full House voted in support of discharging the bill. Ultimately, however, members voted 74-16, effectively killing repeal of CON a second and final time this session.
Meanwhile, the Senate never moved on their version of a bill to do the same.
Childhood vaccines most controversial issue this session
Like CON, Morrisey’s attempt to water down the state’s vaccine requirements petered out, dealing another blow to the governor’s list of priorities.
SBl 460 would have allowed religious exemptions for the state’s school vaccine requirements and revised the process by which families get medical exemptions for the requirements. 
The Senate passed the bill with a vote of 20-2, but the House of Delegates voted it down 42 to 56. The Senate Health Committee earlier this week amended the language of the bill into HB 2776, which requires the state to report positive tests for Alpha-gal, a tickborne allergic condition, to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amendment was withdrawn Thursday. 
The state has been one of only five that allow only medical exemptions to school immunization requirements. Morrisey issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office. The state health department has said it will comply with Morrisey’s executive order even though the Legislature didn’t pass the bill. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion ban passed in final minutes 
The bill to ban nearly all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in West Virginia state government passed the House and Senate in the final hours of the session, with the Senate making its final decision on the bill with less than minutes to go Saturday night. 
SB 474, which is the legislative side of an executive order posed by Morrisey that bans offering specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex. It’s reflective of a trend spearheaded by Republicans nationwide meant to undermine and end DEI in all its forms. 
The bill only applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education. 
It passed the state Senate 32-2 on March 26, when Republican proponents for it alleged that such services shouldn’t exist because “we don’t need [them] anymore.” They said that while issues like racism may be real, they are no longer a problem in West Virginia. Systemic racism and sexism, however, are unequivocally still present in West Virginia and the United States as a whole.
When the bill came up for consideration in the House on Saturday evening, there were 27 amendments — 24 filed by Democrats and three from Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, were pending on the legislation — awaiting consideration. After hours of going through the amendments the House eventually signed off on the legislation.
When the Senate went to concur on the House’s amendments, Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, filed multiple amendments on the bill, but the Senate enacted unclear parliamentary procedures to side-step the typical process of taking up amendments. Garcia and Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, attempted to speak on the bill but their efforts were blocked. 
The Senate passed the bill in the last 10 minutes of the session. Garcia and Woelfel voted no on the measure.
Bill for microgrids, data centers sparks long debates
HB 2014, which would create a certified microgrid program in the state for data centers that lawmakers hope will locate here, was a late addition to Morrisey’s legislative agenda. The bill was introduced by request of Morrisey on March 18 — more than halfway through the 2025 regular session. 
The bill was subject to dozens of amendments as it made its way through both the House and the Senate, including changes to how taxes collected on data centers would be distributed, policies regarding how microgrids would operate and requirements for those microgrids as well as other utilities. The bill initially passed the House on April 1. After more changes in the Senate, lawmakers there approved their version on April 11.
Those who voted against HB 2014 in both chambers shared concerns over the potential for electric rate increases if the bill were to pass. They also voiced discontent with measures that removed local control and enforcement of certain regulations for counties and municipalities where data centers could be built.
On the last night of session, even more adjustments came in the legislation, which changed the tax structure for any data centers that are located in West Virginia, among other things.
The two chambers did find compromise on that version of the bill, with the House passing the amended version 82-16 with two members absent and not voting. The Senate concurred with the House’s changes to the legislation Saturday evening and voted yet again to pass the legislation, sending it to Morrisey’s desk for signage.
The Legislature also completed legislation on SB 458, which allows licensed and certified professionals to practice in West Virginia without taking additional examinations to attain local licensure or certification. Morrisey signed the bill, calling it a “huge step forward to make West Virginia more competitive, attract jobs and workers, and grow opportunities for both current and future residents.”
Lawmakers approve Morrisey’s classroom cell phone ban
In his State of State, Morrisey called for teacher pay raises as West Virginia’s public school teachers are the least paid in the nation. He never requested a bill that could have implemented a raise. 
He did, however, push a measure passed by both chambers, HB 2003, that would limit the use of personal electronic devices like cell phones in school classrooms during instructional time. If counties permit students to bring a cell phone on school property, counties are tasked with developing their own policies. Students may be required to store the devices in containers or pouches provided by the county.
Lawmakers also passed HB2755 that would give lawmakers the ability to review or challenge West Virginia Board of Education polices — even though citizens soundly rejected that in a statewide vote in 2022. Opponents of the legislation have said it is unconstitutional and likely to be challenged before the state Supreme Court. 
Another high-profile education measure, SB 199, would bolster elementary school teachers’ ability to remove disruptive and violent students passed the Senate and House. The measure, two years in the making, was a top request from West Virginia teachers who said worsening student behavior — particularly among the state’s youngest learners — impeded their ability to teach. 
Other bills

 Bills targeted election fraud, voting


Numerous bills relating to campaigns and elections, as well as governmental functions generally, were considered by lawmakers this session. Some related to financing in elections while others implemented changes on how residents can vote and who, under certain terms, is allowed to run for office.
The state is poised to tighten its laws on acceptable forms of photo identification that can be used at West Virginia polling places. HB 3016, meant to address voter fraud and bolster secure elections, would require a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. 
Lawmakers completed legislation on SB 50, requiring municipalities to hold their elections on the same date as statewide elections, on Saturday night. In the final version, cities would have until 2032 to align their elections with those by the state. 
They also enacted SB 490, which prohibits rank-choice voting in the state. The bill was marked by Republican Secretary of State Kris Warner as a priority for his office before session began in February, even though rank-choice voting does not occur in the state..
A bill regarding absentee ballots — HB 2117 — died after passing in the House when the Senate did not take it up. The bill would have set a deadline of 7:30 p.m. on Election Day for absentee ballots to be received and prohibited people or entities from sending absentee ballot applications to people who did not ask for them.
And — in a rare move this session — Republican lawmakers in the House joined with Democrats in rejecting HB 2719, which would have allowed businesses and corporations in the state to directly donate up to $2,800 to political candidates. The body voted 54-41 against the bill. 
HB 3412, a bill that would have revised the state’s Freedom of Information Act, passed in both chambers, but died after the House of Delegates did not take up a message to concur on the Senate’s changes to the legislation. 

 Most foster care, substance abuse bills died


There were a number of foster care bills, many a year in the making, that were meant to address widespread problems in the state’s overburdened child welfare system currently serving more than 6,000 kids.
The majority of those measures never made it up for a vote or failed to complete legislative action, but HB 2880 – an omnibus bill that brought together several foster care measures — passed the House and Senate through negotiations Saturday night. A part of the bill would create a “Parent Resource Navigator” to assist a parent to be unified or reunified with their child. 
A slew of bills were introduced this year that would have drastically changed what services are available to people who use drugs or who are in recovery from substance use disorder. 
Despite early movement, most of those ended up stalling out in committees without being taken up for serious consideration — including two bills to ban and limit syringe service programs, a bill to ban opioid treatment programs and add a tax to lifesaving Narcan in order to fund a “tip line” for people who provide tips that allow law enforcement to prosecute trafficking crimes.
Perhaps the most impactful piece of drug legislation that was adopted this year was SB 196, which introduces mandatory minimum sentences into state code for transporting cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into West Virginia. The bill also removes alternative sentencing options — like probation or home confinement — for those who are jailed on those charges.
The legislation was adopted by the Senate on March 11. Lawmakers in the House amended the bill, changing how drugs would be weighed to determine penalties and also removing a provision saying someone would have to be aware of fentanyl being present in their drugs to be charged under certain parts of the code. The amended version passed the House on April 11 and the Senate accepted the House’s changes to the law the next day.  
While abortion in the state is already illegal except in rare circumstances, the Senate passed SB 85, which would have targeted out-of-state health care providers and others who send abortion-causing medication to people in West Virginia, except when it’s legal. The bill died after the House of Delegates did not take it up. 
The House Health and Human Resources Committee considered but never passed HB 2350, which would have prohibited food stamp recipients from using their benefits to purchase soft drinks and candy.
Morrisey signed a bill that will ban a list of artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in grocery stores or in school lunches. The measure, HB 2354 received heavy pushback from the food and beverage industry, who say it will raise prices for many drinks and shelf-stable foods. The ban on dyes in school food is set to take effect in August, and the rest of the ban will take effect in 2028. 

 Camping ban bill failed 


An attempt to pass a statewide camping ban aimed at homeless people failed after the Senate moved HB 2382 to the rules committee and never put it back on the calendar for a vote. The legislation passed in the House with a 89 to 9 vote. 
The bill, which wasn’t a priority for Morrisey, would have imposed fines of up to $500 and up to 30 days in jail for people who use camping paraphernalia — including tarps, cots, beds, sleeping bags, blankets, mattresses, hammocks or portable cooking facilities and similar equipment — on governmental or public property, grounds or lawns. 
The Senate Health Committee considered but never passed SB 614, which would have allowed pharmacists in the state to sell ivermectin for human use over the counter and without a prescription. The bill hinged upon the federal Food and Drug Administration approving the drug — which is commonly prescribed for animals to treat some parasites — for human use in wider circumstances than currently allowed.  

 Weakening child labor laws


The Legislature completed legislation on SB 427, which would repeal the requirement that 14- and 15-year-olds seeking employment have a work permit.
The minimum legal age to work in West Virginia is 14. Current state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent. Under the bill, employers seeking to hire the teenagers would be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. Proponents of the legislation say it simplifies the process for teens seeking employment. Opponents say that work permits are important to help ensure compliance with child labor laws.

Anitra Hamilton, D-Monongalia, gave a passionate speech about diversity, equity and inclusion during the final night of the legislative session on the House floor on Saturday, April 12, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett |West Virginia Legislative Photography)Through what Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, called “dirty tricks” in the last 30 minutes of the 2025 regular session, Republican lawmakers in the Senate passed a bill Saturday to ban nearly all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state of West Virginia.
The bill passed the House at 10:41 p.m. after nearly three hours of debate.
When the bill advanced to the Senate, 13 amendments from Garcia appeared to be pending on the legislation. 
Then, confusion reigned.
Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, made a motion to suspend legislative Joint Rule 3 — a rule that governs how amendments to amendments and disagreements are handled between the two legislative chambers. That motion was adopted and the Senate then concurred with and passed the House’s version of the bill 31-2 without any consideration of Garcia’s amendments.
After a short break — and as several attorneys and the chamber’s parliamentarian gathered at Senate President Randy Smith’s podium — Tarr withdrew his initial motion to suspend legislative Joint Rule 3 due to a technical error. The vote would need to be done again.
Another member then moved the previous question to consider the Joint Rule 3 motion again and concur with and pass the House’s version of Senate Bill 474. Again, the Senate voted 31-2 approving the bill.
As motion after confusing motion was considered, the microphones for both Garcia and Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell — the lone no votes on the bill — were muted while they attempted to call points of order on Tarr’s motions as well as Smith’s rulings.
In an interview after the chaos, Smith, R-Preston, said he also didn’t quite understand the legislative procedures that led to the passage of SB 474. His job, he said, is to preside over the body and the process, but other people tell him what is within the rules and not.
“This was a procedure I’ve never seen in my 13 years in the House or the Senate,” Smith said “… We have a parliamentarian who knows the rules very well, probably better than anybody in the Senate. Sen. Tarr knows the procedure very well … As far as I’m concerned, as the procedure and rules, everything was in order.”
If it wasn’t, Smith said, someone will need to challenge the law’s legitimacy in court. But for now, it heads to Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s desk for approval.
Garcia, in an interview after the Senate adjourned Sine Die for the session, said he believed there is a “legal deficiency” in the legislation.
“I have questions whether this bill actually did pass,” Garcia said. “… [Republicans in the Senate] will take short cuts, break rules, whatever it takes to get their agenda passed.” 
Senate Bill 474 bans the offering of specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex.
The bill only applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education.
Garcia’s attempt to hold up the bill came after his colleagues in the House — mostly Democrats — employed similar tactics. There, 27 amendments were filed by lawmakers. Just three of those were adopted.
Those voted down included moves to include the Crown Act — a policy banning discrimination based on hairstyles and textures — in the bill, as well as adding nondiscrimination measures based on political beliefs and exempting parts of the bill from applying to veterans, among other measures.
Democrats in the body gave fiery speeches against the overall bill, namely Del. Anitra Hamilton, D-Monongalia, who is one of just three Black lawmakers in the state Legislature. 
Hamilton told her colleagues that DEI measures are not about giving people of color or other classes special treatment; they’re about ensuring everyone has equal ability to apply for and access the same opportunities.
She shared her experiences dealing with system racism in West Virginia and, specifically, at the Legislature. Her points were echoed by her colleagues, Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, and Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, who are also Black.
Not recognizing the existence of racism or sexism, Hamilton said, will only hold West Virginia back.
“Diversity, equity and inclusion matters,” Hamilton said. “If we don’t embrace these principles, we don’t have a bone in the race of this Backyard Brawl. We’ll continue to lose every year … I just pray that we can not only abolish this legislation, we can abolish the mentality and ideology that goes along with it, and the energy.”

But union leaders were not all smiles afterward. The bill was amended on the floor to impose a four-week limit on receiving benefits, eight weeks less than the version approved in the Senate.
Senate Bill 5041 passed the House on a 52-43 vote with seven Democrats joining Republicans in voting against the measure.
The Senate must now decide if it will agree with the revisions or insist on its position. When the bill came up for a vote last month, Senate Democrats narrowly defeated an amendment for a four-week limit before passing the bill 28-21.
New Jersey and New York are the only states with such provisions for striking workers. Oregon lawmakers are debating legislation this year that would offer unemployment benefits to striking workers there.
On Saturday, Democratic lawmakers said the bill ensures workers who choose to walk off the job will be less stressed about going without pay and seeing their finances erode in a lengthy dispute. With the threat of economic hardship eased, workers will be in a better position to endure lengthy negotiations.
“Fundamentally, this takes a step to level the playing field for striking workers,” said Rep. Beth Doglio, D-Olympia. 
Republicans argued that providing benefits would be an incentive for union workers to strike. They tried unsuccessfully to amend the bill to exclude public school teachers and hospital workers.
“If you are paying people to strike, you will have more strikes,” said Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah.
The policy only assures a level of benefits is available “for workers when they do go on strike,” said Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek. “The state is not paying workers to strike.”
Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, said the bill is unfair because taxpayers and businesses with no involvement in a labor disagreement will have their contributions to the unemployment insurance fund go to striking workers.
“People who are not a party to the disagreement will pay for it,” he said.
As written, a striking worker would become eligible for benefits on the second Sunday following the first day of a strike, provided that the strike is not found to be prohibited by federal or state law. Workers would be subject to a one-week waiting period after they become eligible for benefits. 
If a strike is determined to be prohibited by state or federal law, any benefits paid are liable for repayment. 
Employees would also qualify for unemployment insurance during employer-initiated labor lockouts. Lockouts are one way management can pressure a striking workforce during contract negotiations.
Rep. Kristine Reeves, D-Federal Way, authored the amendment for the four-week limit on receiving benefits. It passed on a voice vote. Normally, unemployment insurance is available for up to 26 weeks in a one-year period.
If the bill becomes law, the changes would take effect Jan. 1, 2026, and last through Dec. 31, 2035.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2179899792-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-13 01:03:14.255994

Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, speaks in the chamber of the House of Delegates on the final day of the regular session on Saturday, April 12, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Lawmakers have approved nearly eliminating gender-affirming care for children in West Virginia, removing a narrow exemption in current state law that allows minors at risk for suicide to access hormone therapy and other medications.
Medical professionals warned lawmakers that it would increase the risk of self-harm and suicide in children who are currently receiving care.
The House of Delegates signed off on the measure Saturday on the final day of the legislative session. 
West Virginia already has a strict ban on gender-affirming care for minors, which prohibits gender reassignment surgeries. 
There is a narrow exemption under that current law allowing children diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria by two medical providers to access pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy under guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
Some supporters said Senate Bill 299 would close a loophole left open in 2023 when the near total ban passed. The measure is sponsored by Sen. Chris Rose, R-Monongalia. 
Del. Brandon Steele, R-Raleigh, supported the bill on the House floor, saying, “There’s no charity and good will in destroying the identity of a child and doing it for profit.”
Roughly 100 youth in the state are currently receiving gender-affirming care under that provision, according to testimony from medical professionals shared with lawmakers.
This measure would halt their medical care Aug. 1 if signed into law. 
Dr. Katie Waldeck, a pediatric critical care physician in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Cabell Huntington Hospital, treats about two dozen children who are eligible within the state law’s exemption to receive gender-affirming care. She spoke before House Health Committee members last week, sharing emotional testimony that she worried about children’s well-being if their care was banned.
“I do not want to see them back in my unit with asphyxiation marks. I don’t want to see them overdosing. This is not about an agenda other than patient care. So that’s why I’m here,” said Dr. Katie Waldeck, a pediatric critical care physician in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Cabell Huntington Hospital.
Republican tries to extend date for treatment cutoff
Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, attempted to amend the bill to allow children currently receiving pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy — as permitted in the state’s narrow exemption — to continue with their treatment until July 1, 2026, to help them taper off medication.
He said the bill’s effective date of this summer could be too soon for these children. 
“These medications do take some time to come down from … it would give us an opportunity for these children to either possibly move to another state or find another form of assistance for what they’re going through,” Flanigan said.
Del. Eric Brooks, R-Raleigh, urged a no vote, saying it was partially due to “political” motivations having promised voters he’d end gender-affirming medication. 
“For those of you that run on this issue or talk to your constituents and said, ‘I will support doing away with these drugs for these children,’ this is your time and this is your opportunity. It’s a good bill,” Brooks said. 
In response, Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha, said, “This [amendment] is about empathy. This isn’t about you winning a race.”
Del. David Kelly, R-Tyler, said, “It’s not a political issue for me … We love to talk about love in here … But I think the greatest level of love we can show in here today is to care about kids who will be transitioning down, to give them the extra time that they may need.”
After a lengthy debate on the amendment, it was rejected with a vote of 28-71.
Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, then urged members to reject the bill itself, saying, “I would listen to the doctors on this and err on the side of caution when it comes to the prevention of suicide in children.”
Following Pushkin’s speech, Del. Charles Sheedy, R-Marshall, successfully called for members to move straight to voting on the bill, bypassing any other debate. In parliamentary procedure, it’s known as “point to question.”
Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, said that Republicans had dominated debate time during an amendment, but, “when it was finally time for Democrats to voice our concerns, they cut it off.”
“It is a cruel bill, and especially without adopting Flanigan’s amendment, it’s going to harm people,” Hansen said. “This is a campaign bill, the mailer bill. In some situations, several of those delegates voted for the bill because they’re scared of the mailers and they’re afraid to stand up.”
Three Republicans joined all nine Democratic members of the House to oppose the measure in an 86-12 vote.
The Senate will have to concur with the House’s vote before the bill would go to Gov. Morrisey’s desk for consideration. 
Bill would require teachers to out students’ gender identity to parents
The House also passed Senate Bill 154, which would prohibit instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. It also mandates that teachers tell parents when a child requests to be referred to by a different name or pronouns that are different from the student’s biological sex.
Lawmakers struck out a provision of the bill that would have allowed parents to take legal action against schools that violated the bill. 
The session adjourns Saturday, April 12 at midnight.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)“Union busting bills” and a school voucher bill that threatened to siphon $100 million from public schools were on the table earlier this session, said Amanda Curtis, president of the Montana Federation of Public Employees.
And back in February, the state pay play wasn’t scheduled for a hearing in the Senate yet, she said.
But despite snowstorms and single digit temperatures, union members showed up to engage with lawmakers, Curtis said.
“Because we broke bread and had thoughtful, one-on-one conversations with legislators of both parties, we won,” Curtis told a few dozen rally-goers.
She said union members helped push off unfriendly bills and pulled the pay plan forward..

At a rally Friday at the Capitol with, at most, 18 days left in the session, Curtis praised the work union members had done, including 22 MFPE members who serve in the Montana Legislature.
The MFPE is the largest union in the state with more than 20,000 members.
Rep. Eric Matthews, D-Bozeman, said the legislature has passed the pay plan, and it’s a fair one. Matthews, a teacher, said the STARS Act, a comprehensive bill addressing starting teacher pay, still needs to pass, but it’s a positive proposal.
The Student and Teacher Advancement for Results and Success Act, House Bill 252, passed the House 88-9 and is making its way through the Senate.
“We still have to get the STARS Act out, which will definitely help the education system across Montana,” Matthews said.
Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings, said Montana’s pensions are healthy, and they need to resist attacks. She said 73% of public employees report they would be more likely to leave their work if their pensions are cut.
Baum, a recently retired detective with the Billings Police Department, also urged Gov. Greg Gianforte to sign Senate Bill 7, which she said helps correct a wrong from last session.
The bill revises the retirement criteria for some law enforcement officers.
Instead of being eligible after 20 years of service and at the age of 50, it allows an officer to tap their retirement after reaching just one of the criteria.
The bill passed the legislature and is headed to Gianforte’s desk. A spokesperson for the Governor’s Office did not respond to an email for comment about the governor’s planned action.
Rep. Jill Cohenour, D-Helena, praised increases in the pay plan, including a minimum $10,400 for employees working for the state of Montana and the university system over the course of three years, “raises exceeding anything that has been there in the past two decades.”
“Hear me when I say that public employees in Montana deserve the pay plans that we have negotiated,” Cohenour said. “We deserve so much more.
“We are the people that Montanans go to when they need help starting a business, when they’re trying to find a job, when they’re trying to get back on their feet, when their roads need plowed, and when they’re experiencing a health crisis. We make families successful in communities across Montana.”
At the rally, Curtis also encouraged other union members to run for office in the future, even though “22 member legislators may be unheard of.”
“We need reinforcements in 2027, and it doesn’t matter what party you identify with,” Curtis said.
“If you believe that public service is a public good, if you believe that we must support public employees, if you believe that working people should have a voice and protections at work, we need you in this Capitol building.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3911-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-12 17:03:24.083064

[…]","State Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, seen here on the Senate floor in an undated photo, has pushed for three years for legislation to set new requirements for clergy to report child abuse. Her bill won final approval in the Legislature on April 11, 2025 and is headed to the governor's desk. (Legislative Support Services)Washington is poised to require clergy members to report child abuse or neglect, even when it is disclosed in confession.
Nearly two-thirds of state House members approved a Senate bill on Friday night to make religious leaders mandatory reporters of abuse and neglect, adding them to a list that includes school counselors, police, and nurses. With passage of Senate Bill 5375 on a 64-31 vote, the legislation now goes to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson for signing.
“It’s long past time for this protection for children,” said state Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the bill’s sponsor, following the vote. “Members of the clergy play such an important role in the lives of children, like teachers and doctors do, and just like those other trusted adults, clergy should be mandatory reporters.”
More than half the states make clergy mandatory reporters, but most exempt what is heard in a confessional. If the Senate bill is signed, Washington would join the handful like New Hampshire and West Virginia where such conversations are not exempt.
Removing that privilege played a large part in the House floor debate on Friday.
“This bill is an attack on the Catholic and other faiths,” said Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah.
Some Republicans said they could support making clergy members mandatory reporters as long as the confessional privilege was maintained.
“I have anger at people that do this because it is so wrong. I want something that will work,” said Rep. Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake. “There is no way we can enforce this.”
Rep. Carolyn Eslick, R-Sultan, said she was abused as a five-year-old by a 16-year-old family friend. But, she said, similar laws in other states didn’t reduce child abuse and neglect.

“If I thought for one minute it would help our children, I would vote for it,” she said.
Supporters said the bill will help protect children by ensuring that if they confide to a religious leader that they are being mistreated, they can trust that person will do something to help.
Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, said as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, “what makes a difference is when it stops. It stops when it becomes known.”
State law requires teachers, police, registered nurses, social service counselors and members of several other professions to report to law enforcement or the state Department of Children, Youth and Families if they have reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.
The bill adds clergy to the list, but it retains their privilege to not be compelled to testify in a court case or criminal proceeding.
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
The Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the legislation. They said it would force priests to break the seal of confession, considered a sacred promise to never reveal any of the information disclosed.
Republicans argued the abusers would do more harm because they would no longer be able to freely confide and seek forgiveness.
“It will drive these conversations underground. No children will be protected,” Rep. Hunter Abell, R-Inchelium.
 This marked the third consecutive year Frame attempted to make this change in law.
“It’s finally on its way to the governor’s desk,” Frame said. She thanked the survivors of abuse who shared their experiences throughout the years of legislative process.
“I hope their pain is lessened by the knowledge that there are future children who won’t have to suffer like they did, thanks to their advocacy,” she said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/noel-frame-.jpeg,,,2025-04-12 17:03:24.083064

On a late afternoon in November 2017, Witney Arch told her 1-1/2-year-old son to stop playing and come inside. Upset, he grabbed her right breast when she picked him up. She experienced a shock of pain but did not think it was anything serious. A week later, however, the ache had not subsided. After trips to several doctors, a biopsy revealed that Arch had early-stage breast cancer. Her surgeon told her that it was likely invasive and aggressive.
By the end of January, she had made two critical decisions. She would get a double mastectomy. And she wanted her operation at the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans, a medical facility renowned for its highly specialized approach to breast cancer care and reconstruction. The two surgeons who founded it had pioneered techniques that used a woman’s own body tissue to form new breasts post mastectomy.
The idea of a natural restoration appealed to Arch.
“I don’t judge anybody for getting implants, especially if you’ve had cancer,” she said. “But I felt like I was taking something foreign out of my body, cancer, and I did not want to put something foreign back in.”
Arch was a 42-year-old preschool teacher for her church, with four young children, living in a suburb of New Orleans. The 1-1/2-year-old had been born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. Caring for him consumed her life. By nature upbeat and optimistic, Arch felt blessed that her son’s act of defiance had led to an early diagnosis.
“We’re going to pray about this and we’re going to figure it out,” she told her husband.

Arch asked her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, for approval to go to the center for her care, and the company granted it, a process known as prior authorization. Then, a week or so before her surgery, Arch was wrangling child care and meal plans when she got a call from the insurer. The representative on the line was trying to persuade her to have the surgery elsewhere. She urged Arch to seek a hospital that, unlike the center, was in network and charged less.
“Do you realize how much this is going to cost?” Arch remembered the agent asking. Arch did not need more stress, but here it was — from her own health plan.
“I feel very comfortable with my decision,” she replied. “My doctor teaches other doctors around the world how to do this.”
Over the next year, Arch underwent five operations to rid herself of cancer and reconstruct her breasts.
Arch did not know it at the time, but her surgery would become evidence in a long-running legal fight between the breast center’s founders, surgeons Frank DellaCroce and Scott Sullivan, and Blue Cross, Louisiana’s biggest health insurance company, with an estimated two-thirds share of the market. DellaCroce and Sullivan had repeatedly sued the insurer, alleging that it granted approvals for surgery but then denied payments or paid only a fraction of patients’ bills.
They pointed to calls like the one Arch received as proof of the company’s effort to drive away patients. The aggressive legal attack, they knew, was fraught. Litigation against the $3.4 billion company would take a long time and a lot of money. The chances of winning were slight.
“You fight dragons at great peril,” DellaCroce would tell friends.
But this September, after 18 years and several defeats in court, jurors found Blue Cross liable for fraud. They awarded the center $421 million — one of the largest verdicts ever to a single medical practice outside of a class-action lawsuit. In a statement, Blue Cross said it “disagrees with the jury’s decision, which we believe was wrong on the facts and the law. We have filed an appeal and expect to be successful.”
Frustration with insurers is at an all-time high. The December fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione serves as an extreme and tragic example. Doctors and insurers are locked into a perpetual conflict over health care costs, with patients caught in the middle. Doctors accuse insurance plans of blocking payments for health care treatments that can save the patients’ lives. Insurance companies insist they shouldn’t pay for procedures that they say are unnecessary or overpriced. It is easy to emerge from an examination of the American health care system with a cynicism that both sides are broken and corrupt.
Jeff Landry picks formerly indicted Jindal official to run Louisiana health department again

However, interviews with scores of doctors, patients and insurance executives, as well as reviews of internal documents, regulatory filings and academic studies, reveal a fundamental truth: The two sides are not evenly matched. Insurance companies are players in the fight over money, and they are also the referees. Insurers produce their own guidelines to determine whether to pay claims. When a doctor appeals a denial, insurers make all the initial decisions.
In legal settings, insurers are often given favorable standing in their ability to set what conditions they are required to cover. Federal and state insurance regulators lack the resources to pursue individual complaints against multibillion-dollar companies. Six major insurers, which include some of the nation’s largest companies, cover half of all Americans. They are pitted against tens of thousands of doctors’ practices and large hospital chains.
The Blue Cross trial provides a rare opportunity to expose in detail the ways that health insurance companies wield power over doctors and their patients. Blue Cross executives testified that the breast center charged too much money — sometimes more than $180,000 for an operation. The center, they said, deserved special attention because it had a history of questionable charges.
But the insurer’s defense went even further, to the very meaning of “prior authorization,” which it had granted women like Arch to pursue surgery. The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was “not a guarantee of payment.” Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. “Let me be clear: The authorization never says we’re going to pay you,” said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, in a deposition. “That’s why there’s a disclaimer.
From 2015 through 2023, the Baton Rouge-based insurer paid, on average, less than 9% of the charges billed by the breast center for more than 7,800 individual medical procedures — even though it had authorized all of them. Thousands of such claims were never paid at all, according to court records.
Testimony revealed that the health plan never considered thousands of appeals filed by the center. Corporate documents showed Blue Cross executives had set up secret processes for approving operations and reimbursing the clinic and its doctors that resulted in reduced fees and payment delays.
One lucrative strategy: A national-level policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to take a cut of any savings it achieved in paying the breast center on behalf of patients covered by out-of-state Blue Cross companies, meaning the less the insurer paid out, the more it earned.
In Sullivan’s words, the insurer was hypocritical, “morally bankrupt.” Blue Cross had stranded many of the center’s patients with high bills, amounts that it had absorbed over the years. On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives’ cancer treatment. To Sullivan, it seemed the insurer was willing to pay the center when patients had connections but would fight when patients did not.
Blue Cross declined to comment on any individual cases but said in a statement that single case agreements were “common in the industry” and were available to all members when needed to access out-of-network providers.
The center
Nobody would take the breast center and its adjoining hospital as an ordinary medical establishment. The two facilities take up a city block along St. Charles Avenue, the thoroughfare famous for its streetcars, Mardi Gras parades and Queen Anne mansions. Patients access the complex — created by merging a former law office, funeral home, car dealership and Dunkin’ Donuts — by driving around back where a porte cochere leads into a soaring atrium.
Light pours in through windows set in the high ceiling. Arrangements of white orchids are scattered among comfortable couches and chairs. Here, women consult with doctors to plan their treatment. Surgeries are performed at the 39-bed hospital, which has an Icee machine in a family room. New-age music plays softly throughout the building. Rooms are designed to be as homey as possible, with medical gear hidden away and seascapes by a local artist hanging on the wall. One patient’s husband referred to it as a “spa-spital.”
The idea of combining the luxury feel of an upscale plastic surgery practice with the mission-driven zeal of a medical clinic came to DellaCroce and Sullivan while they were young surgeons. The two grew up in Louisiana. Sullivan spent much of his childhood in Mandeville, a suburb of New Orleans on the north side of Lake Ponchartrain, his dad employed in the oil and gas industry. His mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor.
“I definitely was not going to become a priest,” he said.
DellaCroce’s father worked at the paper mill in West Monroe in the state’s northern neck. His mother, a nurse, gave him an appreciation for medicine as a career that was “meaningful and challenging.”

They became friends while working at the Louisiana State University medical center, where they earned the nickname “the Sushi Brothers” for their favorite lunch. They were drawn to microsurgery and breast reconstruction because it was an emerging field that was innovating and improving care. Both men became board-certified in plastic surgery.
Sullivan, 60, is the hard-charging businessman, stocky, direct and blunt. DellaCroce, 58, with a ponytail, goatee and soft drawl, is more the diplomat, patient and cerebral. The pair have lectured around the world and written numerous medical journal articles.
They opened their first office in 2003 in a single room rented from a fellow doctor at what was then known as Memorial Medical Center, the hulking private hospital in New Orleans. They performed operations at facilities throughout the region but found that most gave little consideration to their patients’ comfort. They wanted to build a different kind of hospital.
“Can we give them that little bit of extra without breaking the budget to make the experience less awful? Can’t make it great, but can you make it less awful?” DellaCroce explained. “Can you attend to the human side of this patient and give them the added value of peace and confidence?”
Hurricane Katrina set back their construction plans, and the new edifice, named the St. Charles Surgical Hospital, did not open its doors until 2009. It boasts of being the only hospital in the country devoted solely to care for breast cancer patients who have received mastectomies. The center does not provide radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The majority of patients come from out of state.
Women seeking to have their breasts restored after a mastectomy face two paths. Some choose a relatively straightforward surgical procedure using implants filled with silicon or another gel. The center specializes in the other option, what’s known as autologous tissue reconstruction, where a woman’s own fat is taken from one part of the body, like the bottom or the stomach, and used to rebuild the breast. The procedure requires a longer recovery time, but the new breasts become part of the body.
The transplant surgery is lengthy and complex. Operations can last up to 12 hours with big medical teams involved. One surgeon performs the mastectomy while another creates a new breast by knitting together layers of fat and tissue.
Concentration is intense. The surgeons stare through glasses with microscopes to connect new blood vessels with a needle that’s thinner than an eyelash, using thread less than half the width of a human hair. DellaCroce and Sullivan invented techniques, for example, allowing tissue to be taken from multiple sites when a woman did not have enough fat in one part of her body for a full restoration.
One afternoon last fall, DellaCroce strode into a cavernous operating room to check on a patient. On the table in front of him, a woman lay covered in curtains of blue surgical cloth, only her torso exposed. Earlier in the day, a surgical oncologist had removed her right breast as part of a mastectomy to treat her cancer. Later, another surgeon had taken flaps of fat from her stomach and interlaced them with blood vessels to create a new breast to replace the lost one.

Now, in the fifth hour of surgery, a physician’s assistant leaned over her midsection, closing an incision along her side with some final stitches. Nurses hurried around the space, preparing to wrap up the operation. Paul Simon’s “You Can Call Me Al” played in the background. The smell of burnt flesh hung in the air. A blue light signaled that the new arteries were successfully pumping blood. “Wow, that woman looks really good,” DellaCroce told the physician’s assistant. “Nice job.”
There is no denying that the center’s high-end treatment means high costs. The median charge for an operation and hospital stay is about $165,000. DellaCroce and Sullivan hired consultants to review other well-regarded practices, who advised them their prices were competitive with their peers. “We weren’t asking to be paid Lebron James, best of the best, even though we feel we’re in the top 1 or 2% of the country,” Sullivan said. “We just wanted something fair.”
Blue Cross and Blue Shield
It is one of the quirks of the American health care system that insurers almost never pay the prices for procedures demanded by doctors and hospitals.
To understand why requires a tour of the grand bargain at the heart of the health insurance system. Insurance companies negotiate with hospitals and doctors to discount reimbursements on medical procedures, like office visits or MRI scans. Providers who sign these contracts are in network. Insurance companies like in-network doctors because they can budget for health expenses and set premiums accordingly. Doctors and hospitals agree to be in network because they get a steady stream of insured patients.
DellaCroce and Sullivan held contracts with insurers that resulted in average payments to the center’s doctors in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. But DellaCroce and Sullivan never came to an agreement with Blue Cross. That made them an exception in Louisiana — the insurer is so dominant that 97% of local physicians and hospitals are in network.
DellaCroce and Sullivan said the company was not offering them enough money — in some cases not even enough to cover the cost of the surgeries, they argued in court documents. The doctors and their hospital remained out of network, meaning they charged Blue Cross the full price for their procedures.
Such charges are controversial. Insurance companies and many health experts say they are too often inflated and untethered from actual costs. Physicians and hospitals say their fees are justified, reflecting the true price of medical care. In the end, insurers — especially in states like Louisiana, with few competitors — use their market power in negotiations to set reimbursements at what they want to pay, not what doctors charge.

At Blue Cross, Dwight Brower was charged with reviewing the bills from the breast center. He had worked as a physician at a small family practice in Baton Rouge and then at a local hospital before joining Blue Cross as a medical director. He helped oversee prior authorizations. While many patients assume that an approval means an insurer will pay for an operation, it is simply a recognition that a procedure is medically necessary. Federal law mandates that private insurers cover breast restorations for women who undergo mastectomies because of cancer or genetic risk. And patients, in general, are allowed to choose their own doctors.
However, since the center was out of network and had no contract with the insurer, Blue Cross determined how much it would pay for the treatment, and Brower believed that the breast center’s bills were exorbitant.
“I did not think that they were reasonable,” he would later testify.
Surgeons doing lung transplants or brain surgery rarely billed Blue Cross more than $50,000 for their work. Why should DellaCroce and Sullivan get so much more?
“Don’t get me wrong. The surgeons at the center are extremely skilled,” he acknowledged. The operations were often lengthy. “But so are open-heart surgeries,” he said. “Relative to some of the other extremely complicated surgeries done by other surgeons in other areas of the body, it just seemed like their fee schedule was extremely high.”
Blue Cross Louisiana executives testified that they did not even consider doctors’ invoices when making decisions on what to reimburse because such charges were “unregulated” and “nonstandard.” Instead, they paid “an amount we establish” — unless the doctor’s bill was cheaper. In the end, the insurer said it settled on reimbursing the breast center about the same as in-network doctors performing similar operations, even though DellaCroce and Sullivan did not benefit from having patients referred to them.
In practice, that meant the insurer paid out a fraction of the breast center’s bills. Of the 7,837 medical procedures in dispute in the lawsuit, involving 1,680 patients, Blue Cross paid about $43 million on invoices totaling $500 million. Some 60% of the claims weren’t reimbursed at all. The difference between the bill and the payment could be striking. For example, in the case of Arch, Blue Cross paid $8,580 out of $102,722 for one operation. For another, it paid $3,190 out of $34,975.
Executives said the Blue Cross reimbursements were fair, designed to keep premiums low for the nearly 2 million Louisianans who depended on the insurer to cover their health care. Paying the breast center’s full fees would add to its customers’ burden, they said.

“If we were to just agree to any rates or any prices set by physicians or any providers, it would cause cost to be exorbitantly high for both the plan and for members particularly, because we wouldn’t be able to forecast or make sure those plans are actually sound,” said Curtis Anders, the vice president of provider networks for Blue Cross. “Premiums would increase.”
For many out-of-network doctors, payments lower than their invoices are an infuriating part of doing business. They absorb the costs, or pass them on to their patients, a practice known as balance billing that can result in medical debt. DellaCroce and Sullivan were the rare physicians with the tenacity to fight. The center collected money from both insurers and patients — but it carried the unpaid portion of invoices on its books. That amount grew every year as it battled Blue Cross.
DellaCroce and Sullivan were convinced that Blue Cross had singled them out for their obstreperousness, but they had no proof. Then, during a phone call one day, an employee for the center was talking to a Blue Cross representative to obtain a prior authorization. The representative let slip that the request required special handling. The breast center’s doctors were flagged on an internal roster. It was called the targeted list.
Discoveries
On Dec. 8, 2023, several dozen attorneys and paralegals from Chehardy Sherman Williams, one of New Orleans’ top law firms, were celebrating their annual holiday party. They had gathered in a private dining room with gilded mirrors and shimmering chandeliers at Arnaud’s restaurant, a bastion of Creole cuisine in the heart of the French Quarter. The waiters served shrimp remoulade, prime rib and turtle soup. Small talk filled the air.
Suddenly, several attorneys’ cellphones buzzed as they all received the same email, a message from the lawyers for Blue Cross. It contained discovery for the case, more than 42,000 pages of internal documents, emails and policies.
Matthew Sherman, one of the attorneys representing the center, turned to a colleague. “Can you believe this?” he asked. It was like something from a John Grisham novel, the kind of thing he and his friends had joked about at law school, a document dump at Christmas time.
By long tradition, many of New Orleans’ biggest law firms hold their holiday parties on the same Friday afternoon in December. Afterward, rival attorneys from around town gather for drinks under a flag of truce at a local bar. Sherman realized there would be no afterparty this year. Nor much of a holiday vacation.
Louisiana spent $2.4B to improve Medicaid. A lot of the money went to administrative functions.

The delivery of the documents was a Christmas gift nearly 20 years in the making. DellaCroce and Sullivan’s first lawsuits against Blue Cross, involving 88 breach-of-contract claims filed in a Louisiana civil court beginning in 2006, were dismissed because of a federal court ruling regarding jurisdiction. A second lawsuit, which lasted from 2010 through 2017, resulted in limited discovery and a two-day trial in federal court. Jurors found that Blue Cross had failed to tell the center how much it would pay for procedures, but they also ruled the center had not been financially harmed. A judge dismissed the remaining claims.
DellaCroce and Sullivan launched their third lawsuit in February 2017 with a novel legal theory: They accused Blue Cross of fraud. They contended that for years the insurer had issued prior authorizations without the intention of paying the actual bills. Their lawyers had sought the targeted list during discovery to help prove the case. Blue Cross denied it existed.
But now, as Sherman and fellow attorney Patrick Follette began poring over the thousands of documents, they came upon a spreadsheet that said “Targeted Provider List.” The first names on the list were DellaCroce and Sullivan. It was labeled “confidential” and dated June 2007 — about a year after the pair had filed their first lawsuit against Blue Cross alleging nonpayment. More digging turned up other documents. There was a “blocked” list that also featured the two doctors.
A corporate policy document provided what DellaCroce and Sullivan considered the most revealing explanation for Blue Cross’ financial motivation. Blue Cross insurers are independent companies that operate under a common set of rules, similar to franchisees in a fast-food chain. When a person covered by Blue Cross in their home state receives treatment in another state, the Blue Cross where the treatment occurs pays the provider and then recoups the cost from the home-state plan.
What the attorneys discovered was that Blue Cross Louisiana would receive a share of any savings it could generate for the home-state plan. Say, for instance, Blue Cross Alabama was facing a bill of $5,000 for a procedure. If Blue Cross Louisiana instead paid $1,000, it saved the Alabama plan $4,000. The policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to earn 16% of the savings — in this scenario, $640.
For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the revelations cemented their belief that Blue Cross was a bad corporate actor more interested in power and control than health care. The percentage fee incentivized the insurer to pay the doctors as little as possible. The bigger the savings, the more Blue Cross made.
“It’s win-win,” DellaCroce said. “That’s their pay day.”
As the trial approached, Blue Cross attempted to settle the case. DellaCroce and Sullivan refused the offer as too low.
The trial
On the afternoon of Sept. 5, 2024, the case — St. Charles Surgical Hospital, L.L.C. and Center for Restorative Breast Surgery, L.L.C. v. Louisiana Health Service & Indemnity Company D/B/A Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Louisiana, Inc. and HMO Louisiana, Inc. — opened in Division C of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, a high-ceilinged room with dark brown benches and tables, fake marble columns and fluorescent lights.
James Williams, the chief litigator for the hospital, had already impressed the 45 potential jurors by memorizing all their names and backgrounds during jury selection. Now, he stood up and placed a football on the plaintiff’s table in front of the 12 chosen to try the case, which included a third-grade teacher, a movie stunt double and a hotel manager. He warned them that they would hear a lot of “insurance talk” from Blue Cross.
“I’m going to ask you, ladies and gentlemen on the jury, keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on what this case is about,” Williams told them. “If they start saying things like, ‘Well, oh, we paid them what we thought was fair, 9%,’ keep your eye on the ball, right?”
Over 10 days — interrupted by a two-day break to allow a hurricane to pass across Louisiana — Williams made his case that Blue Cross had defrauded his clients by making promises to pay but failing to deliver.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

Much of Blue Cross’ defense had relied on the notice that a prior authorization was no guarantee of payment. The insurer had not committed fraud, it said, since it never explicitly promised the center to reimburse anything. Udvarhelyi, the former CEO, had insisted on that. But on the stand, Blue Cross witnesses provided a more nuanced explanation.
They acknowledged that the disclaimer was not meant as a general excuse to free the company from paying bills. A prior authorization “usually” resulted in a payment, testified Brower, who reviewed the center’s bills. He said that the notice was intended for specific situations.
For instance, Blue Cross would not cover a woman who dropped out of her insurance before the operation. Nor would it pay anything if a patient had not met her deductible. But otherwise, Brower said, Blue Cross intended to compensate for a procedure that it had authorized.
“It’s inappropriate for us as a company to approve a code and then turn around and deny it,” Brower said.
Over the years, the center had appealed thousands of reimbursements for being too low. It hired additional employees to manage the paperwork. At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals — nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. “An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,” acknowledged Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict — the payment was correct.
This was the core of the case. The insurer set the rules. The insurer set the prices. Doctors could appeal to a state insurance regulator. But if that failed, and it often did, the only recourse was a long, costly lawsuit.
Williams summed up for the jury the center’s treatment at the hands of Blue Cross: “Our payments are slow pay, low pay or no pay.”
In countering those arguments, Blue Cross witnesses explained that the insurer was committed to paying for Louisianans’ health care and keeping costs low. As a nonprofit, it directed any excess revenue from operations back into the business. (Udvarhelyi, the CEO, did acknowledge that his salary, over $1 million, included bonuses that depended on hitting revenue targets and increasing membership.)
Brian West, a Blue Cross executive who monitored payments, said the center had engaged in “egregious” billing practices.
“They are bad actors in the billing world,” he said.
But company witnesses offered only a handful of examples. Sometimes the center mistakenly coded its bills in a way that appeared to charge for four separate breast reconstructions in a single operation. In other cases, the center asked for payment for two surgeons in the room at the same time. But Blue Cross, following Medicare guidelines, would pay two surgeons only 20% more than the reimbursement for a single surgeon.
Blue Cross did not accuse the center of any intentional miscoding — but the sloppy billing led to additional scrutiny, the company’s witnesses said. The targeted list, a witness testified, had been created especially for the center, requiring all prior authorization requests to bypass normal routes for a special review by company doctors.
The blocked list meant that each bill from the center received a manual scrub by payment specialists before reimbursement. Blue Cross acknowledged the careful checking often resulted in the need for more information from the center, which could result in slower processing of claims. But the lists, executives insisted, were not designed to reduce payments.
“Basically, no harm was done,” said Becky Juncker, who was involved in approving surgical procedures.
Company witnesses explained that the 16% received in saving money for out-of-state Blue Cross insurers was a fee to cover the costs of handling adjustments of the claim — though they were not able to explain why Blue Cross did not charge a flat fee for its services.
Blue Cross also defended itself against the accusation that it had paid nothing for 60% of the charges for individual procedures. Witnesses said the insurer had followed industry practice in bundling charges to make a single payment for an operation. An attorney for the center noted that it had never agreed to take bundled payments — Blue Cross had imposed them.
As to the calls to women like Arch? That was an effort to save members money.
“Our medical area would reach out to our members who were utilizing out-of-network providers to help them understand the, I would say, the financial implications,” said Shepherd, the Blue Cross executive vice president, in a deposition. “It could be financially catastrophic to a member to have an out-of-network claim that they are financially responsible for. It’s a huge difference.”
In summing up the case, Kim Boyle, the lead attorney for the company, told jurors that Blue Cross had not committed fraud. It had acted to ensure the company and its members paid a fair price for the center’s services, she said.
“There’s no scheme. There’s no plot. There’s no mafia. There are no Blue Cross employees of Louisiana that are sitting in some smoke-filled room in Baton Rouge, plotting against these plaintiffs on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans,” Boyle said. “It’s fiction; it’s fancy; it’s completely made up.”

On Sept. 20, at 1:57 p.m., Judge Sidney H. Cates IV sent the jurors to deliberate. The center attorneys retreated to a nearby hotel to await the verdict. About two hours later, they were summoned back to Division C. Williams put his head down and swore. He worried that such a quick return in the legally complex case meant victory for Blue Cross.
The center’s lawyers paid close attention to Cates as he reviewed the jurors’ decision. It was a two-page form. If the jurors found in favor of Blue Cross, the judge would have no reason to read on.
Cates flipped to the second page: The jurors had found Blue Cross liable for fraud.
“Please express in dollars the total monetary compensation, if any, Blue Cross owes the hospital and the center for the damages,” Cates said, reading from the verdict. “Net damages, $421,488,633.”
The center’s lawyers stood and shook hands as the insurer’s attorneys prepared to leave the courtroom.
DellaCroce was in surgery at the hospital, having expected a longer deliberation. Sullivan was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Afterward, jurors approached and thanked him for his work. He teared up.
“We would have given more if we had been asked for more. That’s how egregious the fraud was,” Juliet Laughlin, a 58-year-old property manager who served as forewoman, later said. “There had been wrong done.”
Blue Cross has appealed the verdict.
A health insurance trade group has warned that the finding sets a dangerous precedent. If allowed to stand, insurance companies in Louisiana may find themselves forced to pay whatever price is demanded by out-of-network doctors — which in turn could raise health insurance premiums across the state, the Louisiana Association of Health Plans said in a statement.
For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the verdict was vindication. They had refused to sign contracts they thought unfair. They had rejected settlement offers they thought too low. The trial had revealed Blue Cross’ domineering behavior.
“Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control,” DellaCroce said. “That was regarded as a threat.”
In the months since the judgment, Blue Cross has not changed its practices, the doctors said. It has not approached with an offer that would bring the hospital in network. It still issues prior authorizations for women’s surgeries. And it still pays only a fraction of the billed fees.

Despite growing national backlash against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Washington Supreme Court Chief Justice Debra Stephens says the state’s high court remains committed to examining its own practices and advancing equity in the justice system.
In an interview on TVW’s Inside Olympia, Stephens told host Austin Jenkins that Washington’s judiciary has long worked to identify and correct systemic bias in court rules, precedents and access. That effort intensified in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, when the justices issued a rare public letter acknowledging that “the legal community must recognize that we all bear responsibility for the ongoing injustice and inequality.”
“Just because something is normal doesn’t mean it was ever neutral,” Stephens said. “You’ve got to go back and look at the scale. And just because something is the way we’ve always done it doesn’t mean it was fair.”
As the U.S. Supreme Court and federal courts draw intense public scrutiny amid high-profile lawsuits involving President Donald Trump, Stephens said she is closely watching public sentiment. She acknowledged that trust in institutions, including the judiciary, is declining, but emphasized that courts must continue to be viewed as legitimate and independent.
“Our democracy is a fragile thing,” she said. “The system works when people are willing to use the system to work.”
Stephens co-chairs a national committee on judicial independence and says she is alarmed by rhetoric that seeks to delegitimize court decisions, especially when they come under political fire. She stressed that Washington’s justices do not run as partisans and must instead earn public confidence through experience, temperament and integrity—not campaign promises.
“It’s hard to persuade people when your best campaign pitch is, ‘Vote for me and I’ll never do anything special for you, because I give everybody equal consideration,’” she said. 
The chief justice also discussed efforts underway to improve access to justice through public defense reform. She noted that many counties in Washington still lack sufficient resources to ensure fair representation for people charged with crimes, despite the constitutional guarantee of legal counsel.
A proposed rule before the court would reduce the number of cases assigned to public defenders, following years of concern over attorney workloads and systemic inequities. Stephens said the effort builds on a framework the court first adopted in 2012 and reflects a broader goal of redressing historical injustice.
“We need to look at what we criminalize, how we prioritize it, and whether people are getting the representation they are entitled to,” she said. “The burden of doing things the way we’ve always done them doesn’t fall equally across communities.”
The court has also backed pilot programs to improve jury diversity and boost juror compensation. In Pierce County, a test program raises daily juror pay to $100 — a tenfold increase over the state minimum — and is already showing a more representative pool. “People who were not able to serve now have the ability to serve,” Stephens said.
Despite the national political climate, Stephens struck a hopeful tone about the future of the judiciary, saying that honest dialogue and diverse representation in decision-making roles can build a stronger legal system.
“When we really talk to one another… and assume the best intention, good things happen,” she said.
Looking ahead, Stephens said artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the legal landscape—but warned it could deepen existing disparities if not handled carefully.
She said Washington courts are exploring ways to responsibly incorporate AI tools, such as front desk support, translation services and data analysis, while safeguarding privacy and due process. But she cautioned against relying on unregulated systems, particularly in legal proceedings.
“Bad inputs, bad outputs—and it compounds that and deepens biased learning,” she said.
AI’s growing role raises questions about data security, access to legal resources, and the integrity of evidence, especially as deepfake videos and fabricated documents become more sophisticated.
“You don’t want to run a draft of an opinion through ChatGPT,” she insisted.
Stephens, now in her second nonconsecutive term as chief justice, said her priorities remain rooted in fairness, transparency and trust. “I have such incredible optimism for where we can go,” she said, “and for all of the commitment I see in people around me.”

(Getty Images)Lawmakers in several states are pushing bills to prohibit unauthorized sales of hard-to-get restaurant reservations.
Proposed bills in California, Florida, Illinois and Louisiana take aim at online platforms such as Appointment Trader that allow diners to sell coveted reservations on the open market — sometimes without a restaurant’s knowledge.
In Louisiana, the issue gained attention surrounding February’s Super Bowl, when one customer paid more than $2,000 for a table at a top New Orleans restaurant, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.
Proponents of the platforms say these services provide customer flexibility and can boost restaurant business. But restaurant groups have opposed their entry into the market, arguing that they undermine the dining experience and can leave restaurants with empty tables.
The Illinois and Louisiana legislation follows New York state’s Restaurant Reservation Anti-Piracy Act, which went into effect in February. The law aims at curbing the “black market” in which reservations are scooped up as soon as they go live, Gothamist reported.
The Louisiana Restaurant Association asked state lawmakers to file a similar measure.
Wendy Waren, spokesperson for the association, told the Louisiana Illuminator that online platforms are selling reservations without restaurant’s permission or knowledge. If no one purchases reservations, tables can sit empty, preventing legitimate customers from getting a reservation, Waren said.
“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”

The Republican-sponsored bill, which would require platforms to have contracts with restaurants, is pending before the state House Commerce Committee.
A similar bill just won unanimous approval from the Illinois state House and now moves onto the state Senate for consideration.
The legislation would require a written agreement between restaurants and reservation platforms and would create a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation of the new law.
State Rep. Margaret Croke, the Democrat who sponsored the bill, characterized the move as a “commonsense” measure to protect restaurants and consumers alike.
“At a time when local restaurants are operating with extremely tight margins and working to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, they shouldn’t have to deal with third-party services snatching up their reservations and selling them at a premium, which leads to no-shows and confusion that only hurts their bottom lines,” Croke said in a statement.

The laws do not affect a restaurant’s ability to contract with reservation platforms such as OpenTable and Resy, which have applauded state crackdowns on other third-party sites.
Jonas Frey, who founded Appointment Trader, told the New York Times he launched the platform to help people get tables for a “fair market price.”
Last summer, he acknowledged that computer bots making reservations and then selling them were an issue, and said he had tried to prevent them from exploiting the website. But he said his website had only become popular because it was already difficult to get a reservation, especially in the New York City area.

Photo by Erick Diaz VelizOn Friday afternoon, approximately 60 people, including university students and community members, protested and marched inside the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing against what they say is the harassment of international students for supporting the Palestinian cause and demanded state officials divest from Israel.
The peaceful march inside the Capitol took place after a rally organized by pro-Palestinian student organizations from Wayne State University, the University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, the University of Detroit Mercy, and Michigan State University.
Omar Anasara, 19, a philosophy student and member of Students for Justice in Palestine at MSU, expressed their demands during his speech.
“We demand not only that the state imposes a large-scale arms embargo on Israel and divests from Israeli bonds, investment firms, and weapons manufacturers that profit off of and enable the genocide in Gaza, but also that the State Attorney General drops the charges against pro-Palestinian activists, and that university administrations across Michigan provide assurances for the protection of international students,”said Anasara.

On September 12, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed felony charges against 11 pro-Palestinian protesters from the University of Michigan in connection with the encampment that took place at the Diag in April of last year.
Additionally, the student activists sought to highlight the pressure they are receiving from the Trump administration because of their beliefs, claiming that it is an attack on freedom of speech.
“The monitoring of social media for pro-Palestinian content, or the silent and unannounced deportations of folks for exercising their rights to protest, we are seeing the consequences of unfettered fascism from the top-down level,” highlighted Anasara.
The rally came a day after 19 pro-Palestinian activists were arrested at the Michigan State University administration building when they refused to leave the premises. 
For about an hour, Friday’s rally continued without major incidents amidst speeches and chants.. The protesters momentarily occupied W. Ottawa Street, marching toward Heritage Hall located on the north side of the Capitol, where they entered the building and took a brief break.
Several minutes later, the protesters reached the first floor Capitol Rotunda, where they continued chanting in support of the Palestinian cause for about 15 minutes before leaving the building and marking the end of the protest. There was no police intervention beyond a few questions.

(Pool photo by Veronica Gabriela Cardenas/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.


During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.


Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators are currently considering a similar bill that would prohibit state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would require that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.

Private detention oversight
Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 
Troubling conditions
Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.


State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

Phil Murphy (Habba photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images/Murphy photo by Dana DiFilippo)The Trump lawyer who is now New Jersey’s acting U.S. attorney ratcheted up the buffoonery this week with her claim that she will investigate our governor and attorney general.
Alina Habba appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show Thursday to say she’s opening an investigation into Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over the Immigrant Trust Directive, a state order that bars state and local police officers from becoming de facto immigration agents.
“We are to take all criminal, violent criminals and criminals, out of this country and completely enforce federal law, and anybody who does get in that way, in the way of what we are doing, which is not political, it is simply against crime, will be charged in the state of New Jersey for obstruction, for concealment, and I will come after them hard. Those investigations will start immediately,” Habba told Hannity.
A normal prosecutor would probably keep this under wraps so her targets wouldn’t know from minute one that they’re being investigated. But for all we know, there is no actual investigation. Habba, clearly reveling in the attention this high-profile appointment has granted her, wanted to say something that would make headlines, so she did. I wouldn’t be surprised if her on-air threat is as far as this alleged investigation goes.
That Habba is targeting Murphy and Platkin for the Immigrant Trust Directive is not a surprise. Anti-immigration hard-liners like Habba have twisted efforts like the directive to claim that it does something it does not. It does not bar police from working with immigrant agents to arrest suspected criminals. What it does is prevent local cops from seeing a brown person on the street and asking for their papers. But the facts about the directive are not important for Habba; what’s important is she can use it to promise retribution for her — and President Trump’s — political foes.
Multiple judges have rejected legal challenges to the Immigrant Trust Directive, including one judge appointed by President Trump himself.
Murphy was asked about Habba’s claim on a podcast recorded Friday. His response was fairly muted considering Habba basically threatened to arrest him, but at least he defended his administration’s efforts to protect the countless immigrants living in New Jersey who have done nothing wrong.
“We go after criminals hard, period, full stop, regardless of their immigration status. What we don’t do is we don’t go after somebody for jaywalking or where there’s no probable cause of a crime. And we’re very clear about that,” Murphy said.
Platkin, speaking at an unrelated press conference in Newark, was a bit more knives-out when asked about Habba.
“I hope she starts doing her job,” Platkin said.
Seems unlikely. The U.S. attorney gig is a plum appointment, but it’s probably a bit of a slog overseeing nearly 200 attorneys and handling some complicated cases. That’s probably why we didn’t see a lot of Habba’s predecessors, Craig Carpenito and Philip Sellinger, yet Habba is out here cosplaying as a cop for the New York Post and targeting Democrats on Fox News. That sounds a lot more fun than doing work.
Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, told me Habba’s threat against Murphy and Platkin is in line with the Trump administration’s focus on TV ratings and viral social media posts rather than governing. It’s also part of a broader attempt by the administration to make sure their opponents know they could end up in jail or, if possible, deported.
“They’ll go after political opponents, whether those are individuals, whether those are student protestors, whether those are institutions like law firms and universities, or whether those are state governments,” Torres said

Kay Ivey touted in a post on X Friday that a Honduran man in the state without authorization was arrested in a string of traffic stops intended to reduce violent crimes.
Roberto Steven Martinez Benavides was charged with second-degree forgery in Montgomery on Tuesday in “an operation concerning the delivery of a vehicle for purchase with a fraudulent VIN and fraudulent title.”
Amanda Wasden, director of external affairs for the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, said in an email that the Metro Area Crime Suppression Unit (MACS) helped the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) by conducting a traffic stop on the vehicle with the alleged fraudulent VIN.
Benavides is being held in the Montgomery County Jail. He has a hold for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) so that HSI can determine if he is eligible for deportation or further action.
“Another strong week for Alabama’s Metro Area Crime Suppression Unit in our Capital City — 63 traffic stops, 51 arrest warrants and 15 other arrests. One individual arrested is an illegal. We’ve turned him over to the feds to be deported,” Ivey posted on X.
MACS is a coalition of local, state and federal agencies that work to reduce violent crimes and “seek to obtain prosecutions for violations such as organized crime, drug conspiracy, robbery, motor vehicle theft and firearms violations.”

(Photo by Mary Swander)By this time in the evening, we thought the fire had to be out. So, when I drove over the top of the hill, we were surprised. Flames shot up from the top of the barn roof. Smoke hung in the Saturday night air, turning the darkness into a thick ashen fog that permeated the Amish homestead — the barn, house, shed, and greenhouses, all white buildings clustered tightly together, clinging to each other in a fearful embrace.
Lights from nine different small-town volunteer fire department trucks lit up the sky, their beams illuminating the scene. Police cars, parked along the gravel road, flashed their siren strobe lights silently, but furiously around and around: red, red, blue, red, blue, red. Still more fire trucks rolled into the farm yard, carrying huge tanks of water. The volunteers had set up and filled large plastic swimming pools, dipping their hoses down beneath the surface, suctioning water, and spraying it on the barn.
I parked across the street on a narrow gravel lane, wedging my car next to the ditch to allow the buggies enough room to pass. The Kauffmans, Glen and his two young sons, poured out of my car and disappeared into the darkness. I headed toward the fire, but the smoke was too much for me, so I stayed on the edge of the crowd and watched men, women and children trying to help with anything they could do to dampen the flames.
  (Photo by Mary Swander)
At least a hundred Amish men were working right along with the small-town volunteers. Their faces smudged with soot, they anticipated each other’s actions. Earlier that afternoon, they had moved the 40 milk cows into an adjacent shed. A neighbor had appeared with a portable vacuum milking machine and chores were done as if nothing unusual were happening.
Now the big chore was to stop the fire. The first level of the barn might be saved — the milking parlor and stanchions. But the beams in the loft were so charred, they were a total loss. The hay loft would have to be completely rebuilt. That could be done, of course. That was the easy part. Really. Getting the fire out had proven to be harder than anyone thought.
It felt like I’d stepped into William Faulkner’s story, “The Barn Burning.” The crackling barn boards, the interactions of father and sons all around. With mothers and sisters waiting on the side. But the famous Faulkner story is about class and patriarchy, money and power, lying and truth telling, loss and revenge.
“He say to tell you wood and hay kin burn.”
But here, there was only one mission: to work together to put out the fire and save a homestead, a family and their livestock, all part of a larger community. People from a radius of 20 miles were here to help. Were there tensions among these people? Of course, but they were put aside to get a job done.
Here, there was no arsonist, only sparks from a saw powered by compressed air, sparks that flew through the barn, rose up and fell down, landing on a pile of hay. That’s all it took in this dry spell. That was at 1 o’clock in the afternoon. And now at 8 p.m., the fire was still burning.
“I thought the fire would be under control by now,” Glen said, finding me at the edge of the crowd. “They need more men to help. Can you take the boys home and bring my respirator?”
We were off, down the gravel to the black top, dropping the children at home, donning my head lamp to search for Glen’s respirator hanging from a nail above his workbench in his tool shed. I circled around to my house to grab a box of N-95 masks I had left over from Covid, and headed back to the fire.
The next couple of hours were spent fetching more respirators, fetching coffee butlers and cake pans, and returning more children to their homes. The Amish tend to have large families and they travel in units. We were in the outer reaches of my neighborhood, so I didn’t know some of the children or where they lived.
“Can you send an older child with me who can speak English?” I asked. “Or at least one who can point the way?”
We plunged into the dark night, one gravel road making a T with another.
“Okay, turn here to the right,” my 12-year-old navigator said, pointing with her hand. “Now a sharp left.”
We coasted along in the dark, the farmyards and houses dark without electricity or lights. Barking dogs crawled out of their little houses to greet me with suspicion.
I pulled up in front of one house where my car was recognized as the bearer of bad news.
“Oh, no,” I heard the grandma on the porch. She knew it spelled trouble when I arrived at 10 p.m.
“Everything’s all right,” I called. “They just need another coffee pot.”
“Fire out?”
“Not quite.”
“You gave me quite a fright.”
Back at the barn, Amish men were up in the loft, trying to pitch the hay down to the ground where the fire fighters doused it with water. The men in the loft had managed to unwrap all the small square bales, but when they dove into the loose hay with their pitch forks, it just burst into flames. For another hour, the men pitched and battled the flames, pitched and battled until the fire was better under control. Inside the barn, the flames were extinguished, most of the roof gone, the rafters looking like crumbling skeletal bones. Outside, the hay was still smoldering on the ground, emitting a steady stream of smoke.

Around 11 p.m., the workers began to drift across the road into a neighbor’s garage for supper. Five banquet tables held pots of chili, crackers, cinnamon rolls, carrots, celery sticks and dip, pies, cakes and cookies, all freshly baked that afternoon. Their clothes filled with the smell of smoke, the men teetered on one leg, then the other, too exhausted to talk, shoveling up the desserts with plastic forks.
Many of these same men would return on Monday morning to start to rebuild the barn. They wouldn’t even have to call a frolic, the Amish word for a barn raising. The men would know to come with their tool belts strapped around their waists. The work would be completed by Tuesday noon.
I hung at the edge of the garage. Above, the stars began to shine through the cloud of smoke. In seven hours, it would be an early spring morning with the robins and cardinals beginning to sing.
“Please, have some supper,” one of the women beckoned me to the table.
In Faulkner’s story, Sarty, the young protagonist, left his dead father and his family behind, walking into the woods.
“He went on down the hill, toward the dark woods within which the liquid silver voices of the birds called unceasing–the rapid and urgent beating of the urgent and quiring heart of the late spring night. He did not look back.”
Glen returned my box of N95 Covid masks and thanked me. The masks were filled with soot but stacked, their elastics stretched, one cradling the other, back in the small cardboard box.
“Join us,” the woman repeated.
At last, I stepped into the garage and picked up a bowl of chili, hunger and fatigue suddenly washing over me, the warm liquid effortlessly sliding down my throat.

CHICAGO — Christopher Katz didn’t question why he began receiving $300 weekly payments from an executive at Chicago-based red-light camera company SafeSpeed in the summer of 2019 — despite not yet having sat for a formal interview or done any work.

He didn’t question why his first check was made out from an entirely different company, Presidio Capital LLC. Nor did he raise concerns when SafeSpeed’s co-founder, Omar Maani, agreed to send the subsequent payments via CashApp, and not the company where Katz believed he'd just gotten a job, even though he wasn’t entirely sure what the job was.

Katz was 23 and about to start school at the Illinois Institute of Technology, pursuing a degree in architecture. He needed “some money coming in,” as he put it to a federal jury on Friday, and took Maani at his word that “work would come eventually,” though he’d never met the man and only ever had two phone conversations with him.

When Maani told Katz he’d hired him to “help out” State Sen. Emil Jones III, with whom Katz had interned twice in the past, Katz was “unsure” what he meant, according to his testimony Friday. But according to prosecutors, Katz’s no-work gig with Maani was a bribe Jones had accepted in exchange for agreeing to limit legislation he’d proposed that Maani viewed as harmful to his business.

“The main thing: Take care of my intern,” Jones, D-Chicago, told Maani as the pair dined at a Chicago steakhouse in July 2019. “That’s it.”

Maani, who was secretly recording the dinner for the FBI, followed his handler’s instructions when he asked Jones how much he could contribute for the senator’s upcoming campaign fundraiser.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” Jones said after Maani pushed him to come up with a number. “But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office and I'm trying to find him another job, another part-time job while he’s in school. ... Do you all have any positions available?”

Two days before that dinner, Jones had received an inquiry from Katz.

“Yo Senator,” he wrote. “What’s the word for job opportunity at Roseland Hospital?”

Katz testified Friday that at the time, he hadn’t worked for the senator’s office for roughly a year but had asked Jones for help in his search for a part-time job that summer. He’d known Jones since 2014 when he first interned in his district office after meeting the senator through his mother.

Fresh from earning his associate’s degree, Katz said he knew “tuition would be a handful” at IIT and needed to find a job. He was so “low on funds” that just the weekend before, he asked Jones for some money right after the senator asked about his plans for that Saturday night.

“U think u can slide me a lil sum thru cash app?” Katz asked Jones, referring to the same app CashApp that Maani would eventually end up paying him through later that summer.

“Thanks Senator!” Katz wrote back after Jones agreed, to which the senator said, “U welcome. I want to hang out with u.”

Reading the text messages back on a witness stand nearly six years later, Katz said “no” when Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri asked him whether he found it “surprising or curious” that his “significantly older” former boss “was looking to hang out with you at 10 p.m. at night.”

Katz told Jones he was going to a now-shuttered strip club in south suburban Harvey, but Jones didn’t go. Instead, he continued texting Katz throughout the night, sending him another $20 at Katz’s request and telling him, “I want to see u after” he left the club, but ignoring Katz’s invitation to the venue.

Instead, Katz left Jones’ 3:30 a.m. texts unanswered until finally answering “Sleep” a little after 5 a.m. The senator replied 20 minutes later with, “Naw, u up?”

“Have you ever invited an employer to a strip club with you?” Kolluri asked Katz.

“No,” he replied.

“After this, did you ever hang out with Sen. Jones at a strip club or any other social club?” Kolluri asked.

“No,” Katz said again.

But Jones had floated another hangout later in July after Maani agreed to hire Katz, though it would take another 2 ½ weeks before Maani would reach out.

“So does this mean I got the job lol,” Katz texted Jones on July 25, 2019, a week after sending an updated resume to Jones at the senator’s request.

“Lol let me know when you get a call,” Jones replied. “And when you do get the job, I wanna go to steak 48!!!”

The jury in Jones’ trial has heard about Steak 48 several times throughout the first three days of testimony. The upscale restaurant in Chicago’s posh River North neighborhood was Jones’ favorite steakhouse; he’d hosted a fundraiser there and met with Maani for dinner there twice in the summer of 2019.

The senator texted Katz again a while later.

“LMAO Omar trying to make sure I don’t file my red light camera bill anymore,” Jones wrote in his message. “He thinks steak 48 will do it.”

On Friday, Katz told Kolluri he didn’t know what legislation Jones had been referring to, or even Jones’ position on red-light cameras.

When pushed by Kolluri, Katz also acknowledged that he'd been to Steak 48 with Jones once before, to discuss job opportunities. Though Katz hadn’t remembered until the prosecutor’s prompting that he’d hung out with Jones in a social context before, he did remember that he'd ordered a ribeye.

As the jury heard on Maani’s secretly recorded videos of their dinners and from his testimony this week, Jones favored the pricey wagyu beef filet.

Both Jones and Maani ordered the imported steak at their August 12, 2019, dinner where they agreed that Katz could be paid $15 an hour for 15 to 20 hours a week.

A few days later, Maani called Jones to tell him that he planned to put Katz “on my payroll” even though “I don’t have any work for him right now.”

“I just wanted to make sure that he’s the type of kid that, you know, when he gets a check and he’s not doing anything right away, that he’s, you know, he’s not gonna be spooked by that,” Maani said on the wiretapped call. ""He’s not gonna be weird and stuff. ... Is he — would he be cool with that for a while? I mean, does he get it? Does he understand this?”

“Yeah, but um, make sure we find him some work,” Jones replied.

Maani promised to “work on getting him some” but noted that Katz “obviously needs the job” and that he “just wanted to make sure that he’s cool,” in essence asking whether Jones trusted Katz to be discreet.

“Oh yeah,” the senator said. “Definite, definite.”

Kolluri pushed Katz on whether it struck him as “irregular” that he got paid for a job he never interviewed for, despite doing no work. Katz answered “no” each time.

But Jones’ attorney, Robert Earles, focused in on Katz’s perception of the gig before he took it, pointing out that it had all the trappings of a normal job search process like providing a resume and getting paid an amount that wasn’t overly generous.

“Did $15 an hour sound like an unusual or weird amount of money to make?” Earles asked.

“No,” Katz replied.

“You thought this was gonna be a legitimate job,” Earles said, more of a statement than a question.

“Yes,” Katz answered.

After Katz left the witness stand, jurors heard from the first of three FBI agents who are expected to give testimony in the trial. The government will likely rest its case early next week, while defense attorneys told U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood they only have two witnesses — though they left the door open for Jones to take the stand himself.

(Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
Despite profiling concerns, more law agencies are joining street-level immigration enforcement

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.



Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.
Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
Private detention oversight
Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
Trump’s mass deportation plan could rely on state cooperation

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
Troubling conditions
Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)As the editor of the daily newspaper in Pierre, I operated under the rule that editors should edit and reporters should write. This was back in the day when newspapers still had staffs. I had three reporters and they kept me busy at my desk, so it was rare that I would write a news story. 
I can’t remember the exact circumstances but for some reason, one day during Bill Janklow’s second tenure as governor, I was filling in for a reporter at the Capitol and happened to ask a prominent Democrat why his party had such a hard time getting enough candidates for legislative offices. He blamed Janklow, a Republican. 
It was impossible to get candidates to run for office, the Democrat said, because they didn’t want to come to Pierre to be bullied by Janklow. 
In the next century, as a freelance writer, I was once again in Pierre, this time to cover the impeachment proceedings for Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg. During a break in the action, I asked another legislative Democrat why his party failed to field enough candidates for office. He either didn’t understand the question or didn’t want to answer it. He gave a rambling discourse about overcoming the long distances it took to get Native Americans to polling places and how voters had a tough time distinguishing between the values of South Dakota Democrats and the values of those raging liberals in Washington, D.C. 
South Dakota Democrats announce town hall meetings as frustration grows, even among some Republicans

In the most recent election, I used some of this space to praise the state Democratic Party for its efforts to find more legislative candidates than usual. This was a hollow effort, as it turned out that some of the candidates were just ballot placeholders waiting for real candidates to come along, or they simply lost interest. In any case, some of them dropped off the ballot. Democrats, as they traditionally do in this state, ceded majorities in the House and Senate before a single vote was cast in the 2024 election. 
After the 2024 election, the future didn’t seem bright for Democrats in South Dakota. They had just three of 35 seats in the Senate and six of 70 seats in the House. They don’t hold any of the statewide elected offices. But now, in the spring of 2025, they have been gifted with a first-rate recruiting tool and his name is Donald J. Trump. 
During the first months of his second term, Trump and his buddy Elon Musk have done their best to push the federal government into disarray. They’ve fired thousands of federal workers, shuttered federal offices, disrupted services to taxpayers and cut congressionally approved funding. Even usually staid South Dakotans have taken to the streets in protest. 
Now the state’s Democratic Party wants part of the action, promising a series of town hall meetings. These will be held in protest of the state’s Republican congressional delegation’s decision to follow the advice of their party leaders and stay away from the public that they serve. It seems that discretion is not only the better part of valor, it’s also a way to avoid screaming protesters upset about the future of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, federal grant cuts and any number of other Trump/Musk shenanigans that have made it look like the country is run by Keystone Kops. 
Of course people will be at these Democratic town halls to vent and organizers should let them. But they would do well to quietly take some names. Not necessarily the names of the people who complain the loudest or are the most emotional. It would be best to be on the lookout for those who are well-spoken. Perhaps even get the names of some disenchanted Republicans. 
It will be easy for Democrats to appear as the party of reason at these town halls. It should also be easy for them to use these meetings to recruit a roster of candidates to run for office as Democrats. 
The town halls are organized to ask where the state’s Republican congressional delegation has been hiding. If South Dakota Democrats turn in the same woeful effort at candidate recruitment in the next election, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to organize similar town halls to find out where their party has been hiding all these years.

David Thom has one of those jobs where sometimes, unexpectedly, the phone rings late at night. That was the case on the last Saturday in March, when it rang at 11 p.m. It was the Emmet County Sheriff’s Department, asking if his crew had access to chainsaws.
Thom is the safety and emergency management director for the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians in Harbor Springs. He and many others put those chainsaws to use, clearing debris and trees from roads and power lines damaged by ice storms that devastated the region.
“It looked like a plane had come through and just crash landed through the woods because of how evenly the trees had snapped off,” he said.
Were you in the dark? Some utility customers are eligible for power outage credits.
Thom lives on a horse farm, which lost power for almost a week. During the storm, a generator powered his house. But it wasn’t strong enough to pump water for the horses, so they had to set up garbage pails to catch rain for them.
The storm was disastrous for people who live here — and for those who bring them power.
That’s in large part because of the ice, which can add hundreds of pounds to power lines and trees.
 The damage

“We had a three-inch body of ice around lines” in some areas, said Greg Salisbury, the vice president of electric distribution engineering at Consumers Energy. “We measured a three foot chunk of that [power line], and it’s over 100 pounds for every three feet.”
Michigan is among the states with the most weather-related outages, according to a 2023 analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central. And climate scientists expect ice storms to become more common here in the coming decades.
So with existing reliability problems and more weather on the way, how should utilities adapt?
In the short term, experts say utilities should focus on forecasting weather and immediate response. In the long term, utilities and lawmakers need to prioritize upgrading the grid. And some say policies need to speed up that change.
The utilities in northwest lower Michigan dealing with the fallout include Great Lakes Energy, Presque Isle Gas & Electric and Consumers Energy.
Great Lakes Energy and Presque Isle, which are smaller, didn’t respond to an interview request in time for this story.
On April 7, Presque Isle said it had “substantially restored” its main lines.
“This is significant progress, because these lines are the backbone of our system, and once they are energized, that allows us to branch out and connect more sections of line to individual neighborhoods and homes,” the update said.
Presque Isle has restored power to over 70% of its members as of Thursday morning.
“It’s being called the storm of the century, and being compared to a hurricane that wouldn’t leave,” said Shaun Lamp, Great Lakes Energy president and CEO, in a video posted to the utility’s website.
He called the damage “staggering.”
“To put things in perspective, our construction teams typically replace about 800 poles each year. In the last three days alone, we’ve replaced that exact same number,” he said on April 6.
Consumers Energy, the state’s second-largest utility, hired a staff meteorologist last year, and that expertise helps prepare for extreme weather, Salisbury said: The utility was warned of the storm four days in advance, and it was able to bring in extra crews, stage supplies and set up response centers. But it was still hit hard. In all, about 126,000 of its northern Michigan customers lost power during the initial waves of ice and days of falling trees.
“It was just a crushing impact on the trees and the electric infrastructure,” Salisbury said. The heavy ice didn’t melt for days, and along with the high winds, it was “beyond the realm of even our latest and strongest design standards that we’ve now had in place for the last three years.”
Further south in the state, the utility also had to respond to thunderstorms and tornadoes, complicating their operations.

 What now?

Consumers Energy is updating its Reliability Roadmap, a more than 180-page, five-year plan that outlines a wide range of prevention measures that include everything from trimming trees to replacing poles to better monitoring for outages.
And prevention is key, Salisbury said: “These are very expensive events for our customers to pay for when we have to fix things after they break. It is much, much cheaper — at least 50% cheaper — for us to do this work of hardening and automating and in some cases, burying electric lines in advance with a plan.”
In rural areas, burying electric lines can be relatively fast and simple, and is often the best approach, he said. And updating their operations needs to happen faster.
Planning for extreme weather allowed them “to restore more under difficult conditions faster than we ever have,” he said. “But we know we’ve got to keep getting better, because the weather is going to change faster than we’re going to be able to make the grid resilient enough to withstand something as extreme as what just happened.”
Upgrades, like burying power lines, are expensive. And utilities have come under scrutiny for poor performance even as they’ve increased rates.
Just last month, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved a rate increase of $153.8 million for Consumers Energy, which is expected to increase customers’ bills by about 3%.
The money will go toward reducing outages and improving the grid. Most of it will pay for “clearing trees from over 8,000 miles of power lines, addressing the No. 1 cause of power outages in Michigan,” according to utility spokesperson Brian Wheeler.
But critics, like Attorney General Dana Nessel, argue that continually raising costs isn’t fair to customers, and that doing so allows utilities to ask for higher rates before people can evaluate the impact of previous hikes.
(Michigan Public Service Commission has information on electric reliability throughout the state.)
Jonathan Overpeck, the dean of the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability, said big, investor-owned utilities have to answer to their shareholders, and that doesn’t always align with what’s best for their customers or the climate.
“They have to either provide the service the public needs, or the public has to demand a better model,” he said. “And I think that’s the tension that’s going on right now. And it’s distorted by money, of course. Everyone has their lobbyists, but particularly investor-owned utilities have more money to lobby with.” For instance, in 2023 Bridge Michigan reported that legislators had received $2 million from DTE and Consumers over the previous five years.
That can make it difficult for politicians to tackle climate change more quickly and make power systems more reliable, Overpeck said. He thinks there should be more incentives and regulations for utilities to not only improve reliability, but also move toward electrification.
Making such change affordable could also require more out-of-the-box thinking, such as community power generation and distribution, according to Overpeck, but some of those ideas haven’t really caught on in Michigan yet.
State energy regulators have wrestled with such questions. As part of a clean energy initiative, for example, they just agreed to speed up the review of DTE Electric’s plans to test out programs in areas like reliability and distributed power generation.
Consumers Energy has evaluated the risks posed by climate change before; in 2022, it released a report on those risks, grid planning, and reducing emissions through moves like retiring its last coal plant this year.
Improving the grid in the face of more events like the ice storm will also rely on federal and state funding programs, said Seth Guikema, a professor at the University of Michigan. (Part of his research is funded by Consumers Energy.)
Still, utilities are in a tough position.
“We want cheap power, and it’s a lot cheaper to keep using the above-ground lines than to bury them,” he said. “It’s overhead. If it gets hammered by a storm every five to ten years and we have to fix it and people are without power for a week, okay, that’s a cost-benefit analysis that essentially the Public Service Commission has to do. So part of this is a policy question.”
At some point, somebody’s going to have to spend more money to make a more resilient grid, he said. “The question is, who’s going to spend that?”
Meanwhile, Overpeck, the dean at University of Michigan’s sustainability school, said lawmakers and utilities need to answer questions like that faster, as the climate changes and more storms threaten the region.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ice-power-line-1024x709.jpeg,,,2025-04-12 08:00:52.087728

FEMA has denied North Carolina’s request to continue matching 100% of the state’s spending on Hurricane Helene recovery.
In a letter to Gov. Josh Stein on Friday, acting FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton wrote that the agency had determined the full cost share was “not warranted.”
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement.
“I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days. Six months later, the people of western North Carolina are working hard to get back on their feet; they need FEMA to help them get the job done.”
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The agency’s decision means that North Carolina will lose a critical share of federal assistance in what’s expected to be a years-long rebuild process.
After Helene struck in late September, the Biden administration gave the green light for FEMA to reimburse North Carolina on 100% of disaster relief assistance — particularly with debris removal and emergency protective services. The cost-share allowed state officials to plow ahead on time-sensitive needs more quickly.
In December, FEMA also set the federal cost-share for all other categories of assistance at 90%. But the 100% period for debris cleanup and other services was set to end after six months.
Local and state officials have requested repeatedly that it be extended — preferably another six months — in order to speed up recovery from the deadliest hurricane in state history. But the agency, now under the authority of a president who has floated the idea of dismantling it altogether, will no longer shoulder full costs for that work.
U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, the Republican congressman who represents western North Carolina, told the Asheville Citizen-Times that Stein’s extension request had been “unprecedented.”
“Instead, I’m focusing on other ways I can make a tangible difference in helping the citizens of western North Carolina recover more quickly,” he said in a statement to the newspaper.
“This includes continuing to assist survivors with FEMA casework and working with the administration to find additional avenues to alleviate the financial stress our communities and the state of North Carolina are facing.”
The state can appeal FEMA’s ruling within 30 days.

(Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
Immigrants without legal status must now register and carry documents, after court order

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.

Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.












They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director




Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
Federal judge extends block on Idaho immigration bill

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions for ICE detention centers

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

(Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)North Dakota legislators have been wrestling with a pesticide bill backed by agricultural groups that would make it harder for people to win cancer liability lawsuits against the farm chemical industry. 
House Bill 1318 would shield the maker of Roundup and other farm chemical manufacturers from lawsuits from people who say they were not adequately warned about potential dangers of the chemicals. The bill tries to make clear that the product label approved by the federal Environmental Protection Agency gives consumers sufficient warning about any possible hazards. 
Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto, the maker of Roundup, has been hit with lawsuits from people who have cancer and contend they were not adequately warned about exposure to the herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate. 
Sarah Hall Lovas, representing the North Dakota Agriculture Consultants Association and the North Dakota Grain Growers Association, says the bill is needed to ensure that farmers have access to farm chemicals such as Roundup. 
Opponents of the bill say it provides too much legal protection for the chemical manufacturers. 
Jake Schmitz of Fargo said the dangers of chemicals are sometimes not known until decades later. With the EPA being immune to lawsuits and a potential shield in place for manufacturers, the health care costs associated with a hazardous chemical would impact taxpayers, he said. 
“It’s going to fall back on Medicaid and Medicare to take care of these people now that they’ve got the cancer diagnosis,” Schmitz said. “So this is going to end up, over time, costing the state of North Dakota a good amount of money.”

The next step for House Bill 1318 is a vote by the North Dakota Senate. The bill passed the House unanimously in January but has been heavily debated in the Senate Agriculture and Veterans Affairs Committee.
Committee chair Sen. Larry Luick, R-Fairmount, said there has been a lot of input from both supporters and opponents on what is seen as a national issue. Luick, who is a farmer, said he understands that farmers need pesticides for crop production but also realizes people have concerns about cancer and what is going into their food. 
After about two weeks of deliberations, the committee on Thursday added an amendment to the bill and gave it a do-pass recommendation. 
If approved by the Senate, the bill would go back to the House. 
While Roundup has been a big part of the discussion, the bill applies to all registered pesticides in North Dakota.
The bill has been the subject of television ads and large newspaper ads from a group called the Modern Ag Alliance that is actively supporting similar bills in multiple states.

The bill also has the support of the North Dakota Ag Coalition, which has more than 45 member organizations. It officially supported only one other bill this legislative session. 
Among the members are the North Dakota Farmers Union, the state’s largest ag group, which suggested some of the amended language in the Senate committee.
“It was important to us to ensure that the scope of the bill was specific, and the amendment that the Ag Committee adopted achieves that,” Matt Perdue, policy analyst for the North Dakota Farmers Union said in an interview. 
Nancy Johnson, executive director of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association, said the huge payouts that Bayer and other ag chemical companies have made in product liability cases is hindering the ability of those companies to invest in developing new, safer alternatives. 
“It really is aimed at keeping tools in the farmer’s tool box,” she said. 
In her testimony on the bill, Lovas cites a 2022 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that threatened to end the use of glyphosate. The EPA reviewed the glyphosate label and stuck with its position that the product does not cause cancer. 
Germany-based Bayer has been battered by court decisions from consumers who contend the product does cause cancer. A jury last month ordered Bayer to pay more than $2 billion in a Georgia case.
Schmitz is a chiropractor and nutritionist who grew up on a farm near Williston. He said his father and grandfather both died of cancer. 
He cited the fact that the International Agency for Research on Cancer has concluded that glyphosate probably does cause cancer as a reason to oppose the shield law.

The Dakota Resource Council, the North Dakota Wildlife Federation and North Dakota Association for Justice are among other opponents of the bill.
Schmitz and Lovas agree that the bill would still allow for lawsuits against a manufacturer for things such as a bad batch of the chemical or other product defects. A property owner could still sue an applicator for an issue such as the product drifting into an unwanted area. 
In an article earlier this year, the National Agriculture Law Center said it may be up to the U.S. Supreme Court to decide if such shield laws are valid. 
Bayer’s website says it is also hopeful for a Supreme Court ruling in favor of laws such as the one proposed in North Dakota. 
The National Agriculture Law Center concludes that “Plaintiffs in states with a pesticide liability limitation bill would likely face a more challenging litigation landscape than in states without such a bill. However, the exact impacts will be unclear until such a bill becomes law.”

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Tired of waiting for federal action on the nation’s $36 trillion national debt, governors are banding together to press for state action. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis met with Idaho Gov. Brad Little on March 24 to discuss adding a balanced budget amendment to the U. S. Constitution. From the beginning, the governors were clear that they are asking states to urge lawmakers to vote for a constitutional convention. The main focus of the convention would be federal fiscal accountability.
DeSantis told reporters during the joint Idaho press conference:  “I am convinced that you are not going to have Congress all of a sudden change its behavior for the long term. I think the reason we’ve gotten into this with respect to fiscal is because there are certain incentives for the people that are in Washington to behave the way they do. And we need to change those incentives.”
Florida Gov. DeSantis visits Idaho in push for U.S. Constitution balanced budget amendment

He continued: “If Idaho and Montana join the fight, that gets us to 29 there’s a couple other states that are on the precipice as well. You need 34 states to trigger Article Five, where you would actually write an amendment and then eventually send it to the states for ratification.”
Gov. Little posted on X: “The freight train of federal spending has to stop. Under Donald Trump’s leadership the size of the federal government is being reduced, now it’s time for Congress to put an end to the ever-growing debt. Grateful to Ron DeSantis for his efforts promoting a balanced budget!”
DeSantis acknowledged the federal fiscal problem has bipartisan blame: “As a proud conservative and as a proud Republican, I have no problem pointing out the truth that this is both parties in Washington that have created this mess. As much as I’d like to come up here and blame the Democrats, the fact of the matter is it’s happened under both parties.”
During the 2025 legislative session, Idaho lawmakers rejected three different applications for a constitutional convention. They were for the purposes of balancing the budget and imposing fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, and limiting the terms of office for the federal government’s officials and members of Congress.
Gov. DeSantis continued his balanced budget tour on March 24 by visiting with Gov. Greg Gianforte in Montana to promote the same initiative. Montana also proposed an application for a convention with Senate Joint Resolution 4, but it too was rejected.
Gov. Gianforte stated: “In Washington, they’ve been spending like drunken sailors – that is not what our founders envisioned, we need a change, and fast, to prevent our children and grandchildren from inheriting this mess and we can’t expect Washington to impose permanent fiscal restraints on itself. That’s why we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.”
According to a recent poll, 68% of Americans are in favor of a constitutional convention to propose amendments that would establish term limits, impose spending ceilings, and curb the power of the federal government. The federal government’s $36 trillion in federal debt equates to roughly $106,000 per person in the country. In 2024, the United States spent more on interest costs than on any federal program except Social Security. This problem needs to be resolved quickly.
There are numerous reasons why this problem must be addressed quickly. A large and growing national debt puts the U.S. at a greater risk for a fiscal crisis, being vulnerable to foreign creditors, and reducing public and private investment. Another massive reason is that funds spent on interest payments for the federal debt are not available for infrastructure, defense or other important national priorities.
In 2020, the average interest rate on America’s debt was 2.344%, and it has grown to 3.211% as of this year. In April 2024, U.S. Bank estimated that the federal government was on pace to acquire $1 trillion in new debt every 100 days. If a national emergency were to happen, the government wouldn’t have any other choice but to borrow or print new money. This is why balancing a federal budget is a must. If 49 out of 50 states have to balance their own respective budgets, why shouldn’t the federal government be required too?
On March 26, Moody’s Investor Service also published a study on U.S. debt. It originally changed its rating from “stable” to “negative” when looking at the U. S. credit score in November of 2023, and the findings of this recent study reached the same conclusion. It found that federal policy decisions could lead to worsening debt and higher interest rates for the U.S.
The study said: ”The potential negative credit impact of sustained high tariffs, unfunded tax cuts and significant tail risks to the economy have diminished prospects that these formidable strengths will continue to offset widening fiscal deficits and declining debt affordability.”
Critics claim that the vehicle of a constitutional convention will result in a “runaway convention” that will meddle with the entire Constitution. But there is a high threshold of a 3/4 vote, or 38 states needed in order to ratify an amendment to the Constitution to ensure order and stability. Supporters of a constitutional convention acknowledge that there is a strong possibility that a constitutional convention won’t happen. If there are enough applications, one stream of thought is that Congress will propose appropriate ratification to send to the states, rather than having the state legislatures call the shots.
The last time the federal budget was balanced was in 2001. Spending has gotten so out of control that states must step up to act. This push by Govs. Little, Gianforte and DeSantis shows that there is a real desire and momentum for a constitutional convention. Lawmakers in Idaho, Montana and around the country should seriously consider moving forward with their applications to impose fiscal restraints on the federal government.

(Rae Ellen Bichell/KFF Health News)This story comes to Colorado Newsline from KFF Health News.
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. — On a Friday after school, 6-year-old Esa Rodrigues had unraveled a ball of yarn, spooked the pet cat, polled family members about their favorite colors, and tattled on a sibling for calling her a “butt-face mole rat.”
Next, she was laser-focused on prying open cherry-crisp-flavored lip gloss with her teeth.
“Yes!” she cried, twisting open the cap. Esa applied the gloopy, shimmery stuff in her bedroom, where a large transgender pride flag hung on the wall.
Esa said the flag makes her feel “important” and “happy.” She’d like to take it down from the wall and wear it as a cape.
Her parents questioned her identity at first, but not anymore. Before, their anxious child dreaded going to school, bawled at the barbershop when she got a boy’s haircut, and curled into a fetal position on the bathroom floor when she learned she would never get a period.
Now, that child is happily bounding up a hill, humming to herself, wondering aloud if fairies live in the little ceramic house she found perched on a stone.

Her mom, Brittni Packard Rodrigues, wants this joy and acceptance to stay. Depending on a combination of Esa’s desire, her doctors’ recommendations, and when puberty sets in, that might require puberty blockers, followed by estrogen, so that Esa can grow into the body that matches her being.
“In the long run, blockers help prevent all of those surgeries and procedures that could potentially become her reality if we don’t get that care,” Packard Rodrigues said.
The medications known as puberty blockers are widely used for conditions that include prostate cancer, endometriosis, infertility, and puberty that sets in too early. Now, the Trump administration is seeking to limit their use specifically for transgender youth.
Esa’s home state of Colorado has long been known as a haven for gender-affirming care, which the state considers legally protected and an essential health insurance benefit. Medical exiles have moved to Colorado for such treatment in the past few years. As early as the 1970s, the town of Trinidad became known as “the sex-change capital of the world” when a cowboy-hat-wearing former Army surgeon, Stanley Biber, made his mark performing gender-affirming surgeries for adults.
Colorado bills would add protections for transgender people

On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order refuting the existence of transgender people by saying it is a “false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.” The following week, he issued another order calling puberty blockers and hormones for anyone under age 19 a form of chemical “mutilation” and “a stain on our Nation’s history.” It directed agencies to take steps to ensure that recipients of federal research or education grants stop providing it.
Subsequently, health care organizations in Colorado; California; Washington, D.C.; and elsewhere announced they would preemptively comply. In Colorado, that included three major health care organizations: Children’s Hospital Colorado, Denver Health, and UCHealth. At the end of January and in early February, the three systems announced changes to the gender-affirming care they provide to patients under 19, effective immediately: no new hormone or puberty blocker prescriptions for patients who hadn’t had them before, limited or no prescription renewals for those who had, and no surgeries, though Children’s Hospital had never offered it, and such surgery is rare among teens: For every 100,000 trans minors, fewer than three undergo surgery.
Children’s Hospital and Denver Health resumed offering puberty blockers and hormones on Feb. 24 and Feb. 19, respectively, after Colorado joined a U.S. District Court lawsuit in Washington state. The court concluded that Trump’s orders relating to gender “discriminate on the basis of transgender status and sex.” It granted a preliminary injunction blocking them from taking effect in the four states involved in the lawsuit.
Surgeries, however, have not resumed. Denver Health said it will “continue its pause on gender-affirming surgeries for patients under 19 due to patient safety and given the uncertainty of the legal and regulatory landscape.”
  Esa Rodrigues asked her parents to hang a trans pride flag above her bed. She says she’d like to wear it as a cape. (Rae Ellen Bichell/KFF Health News)
UCHealth has resumed neither medication nor surgery for those under 19. “Our providers are awaiting a more permanent decision from federal courts that may resolve the uncertainty around providing this care,” spokesperson Kelli Christensen wrote.
Trans youth and their families said the court ruling and the two Colorado health systems’ decisions to resume treatments haven’t resolved matters. It has bought them time to stockpile prescriptions, to try to find private practice physicians with the right training to monitor blood work and adjust prescriptions accordingly, and, for some, to work out the logistics of moving to another state or country.
The Trump administration has continued to press health providers beyond the initial executive orders by threatening to withhold or cancel federal money awarded to them. In early March, the Health Resources & Services Administration said it would review funding for graduate medical education at children’s hospitals.
KFF Health News requested comment from White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai but did not receive a response. HHS deputy press secretary Emily Hilliard responded with links to two prior press releases.
Seeking jobs in New Zealand
Medical interventions are just one type of gender-affirming care, and the process to get treatment is long and thorough. Researchers have found that, even among those with private insurance, transgender youth aren’t likely to receive puberty blockers and hormones. Most gender-affirming breast reduction surgeries performed on men and boys are done on cisgender — not transgender — patients.
Kai, 14, wishes he could have gone on puberty blockers. He lives in Centennial, a Denver suburb. KFF Health News is not using his full name because his family is worried about him being harassed or targeted.
Kai got his period when he was 8 years old. By the time he realized he was transgender, in middle school, it was too late to start puberty blockers.
His doctors prescribed birth control to suppress his periods, so he wouldn’t be reminded each month of his gender dysphoria. Then, once he turned 14, he started taking testosterone.
Kai said if he didn’t have hormone therapy now, he would be a danger to himself.
“Being able to say that I’m happy in my body, and I get to be happy out in public without thinking everyone’s staring at me, looking at me weird, is such a huge difference,” he said.
His mom, Sherry, said she is happy to see Kai relax into the person he is.
Sherry, who asked to use her middle name to prevent her family from being identified, said she started stockpiling testosterone the moment Trump got elected but hadn’t thought about what impact there would be on the availability of birth control. Yet after the executive orders, that prescription, too, became tenuous. Sherry said Kai’s doctor at UCHealth had to set up a special meeting to confirm the doctor could keep prescribing it.
So, for now, Kai has what he needs. But to Sherry, that is cold comfort.
“I don’t think that we are very safe,” she said. “These are just extensions.”
The family is coming up with a plan to leave the country. If Sherry and her husband can get jobs in New Zealand, they’ll move there. Sherry said such mobility is a privilege that many others don’t have.
  David, 18, is a college student in Gunnison, Colorado. Even though he’s an adult, his ability to get a mastectomy in this state evaporated following executive orders from the Trump administration. He’ll have to wait until he’s 19. (Rae Ellen Bichell/KFF Health News)
‘This is who I am’
For example, David, an 18-year-old student at Western Colorado University in the Rocky Mountain town of Gunnison. He asked to be identified only by his middle name because he worries he could be targeted in this conservative, rural town.
David doesn’t have a passport, but even if he did, he doesn’t want to leave Gunnison, he said. He is studying geology, is learning to play the bass, and has a good group of friends. He has plans to become a paleontologist.
His dorm room shelves are scattered with his essentials: fossils, Old Spice deodorant, microwave macaroni and cheese. But there are no mirrors. David said he got in the habit of avoiding them.
“For the longest time, I just had so much body dysphoria and dysmorphia that it can be kind of hard to look in the mirror,” David said. “But when I do, most of the time, I see something that I really like.”
He’s been taking testosterone for three years, and the hormone helped him grow a beard. In January, his doctor at Denver Health was told to stop prescribing it. His mom drove hours from her home to Gunnison to deliver the news in person.
That prescription is back on track now, but the mastectomy he’d planned for this summer isn’t. He’d hoped to have adequate recovery time before sophomore year. But he doesn’t know anyone in Colorado who would perform it until he is 19. He could easily get surgery to enhance his breasts, but he must seek surgical options in other states to reduce or remove them.
“Colorado as a state was supposed to be a safe haven,” said his mother, Louise, who asked to be identified by her middle name. “We have a law that makes it a right for trans people to have health care, and yet our health care systems are taking that away.”
It has taken eight years and about 10 medical providers and therapists to get David this close to the finish line. That’s a big deal after living through so many years of dysphoria and dysmorphia.
“I’m still going, and I’m going to keep going, and there’s almost nothing they can do to stop me — because this is who I am,” David said. “There have always been trans people, and there always will be trans people.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)One of President Trump’s 111 record setting executive actions, 25 proclamations and 27 memoranda called for election security. Such an action could have been initiated by our 535 congressional delegates, but they didn’t. Seeing Trump 2.0 in action, Congress could have clarified the meaning of the Alien Enemies Act, but they didn’t. The list goes on regarding Congress’s inaction.
Since Jan. 20, Congress has only managed to pass a budget resolution package. It’s not surprising that only 29%of Americans approve of Congress (Feb. 3-16 Gallup poll).
The Trump administration is well aware of our do little-to-nothing Congress and is testing the waters to see how far they can go even when many actions are alleged to be illegal and/or anti-constitutional (witness 162 lawsuits against Trump 2.0 since Jan. 20). So far, Mr. Trump is not worried since Congress has been sitting on their duff watching chaos and uncertainty reign with a majority of citizens, small business owners, corporate CEOs, investors and our global trading partners and allies.
With our do little-to-nothing Congress and Mr. Trump, Elon Musk, JD Vance and 15 cabinet members ripping apart our federal agencies, it’s no wonder a majority of Americans believe we’re in a constitutional crisis (Economist/YouGov polling).
Trump has already fulfilled his presidential campaign promise to be a dictator on day one, prosecute his rivals, punish critical media, limit citizen’s free speech rights, pardon over 1,500 Jan. 6 convicted criminals – who assaulted 140 capitol police officers — and fire ~54,000 civil servants, which came straight out of the right-wing extremist Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 playbook for Trump to implement.
Maybe – just maybe — there are some things our 535 congressional representatives could do … if they wanted to.
Most citizens know that on April 2, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on all countries (except Russia) by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Did you know under federal law Congress has the ability to cancel national emergencies declared by the president? Did you know that in Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, the power to lay and collect tariffs vests with Congress and not the President?
The conservative-based Wall Street Journal editorial board took a swipe at Trump on April 2 by stating “Trump’s tariffs are no emergency” and the law “doesn’t give him power to impose sweeping tariffs.” Way back on Jan. 31, the Journal’s editorial board noted that if Trump followed through with his tariff idea it would create the “dumbest trade war in history.”
Paul Sracic, an adjunct fellow at the conservative-oriented Hudson Institute think tank and Youngstown State University professor of politics and international relations, stated in an April 7 Wall Street Journal op-ed, “This [Trump] expansion of executive authority [tariffs] clearly oversteps the boundaries set by the Supreme Court’s major questions doctrine. Prominent in recent judicial rulings, the doctrine holds that federal agencies – and the executive branch – can’t make decisions of vast economic and political significance without clear congressional authorization.”
For starters, maybe Congress should act upon Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution … if they wanted to.
What are your thoughts of Congress passing – if they wanted to — legislation to further limit executive powers?
USAID is the foremost tool of American soft power, counter terrorism and bolster food security and public health to 160 countries. We know Trump abolished 83%of USAID’s contracts and $50 billion in humanitarian assistance around the world. So, should Congress – if they want to – join the traditional Reagan-like GOP Senators such as Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Lyndsey Graham (S.C.), John Thune (S.D.) and John Curtis (Utah) plus Secretary of State Marco Rubio (Fmr. Sen., Fla.) who support America’s role of foreign aid?
Does it make sense to you that Congress could investigate and prosecute any member of the federal government who violates the Hatch Act, enacted in 1939, to ensure the non-partisan administration of federal programs, protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace and ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit, not political affiliation …. if they wanted to?
So, when it’s all said and done about Congress – and usually more is said than is done — what do you think? Should our 535 congressional delegates continue in their do little-to-nothing endeavors as if everything going on in Trump 2.0 is in accordance with our U.S. Constitution or act upon and possibly even expand their responsibilities to America’s 340 million citizens?
Oh, one final note: all 435 U.S. House of Representatives will be up for re-election on Nov. 3, 2026 and 33 of the Senate seats will also be up for grabs; 13 currently held by Democrats and 20 held by Republicans … just saying.

He’s equipped with a digital camera and high-powered lens, and during the past week he captured moments throughout the building. I’ve assembled a batch for you today, to appreciate the people and work that occurs in Topeka every session.
As I tell Kansans repeatedly during Kansas Reflector town halls across the state, the Statehouse belongs to you. Legislators only serve at your pleasure. You require no appointment to visit, no reason other than idle curiosity. The more folks who visit, the more who treat the magnificent place as their birthright (because it is), the better for all of us.

The 2025 legislative session was a slog. Perhaps the most important, fatiguing and demoralizing 90 days in a generation. But there was one last thing to do: The Maryland Matters staff fanned out to talk to lawmakers, advocates, lobbyists and others who say they know what’s going on about who won, who lost and who more or less broke even.
In many cases, the answer to our question was another question: Did anyone really win this year?
Matt Losak, executive director for the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, said he found it hard to pick winners, given the tight budget and unanticipated moves from the Trump administration.
“It’s less like a session of winners, and more like a session of survivors,” he said earlier this week.
Even so, we managed to produce the list for 2025. We understand that these lists can be viewed in the same way as a list of “top 100 rock songs.” Some will say it’s just perception.
But this is politics, where perception is every bit as important and real as reality.
THE WINNERS
Sen. Guy Guzzone and Dels. Ben Barnes and Vanessa Atterbeary: The fiscal commitee chairs in the House and Senate have thrown some sharp elbows in recent years. But faced with the toughest budget challenge in years, they regularly worked together to craft a budget compromise without the public drama. And education advocates credit Barnes and Atterbeary for protecting funding for English-language learners, low-income and special education students, speaking out early against cuts and meeting with advocates, parents and students.
Senate President Bill Ferguson: The guiding hand on the budget crisis and energy reform, described by some as an almost governor-like figure who maintained discipline in the Senate.
  Advocates for people with developmental disabilities rallied at the State House in opposition to millions in fiscal 2026 cuts proposed by Gov. Wes. Moore (D). (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
Developmental disabilities advocates: They quickly mobilized, lobbied and brought hundreds to Annapolis to rally against some $457 million in cuts to the agency that oversees their services. Their efforts paid off, and helped claw back $292.48 million of those cuts. Advocates say the remaining $164 million cut will be painful but survivable. That they still were dealt cuts could argue for them to be bumped down to a “push,” but most who watched the effort put the DDA community squarely in the “win” column,
Transportation advocates: They got a projected $500 million annual infusion to the beleaguered Transportation Trust Fund.
Larry Hogan: Maybe he’s going to run for a third term. Maybe not. Who knows? But the Republican former governor got some help from a stilted economy, slash-and-burn budgeting in D.C., and a new cadre of tax and fee increases. So much so that Hogan might be thinking this looks a lot like 2014. And it hasn’t gone unnoticed by Democrats.
NoMoore.org: This “shadowy” anti-Moore website and social media campaign has managed to move in on the second floor of the State House and live rent-free in the heads of some of the governor’s staff, despite having less reach than Hogan’s former “Change Maryland” effort. Running battles on social media and proxy investigation requests gave oxygen to a political effort many had yet to notice.
Dels. C.T. Wilson and Brian Crosby: The duo passionately defended the energy package on the House floor, and they got several of their bills woven into the package, including regulations on solar siting, a separate electricity rate for data centers and a new long-term energy planning office. Several of those we talked to also gave a tip of the cap to Del. Lorig Charkoudian — the Montgomery Democrat has been steeped in energy policy for years, and played a prominent role this year, getting several provisions of her affordable clean energy bill into the leadership package.
Legislative Black Caucus: The 66-member caucus didn’t get everything it wanted, but it did rack up the major pieces: The Second Look Act that provides some incarcerated individuals a second chance at life; expansion of the Prescription Drug Affordability Board; reforms to the medical and geriatric parole process; and the creation of a Reparations Commission, making Maryland one of the few states to have one. The caucus also successfully pushed back against the governor’s plan to freeze funding for community schools as part of the reforms to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.
Sen. Charles Sydnor and Del. Cheryl Pasteur: The two Baltimore County Democrats offered emotional — and unexpected — testimony in suppor of the Second Look Act. They didn’t get all that they wanted in the legislation, but they received praise from colleagues and advocates for having the courage to “stand up for what’s right.”
The Maryland Licensed Beverage Association and the alcohol industry and lobby: An effort to expand beer and wine sales to grocery stores and other retailers ran into the buzz saw that is the “three-tier system” of wholesalers, distributors and retailers in Maryland. The governor’s support was a nonfactor. The issue is assured to come back, which means continued fundraising opportunities for some.
  David Shore, 18, testifies to a Senate committee on a bill that would designate chromite the official state mineral — a bill he first proposed at age 10. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
A boy and his mineral: Who doesn’t love a good underdog story? David Shore started as a 9-year-old Montgomery County boy with a dream of making chromite the official state mineral. He parlayed that into a sponsor in the House and Senate, and a pro-bono (and well known) Annapolis lobbyist. Eight short years later, we can raise a glass to Shore and to chromite (both of whom will be featured in a PBS documentary about the State House next year). May we suggest an Orange Crush, which was going to die as the official state cocktail until it was added to the chromite bill and passed with seconds to spare on Sine Die.
House and Senate Republicans: They are still heavily outnumbered, but the minority party in both chambers was praised — by non-Republicans —  for its ability to get its message out, with House Republicans getting special mention for their use of social media. The GOP also got some Democrats to vote with them on some key budget and other votes. Most notably, five Senate Democrats — Dawn Gile, Shaneka Henson, Katie Fry Hester, Carl Jackson and Mary-Dulany James — sided with Senate Republicans on a budget measure. Sen. Jack Bailey of Southern Maryland got an amendment approved that’s now included in the Second Look Act, one of the major criminal justice reform bills presented this year. Although Bailey voted against the entire measure, his amendment still made it through.
THE LOSERS
Maryland residents: A consistent theme in our reporting on this was the comment (or some variation): “Did anyone really win?” The same angst lawmakers have about federal actions weighs on the average resident and small-business owner. Worried about the economy, keeping a job, a recession? Yup, that too. Electricity costs are up and will go up again this summer. Taxpayers lucky enough to get a cut will likely not swoon over the average $60 tax refund. Same for the credit on utility bills, which is advertised as roughly $80 (broken in two payouts). Some will see more, but some will see less, as actual credits will be based on average usage. Buying a new car got more expensive, so did titling it and putting tires on it. The data and IT tax will hit everyone, not just businesses, and there’s a tax on vending machine sales. Sports gaming and cannabis taxes also went up.
Wes Moore: For the first two years, Moore capitalized on the goodwill from his historic election and a return to Democratic control of state government for the first time in eight years. He’s smart, telegenic and a charismatic speaker. The shine, however, may be wearing thin. That includes a couple of sagging (but still above 50%) job performance polls and a middling record on 2025 legislative priorities, with some bills watered down and others stripped for parts. His tax modernization proposal was recast. The governor demanded that a bill to sell beer and wine in grocery stores and other retailers land on his desk by the end of session; lawmakers deep-sixed those bills into committee drawers.
Moore’s dismount was to send an email six minutes after the close of the session in which he cited the wins, but chided the legislature for missing opportunities to make the state more business-friendly and to add nuclear to the clean energy effort. He also issued a veiled threat to not sign (veto?) bills that did not rise to his three legislative benchmarks. A number of lawmakers — Democrats — were not happy with the email.
Moore is still considered a top-tier potential presidential candidate with a donor call list and connections rivaled by few. That race is in 2028. Moore faces a re-election contest for a 2026 campaign that will begin in earnest this year. And it remains to be seen how the public will react to what was done this session.
  Renter advocates gather in Annapolis to call on lawmakers to pass Good Cause Eviction legislation. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
Renter protections: Renter protections ran up against the state’s desire to create a more developer-friendly market to address the state’s housing shortage. Efforts to pass renter protections known as “good cause” evictions fell short once again, after housing developers claimed the measure would drive new projects out of the state. Renter advocates disagree, but Senate President Bill Ferguson worries passing good cause eviction bills would affect future housing projects — making the road to passage more challenging. Other renter protection bills that did pass  were watered down as well.
House decorum: Lawmakers are no longer called on by their districts when they rise to speak. The tone and tenor of debates is more bitter and rancorous than in recent memory (see “Freedom Caucus” in Push section below). It does not bode well for 2026 and the coming election.
Parole process reform: Dels. Elizabeth Embry and N. Scott Phillips sought to reform the parole process in a state that ranks among the worst in the nation when it comes to the Black prison population. The House agreed, passing two of their parole reform parole bills. Both bill received hearings before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, they never made it to the full Senate.
Child Victims Act: It took a decade to pass landmark legislation that opened the courthouse doors for people who were abused as children in public and private institutions but time-barred from seeking civil remedies. Approval of the act forced the Archdiocese of Baltimore to seek bankruptcy protections. This year, it was the state’s turn to feel the heat as thousands of cases began to surface, a potential liability under the act of billions, if not tens of billions, of dollars — a potential budge-breaker. So lawmakers changed the law to impose lower caps on lawsuits filed after May 31, 2025. Many Democrats in committee lamented the choice they had to make. Some cried. Others stormed out. But the bill passed and heads to the governor’s desk for his signature. And the political policy arm of the Catholic Church? They publicly chided the state for being “the largest employer of child sex abusers in the state.”
AND THE PUSH
A purgatory for those who had some wins and some losses but not enough of either to put them in either of the above categories.
Local governments: The legislature pushed costs of teacher pensions and property tax assessments down onto the counties to solve its own budget issues. Then they got a helping hand in the form of the ability to increase the piggyback income tax from 3.2% to 3.3%. Only about one-third of the state’s 24 major political subdivisions are maxed out on the current cap. In the current climate, such increases could be a political mixed bag.
  Business leaders in Annapolis said a proposed tax on services makes the state less business-friendly. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)
The business community: The Democratic supermajority touts its support for small businesses while vilifying owners as bad actors and foisting fees and regulations and taxes on them, even as lawmakers and Moore look for ways to end the state’s company town dependence on the federal government. Business leaders and advocates did manage to beat a very large business-to-business sales tax proposal into a much smaller one. That effort landed on a services sales tax on IT and data that will cost everyone, not just business owners.
Del. Nino Mangione: The Baltimore County Republican somehow managed to fly under the radar enough to avoid having to answer any questions about his cousin Luigi, who faces a potential death penalty from federal prosecutors related to the killing of a United Healthcare executive.
Environmentalists: For environmental advocates, this year was mostly about mitigating the bad. They fought to water down incentives for new gas power plants, and found some success, but the bill could still expedite gas generation. This year also saw rollbacks of the building energy program and electric vehicle sales targets (via an 11th-hour executive order). But advocates notched some wins in the larger energy legislation: Nixing a clean-energy subsidy for trash incinerators and reforming gas pipeline spending by utilities had both been on their wishlists for years. They walk away with bruised knuckles, and a new feeling that the ground beneath them is shaky. But they have victories to point to — and it could have been much worse.
Immigrant protections: President Donald Trump repeated his determination to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants, stoking fear in Maryland’s migrant communities and presenting advocates with a big challenge. They had limited success. Advocates with CASA felt their safety and protection were not prioritized, as lawmakers rushed through a handful of watered-down protections in some public spaces and for data protection in the final minutes of session. But they rejected the measure advocates said would have given undocumented residents the greatest protection from increased immigration enforcement: A ban on 287(g) agreements, in which local police can essentially act as federal immigration agents.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The House Freedom Caucus. These are not the Republicans others cite for erffective messaging (see Winners section above). The seven-member splinter group of House Republicans some some notice from the press for their disruptive rhetoric, and they got an infusion of institutional firepower from Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) — chair of the congressional Freedom Caucus — and Republican former Gov. Robert Ehrlich Jr. But their act made no friends with Democrats in the supermajority. Looming in the interim is the prospect of committee reassignments in order to spread members out among the six standing committees in the House where three members are on Health and Government Operation and two others serve on Judiciary. It remains to be seen if the group can expand its ranks in the House, or knock off some GOP senators whom they have described as RINOs (though they have not named names). Also unknown is whether the group can add more to legislative debates than strenuous objections to things the larger Republican Caucus is already pushing back on.
Beer and wine sales expansion. Yeah, we know we said above that the Maryland Licensed Beverage Association was a winner, but we still think the concept of expanded sales was a push this year. (We haven’t been drinking, we promise.) It’s popular and has the support of a governor who demanded it land on his desk, even though his promise to do more than “whip votes” did not materialize. A line in the sand angered legislative leaders rather than build a coalition. Some of the most important lawmakers did not know the governor’s thoughts until they heard it from a reporter. That said, even though you cannot buy beer and wine in a grocery (or convenience) store, chances are there are lots of options nearby if not in the same shopping centers or even delivery.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_6618-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-12 02:59:24.170972

Beatty embrace at the signing Tuesday of House Bill 502, which aims to help more Marylanders with disabilities get job training and find work. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Today, as I reflect on Maryland’s latest legislative milestone, I am filled with hope. The recent signing of the legislation that establishes the Office of Disability Employment Advancement and Policy (ODEAP) is not merely a policy win—it is a resounding affirmation of Maryland’s commitment to building an inclusive future where the talents of every citizen are celebrated.
I myself am dyslexic and have ADHD. I also know what it means to raise a child with multiple disabilities.  For nearly a decade, I led a Maryland-based disability nonprofit, witnessing firsthand the persistent barriers faced by people with disabilities in accessing meaningful employment.
Despite our wealth of talent, too many Marylanders with disabilities have been left on the margins. Yet, today, Gov. Wes Moore, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller and Secretary of Disabilities Carol Beatty have delivered on campaign promises that have long resonated with advocates and community members alike.
The governor’s words echo the vision he campaigned on: “We looked ‘impossible’ straight in the eyes, and we didn’t flinch. In partnership with the General Assembly, we are building pathways to work, wages, and wealth — even as the White House seeks to lay off thousands of employees.”

These words underscore not just a political stance but a commitment to transforming our state’s economic and social landscape. With a state budget exceeding $60 billion, it is both symbolic and strategic that the first bill signed carries a modest fiscal note. Its true strength lies in its ability to unlock the potential of Maryland’s disability community — which includes not only individuals with diverse abilities but also many federal workers, including wounded warriors, adversely affected by recent federal policy shifts.
“Whether it’s expanding access to high-quality, paid apprenticeships or removing barriers for individuals with disabilities, these bills reflect our belief that a stronger economy begins with a workforce that includes everyone,” the lieutenant governor said. Her words resonate with those of us who have long championed disability rights.
For too long, systemic obstacles kept many capable and eager Marylanders out of the workforce. ODEAP — a critical piece of the broader Model Employer Initiative — signals a commitment to changing that narrative. It creates not only a pathway for increased employment opportunities but also a framework for transforming how state agencies and private employers approach disability inclusion.
I have witnessed the transformative power of inclusion. Employment is far more than a paycheck; it is about dignity, independence and full participation in society. Policies like these are investments in our shared future. By establishing the Office of Disability Employment Advancement and Policy within the Department of Disabilities, we are creating an institutional mechanism that will not only break down long-standing barriers but also propel our state toward a more dynamic and resilient economy.
The potential impact of this bill cannot be overstated. Currently, 45% of Marylanders with disabilities (ages 18-64) are employed, compared to 79% of those without disabilities. Within our state lies an untapped reservoir of talent and determination that, once harnessed, can bridge critical workforce gaps.
Maryland currently has only 40 workers available for every 100 jobs. Actively including people with disabilities in our workforce not only addresses a moral imperative, it also takes concrete steps toward economic growth. Studies have consistently shown that organizations embracing disability inclusion outperform their peers in revenue generation and overall employee engagement.
While the fiscal note for the bill stands at $0 for fiscal 2026 and only $940,000 for fiscal 2027, this investment is strategically targeted to yield exponential returns by tapping into a labor force that is too often overlooked. As federal policies lead to significant job losses — including among federal workers with disabilities — the need for such innovative state-level initiatives has never been more critical.
I applaud Gov. Moore, Lt. Gov. Miller and Secretary Beatty for their visionary leadership and commitment to an inclusive Maryland. They have shown that progress is not measured solely by the size of a budget line, but by the transformative potential of policies that empower all citizens. They demonstrate that, even amid budgetary constraints and challenging federal dynamics, our state is ready to lead the nation in crafting a future where every Marylander has the opportunity to thrive.
By embracing and investing in the talent of people with disabilities, we are building not just a stronger workforce but a stronger Maryland for all. Let us celebrate this monumental step forward and continue to work together, ensuring that every voice is heard, every talent is recognized, and every Marylander is given the chance to succeed.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0099-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-12 02:59:24.170972

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
Maryland’s oyster population remains in pretty good shape, according to the state Department of Natural Resources.
Preliminary results from DNR’s annual reef survey in fall 2024 found that the state’s stock of Chesapeake Bay bivalves experienced above-average reproduction last summer, and the diseases that once devastated them remain at relatively low levels.
The state’s oysters had a banner spawn in 2023 with baby oysters, or “spat,” seen in great abundance throughout the Bay, even in areas that haven’t had any reproduction in a generation or two. The 2024 “spatfall intensity index,” which measures the density of tiny oysters, declined but remained above the 39-year median for the fifth straight year.
  DNR survey crew members use this tool to tell quickly if oysters have grown to market size of 3 inches across. (Photo by Timothy B. Wheeler/Chesapeake )
DNR sampled almost 300 oyster bars from Oct. 8 through Nov. 25, taking note of oyster abundance and health, including reproduction, disease intensity and mortality.
The bumper crop of juvenile oysters in 2023 resulted from persistent dry weather elevating salinity levels that year. That also helps spread and intensify MSX and Dermo, the two diseases that ravaged oysters Baywide from the mid-1980s through the early 2000s.
Overall, the 2024 oyster biomass — a combination of size and number of bivalves — was 62% above the long-term average and the third-highest annual figure since DNR began tracking it.
Oyster survival in fall 2024 was good, the survey found, even in places like the upper Potomac River, where high freshwater flows in winter and spring had lowered salinities to levels stressful for oysters. Freshwater stunts the growth of young oysters, but the lower salinity also reduces disease levels overall.
Disease and mortality are relatively low now, but they could rebound if the winter’s dry weather continues into the spring, officials say.
“We really need to see some rainfall,” Chris Judy, DNR’s shellfish division director, told the department’s Oyster Advisory Commission on March 17.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/6724f1cc03ca1-1-1024x667.jpeg,,,2025-04-12 01:00:28.401171

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A proposal that legislative supporters say would take a $71 million bite out of Nebraska’s projected $289 million biennium budget gap — largely through clawing back several business-related incentives — cleared a hurdle on Friday.
The amended Legislative Bill 650 is an effort by the Nebraska Legislature’s Revenue Committee and supported by Gov. Jim Pillen to help create a required balanced budget. 
A nearly three-hour discussion ended in a 36-2 vote by lawmakers to advance the package to its second stage. State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Omaha, committee chair, said the proposal would save $71 million in projected state spending over the next two budget years by scaling back or eliminating several programs approved in recent years by the Legislature and Pillen.
Von Gillern said the committee used a “last-in-first-out” approach, targeting newer initiatives and considering input from an earlier public hearing. He characterized the package, which hits both rural and urban economic development, as largely a loss for programs designed to grow jobs and the economy. He said such moves were necessary in an era tighter than previous years when federal and pandemic related funds were more plentiful.
“We are talking about minimal impact to consumers,” he said. “It’s primarily a negative impact on businesses.”
 ‘Low-hanging fruit’

The bill is but one piece of a budget-making process set to continue over the remaining days of a 90-day session that wraps up in early June.
  State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a member of the Revenue Committee, anticipates more contentious debate on other bills, such as expansion of sales and use taxes that he said could more specifically affect “everyday working people.”
Of LB 650, he said: “All said and done, I do think it represents a good step forward with some proverbial low-hanging fruit in order to try to make up some of that budget deficit.”
The package calls for scaling back incentives including: an income tax credit for food donations; credits to retailers for collecting sales tax; a tax credit for reverse osmosis water-related systems; employer tax credits for relocating new workers; and income tax credits for short-line railroad maintenance expenditures. 
It calls for cost-cutting changes to or repeal of the Urban Redevelopment Act, the Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act, the Renewable Chemical Production Income Credit, Nebraska Biodiesel Tax Credit, and the Creating High Impact Economic Futures (CHIEF Act).
Von Gillern said he didn’t yet have a financial breakdown of anticipated savings attributable to each program. 
In addition, a handful of other bills would fold into LB 650, most of which von Gillern said are attempts to clarify or improve earlier laws. One of the five, LB 547 introduced by State Sen.

An exchange with State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha — who wanted to know how certain components would hit the pocketbook of an average consumer — sparked more explanation from von Gillern. He said the focus was on business-related and other incentives — saying less of them had been used than anticipated.
Asked, for example, about the clawback of the biodiesel tax credit, von Gillern said it largely affects truck and agricultural users.
Of the scaled back credits for retailers for collecting state sales tax, he said that would lead to as much as $2,000 a year additional loss for a retailer and was not aimed at consumers.
 ‘Please explain’

State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha cast one of the two “no” votes on the amended package. He took particular offense to repealing the Urban Redevelopment Act, a tax credit intended to help grow small businesses and investment in urban cores, and paring back the CHIEF Act, a tax credit designed to encourage individuals and businesses to make charitable contributions that ease chronic economic distress.
McKinney wanted to know more specifics on the projected savings, noting those two programs were just recently enacted. He said the information the committee chair distributed to lawmakers was not complete. “Please explain to me … what is the increase in revenue that the state is getting? What is the savings?”

He urged lawmakers instead to consider saving dollars by halting construction of a new prison, with costs expected to surpass $350 million, which he said would be overcrowded on Day One.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who cast the other no vote, pointed out reduced tax credits for food bank donations and for the installation of a reverse osmosis water filtration system.
“So we’re clawing back tax credits to help feed the hungry and the poor,” she said. “And adjusting or changing the little bit of help we can provide to Nebraskans who have undrinkable water in their homes.”
Conrad said the state is in the position of having to “scramble” for dollars due to the “self-created, reckless and irresponsible” actions of Pillen and the Legislature to promote income and corporate tax cuts that Conrad said benefitted the wealthiest Nebraskans and corporations.
Von Gillern said the last-in-first-out approach aimed for an unbiased process. Committee discussions led to restoration of a few programs originally to be cut, such as the sales tax exemption for agricultural twine and a tax credit for pregnancy assistance organizations.

State Sen Beau Ballard of Lincoln said the employee relocation tax credit he pushed over the finish line last year — now to be scaled back — addressed a state priority: luring new talent.
Ballard said he was looking forward to working in the future with the Revenue Committee on a restoration.
State Sen. Mike Moser of Columbus said he was encouraged by the committee’s work, and noted that much is ahead in the budget-making process.
“This is just the beginning of the discussion,” he said. “We’ve got a number of things we’re going to have to do to make this all add up.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Following a contentious floor debate, the state Senate approved a bill Friday that would guarantee public school students in Washington certain rights. 
Senate Democrats pushed the bill through on a party-line vote, 30-19. 
“It’s important that we ensure every student, and I mean every student, has access to a supportive environment and responsible environments,” said Sen. Claire Wilson, D-Auburn, who is the sponsor of a related Senate bill focused on parental rights. 
The students’ rights bill is among the most divisive of this year’s legislative session and is entwined with discussions around gender issues and diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Democrats say it will provide important safeguards for students and greater clarity with existing law. 
But republicans contend it will take control away from local school districts and is too punitive toward schools. And they say it weakens parental rights enshrined under a citizen initiative that lawmakers approved last year.
“This bill will erode parents’ trust,” said Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco. “This bill is very disrespectful to parents and to families.” 
Senate approval takes the legislation one step closer to becoming state law. But because the Senate amended the bill, it must go back to the House before it can reach the governor’s desk. 
When the session began in January, Democratic lawmakers introduced bills in each chamber — House Bill 1296 and Senate Bill 5181 — both of which addressed parental rights, but the House version also included language dealing with students’ rights. 
In March, the House bill was amended in the Senate committee process to only address students’ rights, leaving the Senate bill to tackle parents’ rights. 
During Friday’s Senate floor action, Republicans introduced seven amendments, including ones to remove parts of the bill establishing a complaint process and allowing the state to withhold funds for noncompliance. GOP lawmakers also tried to scrap an emergency clause that would allow the bill to take effect immediately and shield it from a potential voter referendum. 
All of the Republican amendments were rejected. 
“I’m disappointed that none of the amendments we offered were accepted,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. “We tried to keep it focused on things that would make it a better bill.” 
Among the concerns Braun and others raised is that schools could get caught up in situations where federal and state laws conflict.
This year’s conversations about the rights of public school students and their parents stemmed from Initiative 2081, a citizen initiative that more than 400,000 residents signed onto and that lawmakers passed in the 2024 legislative session. 
Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, said she introduced the House bill to help ensure every student feels comfortable at school and can thrive.  
“We have talked for years about how important it is to make sure that every student feels that they’re in a school setting where they belong so that they can learn,” Stonier said. 
The bill outlines a list of nine specific student rights, including the right to receive an education in a safe and supportive learning environment, free of harassment and bullying. 
It also says students have the right to receive copies of all school policies and procedures related to students and to have access to academic courses and instructional materials with historically and scientifically accurate information. Additionally, the bill makes clear students are free to exercise constitutionally protected rights at school.
Schools would have to develop promotional materials that incorporate the statement of student rights and make it available on school websites, social media platforms, and other communication channels. It must be added to civics educational materials as well. 
The bill also requires that school districts “immediately” notify parents if a student is a victim of abuse, sexual misconduct, or assault. Setting this standard, rather than requiring notification within 48 hours, was a point of contention earlier in the session. Republicans opposed the 48-hour option, saying it was too long to wait.
GOP lawmakers also pushed against including provisions related to gender inclusive policies and procedures at schools. The bill originally included this language, but it was removed by an amendment in the Senate Early Learning and K-12 Education Committee.  
A floor amendment from Sen. T’wina Nobles, ​​D-Fircrest, added language to protect students from discrimination based on ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identities. The amendment also aims to protect students facing homelessness, those who lack citizenship status, and those who are neurodivergent from discrimination.
“We run public schools that are for the public, for everyone,” Nobles said. “And while this bill is not just to protect students that identify as LGBTQ, it protects students that have a variety of differences.” 
The bill would apply to public schools, charter schools and state-tribal education compact schools.
It calls for the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop a process to investigate complaints from students, parents, and others alleging that schools are not complying with state laws in areas like civil rights, nondiscrimination, harassment, and the physical restraint or isolation of students. 
Starting July 1, 2026, the office could investigate “limited” and “broad” complaints. A broad complaint is one that involves the entire student body or a subgroup of students. A limited complaint involves one or more individual students. 
The bill outlines steps that the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction would have to take once it intervenes, with the consequences for school officials and districts becoming more severe in cases where they are found to be willfully flouting state law. 
As a last resort, the office could withhold up to 20% of a district’s state funds and redirect that money toward resolving the issues the state has identified.  
The bill also stipulates that school districts cannot terminate, demote, suspend, or take any other negative action against a school employee for supporting students exercising their legal rights or for teaching about historically marginalized and underrepresented groups.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/washington-state-capitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-11 23:02:56.025995

The Commission on State Debt also said Friday the property tax on utilities stay at 28 cents per $100.","A Maryland state flag flies outside the State House in Annapolis. Photo by Danielle E. Gaines. A key advisory panel is recommending no increase to the state’s property tax for the coming year.
The Commission on State Debt, in a 10-minute meeting Friday, recommended holding the rate on commercial and residential properties at 11.2 cents per $100 in assessed value.
Treasurer Dereck Davis, chair of the panel, said the decision comes during “difficult, trying times.”
“The past few weeks and months have been stressful and busy but productive for the state,” he said.
The panel also recommended maintaining the property tax rate on utilities at 28 cents per $100 per assessed value.
The rates were approved with no debate.
The rates for commercial, residential and utility have not changed since 2007.
The commission meets each year to recommend the state property tax rates. Those rates are later acted upon by the Board of Public Works, chaired by the governor.
State property taxes repay general obligation bond borrowing. Currently there is more than $10 billion in outstanding debt. State law calls for the rate to be set in an amount sufficient to repay the annual debt service.
The current rate does not cover that amount. The gap has been filled with hundreds of millions in cash from the operating budget.
In fiscal 2026, the state will need an additional $156 million in general funds to cover debt service. That amount grows to about $400 million a year later. In fiscal 2030, the general fund will kick in an estimated $500 million for debt service.
State coffers will take in more money in property taxes this year without a rate increase.
In 2025, the state is projected to take in more than $1 billion in property taxes. For 2026, the commission is projecting property tax revenues to exceed $1.1 billion — a 6.3% increase year over year.
Left unchanged, property tax revenues approach $1.2 billion in 2029, according to estimates.
The Department of Assessments and Taxation reassesses properties on a rolling three-year cycle.
All 23 counties and Baltimore City reported increased assessments for seven consecutive years.
The statewide value of properties in Group One for this year increased by 20.1%. Residential properties increased in value by more than 21%. Commercial values increased 16.4%, according to the Department of Assessments and Taxation.
Last year, assessments in Group Three increased 23.4%.
State law caps increases at 10%.
The department mailed notices to property owners in December.
The budget as introduced by Gov. Wes Moore (D) did not include property tax increases. The legislature’s final version raised other taxes but avoided a property tax increase.
The Board of Public Works will take up the recommendation in the next few weeks. The three major bond rating agencies — Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s — are expected to update its credit ratings for the state before the next bond sale in June.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-11 23:02:56.025995

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Supreme Court threw out execution warrants Friday that a Caddo Parish judge has issued for two men convicted in separate murder cases. 
Judge Donald Hathaway, at the request of Caddo District Attorney James E. Stewart Sr., set a May 28 for the death penalty to be carried out against Darrell Draughn and a June 4 execution date for Marcus Reed. Friday’s ruling from the justices requires Hathaway to consider the defendants’ claims for relief before setting new execution dates.
Draughn stabbed his 64-year-old neighbor Lauretta White in 2000 in her Shreveport home, according to investigators. He was found guilty and sentenced to death in 2003.
Reed was convicted of killing brothers Jarquis, Jeremiah and Eugene Adams in 2010. Police said the fatal dispute was over an allegedly stolen video game console. Reed’s conviction and death sentence came in 2013.
Defense attorneys successfully argued both men had not been allowed to pursue all post-conviction remedies before the judge set their execution dates.
“The Louisiana Supreme Court recognized the fundamental principle that the state cannot send a man to the death chamber without at least allowing him to exhaust his appeals,” Draughn’s lawyer, Ceceilia Kappel of Loyola University’s Center for Social Justice, said in a statement. “If prisoners can be executed before they have completed all of their appeals, by warrants signed under cover of darkness, then all of our rights are in serious jeopardy.”
Stewart could not be reached Friday evening for comment on the ruling.
The Caddo death warrants were the first issued since Louisiana conducted its first execution in 15 years last month. Jessie Hoffman was the first person the state put to death using nitrogen hypoxia, a method the state legislature and Gov. Jeff Landry approved last year. 
Louisiana followed Alabama’s lead in using nitrogen gas to carry out the death penalty after struggling for years to obtain the drugs needed for lethal injection.
Draughn and Reed are among the 55 people awaiting execution in Louisiana.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives voted to cut its proposed 2025 Permanent Fund dividend by almost two-thirds on Friday as the House’s contentious budget process lurched another step forward.
The reduction, which had stymied the House Finance Committee for more than a week, drops the proposed dividend from roughly $3,900 per recipient to about $1,400. 
Assuming Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s proposed capital budget, the change cuts the proposed budget deficit from $1.9 billion to less than $400 million for the fiscal year that begins in July. 
Lawmakers also face an almost $200 million deficit in the budget that ends June 30.
The House is set to resume debating the state’s fiscal year 2026 operating budget on Monday.
Members of the House’s Republican minority caucus said they were caught off guard by Friday’s vote.
Several Republicans said they had been told by the leaders of the House’s Democratic-independent-Republican majority caucus that there would be no budget action on Friday, and three minority Republican lawmakers were absent as a result. 
Amendments pass the House if approved by a majority of lawmakers present on the floor, and the amendment to reduce the proposed dividend passed 20-17, with Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, joining 16 minority Republicans in opposition.
“I am ashamed at the process, and I am ashamed at what is happening today,” said House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage. 
“What is happening today on amendment No. 1 is, in my mind, now considered the poster child of disingenuous relations,” she said.
Rep. Frank Tomaszewski, R-Fairbanks, attempted to adjourn the House until Monday in order to allow time for the missing Republicans to return, but that proposal was voted down.
Friday’s vote capped a vexing week for members of the House majority, who sought to reduce the Permanent Fund dividend but lacked the votes to do so because of the opposition of Foster and Rep. Nellie Jimmie, D-Toksook Bay.
In previous years, legislators have used the Permanent Fund dividend as a budget-balancing tool, reducing the amount in years with low revenue and raising it in years with more revenue, as after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Normally, the House Finance Committee starts its budget debates with a low proposed dividend, and lawmakers negotiate to raise that figure. 
This year, Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and the co-chair of the finance committee, started with a larger figure, first proposed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy in December.
Josephson, speaking to the Juneau Empire, called that decision a mistake. Cutting the Permanent Fund dividend functions like a regressive tax — it disproportionately affects low-income Alaskans, and two of the finance committee’s members are rural Democrats who represent the two lowest-income House districts in the state.
In committee, Foster said he could not vote to reduce the dividend. He and Jimmie joined five Republican members of the committee in voting against a budget-balancing amendment proposed by Josephson that would have set the dividend at $1,000.
Late Thursday, in an unusual hearing, the committee again tried and again failed to cut the dividend before sending the budget to the floor. The debate was cut short as several members of the committee rushed away to present a legislative citation to the Alaska Folk Fest, occurring a few blocks from the Capitol.
On Friday, Jimmie gave an impassioned speech, saying that the large dividend proposed by Dunleavy and the finance committee was never realistic and is a heartbreaking mirage for her constituents, who rely on the dividend for food and basic essentials.
“I’m going to tell you the truth,” she said on the House floor, addressing constituents watching the debate on TV. “From the very first day that we walked into this building, there was never enough money for a full PFD, not without cutting the things that keep us alive: schools, public safety, health care.”
The dividend means dignity, means keeping people out of poverty, she said.
“It hurts me to see that dividend, something that means heating oil in the winters, diapers for our babies, food on the table, being dangled like a bait, like a prize on a string,” she said.
Jimmie said she would continue to advocate for a large dividend but “could not lie to my people to get applause,” and voted in favor of the cut.
No lawmaker has proposed tax increases large enough to pay for the larger Permanent Fund dividend, and legislators say they are unwilling to break a soft cap on spending from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which leaves the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s principal savings account, as the only means to cover the deficit.
That would require votes from 30 of the 40 members of the House and 15 of the 20 members of the Senate, plus the assent of the governor. 
The CBR held $2.83 billion as of Feb. 28 and the draft budget with the larger dividend would have consumed more than two-thirds of it.
“So this is where we are, ladies and gentlemen,” Josephson said on Friday. “This is where we are when we’re the only state that is striving mightily to pay money to every citizen that is eligible, and tax no one in the state. Why are we surprised?”

(John Moore/Getty Images)An Idaho district judge ruled Friday that pregnant patients who have a risk of dying without an abortion are not subject to the criminal penalties of the state’s abortion ban, but the plaintiffs say it doesn’t go far enough to offer real protection.
The lawsuit was filed in Ada County, in Idaho’s Fourth District court. As part of the ruling, District Judge Jason D. Scott said Idaho’s abortion laws do not make it a crime to perform an abortion if the physician determines in their good faith medical judgment that the patient’s existing medical condition or pregnancy complication would be resolved by terminating the pregnancy and the patient faces a “non-negligible risk of dying sooner” without it. Scott said death does not have to be imminent or “assured” to perform an abortion as long as it doesn’t arise from a risk of self-harm, such as suicide, and it attempts to facilitate the fetus’ survival outside of the womb if possible.
Four women, two physicians and a state organization of family physicians filed the lawsuit in September 2023 seeking to clarify the state’s near-total abortion ban, which offers exceptions only to save the pregnant patient’s life and in limited circumstances of rape and incest. 
Despite the efforts of advocates and some legislators, the state Legislature has not offered clarifications to the law allowing an abortion to be performed to prevent severe health effects, and physicians have said it is impossible to know at what point they are safe to intervene without facing fines and prison time or the loss of their medical license.
 Center for Reproductive Rights vows to keep fighting for more clarity in abortion ban laws

The ruling is similar to the Idaho Supreme Court’s interpretation of the law released in 2022, but that language was not enough to assuage doctors’ fears in the years since. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the case from the Center for Reproductive Rights said the case did provide more clarity around the level of risk that needs to be present for a physician to intervene without fear of prosecution, but they vowed to keep fighting for more.
Gail Deady, the center’s lead attorney in the case, said during a news conference Friday that the case will hopefully be instructive to other states with similar abortion bans.
“We do hope they will similarly come to the conclusion that the bans need to be struck down, clarified or expanded in order to prevent the kind of harms that plaintiffs have shown in this case have been occurring in Idaho,” Deady said.
The lead plaintiff was Jennifer Adkins, a Caldwell resident who had to make the eight-hour drive to Portland, Oregon, almost exactly two years ago to terminate her pregnancy after the fetus was diagnosed with severe abnormalities, including a buildup of fluid that Adkins’ maternal-fetal medicine specialist said would be fatal. The buildup of fluid also risked raising Adkins’ blood pressure and causing preeclampsia.

“It is a little surreal to be going through this around the same time as this all began for me personally,” Adkins told States Newsroom on Friday.
Scott dismissed the plaintiffs’ two other claims that would have expressly provided exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies, and another claim that made a constitutional argument against Idaho’s abortion ban, saying it deprived the plaintiffs who needed abortions for medical reasons of constitutional rights. Scott dismissed those claims with prejudice, meaning the decision can’t be appealed.
Dr. Emily Corrigan, an OB-GYN at Saint Alphonsus, said the case also provides some protection for providers who have been worried about terminating a pregnancy in emergency situations. 
 Idaho faces other legal challenges to its strict abortion ban

Idaho has been at the center of a lawsuit claiming the abortion ban violates a federal law mandating stabilizing care for any patient who comes to an emergency room in a hospital that accepts Medicare funding. 
New court order shields certain Idaho doctors from prosecution for emergency abortion care

The state’s largest health care system, St. Luke’s, sued Attorney General Raúl Labrador in January after the federal government dropped the case due to the transition to the new Trump administration. The plaintiffs won a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the law against emergency room physicians who might need to perform an abortion to prevent the spread of infection or in other cases, but the injunction only applied to St. Luke’s because it was the only plaintiff.
Corrigan said Friday’s ruling will help give more confidence to physicians at the hospitals that weren’t included, like hers, as well as other providers around the state.
Whatever comes next, Adkins said the work so far has been meaningful.
“I hope that our baby is watching us and is proud of the work that we’re doing, and I hope that she sees the hard work that we’re putting in,” she said. “We’ll continue to fight so that this hopefully won’t happen to other families.”

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Senate on Friday passed a bill that would change parts of the state’s Freedom of Information Act. 
Senators signed off on House Bill 3412 Friday with a vote of 25 to nine. 
The Freedom of Information Act allows members of the public to access information and public records about the workings of government. Journalists, researchers and others use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain access to lawmakers’ emails, presentations and more that can shed light on how decisions are being made. 
As it passed the House of Delegates, the bill would have exempted the Legislature from the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, if it adopts its own rules. House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, who sponsored the bill, said his intent was not to hide public documents, but to allow lawmakers to write its rules that make it clear to the public what is and is not a public record.
The Senate on Friday approved a new version of the bill from the Senate Government Organization Committee. Under that version, the Legislature is not exempt from FOIA. 
The latest version of the bill would remove the requirement that the law be liberally construed in favor of disclosure. It provides that private personal information is not public record. Personal information includes banking and financial information, address and telephone numbers, date of birth, marital status, social security numbers as well as notes and journal entries containing opinions and more. 
The bill also extends the deadline that custodians of public documents have to respond to FOIA requests from five days to 14 days. Agencies would be allowed to charge a “reasonable search and retrieval fee” for the documents. Under the law currently, agencies may only charge for actual costs of copying the documents. 
The Senate approved the bill with no discussion Friday. The bill will now go back to the House of Delegates for possible approval of the amended version of the bill. 
The 60-day legislative session ends at midnight Saturday.

In an 11 to 9 vote, senators narrowly passed House Bill 69, one day after the Senate Finance Committee removed all education policy changes previously proposed by the state House and the Senate Education Committee. That left an abbreviated version with only the increase in per student funding, known as the base student allocation.
Hours later, the House voted 21-16, with three legislators excused as absent, to approve the Senate changes. That action will send the bill to Dunleavy, who said before the vote that he would veto the bill if it passed without changes.
On Thursday, Dunleavy posted a statement on social media calling the bill a “joke,” and said unless legislation includes policy changes, “it will be vetoed immediately.”
On Friday, Senators debated the bill on the floor, largely focused on the state of Alaska schools’ financial picture and the cost of the education funding bill — estimated at $253 million per year.
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage and chair of the education committee, urged support for school districts facing dire financial shortfalls.
“We have heard from hundreds of parents and students and teachers asking us to raise the base student allocation,” she said. “There’s little else contained in those missives about other types of education reforms. What they’re asking us to do is increase school funding because our schools are in crisis, and we must respond.” 
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, said he couldn’t support the funding without a balanced budget. “We’ve all said this is important, the BSA needs to be increased. Nobody is arguing that,” he said. “But at what cost, and at what reasonable cost that we think we can make work while we’re not negatively impacting everybody else to a significant degree?”
Shower argued not all parents support the funding boost. “I’ve heard lots of parents from back home and others that are saying, ‘Don’t do this.’ I’ve had lots of folks reach out and say, ‘This is not affordable. This is not what we’re looking for. By the way, we want to see policy (changes) in this.’ They’re not necessarily opposed to (a BSA increase), but they’re asking for some of the policy changes.” 
The Legislature has a mandate to provide education funding under the state constitution. Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, argued the state risks a lawsuit if lawmakers fail to act. “The state was sued because we didn’t adhere to our constitutional obligations,” he said. “In 2007, the Supreme Court found that, yes, adequate funding is a constitutional responsibility of the state.”
Senators considered, and then voted against proposals to add education changes back into the bill, including open statewide enrollment, increasing per-student funding for homeschooled students, and grants for districts that show improvements in reading proficiency.
Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and a co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said he could not support the bill given the state’s financial picture. “So I plan on voting no on this bill, regretfully,” he said, addressing Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak. “But I promise to work on revenue measures — I know you as (Senate) president and the Senate caucus have made that a priority. Because in order to address education and all the other things that we need to address that are coming before us require additional revenue.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe House and Senate have not passed legislation to enact any new state revenues this session. A draft state budget under debate in the House has a $1.9 billion deficit for the 12 months that begin in July. That deficit is $2.1 billion if an unresolved gap from the current fiscal year — which ends in June — is included. 
Hours after the Senate voted, the state House took up the Senate’s version of the bill and voted along caucus lines, with members of the House majority — 14 Democrats, five independents and two Republicans — voting in favor and members of the House’s all-Republican minority opposed. 
“I do support a permanent BSA increase … however, the amount that’s in this bill is not something we can afford at this time,” said House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, adding that she would support a $680 permanent increase, the same size included as a one-time boost this year.
Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, was among several members of the House who alluded to the governor’s veto threat and said that if the House approved the change, it would turn into “a step in the process” rather than be a final action.
A veto override requires approval from 40 of 60 lawmakers meeting in a joint session. Several legislators said they do not expect an override. If the governor rejects the bill, they expect work to continue on a bill that contains a smaller increase.
“And maybe, just maybe, we’ll go back to a compromise,” Ruffridge said.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)Hours after a Louisiana judge said a Columbia University activist could be deported, his attorneys said the true legal battle for his right to remain in the United States will be fought here in New Jersey. 
Attorney Marc Van Der Hout, one of the many lawyers representing activist Mahmoud Khalil, referred to the Louisiana immigration court proceedings as “a sham.
“It was a kangaroo court,” Van Der Hout told reporters Friday.
Khalil, a green card holder, was arrested on March 8 in New York City by federal immigration agents and was eventually sent to LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana, where he remains today.
Louisiana Judge Jamee Comans’ Friday decision doesn’t mean Khalil will be immediately deported. Khalil’s attorneys plan to appeal Friday’s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, who is hearing a related case in New Jersey, has ordered federal officials not to deport Khalil until he rules that they can. 
Khalil is arguing before Farbiarz that the Trump administration is targeting him for speech protected by the First Amendment. Khalil led anti-Israel protests on Columbia’s campus.
“Our real remedy is in district court, in federal district court, and that’s the only place we’re going to get any real justice or that he is going to get any real justice,” Van Der Hout said.
Amy Belsher, senior staff attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the immigration judge’s ruling confirms the need for federal courts to intervene and make a decision “because the immigration court made clear today that it won’t and believes it can’t.”
Comans, the Louisiana judge, said she has no authority to question a two-page letter penned by Secretary of State Marco Rubio supporting Khalil’s deportation. 
Khalil’s attorneys also said they will weigh whether to seek asylum for Khalil.

His executive order, issued Tuesday, directs the Department of Justice to challenge a huge swath of state laws and regulations. The order aims at measures that seek to cut carbon emissions, penalize energy companies and limit drilling permits. It also targets state-led lawsuits against fossil fuel companies over the damages caused by climate change.
Trump’s directive orders Attorney General Pam Bondi to “stop the enforcement” of any state laws related to climate change, including any that are seen as “burdening” the use of domestic energy resources. Such language could include state laws that mandate a transition to clean electricity sources.
The order specifically calls out “climate Superfund” policies in Vermont and New York, which require fossil fuel companies to pay for some of the damages caused by climate change. It also targets California’s cap-and-trade law, which places a limit on emissions through auctions of carbon credits.

While Trump’s order says such state policies are unconstitutional, climate-focused state leaders say his administration has no legal basis to unravel their efforts.
“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement from the U.S. Climate Alliance. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”
Hochul and Lujan Grisham co-chair the alliance, a coalition of 24 governors focused on reducing emissions.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Politico that the order is “toothless.”
“[Trump] has no authority on his own to nullify state laws,” he told the outlet.
But the order throws the might of the federal government into a sprawling legal battle over states’ authority to set climate policy and seek damages for disasters.
It could force states to face expensive litigation and years of legal uncertainty. Trump-appointed judges on the U.S. Supreme Court and elsewhere have at times been hostile to environmental regulations. And it’s unclear whether the order will have a chilling effect on state efforts to craft more climate legislation.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Lawmakers have signed off on doing away with the West Virginia Office of Equal Opportunity, opting to keep the office’s director role within a state agency that will be tasked with protecting state employees from discrimination. 
But questions remain about how the office seemingly dissolved before lawmakers signed off on any changes, which is required. The OEO no longer has any dedicated employees or a director, which is required in state code. A website for the office was taken down. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Administration, which now oversees the OEO’s work, hasn’t responded to questions from West Virginia Watch about what happened. Gov. Patrick Morrisey told reporters on Monday that he didn’t know all the details, but was going to “make sure everything is done the right way.”
The OEO was tasked with complying with federal disability rights and investigated discrimination and harassment claims from public employees.
  Del. Chris Phillips, R-Barbour
“All of the suites are still currently housed in the Department of Administration and are still being taken care of,” said Del. Chris Phillips, R-Barbour. The federally-required reports are still being filed, he said. 
While vetting a Senate bill meant to dismantle the OEO, members of the House Committee on Government Organization last week learned that the office was already likely disbanded, possibly violating state code by not having lawmakers’ required approval.
Following that meeting, the committee amended the Republican-sponsored bill to now continue the position of the OEO coordinator within the Department of Administration. The office would still be repealed, according to the legislation.  
The House approved the amended bill on Friday with a vote of 90-9. 
All House Democrats voted against the measure, citing concerns that it still wasn’t clear what had happened to the office.
  Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha
“During the committee process, we learned that the office was eliminated obviously without our authorization,” said Del. Hollis Lewis, D-Kanawha. 
Sheryl Webb, director of the state Division of Personnel, declined last week to tell House committee members who had directed the division to begin dismantling the office.
She did say the change was partially spurred by Morrisey’s executive order mandating that government agencies find efficiencies and eliminate waste. Eliminating the OEO would save $125,000 in salaries plus $41,250 in benefits, she said.
Bill sponsor Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, also said the bill was in an effort to streamline state government since the work was already being done by the Division of Personnel. 
The Senate approved the bill March 29, and they’ll have to concur with the House’s vote on the measure before it goes to the governor’s desk for consideration.
During a press conference on April 7, Morrisey said, “One of the things that we’re charged with doing is protecting taxpayers and driving efficiencies.”
“I’ll go back after this and make sure that we’re taking the steps and figure out if there’s areas where we need the authority to change, then certainly we’ll go to the Legislature and ask for change,” he continued.

Free.,Trump authorizes U.S. military to begin occupation of federal land along southern border,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-authorizes-us-military-begin-occupation-federal-land-along-southern-border,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump late Friday signed a memorandum directing several agencies to start militarizing a stretch of the southern border, an escalation of the administration's use of the U.S. military amid its immigration crackdown.The move, which The Washington Post first reported last month, could potentially put U.S. military members in direct contact with migrants, a possible violation of federal law.The memo directs the Interior Department to allow the Defense Department to have jurisdiction over portions of federal land known as the Roosevelt Reservation, excluding any Native American reservations.By creating a military buffer zone that stretches across the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, California and New Mexico, it means any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, therefore allowing active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.National and military experts have raised concerns that giving control over the land to the military could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement.The Friday memo instructs its “phased” implementation within 45 days, and says it could be expanded over time.The memo is directed at the secretaries of the departments of Defense, Interior, Agriculture and Homeland Security.“The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past,” according to the memo.Friday’s announcement comes ahead of a report that is due to Trump by April 20 from the secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security with recommendations on whether or not to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to aid in mass deportations.The memo states: “At any time, the Secretary of Defense may extend activities under this memorandum to additional Federal lands along the southern border in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor, and other executive departments and agencies as appropriate.”The memo also says that it’s part of an executive order Trump earlier this year signed, “Clarifying the Military's Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States.”That executive order is one of five that lay out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extend other executive powers to speed up the president's immigration crackdown.",,,,2025-04-11 20:04:23.395574

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)A federal court has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to restore funding to Maine, granting the state’s request for a temporary restraining order.
The ruling marks Maine’s first legal victory against federal sanctions imposed over its policies on transgender athletes — policies the Trump administration argues violate Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education. At issue is Maine’s decision to allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, which the federal government claims is unlawful under its interpretation of Title IX.
After the USDA froze the funds earlier this month, Attorney General Aaron Frey on Monday filed a complaint in U.S. District Court seeking to reinstate access to the money this Monday. Four days later, Justicedge John Woodcock Jr.  granted the emergency request, finding that Maine had shown it would suffer “irreparable harm” and that the USDA had failed to follow legally required procedures before halting the funding.
In a statement after the ruling, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said the order “confirms the Trump Administration did not follow the rule of law when it cut program funds that go to feed school children and vulnerable adults.”
“No one in our constitutional republic is above the law and we will continue to fight to hold this administration to account,” Frey said. 
Unlike other federal agencies that opened civil rights investigations into Maine’s policies, the USDA acted without launching a formal probe. On April 2, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins notified Governor Janet Mills that the department was freezing certain federal funds used for school administrative and technological functions. The move was based solely on the department’s view that Maine was out of compliance with Title IX, according to Rollins’ letter.
The U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services had separately found Maine in violation of federal law after short investigations. But the state has pushed back, insisting that its trans-inclusive policies are consistent with both Title IX and legal precedent.
In a letter sent earlier today to Bradley Burke, regional director of the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster cited court rulings affirming the rights of transgender athletes.
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she wrote. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”
Judge Woodcock’s ruling does not address the substance of the transgender athlete policy itself. Instead, it but focuses solely on the federal government’s failure to follow due process.
“In ruling on the State’s request, the Court is not weighing in on the merits of the controversy about transgender athletes that forms the backdrop of the impasse between the State and the Federal Defendants,” Woodcock wrote. “The Federal Defendants froze the appropriated funds without observance of procedure required by law.”

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill that drastically increases penalties for certain drug offenses passed the West Virginia House of Delegates on Friday. If signed into law, advocates worry how the new provisions will impact already vulnerable populations, like people who use drugs, who they say are more likely to be incarcerated even if they are not high-level “dealers.”
On Friday, the House passed the bill 98-1, with one member absent and not voting. Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, was the only lawmaker to vote against the legislation.
A slightly different version of Senate Bill 196 passed the state Senate earlier this session. Through the committee process in the House, lawmakers amended the bill, removing provisions that required someone to know the drugs they carried or intended to distribute contained fentanyl, which through the bill language levies higher criminal penalties than ever before in the state. 
In addition, the amended version created a new code section for “kingpins,” which is defined as people who finance or manage drug conspiracies and as such are subject to enhanced penalties.
The current version of the bill added weight requirements for anyone delivering a drug that contains fentanyl to be charged with conspiracy. It also includes language for the crime of delivering a drug that results in someone’s death, with increased penalties for failing to render aid to someone who is overdosing. 
Overall, the bill introduces mandatory minimum sentences into state code for transporting cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into West Virginia and removes alternative sentencing options — like probation or home confinement — for those who are jailed on those charges.
The proposed law would increase sentences against those charged with manufacturing, delivering or possessing with the intent to deliver a Schedule I or II narcotic or meth from one to five years up to three to 15 years. 
Anyone who is charged with those crimes who has more than five grams of fentanyl, among other quantities of other drugs, could face 10 to 30 years in jail.
The penalties levied in the bill are based on research from the West Virginia Fusion Center and the State Police showing that West Virginia enforces lower sanctions for certain drug charges than surrounding states. Sen. Vince Deeds, R-Greenbrier, who sponsored the bill, previously told lawmakers that he believes stronger penalties would curb the state’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
But there is no data that shows stronger drug penalties anywhere curbing overdose or fatality rates related to the drug epidemic.
Deeds and other proponents for the bill have said the proposed law is meant to target high-level narcotic dealers and distributors. Deeds told a committee earlier this week that no part of the bill is meant to apply to “street-level users.”
Distinguishing between who would be considered a “drug user” and a “drug dealer,” however, is complicated, advocates say.
“Drug dealers often are drug users, and under this law there’s no real distinction,” said Jennie Hill, the assistant director for the West Virginia Alliance of Recovery Residences. “There’s no science behind these arguments at all. They said higher punishment will deter crime, but people who use drugs are going to use drugs no matter what. You could give them a death sentence for using fentanyl. If they’re addicted to fentanyl, they’re still going to carry fentanyl, still going to sell it to support the habit.”
And, Hill said, five grams of fentanyl is not a lot for people who are habitual, daily users. Some people, she continued, use five or more grams a day depending on their tolerance; if they’re carrying that amount, it’s often not because they’re dealing it.
“Instead of being able to shoot up once and be high for eight to 10 or 12 hours, like you used to on heroin, it’s like you have to get high every two, three or four hours,” Hill said. “And so if somebody’s shooting up every two hours, and they need that much, you’re getting into five and seven grams a day personal use.”
Hill is in long-term recovery for substance use disorder. Now she works with people who are entering recovery themselves and said it’s common for people who aren’t traditionally thought of as drug “dealers” to sell drugs when they’re in active addiction.
Pushkin, in explaining his vote against the bill, said he worried about challenges making similar distinctions. People who are using drugs and carrying them around are often charged with intent to deliver even if that isn’t the case, he said.
“I know who we’re trying to go after here, and I fully support that you’re trying to go after the big fish,” Pushkin said. “I think when you cast such a wide net, you’re gonna catch some little fish as well.”
The drastically increased jail time for such offenses is also a concern for Kenny Matthews, a criminal justice advocate who previously served five years behind bars on a charge of intent to deliver $20 of marijuana and $20 worth of crack cocaine. 
Matthews, who is in long-term recovery, testified in the House Judiciary Committee against the bill earlier this week. He warned lawmakers that more prison time for people with substance use disorder was only going to cause more problems in the state as it struggles to care for the incarcerated people it already has.
When people are released from incarceration, Matthews said, systems often don’t exist to set them up for success.
“[People] in long-term recovery, we believe in accountability. You’re held accountable for your actions. We’re not negating that,” Matthews said in an interview after his testimony. “What we’re negating is the fact that you want to throw away somebody for a mistake, whether intentional or not, and you want to over-penalize somebody for not a moral failing, but for a diagnosed disease, like a majority of the people with these possession of intent to delivers have.”
Matthews and Hill, along with other advocates who wrote in public comments against the legislation (no comments came in support of the bill), said the only thing that is known to work to decrease the devastation from West Virginia’s drug crisis is public health intervention.
The state’s rate of fatal overdose is already on the decline — a statistic often celebrated by the state’s leaders. Harsher penalties for drug possession and use is not the answer to deterring crime or tragedy, said Sara Whitaker, the senior criminal legal policy analyst at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy.
“The answer is in public health investment. The last few years, we’ve seen our state — thanks to
COVID federal funding — make additional investments in public health resources, in getting opioid reversal drugs into the hands of people who are using and people who care about them, and we’ve seen the fruits of that,” Whitaker said. “SB 196 has none of that, and it’s not going to change anything for the better.”
Following the House’s vote Friday, the passage of SB 196 was communicated to the Senate. If the Senate accepts and approves the House’s changes to the legislation, the bill will head to Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s desk for signage. The 2025 regular session is scheduled to end at midnight on Saturday.

As gouda it gets
“Cheesy, a little sweet.”
That was the review Gov. Lamont gave to Arethusa Farm’s award-winning “Europa” gouda cheese during a visit to the company’s dairy and cheesemaking facility in Bantam on Thursday.
The governor’s palette was a bit less discerning from the experts at Arethusa, who describe their gouda as having “wispy aromas of butterscotch and toasted nuts that give way to a savory, brothy flavor.”
One thing that is clear is that Europa is a winner. The cheese claimed the top prize in March at the U.S. Championship Cheese Contest in Wisconsin, beating out more than 2,000 competitors across the country for the second competition in a row.
“We got the UConn Huskies who are world champions,” Lamont said, beaming into the TV cameras. “We’re here at Arethusa, which is the world champion of cheese.”
Chris Casiello, the product manager at Arethusa, said he’s been honing the recipe since 2001 and sources all of the dairy’s milk from farms located in northwestern Connecticut. The company produces about 100,000 pounds of cheese a year, he said, and mainly sells locally and in New York and Massachusetts.
While the visit from the governor and other local leaders was largely celebratory, talk did turn to the potential impact President Donald Trump’s tariffs would have on the other 85 active dairy farms operating in Connecticut.
Department of Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt noted that milk and dairy products are one of America’s top agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada, and that those producers would be hit hard if those countries responded with reciprocal tariffs on the industry.

No-fault eviction
Tenants on Wednesday rallied alongside Democratic lawmakers in Hartford to call for a change to state law that would largely end no-fault evictions, which typically occur at the end of a lease.
House Bill 6889 would ban no-fault evictions at apartments with five or more units. The protections would begin once a tenant has lived at the apartment for a year. These protections already exist for people with disabilities and seniors in Connecticut, and the bill would expand those rights.
“Eviction often means losing our job because we are displaced from the neighborhood where our children have grown up and where we have built strong and diverse communities,” said Hartford tenant union leader Rosalina Rodriguez, speaking through an interpreter.
The Housing Committee passed the bill last month. Members of the Connecticut Tenants Union aim to get the House to pass the bill early in the session.
Landlords and Republicans have opposed the measure, saying it interferes with the rights of property owners.
“There is no more cause for the ‘just cause’ bill today than there was when the legislature rejected it last year, because it does not protect Connecticut’s apartment communities and will not build one new apartment home to relieve the state’s housing shortage,” said Jessica Doll, executive director of the Connecticut Apartment Association, in a written statement.
Advocates for the bill say it would help keep people housed, particularly when a new landlord purchases a property, evicts tenants and raises rents. It would also help ensure that people aren’t afraid of being evicted if they ask for home repairs.

Street takeovers
A bill cracking down on so-called “street takeovers” passed through the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.
The bill allows municipalities to destroy all-terrain vehicles, dirt bikes and mini-motorcycles used in street takeovers if the owner doesn’t pick them up within 30 days. It also allows towns and cities to adopt ordinances to fine people participating in street takeovers up to $1,000 for a first violation, $1,500 for a second violation and $2,000 for a third violation, as well as impounding their cars. Participants may also have their licenses suspended for 45 days or revoked after a third offense.
Mayor Justin Elicker of New Haven testified in favor of the bill during a public hearing in March, saying the city has struggled to address the problem.
“Street takeovers and the use of illegal dirt bikes and ATVs are extremely dangerous, posing a risk not only to the participants themselves, but also to bystanders, neighbors, and our public safety personnel. We have seen injuries across the state and other dangerous activity associated with street takeovers, such as fires being set, fireworks being thrown, and in some cases, shots being fired,” he said in written testimony to the committee. 
Deborah Del Prete Sullivan, Legal Counsel Director for the Office of Chief Public Defender who argued against the proposal, said she felt that revoking a license for participating in a street takeover would be too punitive, particularly for young people “who lack the maturity to appreciate their actions.” The ACLU also warned against allowing additional police actions, pointing out that traffic enforcement can disproportionately affect people of color.

Incarcerated mothers and breastfeeding
The Judiciary Committee passed a bill to allow people who are incarcerated to breastfeed children during visits. During a public hearing held last month, Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros testified in support of the measure, explaining that no law or policy on breastfeeding currently exists. Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, a co-sponsor of the proposal, called it “a compassionate and necessary step forward, not just in criminal justice reform but in the overall health of our communities.”
“Denial of breastfeeding during visits is not just an inconvenience — it is a form of unnecessary punishment that harms both mother and child,” Somers wrote in a statement. The bill now heads to the Senate for a vote.

Fining incarcerated individuals for misconduct
On Tuesday the Judiciary Committee approved a proposal allowing correction officers to fine incarcerated individuals as punishment for misconduct. The bill originally received pushback from advocates, who said the measure would penalize the families of the incarcerated individuals, who contribute funds to their commissary accounts.
Correction officers who testified in favor of the proposal told the committee they needed additional measures to impose discipline, since the legislature has prevented them from using punishments such as limiting out-of-cell time or taking away phone time.
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, said the idea came from a tour he took of the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield.
“Correction officers feel that the tools in their toolbox to maintain order has been limited,” Kissel said. He noted there would have to be “further discussions” about the bill, noting that not all incarcerated individuals are able to earn their own money.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said he was willing to support the bill because of Kissel’s “openness” to hear concerns brought forward by advocates.
“I’m happy to engage in a conversation to see if we can make this bill do what Senator Kissel intends without having unintended consequences,” Winfield said.

Senator proposes new “energy procurement authority”
Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee Co-Chair Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, dropped new legislation this week taking aim at Connecticut’s high electric bills. The bill, S.B. 1560, would declare an “affordable energy crisis” in the state and set up a new public authority tasked with studying and developing plans to roll out new, lower-cost sources of power generation. The bill would require utilities regulators to incorporate time-of-use charges into customers’ electric rates and classify nuclear power as a renewable resource for the purpose of obtaining clean energy credits, among other changes.
Fonfara previously served as chair of the Energy and Technology Committee, and has recently found himself in the news as the subject of a controversial deal with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office to confirm Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chair Melissa Gillett. As part of that deal, Lamont agreed to also appoint Fonfara to an open seat on PURA at some later date.
The senator did not make himself available for an interview on the legislation, but he issued a statement through a spokesman saying that his proposal offers a way out of the energy crisis. “This bill will take an historically inefficient electricity procurement and distribution system and turn it into an efficient system that will reduce ratepayer bills by 20 percent immediately, and 40 percent when fully implemented, while meeting critical environmental goals,” the statement said.
The legislation is scheduled for a public hearing next Wednesday.

Eliminating the subminimum wage
The Human Services Committee voted to advance a bill, which originated in the Labor Committee, that would establish a task force to study eliminating the subminimum wage for residents with disabilities. Federal and state laws requiring workers to earn a minimum wage do not apply to people with disabilities. There is currently no wage floor for individuals with disabilities, and many earn less than $3.50 an hour.
During Friday’s vote, legislators on both sides of the aisle expressed concern about the “unintended consequences” of scrapping the subminimum wage. Rep. Jay Case, R-Winchester, a founding member of the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Caucus who had a brother with disabilities, said getting rid of the subminimum wage could eliminate job opportunities. “If we make it so everybody has the same minimum wage, those jobs will be eliminated and those people won’t have things to do during the day,” Case said.
Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, agreed with Case’s concerns, but said she would support the measure. “I do feel that we at least need to look at this and study it,” she said.
The bill now goes to the House for a vote.

Bill for sentence modification dies
A bill that would have expanded opportunities for incarcerated people to have their sentences modified was not called for a vote by the Judiciary Committee during its final meeting on Thursday.
The bill would have removed the requirement for the state’s attorney to approve any modifications to sentences of seven years or more that were made under a plea deal. It also would allow judges to reduce sentences that were made under mandatory minimums. It also would have allowed people whose bids for a sentence modification were rejected to reapply within two years, rather than five years, as current statute requires.
In a public hearing last month, nearly 200 people sent in written testimony supporting the concept, many of whom were family members and acquaintances of people in prison, as well as incarcerated individuals themselves.
Sen. Winfield, the committee chair, told The Connecticut Mirror on Thursday that negotiating the bill would have constrained the committee’s ability to pass a number of other important proposals before its Friday deadline.
Both the Chief State’s Attorney Patrick Griffin and Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said they believed the bill didn’t take into account the long judicial process that goes into determining the original sentences for incarcerated individuals. Others in opposition expressed concerns about placing undue burdens on victims by having to notify them every two years that the perpetrator of a crime against them could have his or her sentence modified.

(Photo by Christian Zimmerman/U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Center)The Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers and funding restrictions has affected the monitoring of a landslide-prone slope that could create a dangerous tsunami in Alaska’s Prince William Sound.
The Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys, in a recent update, alerted the public about the problems affecting the multiagency team monitoring Barry Arm. The site is a fjord where an unstable rocky slope could collapse into the water, potentially creating a tsunami affecting the community of Whittier and a variety of Prince William Sound mariners and visitors.
Administrative changes affecting federal agencies that are part of the Barry Arm monitoring program “have resulted in delays in equipment repairs and service renewals essential to maintaining full operational readiness,” the DGGS update said.
Those delays “may have temporary impacts on tsunami hazard awareness and response efforts in the region,” the update said.
The slope at Barry Arm has been moving gradually, and its movements are recorded through an array of instruments at the site and elsewhere in the sound.
Barry Arm is one of dozens of sites in Prince William Sound where landslide risks have increased as glaciers that buttress mountain slopes retreat. The sound and surrounding parts of Southcentral Alaska are considered vulnerable because of rapid glacial loss.

	Because of Barry Arm’s potential for a catastrophic collapse, the site has received special focus from agencies trying to track slope movement. A key goal is to provide early warnings to people in the area, if those become necessary.
Federal agencies involved in the Barry Arm program include the U.S. Geological Survey; the National Weather Service and its National Tsunami Warning Center; the U.S. Coast Guard; and the U.S. Forest Service. Nonfederal partners include the DGGS and the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Alaska Earthquake Center, and the cities of Whittier and Valdez.
Dennis Staley, of the USGS and Alaska Volcano Observatory, said that changes to federal agency priorities and protocols for travel, purchasing and contracting have affected the Barry Arm Landslide and Tsunami Hazard Monitoring System.
“These have resulted in some rather sizeable changes in the way we approach the logistics to conducting fieldwork in recent months. We also have to plan for and adapt to changes in workforce composition as our staff members are laid off, or offered, contemplate, and sometimes accept offers for early retirement, paid administrative leave, etc.,” he said by email.
Weather conditions have also affected operations, team members said.
USGS scientists went to Barry Arm on April 2 and did maintenance work on radar equipment used to measure landslide movement and transmit that data, Staley said.
National Weather Service crews also got out to the area earlier this month and restored service at a Whittier site that was recording water-level data, said Dave Snider of the service’s Tsunami Warning Center. Crew members were able to restore service there, but more trips will be needed “as time, weather, and funds allow,” he said by email.
No more field work is planned for this month, Staley said. Annual spring maintenance is planned for May, he said.

Tanya Storer of Whitman. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill requiring age verification for social media accounts in Nebraska advanced to the second round of debate with a 38-2 vote. 
The bill from freshman State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a priority for Gov. Jim Pillen, would prohibit Nebraskans from creating social media accounts without verifying their age after next year. 
Democratic-allied lawmakers described the bill as government overreach and said it likely would face lawsuits, while supporters of the proposal said it would help address a mental health crisis among young people. 
Storer, during the two-day floor debate this week, attempted to differentiate Legislative Bill 383 from a recent Arkansas law that a federal judge deemed unconstitutional this month. She said her Nebraska proposal is more like laws in Tennessee and Florida, which remain in place. 
“I’m not waiting. I’m not going to sit here and wait. Well, we lose more kids to suicide, depression and anxiety,” Storer said. 
Lawmakers have heard similar bills this week aimed at social media limits, and the same concerns were raised over violating the First Amendment. The bill requires social media companies to let parents view all posts and messages from their minor’s account, control privacy settings and limit the minor’s usage of the platform.

The legislation mandates that social media platforms implement a process enabling parents to withdraw consent for their child to maintain an account. Once consent is revoked, the platform must delete the child’s account and prevent them from creating a new one until parental consent is restored.
“Fundamentally, my problem with a lot of these things is that we run the risk of making it harder for people to engage in their First Amendment rights,” State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha said. “I’m very concerned about requiring adults to prove their age to use the internet or use these social media sites.
Storer emphasizes the importance of addressing youth mental health, referencing former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s public warning about the risks of social media to young people in 2023. 
“I assure you that minors’ rights to privacy in regards to parental oversight are not being violated,” Storer said. “The impact of social media on youth mental health and safety, quite frankly, is not up for debate anymore. The facts are out. The evidence is clear.” 
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said on the first day of debate that if lawmakers are going to “invoke suicide of children to pass sweeping legislation that strips rights and chills speech and increases government intervention” they should bring the same energy for Queer and Trans youth. She was alluding to a Legislative Bill 89 from Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha that seeks to define “male” and “female” in state law that, among other things, would restrict student-athlete participation and bathroom use by sex at birth.
“We have lost lives in Nebraska since the passage of Senator Kathleen [Kauth]’s bill, two years ago,” Hunt said. 
Kauth’s “Let Them Grow Act,” which was signed into law in 2023, banned transgender minors from receiving some gender-affirming care. Hunt wasn’t on the floor for the Friday vote.
The Nebraska attorney general would enforce the act, which allows for penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation.

(Photo by Gerville/Getty Images)The next time you’re on a Zoom meeting or asking ChatGPT a question, picture this: The information zips instantaneously through a room of hot, humming servers, traveling hundreds, possibly thousands of miles, before it makes its way back to you in just a second or two.
It can be hard to wrap your mind around, said Vijay Gadepally, a senior scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory, but large data centers are where nearly all artificial intelligence systems and computing happens today.
“Each one of these AI models has to sit on a server somewhere, and they tend to be very, very big,” he said. “So if your millions or billions of users are talking to the system simultaneously, the computing systems have to really grow and grow and grow.”
As the United States works to be a global AI superpower, it’s become a home to hundreds of data centers — buildings that store and maintain the physical equipment needed to compute information.
For users of the new and increasingly popular AI tools, it might seem like the changes have been all online, without a physical footprint. But the rise of AI has tangible effects — data centers and the physical infrastructure needed to run them use large amounts of energy, water and other resources, experts say.
“We definitely try to think about the climate side of it with a critical eye,” said Jennifer Brandon, a science and sustainability consultant. “All of a sudden, it’s adding so much strain on the grid to some of these places.”
 The rise of data centers

As society traded large, desktop computers for sleek laptops, and internet infrastructure began supporting AI models and other software tools, the U.S. has built the physical infrastructure to support growing computing power.
Large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) technologies — the foundation of most modern AI tools — have been used by technologists for decades, but only in the last five to seven years have they become commercialized and used by the general public, said David Acosta, cofounder and chief artificial intelligence officer of ARBOai.
To train and process information, these fast-learning AI models require graphic processing units (GPUs), servers, storage, cabling and other networking equipment, all housed in data centers across the country. Computers have been storing and processing data off-site in dedicated centers for decades, but the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and the move to cloud storage demanded much more storage capacity over the last decade.
As more things moved online, and computing hardware and chip technology supported faster processing, AI models became attainable to the general public, Acosta said. Current AI models use thousands of GPUs to operate, and training a single chatbot like ChatGPT uses about the same amount of energy as 100 homes over the course of a year.
“And then you multiply that times the thousands of models that are being trained,” Acosta said. “It’s pretty intense.”
The United States is currently home to more than 3,600 data centers, but about 80% of them are concentrated in 15 states, Data Center Map shows. The market has doubled since 2020, Forbes reported, with 21% year over year growth. For many years, nearly all of the country’s data centers were housed in Virginia, and the state is considered a global hub with nearly 70% of the world’s internet traffic flowing through its nearly 600 centers. Texas and California follow Virginia, with 336 and 307 centers, respectively.
Tech companies that require large amounts of computing power, the private equity firms and banks that invest in them and other real estate or specialized firms are the primary funders of data centers. In September, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and AI investment fund MGX invested $30 billion into new and expanded data centers primarily in the U.S, and said they will seek $100 billion in total investment, including debt financing.
Investment in American data center infrastructure is encouraging considering the global “AI arms race,” we’re in, Acosta said.
“If you own the data, you have the power,” Acosta said. “I just think we just make sure we do it ethically and as preemptive as possible.”

 Energy and environmental impact

Current estimates say data centers are responsible for about 2% of the U.S.’ energy demand, but Anthony DeOrsey, a research manager at sustainable energy research firm Cleantech group, projects data centers will be about 10% of demand by 2027.
As data centers are developed in new communities across the country, residents and their state legislators see a mix of financial benefits with energy and environmental challenges.
The development of data centers brings some infrastructure jobs to an area, and in busy data center communities, like Virginia’s Loudoun and Prince William counties, centers can generate millions in tax revenue, the Virginia Mercury reported.
Local governments can be eager to strike deals with the tech companies or private equity firms seeking to build, but the availability and cost of power is a primary concern. New large data centers require the electricity equivalent of about 750,000 homes, a February report from sustainability consultancy firm BSI and real estate services firm CBRE.
Under many state’s utilities structures, local residents can be  subjected to electric price increases to meet big electric needs of data centers. Some legislators, like Georgia State Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, have sought to protect residential and commercial customers from getting hit with higher utility bills.
Granville Martin, an Eastern Shore, Connecticut-based lawyer with expertise in finance and environmental regulation, said the same problem has come up in his own community.
“The argument was, the locals didn’t want this data center coming in there and sucking up a bunch of the available power because their view — rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly — was well, that’s just going to raise our rates,” Martin said.
Some states are exploring alternative energy sources. In Pennsylvania, Constellation Energy made a deal to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island to provide carbon-free electricity to offset Microsoft’s power usage at its nearby data centers.
But climate experts have concerns about data centers outside of their power demand.
“The general public is largely unaware that cooling industrial facilities, whatever they might be, is actually a really, really important aspect of their function,” Martin said.
The equipment in data centers, many of which run 24/7, generate a lot of heat. To regulate temperature, most pump water through tubing surrounding the IT equipment, and use air conditioning systems to keep those structures cool. About 40% of data center’s energy consumption is used for cooling, the Cleantech group found.
Some have a closed-loop system, recycling grey water through the same system, but many use fresh drinking water. The amount of water and energy used in cooling is enormous, Brandon, the sustainability consultant. said.
“The current amount of AI data centers we have takes six times the amount of water as the country of Denmark,” she said. “And then we are using the same amount of energy as Japan, which is the fifth largest energy user in the world, for data centers right now.”
 Is there a sustainable future for data centers?

Energy is now a material issue to running an AI company, DeOrsey said, and unrestrained, quickly evolving AI models are very expensive to train and operate. DeOrsey pointed to Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which released its attempt at a cost-conscious, energy efficient large language model, R1, in January.
The company claims it trained the model on 2,000 chips, much fewer than competitors like Open AI, ChatGPT’s parent company, and Google, which use about 16,000 chips. It’s not yet clear if the model lives up to its claims of energy efficiency in use, but it’s a sign that companies are feeling the pressure to be more efficient, DeOrsey said.
“I think companies like DeepSeek are an example of companies doing constrained optimization,” he said. “They’re assuming they won’t just get all the power they need, they won’t be able to get all of the chips they need, and just make do with what they have.”
For Gadepally, who is also chief tech officer of AI company Radium Cloud, this selective optimization is a tool he hopes more companies begin using. His recent work at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center focused on the lab’s own data center consumption. When they realized how hot their equipment was getting, they did an audit.
Gadepally said simple switches like using cheaper, less-robust AI models cut down on their energy use. Using AI models at off-peak times saved money, as did “power capping” or limiting the amount of power feeding their computer processors. The difference was nominal — you may wait a second or two more to get an answer back from a chatbot, for example.
With Northeastern University, MIT built software called Clover that watches carbon intensity for peak periods and makes adjustments, like automatically using a lower-quality AI model with less computing power when energy demand is high.
“We’ve been kind of pushing back on people for a long time saying, is it really worth it?” Gadepally said. “You might get a better, you know, knock-knock joke from this chatbot. But that’s now using 10 times the power than it was doing before. Is that worth it?”
Gadepally and Acosta both spoke about localizing AI tools as another energy and cost saving strategy for companies and data centers. In practice, that means building tools to do exactly what you need them to do, and nothing more, and hosting them on local servers that don’t need to send their computing out potentially hundreds of miles away to the nearest data center.
Health care and agricultural settings are a great example, Acosta said, where tools can be built to serve these specialized settings rather than processing their data at “bloated, over-fluffed”  large data centers.
Neither AI developer sees any slowdown in the demand for AI and processing capabilities of data centers. But Gadepally said environmental and energy concerns will come to a head for tech companies when they realize they could save money by saving energy, too. Whether DeepSeek finds the same success as some of its American competitors is yet to be seen, Gadepally said, but it will probably make them question their practices.
“It will at least make people question before someone says, ‘I need a billion dollars to buy new infrastructure,’ or ‘I need to spend a billion dollars on computing next month,” Gadepally said. “Now they may say, ‘did you try to optimize it?’”

(Provided by Montana State University)Three international students attending Montana State University had their F-1 visa status revoked “under the authority of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,” MSU said in a notice Friday to the campus community.
One international student from the University of Montana also had their F-1 visa revoked, a UM spokesperson said. However, that student has graduated and is living out of state.
The F-1 visa generally allows nonimmigrant international students to enter the country as a full-time student at an accredited institution and enroll in a program that culminates in a degree, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Stephanie McCalla, chairperson of the MSU Faculty Senate, said Friday she had not yet spoken with any students who are affected, but she and other faculty are upset at the news.
“These are members of our community, and they’re being ripped away for no apparent reason,” McCalla said.
A story earlier this month from Inside Higher Ed said the Trump administration is revoking student visas every week, and it appears federal immigration officials are also terminating their student residency status, “paving the way for arrest and deportation.”
MSU in Bozeman has an estimated 400 students from 64 countries, and the vast majority of them are on F-1 visas, said spokesperson Tracy Ellig in an email.
Ellig said the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prohibits the university from providing additional information, such as where the students with revoked visas are from, their enrollment status or their ability to remain on campus.
In her message to the campus community, President Waded Cruzado said the three students from MSU whose visas were revoked have been notified and received information regarding their status and available resources.
“The university will follow all applicable laws while exercising the necessary duty of care to our students,” Cruzado said in the email.
She said MSU was sharing the information with the campus “given the heightened attention to the topic.”
“We value every student in our campus; this appreciation includes our international students who make Montana State University their university of choice,” Cruzado said.
UM spokesperson Dave Kuntz said the university has 145 students on F-1 visas and 29 on J-1 visas. J-1 visas are for nonimmigrants participating in an exchange program, according to the U.S. Department of State.

UM has students from roughly 50 different countries.
Kuntz said UM learned of the changed status because it checks the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System database, where those records are stored, on a daily basis.
He said federal officials have not relayed information to UM about the change in status, and the database does not offer explanations for the change in status.
The Inside Higher Ed story said some university and immigration experts are concerned “the Trump administration is playing fast and loose” with the visa system, and it’s hindering the ability of campuses to help students “who may be targeted by ICE.”
The U.S. Department of State could not be immediately reached for comment late Friday afternoon, but a State Department spokesperson had told Inside Higher Ed it is helping keep the country safe.
“The State Department revokes visas every day in order to secure America’s borders and keep our communities safe—and will continue to do so,” the spokesperson wrote to Inside Higher Ed.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)  North Dakota lawmakers on Friday sided with hunters in the debate over whether the state Game and Fish Department can restrict using bait when deer hunting on private property. 
The House passed Senate Bill 2137 after rejecting a proposed amendment. The bill is the same version that passed the Senate.
The North Dakota Game and Fish Department has banned landowners from setting out feed for deer for the purpose of hunting in some areas of the state. The department testified against the bill, saying that feeding bans are part of an attempt to slow the spread of chronic wasting disease in deer. 
Charlie Bahnson, wildlife veterinarian for Game and Fish, said in written testimony that chronic wasting disease is still rare in North Dakota, but the department needs the feeding restrictions as a management tool. 
But Rep. Matt Ruby, R-Minot, argued that the bans have no effect on the spread of the disease that can be fatal in deer. 
Baiting bill limiting North Dakota Game and Fish policy passes Senate

Some states have seen large declines in deer populations. Ruby said North Dakota should continue to monitor for the disease. 
North Dakota has had 122 positive tests of chronic wasting disease in deer since 2009, The Bismarck Tribune reported, citing Game and Fish Department data. Of those, 119 cases were from deer killed by hunters.
Supporters of the bill argue there has only been one confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in the state, a deer that was found dead by a landowner near Williston that tested positive for the disease.
An argument against feeding is that it encourages deer to congregate in large groups, helping disease spread. Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said the state should encourage feeding because with more feed sources, the deer groups would be smaller, he said. 
The failed amendment would have put limits on how much feed could be put out and put restrictions on where feed could be placed. It also called for a Game and Fish report on chronic wasting disease to Legislative Management.  
Hunters have turned out in large numbers at the Capitol to show support for the bill. 
The bill heads to the governor for his signature.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)After news broke of a visa being revoked from an international graduate student at the University of Iowa, UI Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS) President Cary Stough said people immediately started asking the organization and him what can be done to help.
Stough said he wasn’t surprised to hear about the incident, the latest in a series of visa cancellations hitting international students across the country. International graduate students have been preparing for something like this to happen, he said — deactivating social media, checking on their visas, making sure their university documents are up to date and connecting with immigration lawyers.
“People are very, very terrified right now,” Stough said.

COGS is compiling resources and contacts to become a hub of knowledge for international students who need help, Stough said, while urging the UI to take a harder stance against actions that hurt its students. The graduate workers union sent out a news release to students and media with information and relevant services.
UI Public Relations Manager Chris Brewer said in an email the university is “aware of students who have been impacted” by changes to their visa, but no details can be provided due to privacy reasons. He did not respond to questions about university recommendations for affected students or procedures in the situation where Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, officials come to campus looking to detain a student.
UI International Programs Dean and Associate Provost Russell Ganim alerted international students and scholars about the revoked visa Thursday morning through an email, which included contact information for the Iowa State Bar Association, UI Student Legal Services and the Iowa Law law clinic.
“International students and scholars are valued members of the Iowa community,” Ganim said in the email.
COGS added to the university’s list in its news release, naming the American Immigration Lawyers Association, IC Compassion, Iowa City Catholic Worker, Eschucha Mi Voz Iowa and the Prairielands Freedom Fund as helpful organizations in this matter.
Many immigration lawyers who have spoken with COGS are saying if a student hasn’t heard anything about changes to their visa then they shouldn’t leave the country, Stough said. According to the release, if a student sees their student visa listed as revoked in the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS), they should connect with the UI Immigration Law Clinic to check their student status and discuss next steps.
So far, communication has stayed primarily within departments relating to international students, Stough said. He was told by university officials that if ICE agents do attempt to enter classrooms or other private spaces on campus, involved parties should contact the university’s Office of the General Counsel.
International graduate students should also reach out to COGS members to plan how to keep themselves and others safe, the news release stated.
“If push comes to shove, we will protect our neighbors, our friends and our fellow coworkers here at the university to make sure that this is not only a safe space where they can continue to do research and teaching, but also a space where they’re welcome,” Stough said.
University administration should make their intention to protect international students public, Stough said, and gave the option of paying impacted students’ legal fees as a good first step in offering support.
If the UI continues to lose graduate students due to state and federal actions, either being forced to go or choosing to leave, Stough said eventually it won’t have enough workers to teach courses. This would lead to lower undergraduate enrollment and the loss of revenue.
“The university should be standing up for its international students,” Stough said. “Diversity here makes us great. It also connects us with a larger community throughout the world, and any infringement upon that should be against the university’s mission.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Two bills regulating student-athlete compensation at colleges across the state are headed to the governor’s desk after passage through the Montana Legislature on Friday.
Senate Bill 482 requires written contracts for student-athlete usage of their name, image and likeness, while Senate Bill 271 removes an existing prohibition on schools directly paying student-athletes.
Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula introduced both bills, which she said will allow Montana’s largest schools to be competitive in the Big Sky Conference. She also brought the state’s original NIL legislation in 2021.
“If folks do care about the nuance, it actually puts more side rails on NIL for student athletes,” Boldman said in a committee hearing on both bills on April 7. “The university themselves will have a little bit more control over making sure that student athletes understand their contractual agreements and make sure that they’re not taken advantage of in the private sector.”
On SB 482, Boldman said, “We just want to make sure if you’re going to offer our student athletes a deal, it’s got to be in writing.”
The new law rolls back previous laws that specifically prohibited Montana universities and colleges from paying their student-athletes. As an example, some colleges have begun to place student-athletes names on the back of jerseys sold to fans — the players then get a cut of that revenue.

Institutions are already allowed to act as agents or add name, image and likeness agreements to scholarship agreements.
The legislation does not change outside endorsement deals, though does formalize those agreements in writing, meaning a verbal agreement does not constitute a legally binding contract.
“This is about fairness, opportunity, and keeping Montana competitive,” Boldman said in a press release.
Montana has three schools that compete in the NCAA: The University of Montana, Montana State University and Montana State University-Billings.
Similar discussions have occurred at the federal level, and a federal court is expected to soon rule on a $2.8 billion antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA which, if found against the athletics organizations, could allow student-athletes to have revenue sharing agreements and provide backpay.
Boldman said her bills will allow Montana student athletes to take part in the settlement.
“We want our student athletes to be able to opt into that settlement, which will then entitle them to some additional compensation,” Boldman said.
Representatives from Montana and Montana State both testified in support of the bill during its hearing.
“We have the compliance and support staff here to navigate this constantly changing landscape, and this change gives us the certainty we need to act within the bounds of state law,” UM spokesperson Dave Kuntz said during the hearing for SB 271. “With other legislative bodies around the region making similar changes, this bill will help ensure campus policies remain in line with our regional competitors as well.”
 Impacts to the NAIA

Beyond the NCAA schools in the state, the six Montana schools whose athletic teams belong to the Frontier Conference in the NAIA could also be impacted.

In 2020, the NAIA passed name, image and likeness rules for its member schools. It allowed athletes to be paid, but, Montana Tech men’s basketball head coach Adam Hiatt said, “the NAIA legislation did not intend to allow schools to pay student-athletes directly for NIL purposes.”
He added some Tech student-athletes have been able to take advantage of agreements for their name, image and likeness. He said there’s no plan to pay players through the school until the NAIA changes its policies.
Montana Tech athletic director Matt Stepan said the university is reviewing the legislation to see how it will impact them.
“While the new legislation may not have an immediate or direct effect on our recruiting efforts, changes of this nature often create ripple effects throughout college athletics,” Stepan said. “We’ll be monitoring the situation closely to determine any indirect implications for NAIA institutions and student-athletes.”

(Courtesy photos) Dispensing with a need for additional briefs or oral arguments, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled Friday in the high-profile dispute over last November’s closely contested election for an associate justice seat on the high court.
If implemented without further action by the federal courts, it appears the ruling could overturn the election result that has been confirmed by two recounts in which incumbent Democratic Justice Allison Riggs defeated her Republican challenger, state Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, by 734 votes.
The unsigned opinion was agreed to by four justices — all Republicans — Chief Justice Paul Newby and Associate Justices Trey Allen, Tamara Barringer, and Phil Berger, Jr. Two associate justices — Republican Richard Dietz and Democrat Anita Earls — concurred in part and dissented in part.
The ruling partially upholds and partially reverses a 2-1 Court of Appeals ruling issued last Friday on three key issues:

It reverses the Court of Appeals on the matter of throwing out 60,000-plus ballots cast by voters whose voter registration forms did not include a driver’s license number or last four digits of a social security number. While the Supreme Court opinion castigated the Board of Elections for what it called “inattention and failure to dutifully conform its conduct to the law’s requirements” by failing to fix flawed records, it said that throwing out those votes of voters for mistakes that were not their own (and, it emphasized, who had displayed photo ID while voting) would violate established precedent.
It upheld the Court of Appeals ruling on the question of certain military and overseas-citizen voters who used absentee ballots, but did not provide a copy of their photo ID with their ballot — something the Board of Elections has never required. Under the ruling, those voters will have to come forward to show their photo ID within 30 days “after the mailing of notice.”
It upheld the Court of Appeals on the question of so-called “never residents” — a few hundred absentee voters who have never lived in North Carolina, but who are connected to the state through their parents. The ruling says these voters should not have been allowed to vote.

In their opinions, both Justices Dietz and Earls concurred with the ruling on the 60,000-plus voters but issued blistering dissents on the other two categories, saying the court’s acceptance of the idea of changing voting rules after the election is violative of long-established precedent.
In blasting the court’s ruling on military voters — which only applies to a small number of predominately Democratic-leaning counties — and voters connected the through their parents who have long voted in the state, Justice Earls wrote:

        “It is no small thing to overturn the results of an election in a democracy by throwing out ballots that were legally cast consistent with all election laws in effect on the day of the election. Some would call it stealing the election, others might call it a bloodless coup, but by whatever name, no amount of smoke and mirrors makes it legitimate.”    
 
Justice Dietz wrote the court should hear arguments in the case and rule that Griffin’s claims “are not justiciable in a backward looking challenge to a past election.”
In a statement issued shortly after the ruling was handed down, Justice Riggs issued the following statement and said her attorneys would be seeking immediate action in federal court:


“I’m the proud daughter of a 30-year military veteran who was deployed overseas, and it is unacceptable that the Court is choosing to selectively disenfranchise North Carolinians serving our country, here and overseas. While I’m gratified to see the Court of Appeals reversed on the erroneous decision to potentially disenfranchise the more than 60,000 North Carolinians whose registration my opponent has recklessly challenged, I will not waiver in my fight to protect the fundamental freedoms for which our military service members and their families have sacrificed so much.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A drugmaker is suing South Dakota over a law that bars the company from limiting drug discounts used to prop up providers who serve Medicaid patients.
The lawsuit is from Chicago-based AbbVie Inc., which sells the wrinkle-remover Botox and the arthritis drug Humira, among other products. The litigation challenges the legality of a bill signed into law by South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden on March 11. 
Senate Bill 154 bars drug companies from limiting the number of pharmacies that hospitals and clinics can contract with to distribute drugs through the federal 340B program.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

The bill’s supporters called 340B a lifeline for rural health care providers and pharmacies. Those providers are kneecapped by Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements too low to keep the lights on, they said, and they need the supplemental income.
The bill’s opponents, however, argued that the way providers use 340B to recoup their expenses — by getting drugs on the cheap and marking them up — is unsustainable, harmful to patients and interferes in the free market.
The Legislature sided with providers. 
In its lawsuit, AbbVie Inc. alleges that South Dakota’s new law amounts to an illegal “taking” of the company’s products by forcing it to provide them at a discount through contract pharmacies without any say in which or how many pharmacies are involved. 
The company also argues that SB 154 alters the terms of a federal law South Dakota legislators did not write and cannot legally modify, and that it seeks to regulate interstate commerce in a way only Congress has the power to do.
The bill “places an improper thumb on the scale and tilts the bargaining power in favor of in-state pharmacies and covered entities at the expense of out-of-state manufacturers,” the lawsuit says.
Other states have passed similar laws and faced similar lawsuits.
AbbVie filed its lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in South Dakota. Six days ago, a federal judge in Minnesota dismissed a similar case challenging the legality of a similar law in that state.
The Eighth Circuit of Appeals ruled in favor of Arkansas for its version of the law.
The pharmaceutical industry has also won some victories, though. Last summer, in a case filed by United Therapeutics Corporation in Washington, D.C., a three-judge panel upheld a lower court’s ruling that the law behind the 340B program doesn’t bar drugmakers from imposing limitations on how it distributes drugs through the program.
Attorney General Marty Jackley is a named defendant in the South Dakota case, as is Larry Deiter, director of the state Division of Insurance.
Jackley’s office defends state law in court, regardless of Jackley’s status as a named defendant in a case. His spokesman, Tony Mangan, told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday that the state had not yet been served with a copy of the lawsuit.
History, changes to program
The 340B program requires drugmakers who want to participate in Medicaid and Medicare to discount their prices for hospitals, clinics and other providers that serve low-income patients. Those “covered entities” can then sell those drugs at a higher price and use the difference to help fill budget gaps and keep the doors open for patients. 
World-famous Wall Drug isn’t immune from challenges facing rural pharmacies

When it became law in 1992, 340B was limited to a small subset of hospitals and clinics, like those serving mostly Medicaid patients. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expanded 340B to a wider range of providers, roping in places that act as “sole community hospitals” for Medicaid patients who reside in rural geographies. Since then, according to a report from the American Hospital Association, the number of rural providers using it has more than doubled.
What’s also happened, according to the lawsuit from AbbVie, is an expansion of access to lower prices by contract pharmacies.
Commercial pharmacies don’t qualify as “covered entities” under 340B, meaning they don’t have access to discounted drugs unless they contract with a health care provider who does.
The lawsuit paints the agreements between Medicaid-serving providers and their contracted pharmacies as a way to make money on the backs of drugmakers and low-income patients.
“Instead of serving the covered entities’ uninsured and low-income patients, the for-profit contract pharmacies acquire manufacturers’ drugs at the federally discounted price, sell them to patients (including indigent patients) at full price, and pocket the difference,” the lawsuit says.
South Dakota providers: Program keeps us afloat
Lobbyists for South Dakota’s health care systems, rural hospitals and pharmacists offered a different perspective on the arrangements.
Mobridge Regional Hospital Director John Ayoub told lawmakers in February that his nonprofit system serves clients across North and South Dakota. 
“We are the only hospital providing obstetrical services and delivering babies, as well as the only hospital providing general and trauma surgery services in at least a 100 mile radius in every direction,” Ayoub said.

  Rep. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, listens to testimony during the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on March 4, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)
 

Many of its patients qualify for Medicaid, Ayoub said, and low reimbursement rates mean the Mobridge system often operates in the red. It lost $600,000 last year, he said, and $1 million the year before. 
Without the financial prop-up of 340B — funded by drugmakers, not taxpayers — some services might have to end and “people will die.”
“This is not hyperbole,” he said. “It’s just a fact.”
Dillon Kjerstad operates independent pharmacies in Philp and Custer. He said the ability to collect a “reasonable fee” through 340B helps him keep the doors open. If drug companies were able to limit contract pharmacies, it might make it impossible for him to continue offering drugs to Medicaid patients.
“Driving 90 miles to Rapid City in the dead of winter just isn’t an option for my pharmacy’s senior diabetic patient who needs medications now,” Kjerstad said Feb. 19.
Drug company lobbyists and the lobbyist for a free-market political organization told lawmakers that the bill seeks to solve a problem that ought to be solved by Congress.
Sen. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, voted in favor of SB 154. Before casting her vote, though, she offered a nod to the notion that 340B fills a gap created by low federal reimbursement rates.
“Hospitals and clinics and pharmacies are playing the cards that they’ve been dealt,” Davis said. “And Congress needs to take action.”

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)An Iowa-licensed social worker accused of having personal or sexual relationships with two clients is now facing disciplinary action from the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals.
State records indicate Stephanie A. Levy is charged with engaging in sexual activity with a former client within five years of the client relationship ending, and with having her social work license revoked in the state of Nebraska.
The board has not disclosed the underlying allegations that form the basis of the two charges, but says Levy is currently an Iowa-licensed social worker who practiced in Omaha during the period when the alleged violations took place.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 12, 2025.
Nebraska Bureau of Public Health records show the bureau revoked Levy’s license as a master social worker and mental health practitioner in March 2024 for alleged immoral or dishonorable conduct, exploitation and failure to keep adequate records.
The Nebraska records indicate Levy was working in private practice as a mental health practitioner and was a leader in the Nebraska First Responders’ Support Network when the alleged violations occurred. In those roles, the bureau alleged, Levy had consistent contact with multiple current and former clients outside of any therapeutic relationship.
The bureau alleges that while speaking to a therapist, Levy disclosed that in the fall of 2020, she had become attracted to a female first responder to whom she provided services between July 2019 and February 2022.
In February 2021, the bureau alleged, the first responder admitted to her ex-wife she was having an affair with Levy, and in September 2021, Levy and the first responder attended a wedding together as a couple. In January 2022, Levy allegedly moved out of the home she shared with her husband and, on occasion, began staying at the first-responder’s home.
According to the bureau, Levy admitted to a state investigator, “I recognize that this is against the rules, I own it and, yeah, that is where we are at.”
As part of the board’s investigation of the matter, an investigator spoke to another of Levy’s clients who allegedly said he and Levy had once maintained a “weird, blended relationship” and that, “yes, professional lines were probably crossed.”
That former client also alleged Levy had asked him to lie to conceal her relationship with the first responder and had once asked him if he wanted to “know what the sex with (the first responder) was like.”



Bettendorf social worker charged
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently charged Jamie L. Roggenbauer with practicing in a professional relationship while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol, and with unprofessional conduct by interfering with a previous employer’s information technology systems.
According to the board, the undisclosed conduct that gave rise to the charges occurred at some unspecified time in the past when Roggenbauer practiced in Bettendorf where she now resides.

Tom Millett, R-Marion, urged his colleagues in the House to pass Senate Bill 92, which would make membership with the State Bar of Montana voluntary for lawyers. 
“Now you may have heard or think this is an attack on the Bar, but that is not true,” Millett said, telling the House that the bill would still allow for oversight of the profession and was only meant to return constitutional rights to lawyers.
House lawmakers soundly opposed the bill, 43-57. 
Rep. Brian Close, D-Bozeman, a lawyer, said the bill had no proponents speak during the hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. The only Republican attorney on the committee opposed the bill, he added. 
“There were not a bunch of lawyers lined up in the hallway crying, ‘Free us from our shackles,’” Close said. “So the persons most affected by the current bar structure are fine with it.”
The Montana State Supreme Court ordered the creation of the State Bar in 1974, making membership to the Bar a condition to practice law in Montana.
Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, introduced SB 92 as a “freedom bill.” His main issue, he said, was that the state Bar collects dues from members, and takes stances on some political issues, including lobbying the Legislature. 
If a member has an issue with a State Bar position, they can get their proportion of funds used in the effort refunded, which last session amounted to $7.61.
Despite this, Fuller said he still took issue with the requirement to associate with members of the state Bar.
Alanah Griffith, D-Gallatin Gateway, an attorney and former treasurer for the state Bar, said during the floor debate she was concerned the bill didn’t contain a clear substitute mechanism for how attorneys who opt out of the State Bar would complete their licensing and continuing-education requirements for maintaining their status.
Other opponents to the bill in the House pointed out that the Montana Constitution clearly states the state Supreme Court may make rules governing admission to the Bar, and legislative action would be overreach. 
Millett, who is not an attorney, pushed back on that notion by indicating there was no legal review note from legislative staff attached to the bill. 
Fuller had previously objected to the state Bar for disparaging remarks and name-calling by a Montana lawyer during a panel hosted by the organization as part of a continuing legal education seminar last year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3720-scaled-e1744406607973-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-04-11 18:04:39.131919

John Gray/Verite News)The federal government has sufficient grounds to deport Mahmoud Khalil – the former Columbia University student-activist and green-card holder currently detained in Louisiana — an immigration judge found after a tense hearing Friday at the LaSalle immigration court in Jena.
Khalil’s supporters argue the Trump administration’s actions against him — since he was picked up by federal immigration agents in New York and shipped to LaSalle Parish last month — are a violation of his First Amendment rights.
As The Guardian reported, legal filings from lawyers representing the government do not accuse Khalil of any criminal conduct. Rather, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has deemed Khalil a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests simply because of his support for pro-Palestinian protests, which Rubio labeled “antisemitic,” on Columbia’s campus last year. And under a rarely used provision of federal immigration law, that finding alone made him eligible for removal, Judge Jamee Comans found.
In her decision, Comans said she determined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security “had met its burden” to remove Khalil from the United States. “This court is obligated to apply the laws as written by Congress,” Comans said, adding that immigration judges are without authority to overrule a determination made by the Secretary of State or consider whether that determination was a violation of Khalil’s First Amendment rights.

Over the last several weeks, the Trump administration has targeted several other international students and academics who have participated in pro-Palestinian activities at American universities. Whether or not they’ll be able to secure those deportations is now a matter for the courts to decide.  Attorneys for Khalil are also seeking his release from detention in a separate legal battle playing out in a federal court in New Jersey.
Friday’s ruling means that Khalil will remain in detention at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, a privately operated detention center in Jena that is connected to the court, while his attorneys continue to fight his removal through an appeals process.
At the end of the hearing, Khalil stood up and made a statement.
“There is nothing that is more important to this court than due process and fundamental fairness,” he said, paraphrasing remarks Comans had made from the bench.
“Neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,” Khalil said. “This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family.”
“I just hope that the urgency you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.”
Members of Khalil’s legal team planned a Friday afternoon press conference to respond to the ruling.
Representatives for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.
After the hearing, immigrants’ rights advocates and clergy who gathered at a news conference presented a statement from Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is pregnant with the couple’s first child and could not travel to Louisiana.
“Today’s decision feels like a devastating blow to our family,” Abdalla said. “My husband is a political prisoner who is being deprived of his rights because he believes Palestinians deserve equal dignity and freedom. There is nothing the government can say about my husband that can silence this truth.”
“In less than a month, Mahmoud and I will welcome our first child. Until we are reunited, I will not stop advocating for my husband’s safe return home.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With the deadline fast approaching to gather enough signatures to qualify for a ballot referendum, the coalition of Utah labor groups trying to overturn a controversial union bill is feeling optimistic. 
Since March 15, the Protect Utah Workers coalition, which consists of teacher, firefighter, police and other unions, both in the public and private sector, has been gathering signatures around the state in hopes to qualify for a referendum that could ultimately overturn HB267.
The final day to sign in support of the referendum is Tuesday, April 15 — by Wednesday, the coalition plans on delivering the signature packets to county clerks.
“We’re feeling really optimistic. We’re going to get this, and we’ll be ready to go next Wednesday, when everything gets turned in,” said Brad Asay, Utah president of the American Federation of Teachers. “We’re right on track.”

Passed by lawmakers earlier this winter and signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Valentine’s Day, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate terms of employment. 
That means a teachers union, for example, can no longer negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees. The bill takes effect July 1, 2025. 
The bill sponsors, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, say HB267 is meant to protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. 
But labor groups and members of the public were staunchly opposed to the bill, which narrowly passed out of the Legislature. That opposition morphed into an effort to gather enough signatures to trigger a referendum, a process where citizens can vote on new laws, or repeal existing ones, during elections. 
The coalition has roughly 5,000 union members and volunteers that for the last month have been around the state gathering signatures. 
“We have had a lot of momentum going into this,” said Renée Pinkney, president of the Utah Education Association, a teachers union that represents about 18,000 educators. “The scale, we anticipate, is going to be growing day by day as we get closer to the turn-in date, and we’re cautiously optimistic that this is going to be a huge success.” 
Sen. Mike Lee proposes a public union bill similar to the law passed by Utah this year

The process to qualify for a citizen-led ballot referendum is difficult. Of the 26 states that allow them, Utah has some of the steepest requirements for a referendum, requiring signatures from at least 8% of the state’s voters in 30 days. In addition, the law requires signatures from 8% of voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
The signature packets are then handed over to the county clerks — once clerks have verified the voter registration of the signees, the lieutenant governor’s office will review the process. Assuming the coalition has complied with state code and gathered enough valid signatures, ballot language will be crafted for the 2026 General Election. 
“We believe it’s difficult by design, because legislators don’t want the referendum process to be easy,” said Pinkney, pointing to requirements like specific margins for the signature packets, or the number of staples used in each packet. 
Currently, 8% of the state’s voters equates to roughly 141,000 signatures. In late March, the coalition held a news conference at the Utah Capitol announcing they had 130,000 signatures. 
But it’s unlikely all of those signatures are valid — some people may have signed twice, or aren’t registered to vote. Others may have given an incorrect address, or have illegible handwriting. So the coalition is trying to go above and beyond that 141,000 threshold. 
“The more signatures you get, the better cushion there is,” said Asay. 
The coalition has been trying to gather signatures around the state. Volunteers have been at coffee shops, grocery stores, college campuses, congressional town halls, bus stops, tattoo parlors, TRAX stations, sporting events and protests.
“The numbers change literally hour by hour, because we have so many people returning packets,” said Pinkney, who likely won’t know exactly how many signatures the coalition has gathered until the lieutenant governor’s office informs the coalition.  



Let us know what you think...


 


During the legislative session, the opposition to the bill was diverse, with firefighters, police officers, teachers, steelworkers, electricians, flight attendants, municipal workers, plumbers, delivery drivers and more, all speaking out against HB267. 
Now, as advocates gather signatures around the state, they’re seeing a similar turnout.  
“It’s been across the board. We’ve had people from across the aisle, we’ve had conservatives, we’ve had progressives, we’ve had people that just do not like what the Legislature did,” said Asay. “What we’re seeing is a lot of people that are upset at the Legislature because they feel like they don’t have a voice. That’s been the theme.” 
Though controversial among labor groups, HB267 was supported by a number of conservative advocacy and policy groups — that includes Americans for Prosperity, which kicked off its “Decline to Sign” campaign last month. 
The group says the labor coalition has been spreading misinformation related to HB267 and is urging Utahns not to throw their signatures behind the effort. The campaign includes radio and digital advertisements with a simple message: “Don’t sign the referendum — stand for accountability!”  
“The messaging that they need these collective bargaining rights when so many are already not using it, is just fundamentally wrong,” said Americans for Prosperity-Utah state director Kevin Greene in an interview last month, pointing to other school districts, fire and police departments, and municipalities that don’t collectively bargain and haven’t seen stagnant wages or unsafe work environments.

Democrat Josh Shapiro in a lawsuit over a recent U.S. Department of Education cancellation of funds for three programs funded through the American Rescue Act to help vulnerable school children recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Homeless Children and Youth; Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund; and Emergency Assistance to Nonpublic Schools programs.
“Cutting critical funding that students and schools are counting on is unacceptable and reckless,” Torrez said in a statement. “These cuts will have a detrimental effect on our children, stunting their ability to learn in the classroom by rendering schools unable to provide essential resources like food, classroom supplies, special education for teachers and more.”
The lawsuit notes that the U.S. Department of Education in late 2023 and early 2024, “long after the federal government had declared that the COVID-19 pandemic was over,” had given the plaintiff states extensions to use the money they had been awarded to combat the pandemic’s impact on vulnerable student populations.
On March 28, “with no advance notice or warning,” U.S Education Secretary Linda McMahon rescinded that extension, effective the end of the day.
“ED’s drastic and abrupt change in position triggered chaos for state education departments…and local school districts,” the complaint says. “If the rescission action is not vacated and the approved extensions are not reinstated, key programs and services that address ongoing  and emerging education needs of Plaintiffs’ students and local school districts to combat the long term effects of the pandemic will have to be dissolved or disbanded.”
The suit asks for the court to find that the federal education department’s rescission of funds violates the American Rescue Act, and to restate the original extension date of  March 28, 2026.
New Mexico, as of the date the federal education department cancelled the extension of the funds, still had about $778,000 unliquidated funds of the $6.4 million it received under HYC; $12.3 million of the $979.7 million it received under ESSER; and approximately $4.79 million of the $17.4 million it received under EANS.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 18:04:39.131919

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota University System Chancellor Mark Hagerott will retire at the end of April, according to a Friday announcement.

Hagerott originally planned to step down as chancellor at the end of 2025, then serve a three-year contract as a professor of artificial intelligence and human security for the University System. He told the State Board of Higher Education at a Friday meeting his plans to move his retirement date up.
He will no longer be taking the teaching position, a University System spokesperson confirmed Friday.

In a Friday open letter, the Navy veteran and cybersecurity expert said he was accelerating his retirement to devote himself to national security work.
“In these times of rapid military change, my research and book project with the Naval Institute Press on naval officer formation has been expanded significantly with the emergence of artificial intelligence,” he wrote.
The State Board of Higher Education will meet early next week to figure out next steps for selecting an interim chancellor, according to the announcement.
Hagerott will remain on the Secretary of the Navy’s Education for Seapower Advisory Board, the announcement states.
Hagerott will split his time between Washington, D.C., and North Dakota, and hopes to spend more time at his family farm in Morton County, the release said.
The chancellor took a leave of absence last year to prepare to teach a class on AI and to work on a book.
He has led North Dakota’s 11 public colleges and universities since 2015.

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed two bills this week concerning New Mexico children, but called out lawmakers for missed opportunities. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Bills requiring the regulation of cell phones in schools and that hospitals have a safe care plan for substance-exposed newborns were signed into law this week, but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham used the bills to point out lawmakers’ missed opportunities.
Lujan Grisham signed 22 bills into law on Thursday, including Senate Bill 11, which requires local school districts and charter schools to adopt a wireless communication device policy; and Senate Bill 42, which requires hospitals have a plan of safe care in place when newborns are found to be exposed to controlled substances and requires their parents to participate in the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act program. 
In a memo explaining her decision to sign SB11, the governor said that while it was a “first step” toward regulating cell phone use in schools, she was “profoundly disappointed” that lawmakers chose to amend the bill to make compliance optional for local districts. The amendment loosens the wording around the Public Education Department’s minimum requirements for local policies.
“Once again, however, the Legislature squirmed out of taking a meaningful step to improve education under the auspices of local control,” the governor wrote. “That is all well and good until this same body blames the Public Education Department-and not the local bodies-for poor educational outcomes of New Mexico students. I once again encourage the Legislature to hold local school districts accountable for educational outcomes. Our students deserve it.”
Lujan Grisham had a similar response in her veto message about House Bill 65, which would have clarified that local school districts have the authority to determine the number of instructional days in their school calendar. Instead, she voiced her support of a 2024 PED rule – which has not been enforced – requiring local districts to have a minimum of 180 days in their calendars.
PED’s 180-day school calendar rule back in the courts

In another memo this week, Lujan Grisham explained that she chose to sign SB42 because of its requirement that parents of substance-exposed newborns receive treatment through the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act program. However, she called out lawmakers for continuing an “unwarranted vendetta” against the Children, Youth and Families Department, particularly for including amendments to the bill, which require department employees to backup electronic device data daily, monthly and annually. 
“If the Legislature actually wanted to help children and CYFD, it would have fully funded the agency so that it could hire all the staff it needs to succeed,” Lujan Grisham wrote. “The Legislature seems to be of the opinion that adding ever increasing administrative burdens on an agency that they refuse to fund at required levels will make children safer. They also seem to believe that piling on criticisms for problems that they bare some responsibility for creating will absolve them of their own neglect. They are wrong.”
She went on to encourage lawmakers to consider becoming foster parents or apply for a job or volunteer position with CYFD. 
“It is far too easy to stand on the sidelines and criticize CYFD. I hope the Legislature will commit not only to fully funding CYFD, but also to do their part on an individual level to help make a difference in children’s lives,” Lujan Grisham wrote.
The governor voiced similar criticism of lawmakers, as well as Attorney General Raúl Torrez, before the end of the session when she signed House Bill 5 into law, establishing the Office of the Child Advocate. She pointed out lawmakers seem to continuously “condemn” CYFD and its employees, and “refuse to fully fund the agency to hire enough staff then criticize [the department’s] vacancy rates and unmanageable workloads.”

(Photo by Liam DeBonis for Source NM)Most of the public spending that New Mexico lawmakers voted to send up to the state’s governor this year managed to avoid the wrath of her veto pen.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday signed three pieces of legislation into law, establishing the state government’s income and spending over the next year, along with authorizing one-time spending on public infrastructure projects.
“These appropriations bills represent significant investments in New Mexico’s future, from education and healthcare to critical infrastructure,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement.
The governor has the authority to sign legislation while rejecting specific parts that propose to spend public funds, called “line-item vetoes.”
In a news release, the governor’s office said her line-item vetoes “reflect her concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability, implementation timelines, or alignment with the administration’s strategic priorities.”
“The targeted line-item vetoes were necessary to maintain fiscal responsibility while ensuring that we fund our highest-priority projects and initiatives,” Lujan Grisham said.
Yearly state budget
Lujan Grisham signed House Bills 2 and 3, which set the $10.8 billion state budget for Fiscal Year 2026, representing a 6% increase from last year.
She made a series of 87 line-item vetoes to the budget that fall into four categories: parts that “impermissibly attempt to create substantive law;” parts that “attempt to enact general policy;” parts that “intrude into the executive managerial function;” and parts that “unduly restrict appropriations to specified types of expenditures.”
Of those, 14 line-item vetoes total approximately $331 million that will not be spent, approximately 0.03% of the total. They include:

$80 million for housing programs in Bernalillo County and $10 million for programs in Doña Ana County, leaving intact $110 million for housing projects in general
$6 million for bioscience development, contingent on a legislative proposal that did not pass
$5 million to help doctors working in behavioral health settings to repay loans, leaving intact $20 million for all health professionals
$5 million to help doctors repay loans, contingent on a legislative proposal that did not pass
$4.6 million that would have gone through the Public Education Department to tribal education departments
$4 million for a Sundance satellite festival and academy
$2.7 million that would have paid for student testing
$2.5 million for flood control improvements near Hatch
$1 million for a public safety campus in Chaparral and $2 million for public safety infrastructure in Luna, Hidalgo and Doña Ana counties, leaving intact $10 million for public safety infrastructure in general
$2 million for rural airports
$1.65 million that would have covered start-up costs for the Department of Justice to establish an Office of the Child Advocate, contingent on a legislative proposal that she signed
$1 million that would have paid for the Legislative Finance Committee to evaluate the new behavioral health package, and $1 million for LFC to create a children’s future task force, contingent on a legislative proposal that did not pass
$1 million for career pathways programs at the Higher Education Department

Lujan Grisham also allowed $5 million to go to the Department of Finance and Administration for grants to local governments to close encampments of homeless people, but vetoed language that would have also made the money available to use for streamlined housing placements, campsite services from outreach workers, housing navigators and case managers.
In her message to lawmakers, the governor noted that she also signed other bills that created a behavioral health trust fund, created a Medicaid trust fund, increasing the annual money going to the Early Childhood Education and Care Department to a minimum of $500 million, establishing the Strategic Water Supply, modernizing the Water Quality Act and regulating harmful PFAS chemicals.

New infrastructure
Lujan Grisham signed House Bill 450, which authorizes $1.2 billion in new one-time capital outlay project spending on colleges and universities, public schools, health facilities, state parks, a new STEM center, water projects, courts, senior centers, electric vehicle infrastructure, prisons and acequias.
HB450 also sets aside $595 million for local government projects like schools; water and sewer; police; public buildings; health, housing; parks; roads; cultural facilities; transportation; prisons; and military and emergency response projects.
Lujan Grisham wrote that she made a series of line-item vetoes to new capital outlay project money totaling $1.2 million, or approximately 0.10% of the total, that would have gone to projects that “lack proper planning or are not ready to proceed.”
She wrote that she also vetoed all capital outlay appropriations under $10,000, because “state and local governments have other means well within their capacities to fund these smaller projects.”
She also vetoed parts of HB450 that are “unnecessarily restrictive” on decisions made by executive branch state agencies, to ensure money goes to the proper place and to guarantee the amounts are enough to complete the intended projects.
Old infrastructure
The governor also signed Senate Bill 425, which reauthorizes old capital outlay project spending that the state approved in prior years but has not yet been spent.
“We must deploy these resources to benefit New Mexico’s children, families and communities, and this legislation advances that goal,” she wrote.
The governor made 112 line-item vetoes to old capital outlay money in SB425, representing approximately 26% of the 423 total projects in SB425.
Lujan Grisham wrote that each line-item veto was justified because either the money has not been spent; or is already found in the state budget; the bonds for the projects haven’t been issued; or the language would have created unnecessarily burdens on state agencies.
During the recent legislative session, lawmakers said they want to reform the capital outlay process to prevent wasted money on projects languishing for years without coming to fruition.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia 14- and 15-year-olds seeking employment would no longer be required to have a work permit under a bill approved by the House of Delegates Friday morning.
Delegates passed Senate Bill 427 with a 91 to 9 vote. The House’s nine Democrats voted against the bill. There was no discussion on the bill prior to Friday’s vote.
The minimum legal age to work in West Virginia is 14. Current state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent. The permit includes age certification, a commitment by the employer to employ the child legally, a description of the work the child is applying to do, a signature by the child’s principal saying that they’re attending school and parental consent. 
Under Senate Bill 427, employers seeking to hire the teenagers would be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. The age certificate would include the child’s age, name and date of birth, as well as information about the job they’re seeking, among other things.
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh, chairman of the Senate Workforce Committee said the legislation is meant to simplify kids’ ability to work.
“We’re going into vocational training more and more in our public schools, and this provides a way that we’re not tasking the local county superintendents with having to approve the work permits instead going with the age permits,” Roberts said. “Fourteen and 15-year-olds can already work, but this will now allow the parents to make that decision.”
Opponents of the legislation say that eliminating work permits may lead to children being exploited.
Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said in a statement that work permits are vital protection for children and families to help ensure compliance with child labor laws. Research shows that child labor violations are lower in states that require them, she said. 
“While Senate and House committees certainly improved the legislation via amendments from the extremely dangerous introduced version, the final product is unnecessary at best and harmful at worst,” Allen said. “We will closely follow the implementation and impacts of this legislation to ensure youth workers are protected.”
Roberts disagreed with concerns, saying that federal child labor laws still have to be followed.  
“So no, they won’t be working in coal mines and with heavy machinery and all these kinds of things,” Roberts said. “Basically, what I envision is that we’re helping the kids at entry level to get into the workforce.”
He added that the 18 to 24 age group is the lowest performing age group for workforce participation. 
The bill will next go back to the Senate to approve any changes in the bill the House made. After that, it will go to Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s desk for approval.

The bill was later taken off notice in the Senate. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A bill that would criminalize knowingly giving firearms to someone who recently received inpatient mental health treatment was pushed to 2026 on Wednesday  amid questions about its language.
Rep. Shaundelle Brooks, a Hermitage Democrat, named the bill “Akilah’s Law” in honor of her son Akilah Dasilva, who was killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville Waffle House in 2018.
The shooter, Travis Reinking of Morton, Illinois, had a history of schizophrenia and delusions. Prior to the shooting, Illinois State Police had revoked his firearm owner identification card, forcing him to surrender his guns to his father. His father then returned the guns to Reinking, breaking Illinois state law. 
Tennessee bars giving firearms to juveniles or intoxicated people, but not those who have been committed for mental health evaluation.
Brooks said her bill intends to bring Tennessee in line with the Illinois law that prohibits someone from giving or selling a firearm to a person who has been a patient in a mental health institution within five years.
Giving guns to certain mental health patients could become a crime in Tennessee

Brooks’ bill passed the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee in late March, but questions over the bill’s scope and language arose in the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 8. 
Sen. Paul Rose, a Southwest Tennessee Republican, asked for clarity on what the bill defines as a “mental health institution” and what it means to be “admitted.” Rose questioned whether a person who makes routine visits to a mental health provider for medication would be considered a patient of a mental health institution under the bill’s definition.
The bill’s Senate sponsor, Memphis Democrat Raumesh Akbari, said she did not believe the bill would apply in that case. 
Elliot Pinsly, president and CEO of the Behavioral Health Foundation, said the way the legislation is written could have a “chilling effect on people’s willingness to seek mental health treatment in Tennessee.” Pinsly, a licensed clinical social worker, founded the policy-focused nonprofit in 2020.
“The actual bill makes it a crime punishable by up to one year imprisonment to sell, give or otherwise transfer a firearm to a person who has received just about any kind of mental health care or addiction treatment in the past five years, voluntary or involuntary, outpatient or inpatient,” Pinsly said.
Facing uncertainty on the outcome of a committee vote, Akbari chose to move the bill to the general subcommittee, essentially putting it on ice until it can be resurrected in 2026.
“I look forward to Representative Brooks continuing to move this through the House … I will be working with all members on this committee so that we can reach a solution so we can really protect folks in Tennessee,” Akbari said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The first quarter of the year came and went without a peep from Hasbro Inc. on whether the Pawtucket toy and gaming company would be moving out of its Pawtucket headquarters — and where it would go.
Now, the decision has been postponed, with “clarity” on a potential relocation expected by this summer, Andrea Snyder, a Hasbro spokesperson, confirmed in an email Friday morning.
Snyder did not respond to questions about how the economic aftershocks rippling through the stock market and major companies played into the delay. But it’s no secret that Hasbro is hurting; stocks plunged 20% since President Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal tariff” policy on April 2, with Hasbro shares hitting a 52-week low on Tuesday.
Like its game industry competitors, much of Hasbro relies on international supply chains, with 40% of its products coming from China. While Trump backed off tariffs on most other countries earlier Wednesday, the trade war with China continues to escalate, with China raising a retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports to 125% Friday morning.
Before the trade war, the company looked poised to abandon its century-old roots in the Ocean State, trading in its circa 1900 Pawtucket headquarters for a new, modern space in Boston. When news broke in September that the multinational company was eyeing a move across state lines, Rhode Island officials appeared caught off-guard.
Local and state leaders scrambled to try and persuade the company to stay, if not in Pawtucket, then in Providence, offering up a piece of prime real estate in the I-195 Redevelopment District for just $1.
But other incentives requiring state funding or legislation through the Rhode Island General Assembly have not been introduced, and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has deferred to Gov. Dan McKee to take the lead on negotiations with Hasbro executives.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said the governor’s office will “remain engaged” with Hasbro executives.
“We brought together leaders in government, business and higher education to present Hasbro with a strong proposal — one we believe will be difficult to walk away from,” DaRocha said in an email Friday.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that would reform the Prisoner Review Board passed the Illinois Senate on Thursday, aiming to protect victims and increase transparency about prisoner releases following years of controversy surrounding the board’s decisions.

Championed by Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, Senate Bill 19 would give victims the ability to file victim impact statements ahead of hearings, provide them with additional notice when their offender is granted early release, and allow them to seek an order of protection against an offender who is incarcerated.

The bill passed on a 33-22 vote, with some Democrat senators opposing the legislation.

It would also create the Office of the Director of Victim and Witness Services, which would ensure the board complies with victims’ rights, and mandates victims are provided with contact information for the State Victim Assistance Hotline

The reforms come after Crosetti Brand murdered an 11-year-old Chicago boy in 2024. That February, the board voted to release Brand, finding there was not enough evidence he had violated his conditions of release. His ex-girlfriend, Laterria Smith, was denied an emergency order of protection by a Cook County judge while Brand was imprisoned at Stateville in Crest Hill.

A day after he was released, Brand attacked Smith and murdered her 11-year-old son, Jayden Perkins, who attempted to protect his mother. The murder caused two PRB members, including the board chair, to resign.

Brand’s history of domestic violence against women prompted both advocates and lawmakers to call for stricter review of prisoners’ backgrounds before their release.

During last year’s legislative session, Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, championed a PRB reform bill that that had bipartisan support, but was never called for a vote in the House on the final day of session.

That bill would have made changes that included requiring the board to notify victims within 24 hours if an offender, whom they had an order of protection against, was released early.

In a news conference held the day after the session ended, Gov. JB Pritzker expressed his concerns with parts of the bill regarding the live stream of certain PRB meetings and the lack of funding for other requirements.

Harmon described this year’s reform bill as a “similar to, but improved upon” version of Cassidy’s bill that “expands the rights of victims to be heard and to be notified.”

The bill would change qualifications for board members, requiring seven out of the 15 board members to have at least five years of experience as a law enforcement officer, parole officer, prosecutor, criminal defense attorney or judge.

It would also change the term limits of any new board members elected from six to eight years, something Harmon said would allow board members to be less concerned about their reappointment and more focused on making “good decisions.”

Sen. Steve McClure, R-Springfield, voiced his disagreement on the Senate floor Thursday. He asked Harmon how he thought it was a “great idea” to lengthen terms for members, who he said are vetted by the governor.

“The Senate can't pass a law by itself. The bill before us, I believe, will be well-received and passed by the House and signed by the governor,” Harmon said in response. “It is the best bill we are able to pass into law at the present time.”

Republicans have spent years criticizing Pritzker’s appointments to the board following several controversial nominations in recent years.

The bill now awaits action in the House.

Greg Gianforte gives his inauguration address at the Montana State Capitol on Jan. 6, 2025. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan). Most Montanans have a positive view of Gov. Greg Gianforte in the early months of his second term in office, according to new poll data released Thursday.
Morning Consult surveys conducted from January through March of this year show Gianforte has a 56% approval rating among Montanans, with 34% of respondents disapproving of his job performance.
The Montana Republican Party congratulated Gianforte’s numbers, saying it indicated “strong standing with Republicans, reflecting the trust Montanans have placed in his leadership following his re-election.”

“Montanans’ strong approval of Governor Greg Gianforte reflects their continued support for his commitment to conservative Republican principles like cutting taxes, supporting small businesses, and protecting our Montana way of life,” Montana GOP Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt said in a statement. “The Montana GOP stands in strong support of Governor Gianforte and his pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-family agenda.”
The governor’s proposals have met some resistance in the legislature from more conservative members of his party, while Republican legislators more closely aligned with his agenda were recently censured by the state GOP.
Since being elected in 2020, Gianforte’s approval rating reached a high of 61% during 2021, and hit lows of 49%, most recently during the third quarter of 2024 leading up to his re-election.
Gianforte won his second term in November 2024 over Democrat Ryan Buysse by 22 points.
Morning Consult, a political research firm, tracks approval ratings for all 50 state governors throughout their tenure and releases quarterly results.
Gianforte has the 16th highest approval rating among all governors, and seventh highest among Republicans.
Phil Scott, the Republican governor of Vermont, has the highest approval rating from state residents, at 75%, while Kim Reynolds, a Republican from Iowa, has the highest disapproval rating from residents, at 49%.

(Screenshot via Florida Channel)Former state Senate Democratic leader-turned-Broward Circuit Court Judge Gary Farmer is unfit to serve in that capacity, according an advisory panel to the Florida Supreme Court.
  Gary Farmer via Florida Senate
Florida’s Judicial Qualifications Commission recommended Thursday that the high court suspend Farmer from his post pending the outcome of removal proceedings. The Supreme Court has ordered Farmer to respond to the recommendation by April 21.
Late last year, the commission began investigating inappropriate comments Farmer made earlier in the year. Further investigation found several more remarks they eventually included in their recommendation to suspend the judge. 
“Through his extensive misconduct, occurring over a lengthy period of time, Judge Farmer has damaged the public’s perception of the judiciary and the judicial branch in such a way that he has demonstrated a present unfitness to serve,” the 13-page recommendation of suspension states. 
Farmer has characterized at least some of his comments as “dad jokes” to reduce stress in the courtroom, while the JQC said his comments were demeaning and potentially humiliating. 
The panel, comprising judges, attorneys, and non-lawyers appointed by the governor, wrote that Farmer mocked a litigant in August who was expecting three children with different women. 
“Ok, you’ve been busy,” Farmer said, according to court documents. “You were just shooting all over the place! That’s good, do you know their names? First and last? Romantic are you? Don’t tell Susie about Jane don’t tell Jane about Mary God bless you man. One’s enough.” 
Later, Farmer told the defendant he was going to put him on pretrial release, “I’m going to order that you wear a condom at all times. For your own good. Ok?! Probation is going to check. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding.”
In another instance, Farmer played music from his phone for more than 80 seconds, the panel wrote, “which you referred to as the ‘song of the day.’ When nobody knew the name of the song you played, you said, ‘That means nobody gets the Golden Oreo today. I’ve got a bunch of regular Oreos you can have but the Golden Oreo has to be earned. Okay, back to business.’” 
Farmer told the investigative panel, “I don’t think we can say, as judges, that we never — there’s never a light moment or a joke in Court, so I don’t want to overstate it, but I am not doing bad jokes anymore.” 
“Respectfully, the Investigative Panel is amply justified in not trusting Judge Farmer’s judgement in this regard,” the JQC wrote.

The panel took issue with Farmer “prejudging the outcomes of future cases, not yet before him,” relating to laws permitting deadly force in self-defense. 
During his six years in the Senate, Farmer filed several pieces of gun-safety legislation.
Farmer wrote in an order that in Stand Your Ground cases with credibility issues, “the prosecutor will never be able to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant wasn’t reasonably in fear of imminent harm (i.e. proof of a negative). This doesn’t make sense to the Court, but it is the law of Florida and the Court is duty bound to apply it.”
The panel found that Farmer quoted a Marlon Wayans sketch, acknowledging as he did so that he should not have. 
“Laughing, and in a mocking voice you say, ‘Marlon Wayans — In Living Color. Two snaps and a sweater! He likes it when the Oilers play the Packers! He used to be a tight end! Now he’s a wide receiver. Oh, that’s bad. Court reporter in the sky, please! Strike that from the record!’”
The report continues:
“Finally, the Investigative Panel dismisses, out-of-hand, any suggestion that Judge Farmer’s conduct was not violative of the Code because some people laughed at his comments or did not complain about being offended. The simple fact of the matter is that Judge Farmer’s position as a judge provided him with a captive audience who would naturally and understandably be willing to laugh and reticent to complain.”
Other remarks:
“While presiding over the August 15, 2024, hearing you said, ‘Spring is here, I got so excited I wet my plants’ and ‘What did the shirt say to the pair of pants? Wassup britches!’ Apparently, these are some of what you referred to as your ‘exceptionally, exceptionally bad jokes.’”
“‘I called the incontinence hotline. They told me to hold.’ ‘Mr. [attorney present in court] is aghast.’”
“My [court] notes are like Shakira’s hips. They don’t lie.”
“During a pause in proceedings, you ask an attorney ‘Are you a fan of the Flintstone’s Mr. [attorney present]? It’s one of the most popular shows in the world. They don’t like it in Dubai though. I don’t know, but the people of Abu Dhabi do.’ After a moment of silence, the attorney replied ‘Don’t give up your day job.'”

At left is Commissioner Robert Jacquard. At right is Commissioner Layi Oduyingbo. (Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Nearly two years after its formation, Rhode Island’s three-member Cannabis Control Commission only needed 18 minutes Friday to approve an inaugural set of rules that will govern the state’s budding cannabis market.
Regulations will take effect May 1, putting the state another step closer to issuing licenses for two dozen new retail pot shops and making the Office of Cannabis Regulation become its own independent entity. 
The new rules establish new packaging and labeling requirements, outline how licenses will be awarded, and set the criteria to apply for one of the six social equity retail licenses.
Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern acknowledged the long road to finalize the new rules but said it was crucial to  balance industry growth with safety. All the work drafting the regulations was done in-house, rather than relying on an out-of-state contractor, she added.
“These are truly home-grown, just like our cultivators,” she said following the panel’s vote. “This is an industry that is growing here thoughtfully, intentionally, deliberately — and it needs to reflect that.”
With the regulations approved, the commission can officially take over control of Rhode Island’s cannabis industry as envisioned in the 2022 legalization law. Since recreational cannabis was legalized, the Department of Business Regulation has had oversight of the state’s fledgling recreational market.
The final approval was met with little fanfare from nearly a dozen cannabis industry representatives who attended the meeting, but many said they were excited to see the governing rules become reality.
“It’s awesome that this finally happened — we’ve been waiting years for this,” Peter Kasabian, co-founder of Sensible Cultivators for Intelligent Reform co-founder, told Rhode Island Current.
It’s certainly been a long road for Rhode Island to establish its recreational cannabis market, which was legalized by state lawmakers in 2022. Over a year passed before the three-member commission was impaneled, which then needed to hire staff to draft proposals and  conduct a review of rules adopted in other states.
In the meantime, only seven previously authorized medical marijuana dispensaries were able to sell cannabis recreationally. Under the 2022 legalization, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to recreational dispensaries, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives.
Regulations call for a hybrid selection process in which applicants seeking one of the 24 new retail licenses would first be screened based on qualifications before being placed in a lottery. 
All prospective retailers would pay an application fee of $7,500 and a yearly $30,000 licensing fee. Licenses must be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone. 
The commission has yet to determine the date when applications will open, Ahern told reporters. 
“Certainly this calendar year, and perhaps even faster,” she said.
Specificity to come on social equity criteria
Draft rules were posted in January, where the public had 30 days to provide their feedback. More than 380 people provided comments.
“They were very helpful, very thoughtful, and I think made these regulations better,” Ahern said.
She said public feedback helped to close loopholes impacting who would qualify as a social equity applicant, which is generally meant for those who were adversely affected by the war on drugs. 
Ahern told reporters after the meeting that social equity applicants will be required to provide documentation showing they meet the criteria outlined in the 2022 Rhode Island Cannabis Act. At least 51% ownership and control must be individuals directly impacted by past cannabis laws or economic disparities. Qualifying factors include convictions for nonviolent cannabis offenses or residency in disproportionately impacted areas — which can be determined by federal poverty level, unemployment rate, the number of students in a free school lunch program, and historic arrest rates by census tract. 
A preliminary analysis presented to the commission last October found of the state’s 39 municipalities, only three met the criteria for a social equity zone set in Rhode Island’s 2022 law: Central Falls, Providence and Woonsocket. Some census tracts in Pawtucket and Newport also met the criteria.
Ahern said the commission plans to further narrow social equity criteria in future meetings.

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Maine will not be changing its policy on transgender athletes and thus is “at an impasse” with the federal government, according to a letter from the Maine Attorney General’s Office to the U.S. Department of Education Friday.
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights set Friday as the deadline for the Maine Department of Education to comply with a resolution agreement proposed last month that requires the state to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning trans girls from playing girls’ sports. If the state does not comply, the administration has said it will refer the case to the Department of Justice and rescind federal funding. 
“We will not sign the Resolution Agreement, and we do not have revisions to counter propose. We agree that we are at an impasse,” wrote Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster in a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights. 
Further, Forster argued that Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination on which the Trump administration is basing its argument, does not legally preclude transgender inclusion in athletics. 
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said.
Citing several federal court rulings — including a 2024 ruling in New Hampshire, Tirrell v. Edelblut — she added that “various federal courts have held that Title IX and/or the Equal Protection Clause require schools to allow such participation.”
Since Gov. Janet Mills and Trump got into a heated exchange over the state’s trans athlete policy, legal experts have watched the case to see how the Trump administration would respond to the state-level pushback. 
“We just need an answer at this point as to, ‘Does the Trump administration have the authority to do what it’s doing when it comes to fast tracking the removal of federal funds?’” said Jackie Wernz, a former lawyer for the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights who now represents school districts nationwide in these types of cases, in a previous interview with Maine Morning Star. 
“This is just unprecedented, and we’re not following the process that we’re used to. So I think it’s going to be really helpful for courts to start weighing in on whether or not they have the authority to do this.”
While the U.S. Department of Education has not specified how much federal funding is at stake, it awarded $347 million to Maine entities in fiscal year 2024, according to the Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Several federal agencies have launched investigations into Maine’s alleged violation of Title IX. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture froze funding to Maine school programs over alleged violations of federal law, over which the Maine Attorney General’s Office has filed suit.
In addition to the Title IX investigations, numerous other federal agencies have cut funding to programs in Maine in apparent retaliation for the state’s noncompliance. 
Earlier this week, the Department of Justice terminated several grants to the Maine Department of Corrections because of the state policy related to transgender detainees, which it approaches on a case-by-case basis. 
And the former acting director of the Social Security Administration admitted he deliberately sought to punish Maine by temporarily suspending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.

(Miami-Dade Police Dept. video)More than a dozen local governments in Florida have banned fluoride in their public water drinking systems since state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo’s recommendation in November that they do so.
Miami-Dade County won’t be one of them, though, after Mayor Daniella Levine Cava announced Friday that she would veto a resolution approved by the Board of County Commissioners on April 1 directing that fluoridation of the county’s water end within the next 30 days.

“As not only your Mayor, but also as a mother and grandmother, I care deeply about protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of our community,” Levine Cava said in a statement.
“I have listened to the dentists and medical experts and the message is clear: Water fluoridation is a safe, effective, and efficient way to maintain dental health in our county – and halting it could have long-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.”
At least 14 Florida cities have voted to remove fluoride from the water since Ladapo’s announcement, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Similar efforts are happening at the federal level.
This week, U.S. Health & Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he intends to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide.
During the same event in Utah (which recently became the first state to ban fluoride), Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin announced that his agency would review new scientific information on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.


Meanwhile, in Tallahassee, the Florida Senate will soon vote on an omnibus Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services bill (SB 700) that would prohibit public water systems from “the use of any additive included primarily for health-related purposes. Its companion in the House (HB 651) has one more stop in that chamber.
” The Florida Dental Association opposes the legislation.
In addition to Miami-Dade, other local governments in Florida that have opted to keep fluoride in their water systems include Clearwater and Hillsborough County.

The second Trump administration is now attempting to go after state actions too.
On a day the world’s attention was diverted by a massive meltdown of financial markets reeling from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, the president signed an executive order titled Protecting American Energy from State Overreach.
The order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek out and potentially prosecute state and local actions or pending actions that “address ‘climate change’ or involving ‘environmental, social, and governance’ initiatives, ‘environmental justice,’ carbon or ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.” It calls such actions “burdensome and ideologically motivated.”
Whether the goal is truly legal or an exercise in intimidation to get anticipatory compliance from states remains to be seen. But Governor Ned Lamont is having none of it when it comes to his climate legislative priorities and policies. 
“We’re not going to change what we do,” he said Thursday, during a press briefing about Trump administration cutbacks the state is facing. “If I can mitigate some of the risk by changing some of the wording or titles — why not? I want to protect my kids. I want to protect the money we’re investing to keep you safe from flooding. But we’re not going to change who we are.”
While not mentioning Connecticut specifically, Trump’s executive order does call out states with policies similar to those Connecticut has or is considering. One is the climate change superfund legislation up for consideration this legislative session, which would penalize fossil fuel companies found to be contributing significantly to climate change and use the money collected to fund “climate mitigation, resiliency and adaptation projects.” The order specifies such funds already in place in Vermont and New York, calling them “extortion.”
The order also takes on carbon fees — specifically California’s cap-and-trade program, which is similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, that Connecticut  participates in along with the rest of New England and many mid-Atlantic states since its inception in 2009.
But the question of whether the executive order carries any legal heft gets an unambiguous response from environmental legal experts contacted by the Connecticut Mirror.
“No, no, no,” said Patrick Parenteau, professor emeritus at the Environmental Law Center at Vermont Law School. “It’s an email to Pam Bondi, saying, ‘Pam, see if you can find a way to challenge these states that are enacting all these laws and bringing all these lawsuits that I don’t like,” he said. “Let’s not give it any more gravitas than that. It’s an email.”
Brad Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation and a former Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, regional administrator and trial attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice, called it “more political theater than it is law.”
“The executive order provides no legal rationale for why any of the categories of laws it’s attacking are unlawful or unconstitutional” he said. “I pity the DOJ attorney who has to come up with a legal basis for these types of challenges.”

“The EO is so outrageous that we cannot speculate as to legal theories that they may assert in challenging our state’s climate policies,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong in an email. He also said it had no legal effect. “We do not think there is any basis in law to attack individual state’s ability to make the necessary policy choices to protect their citizens and the environment.”
Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School said: “The President has no authority to cancel a state program or tell a state to change its laws or cancel its regulations or anything like that. He can’t. He simply can’t do that.”
Gerrard and others said Congress can pass laws to change policy, but under current conditions is unlikely to get 60 votes in the Senate. The EPA can also issue regulations following all the required and lengthy rules to do so.
But if EPA or the White House were to tell Connecticut to stop doing what they’re doing, Gerrard said, “hopefully their response would be to say ‘no.’ And if EPA really insisted, hopefully the answer would be, ‘see you in court.’”
Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative, also at the Sabin Center, said while the order is toothless, “what I worry a lot about are purple-er states and also local governments,” she said. “If a local policy is challenged in any one of the ways that might come about as a result of this exercise, it seems relatively likely that they would drop that policy. They don’t have the resources to engage in litigation.
“I’m quite worried about the chilling effect that this will have at the local level.”
Campbell thought it would likely “give some legislators pause in strengthening current law, particularly if it falls into, or arguably falls into, one of Trump’s targeted categories,” he said. “I think other state officials will worry that if they take bolder action in any of the areas this executive order targets, it’ll lead to funding cuts or other denials of federal resources or protections.”
Connecticut doesn’t appear cowed at this point. 
In addition to Lamont, Charles Rothenberger, director of Connecticut government relations for Save the Sound, said he isn’t worried. 
“We’re not going to repeal anything that we currently have on the books,” he said. “I don’t necessarily see anybody getting cold feet because of the noise coming out of Washington.”
Rep. Steve Winter, D-New Haven, and co-sponsor of the climate change superfund legislation, said he thought the executive order was designed as intimidation. 
“I would hope that colleagues in the legislature would stay true to the values that make us who we are,” Winter said. “I think the overreach here really is at the federal level, whether it’s trying to dictate to the states what education policy looks like, [or] what climate change and resilience policy looks like.”
House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, who is an attorney, pointed to the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which says that whatever powers aren’t explicitly given to the federal government or withheld from the states are reserved to the states. Adherence to states rights has been the bedrock of the Republican party for decades, but critics contend the administration is abandoning that position. 
“I think that the 10th Amendment could be under attack, based on what we’re seeing,” Candelora said.
“To the extent that the federal government wants to look at whether a state’s law is constitutional or not, I don’t necessarily have an issue with that,” he said, noting that, for instance, he has long felt Connecticut’s marijuana laws should have been pre-empted by federal law.
“When I look at this order, and I look at it through the lens of Connecticut, I don’t think Connecticut has done anything on an environmental level that is preempted by federal [law] and I would just be concerned if this was used in a more broad sense to go after states,” Candelora said.
Connecticut doesn’t have as many ambitious climate initiatives on the books as some of its neighbors like Massachusetts and New York, so there’s less for the Trump administration to go after.
The state has targets, including a zero carbon electric grid by 2040, and a benchmark for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to reach 80% below 2001 levels by 2050. One of Connecticut’s two big climate bills this session seeks to strengthen that metric along with the bill’s renewable energy and energy efficiency provisions. The other focuses on resiliency. Both are largely comprised of provisions from legislation that failed over the last two sessions.
The state’s commitment to offshore wind has also waned, with one wind farm under construction and nothing more planned. That’s in contrast to neighboring states with more ambitious offshore wind goals and projects still awaiting permits.
The state did not place an official ban on gas hookups and is no longer using the strictest motor vehicle emissions permitted under the Clean Air Act.
But a cap-and-invest program for the electric sector known as RGGI (pronounced reggie), which Connecticut has long championed, could provide a target. That program allows power plants over a certain size to essentially pay for the right to pollute. The allowances to do that are then sold through an auction, with proceeds going to the states for use in clean energy and energy efficiency projects.
Since RGGI started through 2022 (the last data available), Connecticut invested $288 million. About 70% has gone to energy efficiency through the Energy Efficiency Board, with 23% allocated to the Connecticut Green Bank. The rest is used for administration of the program.

“You can always file a lawsuit,” said Parenteau at Vermont Law School. “The real question is, what is Pam Bondi going to tell the president she has the capacity to do and what are the priorities to deploy her resources, which are shrinking by the day because she’s firing people, people are leaving DOJ, etc. So I think RGGI would rank way down somewhere at the very bottom of the list of targets.” 
He said she’d be much more likely to go after California’s cap-and-trade.
“I’m not sure that RGGI preempts any federal laws or would be unconstitutional,” Candelora said. “I would think ultimately the state of Connecticut would prevail. And I just have a global concern that we are in general — and I use this across the board with both political parties — that we over-utilize the courts now.”
For Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes, who has been Connecticut’s point-person on RGGI going back to her first position as deputy commissioner for energy at DEEP, the track record is clear — money saved and a 53% reduction in emissions.
“It’s on a solid foundation” she said.
