“We haven’t had any showers since Thursday or even been able to wash our hands,” said Josh McKnight, an inmate, in a phone call late Sunday afternoon with the Daily Montanan.
The state’s Department of Corrections responded to a “water pipe break” at the Deer Lodge facility on Friday, an Oct. 10 press release from the agency said.
“The break occurred in the pipe carrying water from the well house to the main water tank, which supplies water to the secure compound,” the state press release said. “Sletten Construction is assisting the department in repair efforts by providing additional excavation equipment. This water outage affected the secure compound at MSP; the dairy and Work and Reentry Center were not impacted.”
On Sunday, Montana State Prison’s population was 1,610, according to a Department of Corrections database. Its capacity is 1,551.
A Saturday update by the agency said the source of the leak had not been found and that they were continuing to “work and monitor” the broken pipe.
The same release said several agencies had come in assistance, including the Montana National Guard, which delivered 15,000 gallons of water from Deer Lodge. The state also reported 30,000 water bottles were delivered on Friday.
Probation and parole officers from Missoula and Helena are also assisting with security at the facility, the news release said.
A spokesperson for the state Department of Corrections said Sunday afternoon the DOC was working on responses to questions sent Sunday from the Daily Montanan including ones about staffing levels at the prison, the status of bathrooms at the facility, and other issues. 
“The Department is working as quickly as possible to find the break and restore all services to Montana State Prison,” DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in a Saturday news release. “We’re thankful for the long hours staff have already put in and to our partners who have stepped up to help out.”
Additionally, the state said 50 portable toilets were delivered to MSP on Friday and that they were “in the process” of ordering showers. The state release also said meals, inmate services and recreation had not been impacted.
However, McKnight told the Daily Montanan inmates have not been able to shower since Thursday, and they have been given just six bottles of water a day for all of their needs, including to drink and to clean themselves.
McKnight also said some people who are incarcerated and have medical issues need more fluids than they have access to.
He said people who use wheelchairs have difficulties using the portable toilets, and one inmate has been declining food as a result.
McKnight said the man had open sores that were healing but ripped open after trying to use a portable toilet that didn’t accommodate a chair he needs to use over the toilet seat.
He said the prison already is a breeding ground for conditions such as hepatitis, and overflowing toilets inside have exacerbated the problem.
“It’s super unsanitary,” McKnight said. “For staff and inmates alike, it is a dangerous situation.”
Amanda McKnight, who runs a Facebook page called Incarcerated families in Montana Prisons, said her visit was canceled on Saturday, but she learned about it first from her husband, not the Department of Corrections.
Josh McKnight said an agency official told the inmates that families didn’t need to see the “filth” at the facility, and visitation had been canceled out of “respect for families.”
He said corrections officers are doing their best to try to make sure people stay level-headed, but the situation is difficult for them too.
“I don’t think they want to be here either,” McKnight said. He said one officer told him, “They’re not going to want the public to see this.”
Amanda McKnight said her husband told her the handwashing stations have run out of water, and the portable toilets have been vandalized or are overflowing because there are not enough toilets to meet the use.
She also said people who are incarcerated have not been able to go to the gym, and sewage at one point had backed up in the basement of the kitchen.
The Daily Montanan could not verify the status of the basement of the kitchen late Sunday.
In a follow-up call later Sunday, Amanda McKnight said her husband told her the prison had offered five-minute showers, but she said her husband reported water was trickling down the wall, and there was not enough pressure for a shower. 
Her husband told her inmates were told bacteria was not found in the water and it was available for limited use but not consumption, Amanda McKnight said.
Josh McKnight said people in the prison are on edge because they have not been able to take showers and get clean, the prison stinks, and drinking water has been limited.
“It’s a bad situation for a lot of people here right now,” McKnight said.
Kenzie Lincoln, whose husband, Bryce Baltezar, is currently at the facility, said inmates are not currently allowed to do laundry nor are they allowed any outside time. Lincoln has spoken with her husband via phone for a few minutes at a time over the last few days, she said. She’s also a member of support groups for those with family members incarcerated at the facility.
Lincoln, as well as other family members of those incarcerated, have painted a desperate picture for inmates over the past several days. Lincoln told the Daily Montanan that prisoners had been warned Wednesday evening that water may become an issue and to fill up containers. Inmates were later told not to drink that water, she said.
Thursday brought sanitation issues, she said. Inmates were warned that flushing the toilets could make the water run out faster, Lincoln said.
“The toilets were getting clogged, they weren’t flushing, and they were actually forcing inmates, basically to pee and poop in water bottles and plastic bags,” Lincoln said. 
Phone service has been cut to 10 minutes, she added, and said an in-person visit with her husband was abruptly canceled as she was on the way to the prison on Friday. Inmates are also allowed one bottle of water per meal, Lincoln said.
Bathrooms were cleaned and locked on Sunday morning, she added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Montana-National-Guard-at-MSP--1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-12 19:57:10.826640

“We need to tell ICE our message that their surveillance will not slow us down. It will not stop us. It will only bring us out stronger,” one organizer said.

WILLISTON — More than 100 people gathered outside a national U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intelligence hub in Williston Sunday afternoon to protest ICE’s plans to build out its surveillance capabilities at a nearby office in the same town.
The protest was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national, anti-capitalist political movement with a chapter in Vermont. Speakers decried ICE’s plans, laid out in federal contracting records, made public earlier this month, to hire at least a dozen contracted workers at the agency’s National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center. It uses intelligence-gathering networks to generate leads for immigration enforcement agents operating across the eastern U.S. 
Demonstrators gathered in the middle of Harvest Lane, the road that runs in front of ICE’s Law Enforcement Support Center — a facility that houses a national ICE tip line — with local police routing traffic around them.

Across the street from that center is another building run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which, on Saturday morning, was vandalized with threatening graffiti that appeared aimed at federal workers. The vandalized building was cordoned off by police tape on Sunday afternoon while the protest was taking place. 
Cora Honigford, one of the protest’s organizers, said the group was not responsible for the graffiti and had no information about who had done it. Local and federal law enforcement were beginning to investigate the vandalism on Sunday.
The National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which is where the plans that sparked Sunday’s protest would be based, is located about 1.5 miles away from where the demonstration took place and the site of the vandalized building. 
Contractors at the targeting center would use social media platforms and online databases to help federal agents locate people who could be facing deportation, as well as friends and coworkers of those people, according to federal records. The plans are preliminary but say work could start as early as May 2026.

“We need to tell ICE our message that their surveillance will not slow us down. It will not stop us. It will only bring us out stronger,” said Honigford, who’s from South Royalton, in remarks to the crowd, drawing loud cheers.
Protestors held signs bearing slogans such as “No ICE Surveillance” and “ICE Fuera,” using the Spanish word for “out.” They chanted, among other refrains, “No justice, no peace! No ICE or police!”
Several speakers described ICE’s plans for social media surveillance in Williston as an escalation in the agency’s operations on top of the sharp increase in immigration enforcement that has defined President Donald Trump’s second term. The proposed surveillance is likely to target people already impacted by that enforcement the most, said Kate Paarlberg-Kvam, of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, a legal advocacy network for immigrants.
“Make no mistake, that the primary targets for this enforcement would be our Black and brown neighbors, who are advocates for their own dignity,” Paarlberg-Kvam told her fellow demonstrators. 
Michelle and Scott Stinson traveled up to Williston for the demonstration from Ludlow. Michelle held an upside-down American flag, which she said was a protest against ICE’s actions and future plans in the state.
“This is wrong,” she said of the proposed surveillance. “They should not be using us as a hub — for anything.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)CEDAR FALLS – Over the span of two decades, the Cedar Valley community has embraced urban conservation efforts on their properties and in their public spaces in an effort to improve water quality in Dry Run Creek.
Rain gardens, rain barrels and permeable pavement are some of the more than 300 water conservation practices that residents of Cedar Falls, and nearby Waterloo, have adopted over 20 years of the Dry Run Creek Watershed Improvement Project.
The watershed project is part of a water quality improvement plan with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, and in collaboration with the Black Hawk County Soil and Water Conservation District. But, over the past two decades, the project has forged partnership with the cities, residents and local organizations in the name of improving Dry Run Creek’s water quality.
Josh Balk, the source water protection coordinator with the project for the past 11 years, said the watershed project has shown the power of community, as everyone steps up to play a role in protecting the watershed. 
“We all have common goals: everyone wants to live happy, healthy lives, be outdoors, enjoy themselves,” Balk said. “Getting involved with conservation, whether smaller or large scale, there’s indeed opportunities there.” 
According to the Black Hawk Soil and Water Conservation District, the water quality improvements in the region resulted in 120 million gallons of stormwater runoff filtered naturally into the ground each year and 3,700 tons of soil, annually, prevented from eroding into the creek.

At Clay Street Park in Cedar Falls, where a rain barrel workshop and celebration of 20 years of the project took place last week, participants could see examples of the watershed work in action. Between the basketball court and the playground at the park, a bioretention cell buzzed with insects and fall-blooming native plants. The bioretention cell, which is another name for a rain garden, not only provides habitat, but also helps absorb rain water that would otherwise run into city stormwater intakes and into the creek. 
A permeable alley also sat to the east of the park and ran up and down the block. The permeable pavers in the center of the alley filter and allow water and snow to seep into the ground below the concrete, rather than send that water to storm water infrastructure. 
Maria Perez, a storm water specialist with the City of Cedar Falls, said these projects were pushed by Balk and the watershed project, but represent the collaborative effort between the city and the project. 
“It’s always a collaboration,” Perez said. “There’s a lot of projects in the city because of this project.”

Balk said there are about 50 bioretention cells in the city, most of them in high traffic areas where residents are able to see and interact with the native plant landscapes. 
These projects make use of funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Program, which are distributed to improve the water quality in Dry Run Creek. It also uses grants from state and local partners. Over 20 years, that funding equated to $3.1 million dollars in cost share funds spent on landowners who implemented the practices.
In the past couple of years, Balk said, the adoption of rain gardens in town has “skyrocketed” and when the project hosts a rain barrel workshop, as it did at the 20th anniversary event, he said they almost always sell out. 
“Thankfully, the Cedar Valley has been very interested, passionate about conservation, and we’ve been able to build upon that, provide the technical resources and the incentives so folks can make this conservation happen,” Balk said. 
Dan Pickar, of Cedar Falls, with about half a dozen participants, assembles a rain barrel at the event. Pickar said he has wanted to add a rain barrel to his backyard so he can water the plants without having to run the hose from the side of the house where his spigot is.

Community  impacts
While the City of Waterloo is not technically in the Dry Run Creek watershed area, Waterloo residents and city staff have been involved in the project as well. 
Kristine Beenken, of Waterloo, said she attended a practical backyards tour hosted by the watershed improvement project last year, which she said opened her eyes to the number of water management projects that had been installed, just in peoples’ backyards, throughout the Cedar Valley. 
Beenken said she already has a rain barrel on her property but spoke with Balk about adding a rain garden soon as well. The native plants in a rain garden, she said, not only help to protect the water in her area, but also make lawn maintenance a lot easier. 
Landowners, or homeowners, like Beenken who want to implement these practices get a consultation with Balk, who figures out what projects would work best, and helps to coordinate technical and financial resources. Usually, the project is able to find funding for up to 75% of the cost of the project, according to its website. 
Adam Himschoot, also of Waterloo, said he is interested in the water management project because flooding has become common in the region. 
“If everybody does a little bit … it might help out,” Himschoot said. 
After stepping out of a fish costume at the event, Cameron Agan, a storm water specialist with the City of Waterloo, said the city has millions of dollars worth of projects on their lists to improve storm water management. 
“So any little bit that homeowners can do, or business owners, helps with that,” Agan said.

Agan said storm sewer lines and plans are designed with five-year storms in mind, but he said the frequency and amount of rain in those storms has changed “quite a bit” since a lot of city infrastructure was built. 
Agan’s colleague, Ryan Shatek, also a storm water specialist with the city, said things like rain barrels, bioretention cells and permeable areas of pavement all help to reduce the amount of water headed for a storm sewer. 
“It’s not a lot, but it does help with a big flush of rain,” Shatek said. “Everything helps.”
Environmental impacts 
Balk said the Dry Run Creek Watershed Improvement Project was initiated because of two water impairments in Dry Run Creek, one for bacteria and another for stream biology. These impairments were largely attributed to stormwater runoff in the creek.
Balk said the project “hasn’t quite” reached its goals for water quality improvement, but is showing “improving trends.” He said biological diversity in the creek has had a “significant increase” since the project started.
Dry Run Creek has been subject to multiple fish kills, attributed to releases of manure from a dairy. These instances occurred near Decorah, about 80 miles northeast of Cedar Falls, and outside of the Dry Run Creek watershed area.
Balk said the Dry Run Creek watershed experiences an almost 2% increase in urbanization each year, which is part of why the urban water management strategies are a focus of the project. 
“We’re losing agricultural land and getting more hard surfaces,” Balk said. “Our land’s changing, and so (we’re) trying to find ways to get conservation in to protect the land we have.”

Tom Schilke has been a part of the Prairie Rapids Audubon Society since 1999 and said he has noticed a change in the wildlife now that there are more native plants in people’s yards and on city property. 
Schilke said he is starting to find more birds in town than in some of the natural spaces he frequents for bird watching. 
The native plants in people’s yards or on city grounds — like the bioretention cell in the middle of the park — mean there’s more habitat, food and better water quality in the area, which draws in more birds. 
“People think we’re just about birds … but it’s about ecology and how it all fits together,” Schilke said. 
Schilke said the society tries to get people to understand their surroundings more and why a bird might, or might not, be hanging around. Building a rain garden in a yard, or planting some native plants, he said, is a “good start.” 
“One little piece at a time builds momentum,” Schilke said. 
Beyond Cedar Falls and the direct watershed, Mary Beth Stevenson, chair of the Middle Cedar Watershed Management Authority, said the water quality improvements made by the Dry Run Creek Project are “incredibly important” to the health of the larger watershed. The Middle Cedar Watershed includes parts of Benton, Black Hawk, Buchanan, Butler, Franklin, Grundy, Hardin, Linn, Marshall and Tama counties. 
“The Dry Run Creek effort is an important model for community-based watershed improvements,” Stevenson said in a statement. “We are grateful to Josh Balk and the Black Hawk SWCD for all their work on improving water quality and educating citizens about what we can all do to improve water quality.”
Balk said the Dry Run Creek watershed effort has been unique in the fact that a large portion of the watershed is urban, where other watershed projects in the state might be focused more on rural, or agricultural land. 
“Everyone lives in the watershed, everyone has a role to play,” Balk said. “No matter what size land you own, what the land use is, there’s a way to get involved with conservation.”

Kylie Jorgensen)Late in August, Gov. Larry Rhoden called out the South Dakota National Guard to serve  for 30 days as crime-stoppers in Washington, D.C. It’s hard not to wonder why he did that.
By calling up the 129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment, maybe Rhoden is showing his belief that the pen is mightier than the sword.
Maybe he reasoned that the 12-member unit from Rapid City could make the mean streets of D.C. safer — one news release at a time.
With a Republican primary for governor coming up next June, perhaps Rhoden saw the Guard deployment as a way to curry favor with President Donald Trump and get his endorsement.
If any of those is the reason, it’s not good enough.
12 South Dakota National Guard members joining D.C. force at Trump’s request

Rhoden called out the Guard unit at the request of the president. Since there really was no “crime emergency” in Washington, D.C., Rhoden would have been better off giving the president a polite but firm “no.”
The images of armed soldiers on the streets of the nation’s capital are reminiscent of the images from third world dictatorships. The presence of the Guard in D.C. may have curbed some crime, but the president’s reasons for that deployment, and others he has threatened, are less than compelling.
According to Trump, troops are needed to patrol the streets of crime-ridden cities ruled by Democratic mayors. Cities with similar or worse crime statistics that are governed by Republican mayors are exempt from an invasion of troops. Politics shouldn’t play a part in public safety, but it’s the first rule of the president’s plan to make big city streets safer.
Rhoden’s decision to so easily buy into the president’s vanity project is troubling. Perhaps he learned from his predecessor that the best way to curry favor with the president and polish up some conservative credentials is to call out the troops.
Gov. Kristi Noem had a bad habit of sending the Guard to the southern border and a willingness to let South Dakota taxpayers foot the bill. In announcing the D.C. deployment, Rhoden was sure to mention that the cost would be covered by the federal government. So taxpayers are still on the hook for the cost, but out of a different account.
A sampling of the D.C. work of the 129th shows they dutifully recorded the patrolling of the Guard as part of the effort to stop crime. They also recorded troops cleaning up parks and tidying national memorials — a good sign of the Guard’s work ethic and a bad sign that perhaps there’s not enough crime-stopping to go around for all the troops on the ground.

One of the South Dakota unit’s videos features U.S. Army Col. Larry Doane, commander of Joint Task Force D.C. After thanking the Guard troops for coming to D.C., he gives a short lecture on self-care, admonishing them to take time for themselves by hitting the gym, going for a run or watching a movie. Doane must not have read his marching order as those are just the kind of activities that Trump says the good citizens of Washington, D.C., can’t do safely because the city is so crime-ridden.
While the troops take time for themselves, it’s easy to wonder how their families are doing with self-care. Going for a run or watching a movie probably sounds pretty good to them. Trump’s vanity project leaves the husbands and wives of Guard members with a month of single parenthood. Employers may need a little relaxation as well, since they’re short-handed for a month.
At the end of their deployment, the 129th will have worked hard to chronicle the Guard’s activities in D.C.—a lasting record of how not to fight urban crime. It will also be a testament to one president’s ego and one governor’s hope that his eagerness to help during this “emergency” will not be forgotten.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9356868-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-12 14:57:43.906374

WILLISTON — A U.S. Department of Homeland Security building in Williston has been  vandalized with threatening graffiti about a week after news broke about the department’s plans to bolster surveillance on social media sites at a different facility in the same town. 
The building that was vandalized is on Harvest Lane, across the street from a national U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intelligence hub. At another site in Williston, off Industrial Avenue, public records released earlier this month show ICE plans to hire a dozen contracted workers to do surveillance work.
It was not immediately clear when the Harvest Lane building was vandalized. On Sunday morning, black graffiti was visible around at least three sides. The graffiti included phrases such as “kill yourselves,” “shoot yourselves” and “hang yourself,” as well as “not safe” and “die.”The word “scum” appeared to be written in large letters across the entrance.
A Boston Globe story earlier this month described the building as being used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The building was flanked by police tape early Sunday afternoon. Several federal law enforcement officers were parked outside the ICE facility across the street. A protest against the surveillance plans was planned for outside the ICE facility that afternoon.
The vandalism comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has ratcheted up homeland security operations nationwide, prompting protests and, in some cases, clashes between protestors and federal law enforcement.
Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for more information Sunday afternoon.
This story will be updated.

A bystander reported the truck sped past a stop sign and collided with a tree in a nearby field, according to police reports. 
At the scene were two intoxicated men in wet and muddy clothes, denying they’d been in the truck and refusing to give their names, records show. Though the driver gave in and was detained for driving under the influence, the passenger remained defiant.
“F— you,” he repeated again and again. Officers handcuffed the man, who threatened to sue, yelling that he’d been a cop for 20 years. 
Finally, he gave up his name: Joshua Grasseth. Police booked him into jail for obstruction and unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon, since they found a switchblade knife in his pocket. He was found guilty for lying to police.
Nearly four hours away in a right-leaning rural county at the state’s southern border, Grasseth is now running for sheriff as a Republican in Wahkiakum County: population 4,400, the third smallest in the state. He’s spent the last two decades bouncing around small police agencies in Washington, but is no longer a working police officer. Two of those agencies would not share his personnel files, but InvestigateWest found that Grasseth has been convicted of at least two crimes while off duty and has a history of alleged domestic violence and dishonesty. The Wahkiakum County prosecutor says that, if elected, Grasseth’s troubled past would land him on the so-called Brady list — a list of officers flagged for credibility issues — that could undermine his credibility in court.
Grasseth’s opponent, current Sheriff John Mason, drew 85% of votes in August’s primary election. But police accountability advocates say Grasseth’s candidacy underscores a larger issue in Washington: Sheriff candidates are not backgrounded, and the state’s only requirement is that they complete basic law enforcement training within 12 months of taking office — a lax standard compared to what’s required to become a police chief or a lower-ranking officer or deputy. Had a bill increasing eligibility requirements passed the Washington state Legislature last session, his conviction for lying to police in 2022, a gross misdemeanor, would have disqualified him from running. Grasseth has no felonies on his record.
Joshua Grasseth, Wahkiakum County Sheriff candidate, did not respond to InvestigateWest for comment. Police accountability advocates say his campaign is an example of why Washington needs stricter sheriff requirements. (Photo courtesy/Elect Josh Grasseth for Wahkiakum County Sheriff’s Facebook page)
“Washington is exceptional relative to other states in having next to no eligibility requirements for sheriffs, even lacking the most common state requirements like a minimum age rule, or the requirement that the sheriff have a clean criminal record — or at least, no felony convictions — and undergo a criminal background check,” said Josh Parker, deputy director of policy at the Policing Project, an organization out of New York University’s School of Law that works to modernize law enforcement policies across the country. “Many states, including California, Georgia, Kansas and Oregon, also require sheriffs to be certified by a state licensing agency and stripped of that license if they engage in egregious misconduct.”
Grasseth, 47, who has campaigned on being “accountable, transparent, and deeply engaged” with his community, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. On his Facebook campaign page, he addressed his false statement charge by stating, “I chose not to provide information about an incident in which I was a passenger in a vehicle. I accepted full responsibility in court, where I was honest about my actions and intentions. I received no jail time as a result of my cooperation and accountability.”
But Grasseth’s opponents believe if he became sheriff, it would diminish public trust for the agency.
“We took many years to foster a level of trust and transparency and partnership with the people in the community, and it takes a long time to build that trust,” said Mark Howie who was the county’s sheriff from 2012 to 2024. “You’re jeopardizing that trust with people the second that person comes in with that type of stigma attached.”
Upon Howie’s retirement, he recommended John Mason’s appointment to county commissioners. They appointed Mason by a unanimous vote.
Grasseth’s past
On Halloween night in 2009, Grasseth, then-working as a deputy for the Wahkiakum County Sheriff’s Office, called off work halfway through his shift, telling management he was sick and going home, but would remain on call. 
Instead, Grasseth met his then-wife at the Monticello Hotel bar in Longview. The couple reportedly got into an argument that turned physical. Grasseth hit his wife three times, according to a witness in the police report. He was then kicked out of the bar and went back to the hotel room alone. 
Hours later, Grasseth found his wife in the hotel parking lot in a vehicle with another man. He fought the man whom he had already suspected his ex-wife to be seeing, giving him a black eye and knocking out a tooth, court records show. She called the cops. Responding officers said Grasseth was “highly intoxicated” and arrested him for fourth-degree assault against his wife. The charge was reduced to disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, and he was found guilty, according to court records. 
The event was relayed to Grasseth’s boss, former Sheriff Dan Bardsley, who “strongly considered” terminating the deputy. Bardsley had already warned Grasseth to “avoid contact with” the man he fought, according to a disciplinary letter.
Later that month, Grasseth resigned. The next year, he ran for county sheriff, unsuccessfully. 
He became an officer at the Lower Elwha Klallam Police Department near Port Angeles in the Olympic Peninsula in 2013. Then in 2018, he moved an hour and a half away to be a commander at the Port Gamble S’Klallam Police Department, north of Bainbridge Island. Neither department would share any information about Grasseth beyond confirming Grasseth worked there at one point.
In 2016, his ex-wife called the cops in nearby Clallam County, who arrested Grasseth for fourth-degree domestic violence, records show. That charge was dropped. His ex-wife declined to comment for this article.
On Grasseth’s campaign page, he addressed the domestic violence allegations raised by his ex-wife.
“These were only allegations, I have NO CONVICTIONS for such allegations because that is all that they were. I filed for divorce in 2016 and have had zero allegations or accusations since then.”
In the midst of the divorce and while working as an officer for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, Grasseth allegedly got into a relationship with Savannah Roberts, 21 years old at the time. He was never charged with crimes involving Roberts. However, her sister, Samantha Hoines, said he abused her physically and emotionally and isolated her from her family for years.
Roberts, who once loved playing softball and being with her family and friends, had “become a shell of herself,” Hoines said. “He tore her down. It was so hard to hear my sister think that no one liked her and that she was scared to make friends.”
Roberts remained out of contact with her family for years, afraid to speak out on the abuse because Grasseth was a police officer and she feared retaliation or not being believed, Hoines said. 
During their relationship, Roberts’ battle with alcoholism spiraled. After the two broke up a few years ago and the recent death of her grandmother, it intensified. Roberts died in April this year due to kidney and liver failure, Hoines said. She was 30.

Grasseth didn’t respond to multiple emails and phone calls from InvestigateWest. But a number that traced back to his wife, Amanda Grasseth, who is the Wahkiakum County election coordinator, texted an InvestigateWest reporter asking why the news organization was not looking for “anything positive about him.” She declined an interview request. Grasseth went to Facebook to announce a story was about to be published “including my past and false allegations,” characterizing the reporting as a “coordinated smear campaign” against him.
Sheriff qualifications
In Washington, sheriff candidacy requirements haven’t been updated since 1979 and only require a training certification post-election. Meanwhile, a 2021 law strengthened the backgrounding of peace officers to include a check into whether they are on any Brady lists maintained by county prosecutors.
“An 18-year-old without any law enforcement experience can run for sheriff, and I think that would surprise some people,” said Leslie Cushman, advisory committee member for the Washington Coalition for Police Accountability, an advocacy group made up of families impacted by police violence, experts and other policy-focused organizations. 
Grasseth hasn’t worked in law enforcement since 2021, and his training certificates have expired, according to Washington’s Criminal Justice Training Commission. If Grasseth assumed office, he would have up to a year to complete required training.
House Bill 1399, the bill that failed to pass the Legislature last year, would have changed eligibility requirements for sheriff candidates to include having: a high school diploma, no felony or gross misdemeanor convictions, no revocation of law enforcement certification, two years of law enforcement experience, to be at least 25 years old, and for those once in the military to have received at least a general discharge under honorable conditions. Additionally, it would have required sheriff candidates to complete a background check, which is already required of police chiefs and town marshals, the two other highest-ranking local law enforcement officials in a given jurisdiction.
“It actually is just a bread and butter good governance bill,” Cushman said. “It really is about having strong leadership in place that is subject to the same requirements as the rank and file.”
Aside from stricter requirements, the bill would have limited the authority of sheriff volunteers, who can assist law enforcement agencies with security at community events, traffic control, and search and rescue operations. The bill also called for sheriff candidates to complete an extensive background check — the same one mandated for peace officers —  which would then be verified by the Criminal Justice Training Commission. Both provisions drew pushback from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs and rural constituents.

Howie, the former Wahkiakum County sheriff, opposed the bill. He said he supports more qualifications for sheriff candidates that could lead to disqualifying someone for integrity issues, but he “would not support any state-appointed political body” to conduct background checks on candidates.
“You could have somebody from the far right or the far left that is gunning for a particular candidate because they have different views,” he said. “I just wouldn’t trust that kind of system.”
Dan Bigelow, the Wahkiakum County prosecutor, agreed with Howie’s concern that the background check could be used for political purposes.
“The idea was for counties to be able to elect their own people for better or for worse,” he said. “That was how the state started out, and this seemed to be a retreat from that. Although, I gotta say, there’s some folks who I wouldn’t mind seeing knocked off.”
For police accountability advocates, the prospect of an elected sheriff with a dicey past is even more troublesome as more rural sheriffs, like those in Klickitat and Adams counties, align with the constitutional sheriffs movement — the idea that sheriffs, believed to have supreme authority in their jurisdiction, chose to enforce their own rules instead of federal or state laws. Some Washington sheriffs are flouting the state’s “sanctuary” law by helping enforce federal immigration orders. 
“Constitutional sheriffs are something that we’re worried about,” said Cushman, who testified in support of House Bill 1399 earlier this year. “[They] think they are the highest law in the land and that they interpret the law and that they are allowed to keep everybody else out of their jurisdiction, including the federal government.”
She and others advocating for stronger police accountability laws are drafting a similar bill for next session. In this new version, the bill requires sheriffs to “uphold and enforce” state law.
“There’s a lot to be said for the people, the residents of the state of Washington, to have confidence that wherever they are, their law-enforcement leader is subject to the highest standard,” Cushman said.
Cushman and her organization started drafting legislation for stricter sheriff requirements after former Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer was accused of falsely reporting that a newspaper carrier threatened to kill him — conduct that led the state’s attorney general to prosecute him. 
Troyer was ultimately acquitted of the false reporting charge, but records show his name was added to Pierce County’s Brady list in November 2021, roughly a year after he became sheriff. Pierce County Prosecutor Mary Robnett says his entry on the Brady list didn’t have “a huge effect” on the court.
A Brady list is a record kept by prosecutors of law enforcement officers with credibility issues such as dishonesty or misconduct that must be disclosed to defense attorneys in criminal cases. If a county sheriff was on the Brady list and testified in court, the defense could call out their misconduct in front of a jury, undermining their credibility as a witness. 
“We’re a big county, almost a million people, and he has hundreds of deputies and detectives and corrections officers work for him,” Robnett said. “He was never a witness in court.”
A Brady list designation
Bigelow, prosecuting attorney for Wahkiakum County, said if Grasseth were elected, he would go on the Brady list both due to his dishonesty as a deputy in 2009 and because of his more recent false statement to a law enforcement officer charge in 2022. Bigelow said he’s not already on the list because he’s not currently a law enforcement officer.
“He called out sick when he wasn’t sick,” said Bigelow, Wahkiakum County prosecutor. “That’s an act of dishonesty but not a crime. An act of dishonesty in his official capacity would go on the [Brady] list anyhow. What really locked it in was the conviction for a false statement to a public servant. … Those would all go on the list.”
In 2022, the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys adopted a model policy advising county prosecutors to “err on the side of disclosure” when deciding whether to place someone on the Brady list. The Wahkiakum County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said it follows this policy. 
As part of an ongoing series examining officers with credibility issues in Washington, InvestigateWest reviewed hundreds of Brady list records and found a wide variety of reasons why officers in Washington were placed on the Brady list, including having a DUI, unsatisfactory work performance, being inappropriate to co-workers, time theft, sexual assault and domestic violence, to name a few.
“If you have an officer with, for example, a history of lying, then that should be relevant in virtually every case that officer is involved with,” said Rachel Moran, a former public defender turned professor researching access to officer misconduct information at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. “But if you have an officer who has, let’s say, a conviction for a DUI, there might be very limited situations in which there’s any reason to disclose that in a particular case.
“Instances of dishonesty, false testimony, falsifying a police report, that kind of thing, are the most significant information in terms of impeaching the credibility of the officer.”
In a small county like Wahkiakum, sheriffs play a larger role due to the small size of their agency. The county only has seven deputies, including the sheriff and undersheriff. 
“It wouldn’t bode well for any sheriff’s office in our state, or anywhere, to have an elected official, the leader of that office, on the Brady list,” Howie said. “That would be very damaging.”
Based on the results of the primary election in August, Bigelow doesn’t think that will happen.
“I think that the county spoke pretty loudly in the primary about not wanting a convicted criminal to be their sheriff,” Bigelow said.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove defended his decision to pause some timber sales and said he will seek 2026 legislation to diversify revenue from state trust lands, arguing the state can “do more for climate and habitat while providing stability.”
In an interview on TVW’s “Inside Olympia,” Upthegrove told host Austin Jenkins that his halt on harvesting in older, “structurally complex forests” — those that have some but not all the characteristics of “old-growth”— began as a six-month hold for restoration and protection. It was intended to refresh inventory data and gather input from tribes, industry, school districts and counties. 
All but four of the 24 paused sales in such forests have been lifted. Three timber sales in the Elwha River watershed remain on hold as a condition of a budget provision requiring a study of whether conserving the surrounding forests could enhance ecosystem recovery from a dam removal before any logging can resume. A fourth sale in Kitsap County will remain paused at the county’s request as it seeks funding to purchase the sale area for conservation and recreation.
As most of the pause lifted in August, Upthegrove directed preservation of 77,000 acres while allowing logging on about 29,000 acres, a split he called a “sweet spot” to limit near-term fiscal impacts while testing new approaches. “These lands don’t belong to industry. They belong to we, the people,” he said, adding his duty is to manage in the public interest while meeting constitutional trust obligations.
The move drew both process and revenue criticisms from editorial boards and former lawmakers, while some conservationists said it didn’t go far enough. 
Upthegrove said he spent months in meetings — including with 20 of the state’s 29 tribal councils — and called the action an internal directive to staff, not a vote of the Forest Practices Board. 
He disputed claims of widespread economic harm, noting 70% of Washington’s wood supply comes from private lands and more than 90% of Department of Natural Resources timberlands are unaffected. He said ecological thinning, acquiring replacement timberlands and entering carbon-credit and other environmental markets could support rural economies.
Upthegrove said his department will propose an agency-request bill in the 2026 session to let the department take part in carbon and other “ecosystem service” markets, which turn natural assets into revenue. Those tools would not fully replace timber revenue, he said, but could become a “meaningful piece” of a diversified model.
He also urged lawmakers to restore wildfire-prevention funding that was cut last cycle. 
A 2021 framework envisioned $125 million per biennium for forest health, community resilience and response; the current budget provides about $60 million, he said. With longer seasons and more blazes on both sides of the Cascades, “without the funding restored, we’re going to see more fires and bigger fires,” Upthegrove said. 
He likened the Department of Natural Resources’ suppression role to an emergency room — “we put it out no matter what” — and cited state costs of about $500,000 a day to fight two large central Washington fires this fall.
Framing the trade-off, Upthegrove said prevention dollars can avert larger suppression bills and protect communities while his agency pilots new revenue streams: “We can do more for climate and habitat while providing stability” for schools, counties and the timber workforce.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Councilwoman at-large Helena Moreno is heading back to City Hall after a resounding win in Saturday’s mayoral primary election, securing 55% of the vote, above the simple majority she needed to clinch the job without a runoff election.
Her victory in the primary will give Moreno a strong mandate when she enters office in January.
On Saturday during her election night party at the Civic Theater, Moreno said the early victory will give her time to assemble a good team and prepare to lead a city at a crossroads.
“The work starts tomorrow morning,” Moreno told Verite News, noting that she would pay particular attention to preparing a city budget that can help her achieve her vision.

Moreno will succeed Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who, in her second term, has been in frequent combat with the City Council that Moreno, at times, helped lead as one of two citywide representatives on the seven-member body. The council has made multiple efforts to limit Cantrell’s power, often challenging her decision-making on everything from mayoral appointees to entering into a settlement with the School Board.
However, despite their frequent differences, when asked whether she would keep any part of Cantrell’s administration in place, Moreno said yes: Cantrell’s popular health director, Dr. Jennifer Avegno, who led the city through the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I’ll be keeping Dr. Avegno, who I think does an amazing job with the Health Department,” Moreno said.
She did not provide any hint as to whether any other familiar faces would be part of her administration, even when asked whether popular councilmember Joe Giarruso would be joining her team – though she did compliment him effusively.
Moreno held a comfortable lead in both polling and campaign contributions over the course of the election season. The councilmember at-large kicked off her mayoral campaign last year, with campaign signs appearing as early as last summer, more than a year out from the election. It was a bracingly early start – and an explicit claim to the leading position she would maintain throughout the election.
Fellow councilmember Oliver Thomas also threw his hat into the ring early on in the election, announcing his campaign this spring. Thomas, who was once considered a mayoral frontrunner almost two decades ago, before a federal bribery conviction derailed his political career, had recently returned to politics representing District E on the council beginning in 2022.
As a councilmember, Thomas has been a frequent advocate for the Cantrell administration, regularly voting against overriding mayoral vetoes, whether they concerned council approval of mayoral appointees, sanitation contracts in the French Quarter or even her ability to use the city-owned Upper Pontalba Apartment. As a candidate, Thomas has promised to leverage his decades of experience to address blight and improve city services.
As the year proceeded, other candidates also entered the fray. Some were more serious contenders, like former judge Arthur Hunter. Others were less so, like disgraced former Orleans Parish Communication District executive Tyrell Morris. But all failed to meaningfully gain momentum and eat into the early lead held by Moreno.
Going into qualifying in July, many voters expected a two-man race between Moreno and Thomas, rehashing the frequent disputes the two had on the council. But then State Sen. Royce Duplessis, who had earlier announced that he would not run for mayor, changed his mind and entered the race, hoping to offer a meaningful challenge to his fellow progressive Moreno.
Duplessis, also a former statehouse representative, made a name for himself in Baton Rouge through his work reforming criminal justice, health care, worker protections and early childhood education. At the launch of his campaign, he marketed himself as the candidate who could be a real challenger to Moreno, but he entered with little cash on hand. Still, Duplessis saw an opening and hoped he could force Moreno into a runoff.
Less than a month later, Hunter, who continued to trail in the polls, would drop out and endorse Duplessis, cementing the three-way contest that has defined the election over the last two months.
Since then, there has been a marathon of forums and televised debates and questionnaires. In some ways, the candidates’ platforms look similar: All have highlighted their desire to improve city services, increase affordable housing and support the creation of new jobs. In pitching voters, they’ve each played to their strengths. Moreno has pitched herself as someone deeply attuned to the systems of City Hall, capable of implementing her progressive policies without drama or delay. Thomas as someone with deep experience in politics going back to the ‘90s, who can speak plainly and compassionately to the experiences of longtime New Orleanians, especially those impacted by the justice system. And Duplessis as an outsider uninvolved in the current battles between the City Council and the Mayor, willing to leverage his statehouse relationships to achieve his goals for the city.
Moreno first became a public figure in New Orleans through her work as an on-air journalist with WDSU-TV. She later became a state house representative, where she was known for her work championing survivors of domestic and sexual violence in a series of bills. In 2018, she joined the New Orleans City Council as an at-large member, where she became known as one of the more progressive councilmembers as she passed a reams of ordinances, most notably, helping relocate the residents of Gordon Plaza, increasing wages for city workers and promoting renewable energy.
She will become New Orleans’ second woman mayor in its history, and its first Hispanic mayor.

BESSEMER — The reverend knew what was coming.
As Tuesday’s City Council meeting began, The Rev. Thomas Thrash delivered a prayer that set the stage for the dynamic that would play out in the council chambers.
“May truth rise above deception,” Thrash said. “May righteousness rise above greed.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Thrash requested divine guidance to help the council consider the harm a proposed hyperscale data center could bring to Bessemer and the surrounding, rural communities in central Alabama.
After the prayer, the council got down to business. Despite vocal opposition from residents, local and state environmental groups and the NAACP, the entire council—save one absent member—voted to amend the city’s zoning code to allow the location of data centers in areas designated for light industrial use.
The decision is the first major step, following repeated delays, toward the approval of Project Marvel, a $14.4 billion hyperscale data center development set to encompass 700 acres and include 18 buildings totaling 4.5 million square feet.
The project has faced consistent, staunch opposition from residents living both within Bessemer city limits and in the rural, unincorporated areas surrounding the proposed development site. Locals have expressed concerns about excessive energy usage, increased utility rates, potential watershed contamination, habitat destruction, noise pollution and years of disruptive construction traffic.
Bessemer’s relatively small City Council chambers were packed to capacity Tuesday evening, with residents spilling into the hallway and herded into an overflow room on a different floor. The only levity in the somber crowd was a spontaneous “Roll Tide” someone interjected after the Pledge of Allegiance.
Residents in the audience were more subdued than in the numerous meetings most had attended again and again as the City Council and Bessemer’s Planning and Zoning Commission considered and reconsidered proposals involving zoning and development plans related to Project Marvel.
Before the council’s vote, President Donna Thigpen emphasized that the ordinance under consideration—a measure to allow data centers in areas with industrial zoning—wasn’t specific to Project Marvel.
“It has been suggested that there’s other properties that might be more suitable or more favorable, but to do that, even in another place, this would have to be had,” Thigpen told those gathered.
Indeed, the proposed ordinance wouldn’t simply impact the possible siting of Project Marvel on land slated to be rezoned from agricultural to light industrial use. Under the proposal, future data center projects, too, could be located in areas zoned for the latter purpose.
Before Tuesday’s vote to change Bessemer’s zoning ordinance, light industrial uses included facilities like bus terminals, gas stations with garages and large billboards. Expressly forbidden from light industrial classification are facilities “which are especially detrimental to property or to the health and safety beyond the district by reason of the emission of odor, dust, gas, fumes, smoke, noise, vibration or waste material.”
Residents have argued that commissioners should vote down the allowance of data centers in light industrial zones because the facilities simply don’t fit the definition of light industrial development and aren’t comparable to facilities that are typically permitted under that classification.
“This is not light industrial,” Becky Morgan, a resident affected by the project, previously told city officials. The facility’s high power consumption, security needs and sheer footprint should require its zoning in heavy industrial or another, newly created zoning category, she argued.

Several other residents spoke during Tuesday’s meeting to express their concerns, asking the council to more deeply research the different types of data centers, their sizes and impacts. But to their consternation, members of the overflow crowd in the downstairs waiting room at City Hall weren’t allowed to voice their views during this meeting.
Sarah Stokes, an attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, expressed her dismay that residents among the overflow crowd weren’t allowed to speak and were given no explanation from officials as to why.
“That’s not the law for the public hearing. You have to be able to be heard,” she said.
William Spencer, who owns Spencer Wood Recycling in Bessemer, was also upset by what he viewed as an effort to limit dissent. Spencer said he witnessed a police officer stop a lady in a red shirt “with force” and told her she couldn’t go upstairs to the council meeting to speak.
Ultimately, the council voted unanimously to approve the change to the city’s zoning ordinance, making way for data centers of any size and scope to be located in land zoned for light industrial use.
Spencer called the council’s rapid approval a farce.
“I think that they’re railroading,” he said. “For them to make it light industrial and give a positive spin on light industrial for something that’s heavy industrial pulling all of this diesel power, I think that it’s a farce.”
Spencer wasn’t the only one to think the fix was in before the meeting even began.
In a press release issued the day before the council’s formal vote, the Bessemer City Council reaffirmed its full support for the data center as a “tremendous investment” with economic benefits for both the city and state of Alabama.
At least one city council member has also been vocal about his support for the project, painting those opposing it as outsiders aiming to halt a project at the expense of Bessemer’s city government.
In response to a postcard by the Alabama Rivers Alliance, an environmental nonprofit, sent to Bessemer residents urging them to tell their council members to vote against the data center, City Council member Chester Porter wrote on social media that concerned citizens living outside the city limits had no place to tell Bessemer citizens what to do.
“Telling Bessemer citizens what to do with our land is like showing up at their community meeting and telling them to plant apple trees in their front yards and build swimming pools by their mailboxes,” he said.
The land involved in the proposed project hasn’t always been located within Bessemer, but was annexed into city limits in recent years. The site is located on the extreme edge of the city, about six miles from the city center.
And not everyone views concerned citizens living outside the city limits as undue, outside interference.
“Quite frankly, if we want to talk about outsiders, there’s only one person in that room upstairs that I know of that doesn’t live in Jefferson County, and that’s the developer,” said Charles Miller, policy director for Alabama Rivers Alliance.
Shelby Standfield, an architectural designer who suffers from chronic asthma, moved from Birmingham to McCalla, an incorporated area of Jefferson County adjacent to the proposed data center site, to escape poor air quality. Even though she’s not within the city limits, she goes to Bessemer to shop for all her amenities.
“Air pollution knows no boundaries. It doesn’t know where the county line is,” she said. Even though she lives ten miles away from Bessemer’s city limits, Standfield’s home is located just up the road from the site where, if approved, dozens of diesel generators could soon be located as a backup power source for the data center. “I live closer than some people who actually live in Bessemer,” she said.
Edith Hunter, a breast cancer survivor and Bessemer resident, also pushed back on the notion that those outside the city limits won’t be affected by air pollution.
“Smoke is not just going to settle in Bessemer,” she said.
She said she believes the proposed development is a “done deal” and a “money grab.”
The Bessemer City Council is expected to formally consider the data center’s development plan, one of the final steps in the approval process, at a meeting on Nov. 18.

There are steps Vermont towns can take to be better prepared regardless of the outcome of future federal declaration requests.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Chris Campany: Preparing for greater self-reliance in the wake of disaster.","This commentary is by Chris Campany, of Townshend. Campany is the executive director of the Windham Regional Commission and chair of the Vermont Planning and Development Agencies (VAPDA) Emergency Planning and Resilience Committee.


On Aug. 25, Vermont requested a federal disaster declaration to reimburse municipalities in Caledonia and Essex counties for expenses resulting from flooding on July 10. As of this writing the response is still pending. Vermonters should pay attention to whether or not a federal disaster declaration is made and, if so, what’s included; the result could be an indicator of how changes in the federal approach to disaster declarations will affect the state and what costs municipalities and local taxpayers will be expected to bear when disaster strikes. There are steps towns can take to be better prepared regardless of the outcome of future declaration requests.
Vermont state and local governments are heavily reliant upon federal funding for emergency preparedness, and disaster response and recovery. Nationally, disaster declaration requests that would have been routinely approved have been slower in coming or denied. Furthermore, federal funding for mitigation action that has traditionally accompanied federal disaster declarations through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program is no longer a given. Vermont has relied upon this funding for property buyouts in floodplains and landslide areas, improvements to bridges and culverts, protection of floodplains and flood-proofing of buildings, among other things.
What can a municipality do to be in the best position to recover from disaster amid federal funding uncertainty?

Establish a dedicated disaster reserve fund.
Establish lines of credit before a disaster ever strikes.
Learn about public financing tools and options for mitigation projects, recovery and rebuilding.
Develop a capital improvement plan and related budget to identify and prioritize projects. At a minimum this could be a prioritized bulleted list with reasonable cost assumptions.
Use your town plan and your local hazard mitigation plan to inform your capital improvement planning.
Give serious consideration to what infrastructure must be rebuilt and what can be abandoned if damaged or destroyed, also known as “strategic abandonment.”

Hopefully federal aid will be forthcoming to the impacted communities in Caledonia and Essex counties. However, each of these actions will serve a municipality well regardless of how the federal policy and funding realm evolves over the coming weeks, months and years.

Truth telling
Ursa Goldenrose, 16, Hardwick
     We manifest our fear in our hands, as a physical thing. Sometimes it pricks at our skin and leaves marks; sometimes it results in stiff fingers, cracking from a stiffened clench. The keyboard invites an unbeknownst realization to form, almost as if the clacking of the keys – spelling out the words of some reality – is the only thing to make the phenomenon itself real. When focus is placed on the fingertips, they jump and skip, and while they rearrange the saddest words, they also often confide a confidence that allows them to be free.
  What we write pulls our fear out from underneath our hearts. Steady hands solidify each sound so that when the words are read aloud, they ring with truth and vitality. Sometimes these scribbles seem to be the only proof of our surviving those smaller mortalities.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-12 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Government shutdown rhetoric begs the question: Should the sick and injured be denied emergency care?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/12/government-shutdown-sick-injured-medical-care/,"Since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, federal law has required hospitals to provide emergency treatment to all who need it, regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens.","Based on the ongoing rhetoric surrounding the federal government shutdown, perhaps it is time to ask the question.
The question is, do we – the United States of America –  really want undocumented immigrants receiving medical treatment in our hospital emergency rooms?
If a non-citizen falls off a roof of a house while doing carpentry work, do we want to transport him to the hospital or just leave him in the yard to fend for himself – broken legs and all? If a non-citizen child is sick, should she be provided emergency care?
Under current law signed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, the answer is yes to providing emergency care.
Hospitals, if they receive federal funds, are obligated to provide “stabilizing care” in their emergency rooms to all who show up, including undocumented immigrants.
The issue is worth discussing now because Republicans, led by U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, are complaining that Democrats are shutting down the federal government demanding federal funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants.
U.S. Rep. Mike Ezell of Mississippi’s 4th District wrote on social media, “Senate Democrats failed America. They shut down the government because we refused to give free healthcare to people who broke our laws to get here.”
U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi reposted the Senate Republicans proclaiming, “Senate Democrats are putting illegal aliens ahead of our troops and American families in need.”
In reality, the issue that led Democrats to oppose the continuing resolution to fund the federal government and thus leading to the shutdown has little to do with illegal immigrants. Instead, Democrats are trying to extend federal subsidies that make insurance policies purchased through the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges dramatically cheaper than they would otherwise be.
If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the cost of insurance will go up on average $480 annually for the estimated 285,000 Mississippians on the exchange, according to KFF, a national nonprofit health care research organization. The premiums will go up much more for some Mississippians.
Some Republicans counter that they will discuss the subsidies once the government is funded. But the main talking point for many Republican lawmakers is that the Democrats want free health care for non-citizens. 
Under federal law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive coverage through federal health care plans, such as Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Republicans had a chance to take up that issue when they passed what they called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” earlier this year at the urging of President Donald Trump. They did not.
Granted some states – yes, California _ do use their own state funds to provide health care for undocumented immigrants. Congressional Republicans considered trying to penalize those states for using their own money to provide health insurance for undocumented people, but opted not to in the big bill that President Trump signed into law in July.
While undocumented immigrants do not get health care through any federal program, hospitals do receive compensation for treating in their emergency rooms people, including non-citizens, without insurance and with limited ability to pay.
Trump’s big bill reduced the amount of compensation hospital emergency rooms receive for treating undocumented immigrants. That reduction hurts the hospitals, not the undocumented immigrants who the hospitals still must treat if they show up in emergency rooms.
Hospitals are partially reimbursed for the uncompensated care they give to help ensure their financial sustainability and help hold down the cost of health care for Americans. Without the federal assistance, hospitals could be forced to close or reduce services or increase costs for those with the ability to pay through private insurance or through other means.
So, if congressional Republicans and President Trump are complaining about Democrats trying to provide health care for undocumented immigrants, perhaps the options should be discussed.
One option was the big bill’s reduction of money going to the hospitals to treat undocumented people. This option penalizes hospitals and potentially those with insurance or the ability to pay. The alternative would be to provide adequate federal funds for the care that federal law mandates the hospitals provide.
Another option is to stop requiring hospital emergency rooms to treat undocumented immigrants. That could save a lot of money.
How does the United States of America, a country where a majority of people claim some type of religious views, want to address that issue?
Perhaps it is time to cut through the rhetoric and ask that question.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/07045727/U.S.-Capitol.jpeg,,,2025-10-12 07:58:06.521880

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Gilman grapples with its identity as rail is poised to return.","LUNENBURG — The inconceivable is happening in Gilman: Rail is returning to the former mill community.
Early this year, news broke that Vermont Rail System planned to reopen a then-defunct section of railroad that runs from one of its freight lines in northern New Hampshire across the Connecticut River into Gilman. The rail company is in the process of clearing and reconstructing that section of track, as well as negotiating with rail giant CSX to purchase the rest of the line, which runs approximately 20 miles from Gilman to St. Johnsbury.
The plans, however, have been a shock to community members in Gilman, a village in Lunenburg that once thrived because of the local mill and adjoining railroad, but became a shadow of itself when the last freight trains passed through in the late 1990s. Around the same time, the paper mill closed.
The mill reopened in 2004, but abruptly shut down in June 2007, with 115 workers immediately laid off, according to a website run by the power company that now owns the property. At present, the mill property primarily consists of a hydroelectric dam and solar energy fields, but its owner is seeking tenants — including those who might benefit from a rail connection.
As the two historic economic pillars of Gilman work to reestablish themselves, community members are grappling with the pending impact on their lives and their town.
‘Pretty pissed’
Annika Chaffee and her husband are two of many Gilman residents whose houses or yards back up to the tracks. The couple bought their house a decade ago, choosing the location because it was quiet and a good place to raise kids while still being close to larger population centers, Chaffee said. The property is sandwiched between the road and the railroad; during an August visit, one of their children played on a swingset abutting the rusty rails.
The Chaffees’ kids used to play on the tracks, which, in mid-August, were in the process of being reclaimed by nature. Trees and brush grew around and through the rail, and Chaffee said the family regularly saw bears and moose on their game cameras.
In the months since, Vermont Rail System has cleared vegetation almost all the way to the mill.
When she first heard the news of the railroad’s return, Chaffee said she was “pretty pisssed.”
“If my husband’s job wasn’t so good, I’d say, ‘let’s head to Maine,’” she said. “But we’ve invested so much into our house, we’ve got so much going with the community. … I don’t want to leave.”
Chaffee said she worries about the many unknowns: how often trains will run, if there will be noise in the middle of the night, if the rail cars will transport chemicals, what would happen if there’s an accident — and if her family’s property value will decrease.
The rail corridor includes 33 feet on each side of the tracks, though many in Gilman have utilized that space for decades, including for walks. In August, a hammock even hung directly over the tracks in the center of the village, near the mill.
That corridor makes up more than half of the Chaffees’ backyard. 
“We would lose a lot if they decided to impose all 33 feet,” she said.
So far, adjacent property owners haven’t heard from Vermont Rail System about its plans directly — local approvals are not needed — and must sit with their uncertainties.
“If the railroad is going to benefit us, great,” Chaffee said. “But if it’s just going to tear the whole town apart, and you lose too many good people, then that’s problematic.”

Rail as an economic driver
Vermont Rail System, a family-owned company based in Burlington, operates more than 400 miles of track in Vermont and adjoining states. While it runs a passenger “dinner train” in the Champlain Valley during the summer and fall and Amtrak uses some of its rail lines, the company’s main business is freight.
Selden Houghton, president of Vermont Rail System, said Thursday that the company has some interested freight clients in the Gilman area, as well as customers in northern New Hampshire that are presently trucking their product from the rail’s current end in Vermont. Houghton said a lot of the goods being moved are in the forest industry but he thinks “there’s some other markets that will evolve as well.”
The company’s goal is to reestablish the connection between its rail line in northern New Hampshire and the rest of its network in St. Johnsbury, where Vermont Rail System owns track. Currently, Houghton said, the company sometimes has to send equipment all the way up into Québec and then back down into Vermont.
“If you look at the map, it makes sense why we want to do it,” he said.

Houghton said Vermont Rail System hopes to be running trains into Gilman within a year and that negotiations with CSX are ongoing; he is “optimistic” they will figure something out. However, Houghton noted, the rail corridor west of Gilman into St. Johnsbury is much more overgrown and has more significant washouts than the section into Gilman. The company plans to look to federal infrastructure grants to reopen that section of rail line.
The biggest reason for the project, he said, is to spur economic growth in the Northeast Kingdom and northern New Hampshire.
“If we can get competitive rail service reestablished by getting the New Hampshire Central Railroad that we purchased connected to the rest of the VRS system, it just opens up a tremendous amount of opportunities to put business on rail and get it off the road,” he said.
Houghton’s best guess is that trains will run through Gilman several times a week, initially, during daylight hours. However, he said, it really all depends on customers’ needs. Vermont Rail System’s nearby line from Newport to Wells River currently runs a train most days of the week during daylight hours, but used to do so twice daily, he said.
In terms of the myriad of pieces of personal property on the rail corridor through Gilman, Houghton said the company is going to initially clear things enough to move trains, but they “certainly need to address any encroachments” at some point. Typically, he said, brush is cut back the full 33-foot distance from the center line on each side of the tracks.
“You never know, based on business needs, what part of the corridor you may want to put a siding in,” he said, referring to a low-speed section of track next to the main line that is used for loading or storing rail vehicles. “It is private property.”

‘Everything needs to be done in balance’
While many are wary, some in Gilman are excited about the return of the trains.
Jacob Fournier has lived in Gilman his whole life and has a great passion for rail, originating from watching the trains go by the windows of Gilman’s middle school in the mid-1990s.
“It was a lot more exciting to watch the trains out the window than it was to pay attention to class,” he said. In August, Fournier said he was “cautiously optimistic” about the return of rail to town, though he noted he does not live by the tracks and is not directly affected like the Chaffees.
“A lot of rail proponents and fans of rail, I think, had sort of resigned themselves to the fact that (the railroad through Gilman) probably was going to get torn up and turned into a trail,” he said. “So the fact that VRS feels like they see a path forward to developing enough business to make it worthwhile to invest in the lines has certainly made us, you know — we’d like to see the trains come back.”
Fournier was referring to the Twin State Rail Trail Project, a collaboration between Vermont and New Hampshire snowmobile clubs and other trail organizations that had planned to connect the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail in St. Johnsbury to the Presidential and Ammonoosuc Rail Trails in New Hampshire via the very rail corridor now in the process of reactivation.
Initially stunned, organizers are now working with Vermont Rail System on possible designs for a recreational trail running next to the rail line for a short but important portion of reactivated track in Whitefield, New Hampshire. They hope this approach, used in other parts of Vermont such as the Burlington bike path, might be possible along other parts of the route.
“Everything needs to be done in balance,” Fournier said. “As a proponent of rail, I don’t want to see the community’s needs for recreational opportunities ignored or steamrolled over.”
Vermont Rail System’s rail revival is also having a striking impact on nearby communities, most notably in Whitefield, New Hampshire, where the unexpected reactivation has stalled a multimillion-dollar library expansion project.

‘Opportunity for connection and innovation’
Kate Baxter is chair of the local task force on Outdoor Recreation, Trails & Tourism, whose members — including Chaffee and Fournier — hold a multitude of viewpoints on the return of rail to town. The group was created during the Vermont Council on Rural Development’s community visit process, which Lunenburg participated in late last year around the same time the rail’s reactivation was announced.
Selectboard meeting minutes from last summer reveal an initial upwelling of community opposition, including a petition against the return of the rail. According to Baxter, the majority of residents — especially those who live on the rail corridor — would rather have seen the former railroad just turn into trees, communal land or the previously planned rail trail.
Now, however, they are focused on making the best of the situation.
As part of the task force, Baxter said she has spent a lot of time communicating with Vermont Rail System about its plans and progress, as well as meeting with residents to collect their feedback and share it with the rail company. In mid-September, she helped organize a meet and greet with several members of Vermont Rail System’s staff.
“I think it was helpful for people to … recognize this as a real thing that’s happening,” she said on Sept. 18. “I think there’s still a huge number of people who don’t even know. Maybe they’ve noticed the trees being cleared, maybe they haven’t.”
The task force has identified a number of proposals to share with Vermont Rail System, including one to retain community access to the Connecticut River and a number of trails alongside it that are reached by crossing the tracks. Later this month, Baxter plans to visit potential crossing locations with the Vermont Rail System team.
According to Baxter, Vermont Rail System said they are “confident” they can work out a crossing  — if there is financing.
“With collaboration of different stakeholders, I am hopeful we can achieve that,” Baxter said in an email. “Overall, VRS seems amenable to creative ideas in general if financing is there.”
Gathered proposals also call for low fencing alongside residential properties to bar animals and children from the rail.
“Every challenge is an opportunity for connection and innovation,” Baxter said. “It’s important to listen to all the different sides so that we can come to some sort of a future that is beneficial for everyone, so that we’re not just a pass-through (place) in the middle of nowhere.”

Mill space for lease
The other historic economic pillar of town, the defunct paper mill, was bought by Ampersand Energy Partners in 2008 and reopened as a hydroelectric power plant. The Boston-based company — which owns and operates small hydro and solar power facilities — has constructed one solar field on an adjoining property and recently notified the Lunenburg Selectboard that it would like to create another solar field on the mill site.
The mill building itself, however, has remained vacant since its purchase, despite several failed plans for new use or improved power infrastructure. Currently, a website advertises space for lease in the “Gilman Business Park,” where the developer is “willing to build to suit on currently empty lots.” According to the website, light manufacturing companies, forest and agricultural product businesses and commercial enterprises would do well at the location.
Annabelle Blake, a spokesperson for Ampersand, said in an email that the company has “had interest from prospective parties” and believes the mill “holds strong potential for strategic investment and long-term community benefit.” Blake added that Ampersand strongly supports the restart of rail operations, which “will bring increasing environmentally friendly options for transportation for potential tenants of the former Gilman mill.”
Fournier said he’d like to see the mill get some use.
“It will never be a paper mill again like it was,” he said. “But if having rail transportation gets a couple smaller businesses in here that can create 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 jobs, that just helps diversify the economy.”

Who will benefit?
During the heyday of Gilman’s mill and the railroad, community benefit was clear: the entities employed locals, paid taxes and created a vibrancy in town. There was an ice skating rink and warming hut along with tennis courts and a hotel, Baxter said. Others remember a bowling alley, train station, union hall and restaurant — all of which disappeared with the mill’s decline.
But now, many residents are wondering how the resurrection of these former economic pillars will benefit the community, and how their quality of life — including access to nature and recreational areas — will change with the rail’s revival.
“We don’t want to have industry come that doesn’t give us jobs or that doesn’t feed our community,” Baxter said.
However, most doubt the rail line or the mill will bring much benefit in the near future in terms of taxes or jobs, Baxter said. In fact, Ampersand requested (though was denied) a tax abatement on the mill property last year.
One thing the community is excited about, though, is having functional railroad infrastructure and someone to call when it fails. During last summer’s flooding, unmaintained railroad drainage ditches plugged up and contributed to washed-out roads.
“No one would return phone calls until these people bought the track,” said Meagan Forbes, who owns property abutting the railroad. “(Vermont Rail System) has been very responsive, but we all have that concern: are they going to maintain it? How long are they going to be around before they go out of business?”
“We want to see something that’s sustainable,” Baxter echoed.
To that end, Baxter has been pushing for a public meeting with the rail company and New Hampshire and Vermont’s transportation agencies, hoping to put the community’s voice at the table.
“I get it: corporations, businesses need to make money, and that’s where their interest is coming from,” said Baxter. “But we taxpayers … we as community members also have a vested interest in this space. We pay for roads, those different elements, and we live here and we want other people to live with us here and enjoy this space.”

TOWNS STATEWIDE — As tourists and Vermont residents alike set out on the state’s many hiking trails to admire the fall colors, they’ll find the vast majority of trails open as usual for foot travel. But this year’s drought coming after two prior years of damaging flooding has made upkeep and management of trails more challenging. 
Much of Vermont remains in severe to extreme drought, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System. That’s a sharp contrast to flooding in 2024 and especially 2023 that caused extensive damage including to trails.

The flood to drought scenario complicates trail repairs and improvements.
Waterbars, a key piece of infrastructure to control rainwater flow near trails, are difficult to install both when the soil is too dry and when the soil is too wet.
Stone stairs, which are necessary to slow erosion and help hikers get up steep, rocky stretches, are another piece of infrastructure that is difficult to construct in both droughts and post-flood conditions. 
“In wetter years like last year it was easier to see where water would flow or sit in the trail and therefore where we needed to add these structures,” said Molly Belvo, a Green Mountain Club trail crew leader.
This year it’s been so dry that trail workers have to try and picture where the water will go.
“We can see places that may be problematic in a heavy rain year, but without actually seeing it (now) we definitely could be missing areas,” Belvo said.
Droughts are a major concern on the trail this year. Trail advisories to carry more water when going on hikes have been issued this summer and fall, especially if hikers are spending the night on trail.  
While dry trails are more likely to remain compact to help prevent erosion, the long term risks that come with drought can be concerning to the future of the trail. On top of that, the Green Mountain Club has put out warnings against lighting outdoor fires since early August as the drought turns forest understories into timberboxes.
Floods in 2023 and in 2024 destroyed trails and trail infrastructure.
Roads, bridges, and trails were washed out or damaged in the floods and access roads to trailheads were destroyed.
“I think it’s going to take years to fix all of the damage from the storm events,” said Mike DeBonis, executive director of the Green Mountain Club, the Waterbury-based nonprofit that manages over 500 miles of trails in Vermont.
Floods that last only a day or two can lead to erosion levels typically seen only after five or more years of weathering.
“If those floods happened every 10 or 20 years, that’s one thing, but if it’s happening every two or three years do we really have the capacity with our current volunteers to maintain those trails to the standard we strive for?” DeBonis said. 
Every year, volunteers help repair and maintain trails and build infrastructure to help prevent future damage. 
This infrastructure is not cheap. A three-year trail improvement project on the popular Burrows Trail up Camel’s Hump that was completed last fall cost approximately $700,000. The Green Mountain Club and the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation led the work. 
You can’t do that big of a project everywhere, DeBonis said.
“I think one of the things we have to do is be smart and identify those areas that are at the greatest risk and will benefit the most from large scale investment,” he added.
Changes in federal funding also impact trail work.
“AmeriCorps funding cuts cut out certain aspects of our funding,” said Anna Montesanti, the conservation project coordinator at Vermont Youth Conservation Corps, a nonprofit conservation and agriculture organization based in Richmond.

Funding is not the only barrier to successful trail restoration. The same weather events that cause trail restoration to be necessary also greatly affect trail restoration efforts.
Both drought and heavy rains complicate building of waterbars and other necessary infrastructure. If the soil is too dry, stones used in infrastructure might not ‘suction’ into the holes and can be unstable. If the soil is too wet, the holes dug to put the stones in might fill with sediment and water before stones are able to be properly set, which can cause the rocks to not sit correctly in the ground. 
The availability of crews to lead trail restoration is also at risk.
“People are booking us several years in advance for some projects,” Montesanti said.
Planning and organizing restoration efforts is complicated when natural disasters can strike anytime and there is already so much damage to repair.
“(We) are trying to build with the thought in mind that there will be new disasters,” Montesanti added. 
So what’s the best way to help Vermont’s trails? Volunteering with the Green Mountain Club and local land trusts is one way, according to DeBonis. Donating to trail organizations and also advocating for government funds to go to trail restoration is also important, trail groups say. 
It’s also important to stay off damaged trails impacted by weather events and follow advisories such as the Green Mountain Club’s guidelines.

This story by Maryellen Apelquist was first published in The Herald on Oct. 9, 2025.
Along with food came unbridled laughter as volunteers-turned-friends in Royalton wound down the clock to a noontime meal on Tuesday for seniors.
The lunch preppers, themselves senior citizens in their 70s and 80s, hustled and bustled in the warm kitchen of Royalton Academy—some, like chef Tony Perkins, since 5:30 a.m.
One wrested a deep bowl of hot potatoes from an old Hobart floor-standing mixer. Another sliced servings from four large sheet pans of pineapple cake baked fresh that morning. Others washed pots and pans and pitched in wherever directed by Perkins, a military veteran and retired court reporter of 38 years who also spent 15 years as a professional cake decorator.
They recalled tidbits of conversations overheard at lunches past: “I’m sorry I didn’t introduce you but I didn’t remember your name,” brought howls of laughter. And volunteer Larry Parmenter of South Royalton rolled with quips: When another volunteer yelped “Ouch!” in the kitchen, Parmenter offered a helpful “I didn’t feel a thing.”
Linda Fadden of South Royalton, a former nurse who worked at Dartmouth Hitchcock for 36 years, said she “failed at retirement a couple times,” a sentiment echoed by Perkins and other hardworking members of the brigade.

The senior center gig is a good time all around, said 89-year-old Marge Turner of East Bethel. “I love being down here. I love just getting [out]. I can’t stay at home—it would drive me crazy,” said Turner as she washed dishes.
The kitchen crew was making food not just for the weekly congregate lunch — 25 pounds of ground beef for Tuesday’s stroganoff — but also to support the South Royalton Senior Center’s other programs that help to ensure food access for older community members in the White River Valley towns of Royalton, Bethel, Sharon and Strafford. Programs include home-delivery Meals on Wheels and a grab-and-go curbside service, which started during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With some seniors receiving meals for all seven days of the week, having variety available in the center’s freezer is key, said South Royalton Senior Center executive director Sue Pirie, who manages the business side of things. Pirie also leads the centers in Chelsea and Strafford.
“So when we do a meal, we do 60 to 90 extra and freeze them, and they’re all labeled,” said Pirie during a tour of the packaged meals side of the operation, as she pointed out a cooler being prepped for a recipient. “And then that way, like, this person is getting six meals, so they’ll have different meals every day.”
In addition to the meal programs, Pirie plans trips for seniors and oversees other services and partnerships, such as with Central Vermont Council on Aging.
Her centers’ joint October newsletter includes a robust and filling-sounding menu — roast pork, homemade baked beans, hearty lasagna — and is likewise full of opportunities. An upcoming trip includes a Christmas show in Portsmouth, N.H., and lunch in Kittery, Maine. CVCOA offerings include “Creative Care Kits,” which are projects that can be picked up and completed at home.
October also means it’s annual-meeting time for the centers, and Pirie on Tuesday was reviewing numbers for the previous fiscal year.
“Last year, which would have been as of September 30, we served 12,789 in Royalton and in Strafford we did 2,620,” she said. “It’s all by donation, so we do a lot of fundraising. We’re looking for grants, that type of stuff. It’s all by donation — we don’t charge.”
All in, a pre-packaged meal by the center costs $12 to produce. That figure factors in things like the packaging, which is compostable, and payroll.
Pirie, who lives in Chelsea and has been doing similar work for 25 years, expressed gratitude to the donors, including the center’s dozen board members and local farmers who donate squash.
While the senior centers receive some state and federal funding, that support feels tenuous.
“We can’t depend on that. You know how things are changing, which is not good,” she said. “They’re worried about their insurance. They’re worried about a lot. And the way I feel, seniors should be the last ones to be cut. …They’ve worked all their lives. We should be helping them, just like the veterans. We should be helping them. We shouldn’t be penalizing.”
In the dining room Tuesday in Royalton, while lunch was served at noon, guests started rolling in before 10:30 a.m. They took coffee or tea and caught up with neighbors they perhaps hadn’t seen since the Tuesday before.

There’s nothing quite like it where she lives in Florida, said seasonal Bethel resident Martine Weaver. “I don’t know of any senior center in Florida,” she said. “The whole thing, it’s all different. We entertain in our homes.”
Weaver agreed with her tablemates on one attractive aspect of the meal: food cooked by someone else tastes better. The social opportunity afforded by the lunch is also a big draw. “You have good conversation,” said Marilyn Pratt of Bethel. “And I never leave hungry, and I’m a big eater.”
While the center’s dining room was largely full come lunchtime, Perkins, who works about 15 hours a week and also cooks for the Chelsea center, wants readers to know there is still plenty of room at the table, and he’s eager for everyone to try his food.
“Everyone seems to like everything I’ve cooked so far,” said the chef, who estimates he has somewhere between 600 and 700 cookbooks and is known for his whoopie pies and fancy chocolates. “But I think one of the favorite meals is the roast pork dinner.”
Barbara Hart, 93, of Bethel offered her compliments to the chef. “The food is great,” she said. “They haven’t served anything I haven’t liked.”
Senior meals available in the White River Valley are offered by the Chelsea Senior Center, Greater Randolph Senior Center, Orange East Senior Center, Quin-Town Senior Center in Hancock, South Royalton Senior Center and South Strafford Senior Center.

Prosecutors have charged one of those employees with sexual abuse of a protected person. (Lori Potter for the Flatwater Free Press)At least two staff members at the juvenile treatment center in Kearney have resigned, another is on leave, and a fourth faces a criminal charge in connection with allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with teenagers in state custody.
Two of the cases involve months-old allegations, revealed in recent court proceedings. They have sparked concerns about a potential “systemic problem” at the center and prompted the Douglas County Public Defender’s Office to start reviewing its cases involving clients housed at the center.
In one teen’s case, a judge wrote that she was “disgusted and disturbed as to the lack of transparency in this matter.” She ordered the state to relocate the teen to a different center. And she directed all juveniles at state centers with cases before her to appear in person with enough time for private conversations with their lawyers.
The recent court filings and proceedings have referenced at least four current or former Kearney staff members in connection with incidents involving three teens at the center.
In a statement, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which operates the state’s youth centers, said it takes every allegation seriously and investigates every claim of abuse.
“DHHS has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment or sexual assault. Staff are required to cooperate fully with investigations when allegations are made.”
The allegations, though, proved extensive enough that Douglas County Public Defender Tom Riley said lawyers in his office will examine the treatment of the county’s juveniles housed there — approximately 20 boys — to determine if they want alternative placement.
“Given the very disturbing information that’s come out over the last week and a half or so, it appears that there could be a systemic problem at Kearney,” Riley said.
Kearney is one of three Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Centers, or YRTCs, that serve juvenile offenders 14 through 18 years old who are placed there by the courts.
Court records show that Douglas County Juvenile Court Judge Amy Schuchman learned during a mid-September hearing that a 17-year-old at the Kearney center had been “in a relationship” with a 23-year-old staff member.
Later that same month, Schuchman learned that an 18-year-old at the same center had disclosed “incidents of sexual assault” by a different staff member, according to a court order.
In both cases, YRTC leaders learned of the alleged misconduct months earlier, but the state didn’t disclose it to probation officials, the boys’ attorneys or the judge.
In the 18-year-old’s case, March emails between YRTC staff and the Nebraska State Patrol showed a cellphone was found with “nude pictures and videos of youth at the facility” and “nude content” from a female staff member, according to an order.
Riley said it appears the employee provided the phone to several teens at the center.
Text messages showed “inappropriate text communication for an ongoing period of time,” with the woman referring to the teen as her “future hubby” and asking whether he’d live with her after he was released. (The staffer is not being named in print, because she has not been charged with a crime.)
The state didn’t disclose any of that information, though the teen had appeared in court in July for an unrelated hearing, according to the court order.
“This Court is disgusted and disturbed as to the lack of transparency in this matter and cannot say that continued commitment to the YRTC at this time would” be in the 18-year-old’s best interest, Schuchman wrote.
The staff member has resigned from the YRTC, according to court proceedings.
For months, officials at the state-run Kearney Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center did not disclose allegations of inappropriate sexual contact involving staff members and teenagers in custody at the center. (Lori Potter for the Flatwater Free Press)
In the 17-year-old’s case, YRTC officials substantiated allegations in April. Evidence included a “sexually graphic written conversation” and “sexually graphic videos” between the teen and staff member.
But the center didn’t report the allegations directly to law enforcement and — despite knowing about the allegations at the time of an earlier hearing — it didn’t report them to probation until just before the September hearing.
In both cases, Schuchman ordered the state to move the boys to another facility. On Oct. 2, she issued a broader order requiring that any youth committed to a YRTC be transported to court for their hearings with “ample time for them to consult with their attorneys” and other adults.
At a hearing Wednesday, lawyers and Schuchman pressed DHHS staff about the department’s handling of the 17-year-old’s case.
The staffer initially reported the teen for inappropriate touching, according to Shaylee Fortner, a DHHS facility compliance administrator. (The staffer has not been charged with a crime.)
Within days, a compliance manager reviewed the graphic note and video surveillance, the staff member was placed on paid suspension and she resigned, according to DHHS staff testimony. After further investigation, the compliance manager contacted the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline, according to Fortner.
“I do not believe my team directly notified anybody else, externally,” she said.
An internal, non-criminal investigation determined the staff member had merely allowed inappropriate contact with the 17-year-old to continue for too long before reporting it, according to Fortner. YRTC’s determination didn’t change as more information surfaced, though Fortner said her office contacted the hotline a second time.
YRTC Kearney reprimanded the 17-year-old, giving him a “major violation for sexual harassment,” which was reported to his attorney and others in a monthly progress letter. The letter didn’t mention any details of the allegations or relationship with the staff member, according to testimony.
When the 17-year-old’s lawyer called his client’s living unit manager, Steven Huffman, to ask about the incident, Huffman told the lawyer that he wouldn’t believe anything the boy said. At the time of the phone call, Huffman had already seen the video surveillance and graphic note.
In court, the boy’s lawyer asked Huffman why he said that he shouldn’t believe his client.
“I really don’t have an answer for you,” Huffman responded.
As a result of the incident, Huffman said he now does more training with new employees about boundaries.

Under state law, it’s a felony to subject someone in DHHS custody to sexual contact. Consent is not a defense. DHHS’s own policy requires the YRTC to contact the State Patrol if evidence supports criminal prosecution, according to testimony.
But Fortner, the DHHS facility compliance administrator, said the video footage only substantiated allegations that the youth touched the staff member.
“We reviewed … copious amounts of video, and we only ever found incidents of him touching her inappropriately outside of the clothing,” Fortner said.
Under questioning, though, Fortner acknowledged that the video showed the staff member smiling and laughing while the teen touched her. And Fortner confirmed that the confiscated note included the staff and youth talking about sex acts and her writing that she likes it when he’s jealous.
Judge Schuchman asked Fortner: “You’ve said several times that, when you reviewed video, you only found incidents of (the youth) touching the staff. But are you aware that that could also be a crime? That sexual contact, as defined by the Nebraska statutes, can be the touching by the victim of the actor’s sexual or intimate parts or the clothing covering it — are you aware of that?”
“I would have to say no,” Fortner replied.
Denis Lemus, the teen’s attorney, said in an emailed statement that progress reports often include that children need to take accountability for their actions rather than avoid negative consequences. It seems the center doesn’t “practice what it preaches,” he said.
“The offending staff member was allowed to resign, while they used the incident as the catalyst to set back my client’s progress at the facility, thereby prolonging his stay,” Lemus said. “I am disheartened, and frankly sickened, that the YRTC seems more concerned with trying to protect [its] reputation than trying to protect the children in their care.”
In its statement, DHHS said it complies with requirements and procedures laid out in state and federal law and adheres to standards set by the American Correctional Association.
Once abuse is reported, the department immediately separates the teen from the implicated staff member, who is escorted off the property, according to DHHS. The teen is provided immediate medical and mental health care, and the department reports each case to the abuse and neglect hotline. Reports are sent to law enforcement for investigation. The department cooperates with the Nebraska State Patrol and follows protocol to notify the Office of Inspector General and probation.

Two additional cases surfaced during the questioning Wednesday.
Fortner said she very recently learned that a confidential reporter had called the child abuse hotline alleging inappropriate sexual contact between the same 17-year-old and another Kearney staffer. It prompted a new investigation and alert to the State Patrol, Fortner said. That staffer is now on paid suspension, according to Fortner.
And in September, authorities charged former Kearney YRTC staff member Martha Ruiz Palacios, 28, with second-degree sexual abuse of a protected individual. Court filings allege she had sexual contact with a 16-year-old at the center sometime between July 31 and Aug. 2. Ruiz Palacios’ employment with the department ended Aug. 4, according to DHHS. She is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 17.
At one point during Wednesday’s hearing, Schuchman asked Fortner how many staff members since March 2025 had resigned or been fired due to “inappropriate sexual allegations.”
Fortner said she didn’t know.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-12 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"In some CT towns, clouds form over new solar developments",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/12/ct-solar-power-gravel-pit-pushback/,Experts warn the pushback against solar could threaten CT's ability to meet its long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,"The first time Chris Dahl heard rumblings of a plan to build a large solar array among the corn fields and tobacco sheds of East Windsor, she said the project sounded like a good enough idea.
A portion of the land slated for development included a sand and gravel quarry that had become an attractive hangout for underage drinkers and ATV riders, much to the displeasure of local residents and town officials.
Plus, Dahl said, the project promised to produce gobs of clean, carbon-free electricity  — the kind of mission that she and her wife, Robin Chesky, had supported by installing solar panels on the roof of their own home in town.
Dahl wasn’t alone in her initial feelings about the project, which even adopted a name highlighting its adaptive reuse of the old quarry: Gravel Pit Solar.
Local officials also threw their support behind it, citing the project’s benefits to the town as well as Connecticut’s broader effort to shift away from its reliance on older fuel-burning power plants. While testifying in favor of Gravel Pit Solar’s application before state regulators in 2020, East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said the community was “very supportive of renewable energy projects, especially when the projects make sense for us.”
“This is not going to be something that becomes an eyesore,” he added.
But by the time Gravel Pit Solar began to take shape in late 2021, Dahl and others were having second thoughts.

They grew alarmed as they watched construction spread beyond the gravel pit area onto hundreds of acres of surrounding farmland. Trees and shrubs were cleared to make way for solar panels, and workers erected a wire fence around the site, which Dahl said she feared would block the movement of local wildlife.
The first she time drove over a hill and witnessed the extent of the project, Dahl said she began to cry. 
“It just overwhelmed me,” she said. “Gone was the farmland. Gone was the open space, now it was filled with panels … It was really unexpected for me, and I think other people have had similar experiences.”
With an output of up to 120 megawatts, Gravel Pit Solar is by far the largest solar array in Connecticut and one of the largest in New England. Its thousands of panels are enough to cover more than 350 football fields and are capable of producing roughly one-quarter of all the existing utility-scale solar power in the state. The site runs from Apothecaries Hall and Windsorville roads on the north side to Plantation Road on the south, according to the site plans. 
Its construction has made East Windsor the forerunner in the state’s charge toward solar energy development. Surrounding towns, too, have joined in the bonanza with other large arrays sprouting up on former farm fields throughout the region. 
After initially welcoming the Gravel Pit project, however, many residents and local officials now say they’ve soured on the town’s status as a hotbed for the solar industry. Critics have accused developers of snatching up farmland, altering the rural character of the town and ignoring local concerns about noise and safety.
And East Windsor isn’t the only Connecticut community where solar opposition is on the rise. Experts warn the growing pushback could threaten the state’s ability to meet its long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by deploying new, cleaner forms of electricity generation.
Still, solar developers haven’t slowed down.

Roughly a month after commencing full operations in April, Gravel Pit’s developers, DESRI Holdings, filed a request with the Connecticut Siting Council to expand the existing facility by another 30 megawatts onto adjacent properties. The company has also revealed its plans to build a second 100-megawatt facility, Saltbox Solar, on farmland in the towns of East Windsor and Ellington.
“Connecticut needs additional power to meet future demand, and state law requires all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2040,” the company said in a statement.
“Regulators determine how to balance those needs with local concerns,” the statement continued. “DESRI is proud to help provide affordable, clean power to the state by developing projects that are consistent with state policy and is committed to engaging local communities throughout the process.”
In an effort to marshal the local opposition to solar expansion, Dahl and Chesky formed East Windsor Residents for Responsible Solar Development and have been collecting hundreds signatures from people urging the Siting Council to reject the latest proposal.
Their efforts have attracted the support of state lawmakers — even some who strongly support the state’s clean-energy efforts — who are now pressing for systemic changes to the process of approving larger solar arrays and other renewable energy projects that would give cities and towns more of a say in determining whether those facilities get built.
“We don’t want any more of these,” East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said recently. “I want to be very clear — we don’t want any more of these.”

Who gives the go-ahead
That systemic change lawmakers are considering could begin with the Connecticut Siting Council. Established in 1971, the council regulates the placement of power plants and electric transmission lines, a process that was previously controlled largely by the use of eminent domain by utility companies.
The council’s jurisdiction has since grown to include cell phone towers, hazardous waste facilities and other types of vital infrastructure projects that often meet with heavy pushback from neighbors. For that reason, the council has the final say over siting such facilities, preempting local control.
“It was basically to end town-by-town regulation of these larger projects that impact interstate commerce,” said Melanie Bachman, who has served as the executive director of the Siting Council since 2013. 
If each town had the authority to veto projects within its borders, she added, “the lights would go off and telecommunications would go out.”
Critics, however, say the Siting Council has gone too far in weighing the interests of developers over local opposition. They point to the fact that the council has, in recent years, approved more than 80% of its applications to build large solar arrays. (By statute, the council has jurisdiction over siting any electric-generating facility over 1 megawatt, though developers of smaller projects can waive their exclusion to avoid leaving the decision up to municipal officials.)
“We look at the state and say, ‘You need to do a better job, because these are being built in residential zones, and the impact on the community and the residents that have purchased property next to them is huge,'” Dahl said.

(Mid-America All-Indian Museum)It is one of the most recognizable pieces of art in Kansas.
“The Keeper of the Plains” is Blackbear Bosin’s 44-foot steel sculpture of a Native American, hands lifted to the heavens. It is installed on a rocky plinth above the confluence of the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers near downtown Wichita and, since its creation in 1974, has become synonymous with the city — its aspirations and hopes and the First Peoples who came before.
It is also a Mercator of worlds.
Land and river, city and plain, earth and sky, past and present.
Red and white.
If only Bosin were still around, he might be able to tell us what it’s like to straddle two worlds. Alas, Bosin — who was born in a tipi in Oklahoma and was of Kiowa-Comanche heritage — died 45 years ago.
But the subjunctive capacity survives in his work, the ability of one soul to reveal a glimpse of itself to another in an eternal game of what if? If I had been born in another culture, or another time, or a different place, this is what my eyes might have captured, this is what my heart may have held. This is the secret of all great or at least good art: the ability to transmit experience.
I’ve been thinking about Bosin because this three-day weekend marks Indigenous Peoples’ Day. The holiday is celebrated in some localities on the second Monday in October, as an alternative to the Columbus Day federal holiday. In Kansas, despite attempts by advocates to set aside a day to respect and honor First Peoples, Indigenous People’s Day is not a paid holiday for state employees. Many cities and schools in the state do mark the day, however. It is recognized in Wichita by proclamation and was celebrated Saturday, with remembrance and a Trail of Tears walk at the Mid-America All-Indian Museum.
The museum, on the triangle of land between the Arkansas and Little Arkansas rivers, is almost in the shadow — just a short walk away — of the “Keeper of the Plains.” Established in 1969, the site was originally called a center instead of a museum, but it’s really both; not only is it a meeting place that hosts cultural events such as powwows and book talks, but it also has a collection of 3,000 American Indian artifacts.
In June, I spoke at the museum about my 2018 University Press of Kansas book, “Elevations: A Personal Exploration of the Arkansas River.” I arrived a little early for my talk and, as I walked among the exhibits, I became absorbed in the work of Bosin.
Studying his other work made me see “Keeper of the Plains” differently.
“Keeper” is his only sculpture, and I’ve seen it so often and for so long — in person, in newsprint, on postcards and regional television — that I took it for granted as a part of the Wichita landscape. Dedicated in 1974, in advance of the nation’s bicentennial, over the years it became hidden by surrounding trees. It was later placed on a raised plaza and became the centerpiece of an eight-year, $20 million river beautification and renovation project completed in 2007.
The location of the “Keeper,” where the big and little rivers meet, is of special significance to several First Nations. It’s been inhabited for centuries. The headwaters of the Arkansas River — the big river, the one most folks in Kansans call the AR-kan-sus — has its headwaters on the Continental Divide above Leadville, Colorado, more than 600 miles and about 9,000 feet of elevation away. The headwaters of the little river are 80 miles away in Rice County and not far from the ancient Native American “Serpent Effigy.”

In “Elevations,” I described rivers as liminal spaces, as those places between. While I was on the spit of land between two rivers where the Mid-American All-Indian Museum is located, I kept thinking back to the idea of the liminal as I looked at Bosin’s art. On one hand you have the quick early sketches and commercial work and on the other hand there are the cultural pieces that vibrate with color and power.
My favorite is “Prairie Fire.”
The original 1953 painting is held by the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa. The dreamlike sky seethes with wind and flame, antelope jump, Native Americans race away on horseback, and wolves (or perhaps coyotes?) slink in the foreground. National Geographic used the work in its magazine and as the dust jacket cover of “Indians of the Americas.” It is the work that brought Bosin national attention and secured his place among contemporary Native American artists of the mid-20th century.
Let me pause and revise that last sentence.
It should read “contemporary American artists” instead.
Bosin was an American artist who also happened to draw inspiration from his Kiowa-Comanche culture. To qualify his work as that of a “Native American” artist is true, but also patronizing, in the same way that makes Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar-winning director of “The Hurt Locker,” bristle at being called a woman filmmaker. Such attitudes toward Native American artists were crystallized in an April 14, 1957, review in the Tulsa World.
Bosin’s paintings “in exhibition now at Philbrook are particularly interesting as an illustration of this artist’s attempt to solve the problem which faces all Indian painters,” opined the newspaper’s arts editor, Maurice De Vinna. “That is, how to avoid repetition of stereotypical motifs without either taking his work out of the category of American Indian painting, or pushing a personal style to the point of mannerism.”
I’m not attempting to be cruel to De Vinna — somebody 70 years from now might take an example of something I’ve written as an example of our thick-headed age — but to underline the patronizing constraint under which Bosin worked. Mannerism was a part of Thomas Hart Benton’s style of exaggerated figures and vibrant color, and while Benton had plenty of critics who sneered as his populism, his heritage was not a part of the argument.
Bosin was born in 1921 in a tipi near Anadarko, Oklahoma, according to a chronology on his legacy project website. His Kiowa name was Tsate-Knogia. At a mission school he became acquainted with the work of the Kiowa Five artists and his mother, Ada, a bead worker, encouraged his interest, although he would have no formal training in art. During the Depression, the teenage Bosin peddled his own paints door-to-door for $1 or so each at Anadarko, according to a United Press International feature.
At 20, he moved to Wichita and worked at Beech Aircraft. He was a Marine during World War II, and his interest in art was rekindled while recovering from an illness in Hawaii. His first one-man show was in Honolulu in 1945.
Back in Wichita after the war, he was an industrial designer and illustrator for Boeing. In 1958, he was asked to create a mosaic for the Crystal Ballroom at the Hotel Broadview downtown. The result was “Advance of Civilization in Kansas,” and part of it depicts Coronado’s 1541 exploration of the region.
By 1959, Bosin opened the Great Plains Studio.
“Bosin attained widespread acclaim as a traditional painter,” according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. “While using some manner of the Kiowa flat style, he also employed European techniques of illusion and surrealism. This combination contributed to his work’s uniqueness. Besides relying on his own research and reading, Bosin drew inspiration from his grandmother’s tales of earlier and better times.”
In 1965, he was invited to the White House Festival of Arts and in 1970 was part of the All-Indian Show at the Kennedy Theatre in New York. It was about this time, or slightly earlier, that plans were laid for “Keeper.” The idea for the sculpture came from Elmer Hall, CEO of Kansas Gas & Electric Co. (now Evergy), according to the utility’s website. But it would be years before work began on the sculpture.

Meanwhile, Bosin pursued authenticity in his two-dimensional work.
“Bosin travels from his Wichita home to the reservations of the original Plains people to interview the few remaining medicine men and hear stories of supernatural deeds handed down over countless generations,” wrote UPI reporter Patrick Malone in 1973. “He pores over weighty anthropological finds — all in his quest to accurately chronicle what Indians looked like centuries ago, and perhaps more importantly what they dreamed.”
The five-ton “Keeper” sculpture was dedicated in 1974 as part of the nation’s bicentennial celebration. Construction was funded by $20,000 in state and municipal grants and another $8,000 in community contributions. KG&E engineers and crews created the sculpture from designs provided by Bosin. The skin for the sculpture was made from Core-Ten, a type of steel that doesn’t need painting and turns a burnished red as it weathers.
The 2007 renovations incorporated the themes of water, air, earth and fire. For 15 minutes each night, a ring of fire pots is lit near the base of sculpture. Exhibits along the limestone walls of the plaza celebrate Plains culture, including depictions of bison, ceremonial pipes and dream animals.
“This is not the place I was born,” Bosin told a Wichita Eagle reporter in 1974, “but this is the birthplace of my fathers and forefathers. (The sculpture) has conveyed everything I wanted to say. And I have a very good feeling about it. That is the reason I have asked no stipend, and why I have given the design to the city.”
As he grew older, he increasingly portrayed Plains nations as he dreamed they were in prehistory.
“Late in his life the artist remarked that his paintings never recognized the defeat of the Indian,” according to his Oklahoma Historical Society entry. “Instead, he described America as if Europeans had not arrived in 1492. His art reflected spiritual history, tribal history, and Indian myth. He depicted his people in the same way the tribal storytellers told their histories.”
Bosin died on Aug. 9, 1980, after years of heart problems. He was 59.
“Blackbear never was aware of it,” eulogized George Neavoll, an editor at the Wichita Eagle, “but I loved him with a passion that was born of the land and all that walks upon it, and none trod its surface as lovingly and as gently as the great Indian artist.”
Bosin was one of the most organic of creators. From selling his paintings door-to-door during the Depression to his most iconic work, it was inspired by time and place — and, in some cases, the dull compulsion of the economic. But art flows on, even when the most influential of artists dies, and other generations step forward. The Smithsonian has a striking digital exhibit of contemporary Native and Indigenous artists.
Nobody knows what Bosin experienced when he crossed from earth to sky, or from darkness to light, or from being to nothingness. He crossed the last great border, the threshold to Shakespeare’s “Undiscovered County.” Perhaps he joined his ancestors in a world before history. But wherever he went, he left pieces of himself scattered across our world, in paintings and murals and one singular sculpture.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-12 08:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Shapiro’s Folly — a bridge over Long Island Sound,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/12/shapiros-folly-a-bridge-over-long-island-sound/,Connecticut has been buzzing over a local housing developer's fantastical pipe-dream of a bridge to Long Island.,"Why is much of Connecticut talking about a bridge from Bridgeport, across Long Island Sound, to New York State?  How did we get sucked into a debate about a project that every transportation expert I spoke with said just won’t happen?
You can blame (credit?) Connecticut housing developer Steven Shapiro for this distraction as he pipe-dreams way outside his area of expertise.


“A reporter from The CT Post called me to talk about housing,” he told WFSB’s “CT ‘25.”  “I always liked the idea of a bridge.  And now this thing has ballooned into a massive story.”
He even helped by generating a lovely artificial intelligence image of the structure, complete with red, white and blue towers which was gobbled up by the media.
A 14-mile bridge, costing a guesstimated $50 billion?  It’s a good thing Shapiro didn’t dangle the idea of flying cars to the reporter.
Shapiro has never built a bridge.  His expertise is in affordable housing projects in cities like Bristol, Fairfield, Milford and Easton.  That’s great, and certainly needed.  But a bridge?  Nah.
I asked the Connecticut Department of Transportation about the idea of such a bridge and they said “None of the regional MPOs (regional planning agencies) have this in their long-range plans.  It is not in CTDOT’s long-range plan for the state either.”
It’s not that our state’s planners lack vision… just money.  They must focus on the feasible, not fanciful.
Shapiro says a cross-sound bridge would get Connecticut residents to the lovely Long Island beaches faster.  But that’s hardly the justification for a $50 billion bridge.  And anyhow, what’s wrong with Connecticut’s beaches?
As for the $50 billion estimated price, Shapiro says the new Tappan Zee Bridge replacement, the Mario Cuomo Bridge, cost $4 billion for its three-mile length. “If you prorate that out to 15 miles, it’s $20 billion,” he says.  Factor in inflation and adding a train line on the bridge and you’re at $30 billion.  Rounding upward, because things always cost more than planned, and he suggests a $50 billion price tag is reasonable.
But is that a fair calculation?  Is that how Shapiro bids on housing development jobs?
And what would it cost to drive across this hypothetical bridge?  Shapiro suggests a one-way toll of about $40.
Compare that to the one-way fare of about $75 for a car and driver on the Bridgeport – Port Jefferson ferry.  That makes Shapiro’s bridge look like a bargain… except only those who take the ferry pay the fare.  Build a bridge and all of us taxpayers pay for it, even if we never go to the Hamptons.
And if there were a bridge, wouldn’t that just worsen traffic in Connecticut with more New Yorkers going to New England?
The idea of bridging Long Island Sound has been studied by experts as recently as 2017.  They concluded that there were serious environmental issues and maybe ten or more state and federal agencies would need to be involved.  Most concerning, the report said that tolls would cover only 22% of the debt service (with guess-who paying the difference) and that it would take five years to plan and eight years to build.
Meantime, our state’s housing crisis is happening right now.  Maybe Shapiro could focus on his real skill set and not dangle unfeasible, bright shiny objects in front of a click-hungry media.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bridge-AI-Picture-by-Shapiro-1024x595.png,,,2025-10-12 04:56:49.322137
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-12 00:05:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Why the Democratic supermajority on Beacon Hill won’t pass Democratic bills,Aaron Singer,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/why-the-democratic-supermajority-on-beacon-hill-wont-pass-democratic-bills/,"Sooner or later, enough people will learn how democracy in Massachusetts is a lie. When they do, leadership’s iron grip will crack, not because those in power wanted to change, but because voters finally forced them to.","FIVE AND A HALF hours into a tedious rules debate at the Massachusetts State House in January 2019, acting Speaker Tom Petrolati ordered a roll call vote on a noncontroversial amendment, and voted no. Within seconds, red lights, representing “no” votes, lit up the electronic vote-tally board in the House chamber as dozens of rank-and-file members followed his lead.  
Then, realizing he had made a mistake (but not realizing his mic was still on), Petrolati stammered: “It’s a yes?… Switch ’em. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes!”  
After his vote on the large display board flipped to green for “yes,” so, too, did the votes of at least 63 Democratic representatives. (The video of this moment remains on the Legislature’s website, beginning at 5:35:49.)  
Beacon Hill Roll Call reporter Bob Katzen’s write-up of the all-too-common event didn’t mince words: “Did these 63 even know what they were voting on? Did they care? What would cause them to switch their votes other than they decided to follow the ‘suggestion’ of the speaker?”  
In a separate interview, Rep. Russell Holmes, one of the few at that time to openly criticize the system, offered a blunt assessment: “The entire legislative establishment is a scam. [The Speaker] is like a shepherd leading the sheep. Most reps vote the way he tells them to vote.” 
Having grown up in deep-blue Massachusetts, I viewed politics through a national lens. Beyond knowing my rep’s names, I never thought much about what goes on under the Golden Dome on the corner of Boston Common.  
Like many, I assumed that Massachusetts was liberal, and therefore, so was our State House. If a progressive policy was doable, the same electorate that chose Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey would have chosen a Legislature excited to make it happen.  
That assumption crumbled when I started working on a documentary about why daylight saving time (DST) reform won’t pass the Legislature, despite broad public support. 
What began as an attempt to use the Legislature’s clunky website to trace the path of a DST bill quickly turned into a ten-month (and counting) investigation. Interviews with lawmakers, activists, and reporters all confirmed the same truth of how laws actually pass in Massachusetts: Just a few members of leadership decide which bills live or die. Debate is staged, and the real lawmaking happens behind closed doors.  
Massachusetts has one of the least transparent, least productive legislatures in the country. Despite our state’s progressive reputation — and a Democratic supermajority in both chambers — our State House won’t pass basic party priorities. This includes bills to:  

Prevent offshore corporate tax dodging 


Implement LGBTQ+ inclusive sex-ed 


Provide menstrual products in schools, prison, and shelters 


Stop wage theft  


Enact same-day voter registration 


End state/local collaboration with ICE 


Ban cash bail and mandatory minimum sentences 

The “Act to Stop Wage Theft” referenced above? It had a supermajority of co-sponsors in the House a few years ago, yet it never received a vote. Here’s why.  
Each law must go through several committees led by handpicked allies of the leadership; committee votes were completely opaque until mounting public pressure spurred changes this summer.  
These committees serve as bottlenecks, allowing leadership to effectively choose what bills get a vote by the full chamber. When committee chairs go against the Speaker or Senate president, they risk losing this position and the extra salary that comes with it. Representatives have even lost pay and power just for being critical of leadership.  
Former rep. Denise Provost has pointed out that leadership used to poll members before major bills. But after a threshold of lawmakers with leadership-controlled stipends was reached, the polling stopped.  
This top-down dynamic should frustrate Republicans as well: Minority Leader Brad Jones cooperates with the Speaker to block some roll-call votes Democrats prefer not to be recorded on.   
No House committee is more important than the Ways and Means Committee. Internal rules require that many bills go through that committee, before the full House can vote on them, making Speaker Mariano’s handpicked chair, Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, one of the most powerful people in the Bay State. 
For big money industries, like private insurance, this structure is a gift. Instead of persuading 160 representatives to kill or pass a bill, they only need to win over a small handful of gatekeepers. And if you wonder what their preferred method of persuasion might be, just look at Michlewitz’s campaign reports: Since 2009, he’s run unopposed, yet between 2020 and 2024 he raised $1,995,765.21.  
Beacon Hill’s contempt for the public will is perfectly illustrated by a largely forgotten incident from two decades ago, whose key players now run the Legislature. 
In 2003, Massachusetts residents petitioned to put a constitutional right to affordable health care on the ballot. “Romneycare,” the bipartisan Massachusetts law that served as a blueprint for the Affordable Care Act, was still being shaped, and activists feared lawmakers would gut patient protections to appease the powerful insurance lobby.  
After collecting over 71,000 signatures to begin the process for amending the Massachusetts Constitution, the hard part was finished. All that remained was getting 25 percent of the Legislature to approve it in two sessions. When the first vote confirmed it, 153-41, the second seemed like a formality. However, the vote would never happen.  
When the next session convened, House and Senate leadership backed an effort to send the question to study, a procedural trick to kill a measure without taking a public stance. Lawmakers fell in line, 118-76, and voters never got to decide if affordable health care should become a right.  
Then-committee chairs Ron Mariano and Karen Spilka were among the few legislators to openly argue for the motion on the floor, a gamble that should have made them the face of killing affordable health care. Ultimately, their gamble paid off: Today, House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka each sit atop massive campaign accounts fueled by lots of money from the health care and insurance industry.  
Today, the “study” maneuver is a convenient tactic to quietly kill bills, as citizens are misled into thinking their bill is being actively considered; lobbyists know better.  
When activists challenged the scuttled ballot question at the state’s highest court, justices agreed that lawmakers violated their constitutional duty by failing to hold a second vote on the proposal, but the court said it had no authority to compel action by lawmakers under the separation of powers. The only recourse, the justices said, was at the ballot box.  
It’s taken nearly 20 years, but recent events suggest that political recourse may finally be within reach, and that frustration with Beacon Hill’s establishment is near a breaking point.  
First came last fall’s closely watched contest in Cambridge, when Democratic union leader Evan MacKay took on Rep. Marjorie Decker, a fixture in local politics, making legislative reform the cornerstone of their primary challenge. MacKay attacked Decker for repeatedly taking votes that strengthened leadership’s power over rank-and-file members, undermining the progressive values she claimed to support.  
To say Decker was favored would be an understatement: Her campaign had a four-to-one spending advantage, bolstered by a rooftop fundraiser that drew a who’s who of party insiders, including Gov. Maura Healey. Despite all that, MacKay came within 41 votes of an upset, marking the first time Decker dropped below 83 percent support as an incumbent. 
Then, in June, after mounting criticism for their slowest start in 40 years (six laws passed in six months), legislative leadership caved to rule reforms they had stonewalled for years. Public committee votes, publicly available testimony, and plain-language bill summaries may sound like basic democratic norms, but on Beacon Hill, they were fought tooth and nail. Their sudden passage was such a shock that one activist excitedly texted me: “It looks like we won on nearly everything.” 
Perhaps most telling of all, 72 percent of voters supported a ballot question last November authorizing the state auditor to audit the Legislature, an unmistakable mandate that Beacon Hill can’t police itself. Like clockwork, the Legislature brazenly ignored the result, arguing it was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.  
Let’s be clear: this argument is cover for preserving unchecked power. The auditor is an independent, voter-elected watchdog; she’s neither appointed by nor answerable to the governor. She is “executive” only in a technical, structural sense, not in any chain of command way that would trigger separation of powers concerns.  
If you’re an aspiring activist who feels waving around a “No Kings” sign falls short of impactful activism, look at state government as an avenue for change. Lobbying your state rep will do far more than mailing a postcard to Wisconsin for a judicial election. Medicare for all is likely to happen here long before Congress secures a filibuster-proof majority.  
If your rep is one of the 85 percent of House Democrats who voted with the Speaker 100 percent of the time in 2024 (full list here), ask them directly: Are they proud that their paycheck and ability to represent the district depends on their loyalty to the House speaker? Are they open to supporting new leadership and new rules that put constituents first?  
And if they shrug you off, connect with local advocacy groups and find a candidate worth backing, or consider becoming that candidate yourself. Only under the threat of losing their seats will rank-and-file members reclaim their power to oust authoritative leaders and rewrite the rules to favor voters.  
For decades, Beacon Hill has shamelessly ignored voters, because the public has never held them accountable. Mariano and Spilka weren’t shamed for helping kill affordable health care, they were rewarded. But sooner or later, enough people will learn how democracy in Massachusetts is a lie. When they do, leadership’s iron grip will crack, not because those in power wanted to change, but because voters finally forced them to.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Amid the ongoing federal government shutdown and a recent high-profile immigration arrest in Iowa, Republicans gathered Saturday to deliver a warm sendoff for U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst at her 10th annual Roast and Ride fundraiser Saturday.
Though the motorcycle ride from Big Barn Harley-Davidson to the Iowa State Fairgrounds and following pig roast is a fundraising event, Ernst herself is not running for reelection. She announced in early September she would not seek a third term in the U.S. Senate. Speaking to a crowd of 600 gathered at the Elwell Family Food Center, Ernst thanked Iowans for supporting her throughout her time in public service.
“It is my last Roast and Ride, our 10th year of doing this, and it was just a privilege to be able to wrap up in such a great way today,” Ernst told reporters.
Gov. Kim Reynolds said the final Roast and Ride was “a little bittersweet.” Reynolds, who also announced she will not run for reelection in 2026, said she and Ernst’s political careers were linked, having served in county government and in the Iowa Senate.
“Who would have guessed back then, in those local government days, that one of us would become (Iowa’s first) female United States senator in 2014, and the other would become Iowa’s first female governor in 2018,” Reynolds said.  “Not too bad for a pair of rural Iowans.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said he was “not here to roast Joni, I’m here to thank Joni for her public service and more importantly, saving me from 30 years of having a Democratic colleague” in the Senate. He asked the crowd to help him continue working with a fellow Republican by voting in the 2026 U.S. Senate election.
Shortly after Ernst’s exit from the race, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson announced she would run for the position, and quickly became the frontrunner for the GOP nomination. Hinson has received endorsements from President Donald Trump and Senate Republican leadership.
Hinson said if elected, she would work to continue Ernst’s legacy in the Senate on issues like immigration, government efficiency and supporting veterans.
“We know that in the Senate, Joni has helped pave the way for what it means to put Iowa first and put America first,” Hinson said. “These values are values that we share, and we are continuing to work together for you. … We’re going to continue to deport those criminal illegal aliens who threaten our communities. We’re going to stop China from owning our food supply. We’re going to protect veterans, continue to work on cutting taxes and protecting taxpayers and help Iowa’s working families to thrive.”
Ernst has not officially endorsed Hinson to succeed her in the Senate but told reporters, “I will tell you that she has my full support and you may hear something more official a little bit later on.”
Video remarks from Ernst’s GOP Senate colleagues including Sens. Ted Cruz, Tim Scott, Markwayne Mullin, Katie Britt, Marsha Blackburn, Rick Scott, Dave McCormick, Ted Budd, and Pete Ricketts thanking the Iowa Republican for her work in the Senate and voicing support for the Roast and Ride, were shown at the event.
There was one high-profile Republican from outside Iowa in attendance at the event: U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has collaborated with Sen. Chuck Grassley and other Iowans making requests regarding the ICE arrest and detainment of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts in late September.
DHS confirmed Roberts, who is a citizen of Guyana, had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, in addition to sharing information about his previous criminal history. Reports have also found Roberts had falsified portions of his educational background and achievements.
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who has launched an exploratory committee to run for governor in 2026, said Iowans “owe” Noem for her support in apprehending Roberts. He also linked the incident to Democratic control in the Des Moines school system.
“That is what happens when you have a liberal, progressive agenda,” Feenstra said. “In the Des Moines public school system, that school board allowed it to happen. We can never allow that to happen again.”
Noem said Trump had told her “make sure that you tell them about the individuals in Iowa that we got rid of, that have been so terrible, that have been illegal aliens that have devastated families” when she was speaking at the event. She shared cases of arresting undocumented individuals with criminal backgrounds in Iowa communities like Council Bluffs and Cherokee County.
She also talked about Roberts, celebrating his arrest and criticizing the fact that “no one did a background check on him.” Des Moines school board officials said Roberts had completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted other required documentation to show his eligibility to work in the U.S. when he was hired, and are suing JG Consulting for not providing information on Roberts’ criminal history and immigration status when he was suggested during the superintendent search process.
Noem said Roberts was “interacting with children every single day, making a six-figure salary with benefits as well, that so many people in the United States could have been benefiting from.”
“Now he’s away from your children, and he’s being brought to justice,” Noem said.
The fundraiser comes on the 11th day of the federal government shutdown. On Friday, the Trump administration began a process of mass layoffs of federal employees, a step not taken during previous government shutdowns. The shutdown is expected to continue into the coming week, as the Senate is not scheduled to return until Tuesday.
Iowa Democrats criticized Iowa’s all-Republican federal delegation for attending fundraisers like Ernst’s event while the federal government remains shuttered. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement Friday Reps. Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Zach Nunn and Feenstra “are treating this shutdown like a vacation.”
“Why can’t Iowa’s representatives show some Iowa work ethic instead of spending the weekend at Joni Ernst’s Republican fundraiser?” Hart said. “They should be working with their Republican colleagues to find a deal to open the government and prevent a spike in Iowans’ healthcare premiums. Don’t they think Iowans are paying attention?”
Nunn was not in attendance Saturday, though a video was shown at the event of him thanking Ernst for her service.
The shutdown has largely come in part as Democrats seek to extend health care premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have said not passing this extension will cost health insurance costs to spike across the country and blame the shutdown on Republicans for not agreeing to negotiate. But Trump and Republican leaders have framed the shutdown as the result of Democrats wanting to provide undocumented immigrants with government-supported health care – a claim repeated at the fundraiser.
Ernst said Republicans care about allowing people to continue having health coverage, but said there is rampant waste and fraud that needs to be addressed in the ACA system. She said the ACA is not affordable, and that GOP leaders are open to having a discussion on a “different model” for health care coverage after the shutdown ends.
“I’ve talked to a number of my Democratic colleagues about what do we do next, and how can we come to an agreement to open the government and then come up with a plan to move forward,” Ernst said. “And I know the president has been really open to that as well. So, I am hopeful we get the government open, we actually have serious talks on fraud and waste within the program, and then we actually make a difference and make healthcare affordable for those folks that truly do need that support.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ernst.Ride_.10.11.4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-11 18:57:20.290680

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Republicans in El Paso County on Saturday once again selected Second Amendment activist Ava Flanell to fill a vacant seat in the Colorado House of Representatives, after the first vacancy committee vote was invalidated by the secretary of state’s office.
Flanell won during the second round of voting with 34 votes. Joe Woyte received 30 votes. Troy Vanderhule also ran and was eliminated when he came in third place during the first round of votes.
“This position is not about me. It’s about you, about this district. It’s ensuring our community is represented with strong principles and a patriotic voice at the Capitol,” Flanell said ahead of the first vote.
Flanell will join the 22-member House Republican Caucus.
“Like many of you, I look around and see a Colorado that doesn’t resemble the one we grew up loving. This is about protecting what makes America strong and restoring what made America exceptional: faith, family and freedom and personal responsibility,” she said.
This was the second time a vacancy committee met to appoint someone to the seat. They first met on Sept. 22 and selected Flanell, but the results were not valid because the meeting did not meet the 10-day written notice requirement.
Flanell will replace former Rep. Rose Pugliese, a Republican who resigned in September after a public fallout with House majority leadership during a special session in August.
She will serve the remainder of Pugliese’s term and will need to run for reelection next year if she wants to stay in the seat.
The Legislature is set to reconvene in January.

Four were killed in downtown Leland after a high school football homecoming game in the Mississippi Delta on the state’s western edge, a state senator said Saturday.
About 20 people were injured in the gunfire after a gathering in downtown Leland following the game, state Sen. Derrick Simmons said. Of the 20 wounded, four were in critical condition and flown from a hospital in nearby Greenville to a larger medical center in the state capital of Jackson, Simmons told The Associated Press.
Simmons said he was being updated on developments by the Washington County Sheriff’s Department and other law enforcement authorities in the Delta.
“People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,” Simmons said of the town with a population of fewer than 4,000 people.
He was told that after the gunfire, the scene was “very chaotic,” as police, sheriff’s deputies and ambulances “responded from all over.”
“It’s just senseless gun violence,” he said. “What we are experiencing now is just a proliferation of guns just being in circulation.”
No arrests were immediately announced, and Simmons said late Saturday morning that he had not heard any information about possible suspects.
“They are on the ground working and I have all the faith in the world that they will get to the bottom of this,” he said.
“As the state senator for the area, we are asking any and all individuals who might have any information regarding the horrific shooting last night to come forward and provide whatever information they have,” he added.
Meanwhile, police in the small Mississippi town of Heidelberg in the eastern part of the state are investigating a shooting during that community’s homecoming weekend that left two people dead.
Both of them were killed on the school campus Friday night, Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said. He declined to say whether the victims were students or provide other information about the crimes.
“Right now we’ve still got a subject at large, but I can’t give specifics,” White said Saturday morning.
An 18-year-old man was being sought for questioning in the Heidelberg shooting, the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department football game Friday night. The town of about 640 residents is about 85 miles southeast of Jackson.
It wasn’t clear exactly when the gunfire occurred or how close it was to the stadium. White said he was at the scene Saturday investigating, and that more information might be released in coming days.

Mississippi is among them.
The dates, in late October and November, could be extended, and it is not immediately clear when the other three states will remove their troops. But the planned withdrawals signal that the surge of troops into the nation’s capital may head toward a drawdown or a change in scope.
The plans by the contributing states come as Trump takes his push to send the military to other American cities, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon, which have each pushed back with legal action to try to stop any deployment.
The National Guard was activated in D.C. in August after Trump issued an executive order proclaiming an emergency over what the Republican president said were crime concerns. The order placed the local police department under the president’s authority for 30 days and then lapsed when Congress did not renew it.
But roughly 2,300 Guard members from eight states, as well as D.C., and hundreds of federal law enforcement officers remained in the city. According to official figures, more than 4,000 people have been arrested as part of the campaign since August.
Authorities in Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia all told The Associated Press they had a planned end date for their deployments. The other states with troops in D.C. — Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota — did not respond to requests seeking information.
South Carolina, which initially sent 200 troops and now has about 40, said it plans to withdraw by the end of October, according to Maj. Karla Evans, South Carolina Guard spokesperson.
Ohio, Georgia, Mississippi and West Virginia said they planned to remove their troops by Nov. 30.
The five states together make up more than 80% of the 1,300 out-of-state troops deployed to D.C. The D.C. National Guard deployment is made up of around 1,000 forces and has had its orders extended at least through December.
Asked about the planned withdrawals, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump’s law enforcement campaign in the capital had led to a reduction in crime. “These are undeniable positive results that everyone can celebrate.”
Trump has heralded his crime-fighting campaign in the nation’s capital as a resounding success. And data shows crime has decreased during that time, although rates were already falling before. But the lingering presence of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., has raised questions about Trump’s endgame for the deployments.
The Guard troops have patrolled transit hubs and tourist sites and as the deployment has dragged on, have become a fixture of the city’s urban scenery at parks and in neighborhoods. Their presence, at times armed, has been enough to unnerve residents, although no violent incidents have been reported. They also have picked up trash and in the case of the D.C. Guard, run an initiative that has done everything from help package meals for.
The news of a planned drawdown could be a relief for some residents, who have seen the unprecedented military deployment as increasingly normalized.
“This is not normal,” said Joseph Johnson, a local elected official who chairs a neighborhood advisory commission. “We know this should never have happened in the first place.”
A lawsuit brought by D.C.’s attorney general is challenging the deployment, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office declined to comment. Bowser has said on several occasions that National Guard deployed from other states “has not been an efficient use of those resources.”
Some, however, said since the deployment was unavoidable, they tried to take advantage of it, especially with the D.C. Guard members running an initiative that has included cleaning neighborhoods and removing graffiti, as well as working with local food banks to package food and helping to revitalize a recreation center.
“They have no guns. They have no rifles, and they are truly doing what we have asked them to do to come and be a part of our community clean up,” Johnson said.
His fellow neighborhood advisory commissioner, Marcus Hickman, welcomed the additional help when the D.C. Guard emailed commissioners and asked if there were any needs. It allowed community members to work side by side with the guard members. Other plans are in the works, including the D.C. Guard joining in a school reading program, he said.
“When someone offers to come and help you clean your house, there is something to be said. A cleaner community is often a safer community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10132923/AP25282690330683.jpg,,,2025-10-11 14:02:11.717941

$17.5M OneWorld building marks milestone in $235M South and North Omaha state grant program 

When completed, the new three-story health care workforce training center will be the fourth structure at the historic Livestock Exchange stockyards campus in South Omaha, which OneWorld calls home.
The 29,000-square-foot facility is funded in part with $9.5 million from the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. In addition to worker development programs, it will house a child development center and micro-unit for epidemic or pandemic responses.
“This new space will allow us to expand behavioral health services and invest in workforce development, ensuring that healing and growth are further built into the framework of our community,” said Andrea Skolkin, OneWorld CEO.
Work on the facility will continue through next year, and services are expected to launch in early 2027.
Thursday’s event, which drew numerous community supporters and city and state officials to the site, is known as a topping out ceremony in the construction world. As per tradition, people sign their name or leave a personal message on the building’s last and highest structural beam before it is lifted into place. The occasion celebrates completion of framing and symbolizes collective achievement and connects supporters to the cause.

Established in 1970, OneWorld is a federally qualified health center that provides quality and affordable primary, mental, substance abuse and dental care for more than 50,000 patients each year at 20 clinical locations in Omaha, Bellevue and Plattsmouth. The network serves families and individuals without regard to insurance status or ability to pay. 
Canopy South, a nonprofit based in South Omaha, played a critical role in securing and managing the public grant for the project, called the OneWorld Health Care Workforce Development Center.
“By bringing critical health services and workforce opportunities into the heart of South Omaha, we’re not only honoring the history of this campus, we’re shaping a future where every resident has a chance to thrive,” said César García, Canopy South’s executive director.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has pledged to pay $217 of his own money to keep Mount Rushmore lit for the next week.
Rhoden’s Saturday morning announcement came in tandem with pledges from West River lawmakers to personally pay the national memorial’s nightly lighting ceremony bills. Rhoden pledged to cover seven nights. Various lawmakers and one private citizen have made pledges to pay the daily bill after Rhoden if the shutdown continues.
The nightly light bill is $30.94, Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms told South Dakota Searchlight.
‘Substantial’ layoffs of federal workers launched by Trump administration amid shutdown

The memorial has remained open during the shutdown, but South Dakota’s Travel SD website notes that the lighting ceremony is “temporarily unavailable.” The visitor center is also closed and ranger talks are temporarily unavailable.
The promise to pay Rushmore’s light bills is the latest in a series of statements from the Republican governor aimed at pressuring Congressional Democrats to fold and pass the funding bill supported by the body’s GOP majority.
Since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Democrats have pushed their Republican counterparts to negotiate on extensions for expiring health care subsidies before supporting a funding bill. Rhoden is among the Republican governors that signed on to a letter Thursday urging Democrats to give in and pass a funding bill. 
On Sept. 30, Rhoden signed a statement from a group called the Governors Council of the America First Policy Institute urging both sides to find a way to avoid the shutdown that came hours later. 
This week on social media, Rhoden used the term “Schumer Shutdown,” a reference to the Senate’s Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York. Daily news releases from Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, use the term in their subject lines.
Rhoden’s news release on the lights at Mount Rushmore says the payments were facilitated by the nonprofit Mount Rushmore Society through its partnership with the National Park Service.
It also says Rhoden “has received many other pledges to support shining the lights if the shutdown continues longer.”

Larry Rhoden. Hansen and Doeden are running for governor next year. Rhoden has not yet announced whether he'll be a candidate. (Photo illustration by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)After multiple Republican candidates for governor advocated firing university professors recently for personal social media posts, one of those professors says South Dakota politics is sliding down a “dangerous path.”
“They’re trying to limit what universities can offer, what faculty members can teach, what we can say in the classroom, and now, apparently, outside of it,” said Timothy Schorn, an associate professor of political science and director of the University of South Dakota’s international studies program.
After the Sept. 10 fatal shooting of political activist and commentator Charlie Kirk, some Republican officials nationwide encouraged Americans to report people who criticized Kirk. Schorn is one of the people who has received scrutiny.
South Dakota university drops effort to fire professor for Charlie Kirk post

On the evening of Sept. 12, Schorn published a more than 700-word criticism of Kirk to a personal Facebook account. The post included criticism of Kirk’s views on race, guns, religion and more.
On Sept. 30, Republican gubernatorial candidate Toby Doeden, of Aberdeen, published a social media post calling attention to Schorn’s writings and accusing him of  “indoctrination and radicalization of our young people.”
“Under my leadership,” Doeden wrote, people like Schorn “will have no place in the classroom!”
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Doeden said taxpayers should not fund Schorn’s views.
“This is about taxpayers’ money, plain and simple,” Doeden said. “If Mr. Schorn wants to open a business with his own money and speak this way, that is his right as an American.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, another Republican running for governor, has not called for firings in reaction to comments about Kirk. He told South Dakota Searchlight that he has disagreed with many of Schorn’s comments.
“It’s important to remember, though, that stupid comments from professors are generally protected by the First Amendment when issued as private citizens, rather than state employees,” Johnson said.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden has not yet said whether he’ll be a candidate to keep his job next year. He declined to comment about Schorn, but a spokesperson said Rhoden “takes open and civil discourse on our college campuses very seriously.”
Rhoden was previously involved in another controversy about statements by a university professor.
In a post to a personal social media account within hours of Kirk’s death, University of South Dakota art professor Michael Hook used profanity and derogatory terms to describe Kirk while questioning the veracity of Kirk supporters’ concerns about political violence.
Two days later, candidate for governor and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, posted to social media about Hook.
“I immediately reached out to USD President Sheila Gestring and called on the professor to be fired,” Hansen wrote.

Two hours after Hansen posted that, Rhoden posted to social media that “the Board of Regents intends to FIRE this University of South Dakota professor, and I’m glad.”
“We must not send the message to our kids that this is acceptable public discourse. We need more Charlie Kirks on campus and less hatred like this,” Rhoden wrote.
The state Board of Regents and the university placed Hook on administrative leave with an intent to fire him. He sued, and a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 24, requiring the university to reinstate him pending further proceedings in the case.
The judge found that Hook had spoken as a citizen on a matter of public concern, which is a form of constitutionally protected speech; that the state failed to produce evidence that his speech had an adverse impact on the efficiency of university operations; and that Hook had a fair chance of prevailing in his lawsuit by showing the actions taken against him were a form of retaliation that could chill protected speech.
On Oct. 3, Hook’s attorney released a letter from USD President Sheila Gestring informing Hook he would no longer be fired.
“We have taken into consideration your remorse for the post, your past record of service, and the university’s interest in efficient operations,” the letter said.
Hook issued a statement that said in part, “I hope the state now understands that the First Amendment prohibits it from punishing anyone for speech about public issues — no matter how much state or national leaders or others disagree with it.”
Schorn, who studies authoritarian governments and human rights, said he views the threats of termination as part of a broader, national effort to chill speech and control thought.
“If universities can’t tolerate uncomfortable ideas, then we’re no longer educating, we’re indoctrinating,” Schorn said. “And that’s exactly what these politicians claim to oppose.”

Photo by TimothyJ via FlickrA proposed south Georgia chicken plant that could be the state’s largest poultry operation is on hold after a Coffee County judge found it would likely harm locals’ health and property values and damage the nearby Satilla River.
The proposal called for 60 chicken houses, each holding more than 25,000 birds, which are projected to produce at least 40,000 pounds of litter roughly every eight weeks – about how long they will be on site – and up to 450,000 carcasses on the site per year. 
“According to Defendants, this waste, including dead carcasses, will be periodically hauled off site but will sit in the houses for months before being sold,” wrote Coffee County Superior Court Judge J. Kelly Brooks in his order halting the project while a legal trial continues. “Defendants could not name the hauler or describe the method or frequency of disposal in any manner. Nor could they identify any odor or dust suppression methods to be employed.”
The plaintiffs, a group of landowners near the proposed site, had a variety of reasons for not wanting the operation to start up, mostly having to do with not wanting to be exposed to chicken feces, rotting bird corpses and bacterial runoff.
One local farm owner testified that she and one of her grandchildren are severe asthmatics and she worries about the effects of breathing in particulates from the plant.
Former GOP state Rep. Chuck Sims, representing his company, Sims Funeral Home, testified that he “does not want attendees to be bombarded with pathogen-laden dust and the smell of chicken feces and corpses as they are mourning.”
Other testimony indicated that the project could harm the Satilla River for miles, and potentially all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, and that property owners could see the value of their land drop by up to 30%. 
Brooks also criticized defendants for not making any attempts to contact neighbors or engage with the community about the project.
“The evidence clearly showed that Defendants pursued this project quietly and avoided community engagement until forced to respond through these proceedings,” Brooks wrote.
“The court is not without empathy for potential financial injury to Defendants,” he added. “However, such injury is largely self-inflicted.”
George Lott, an attorney with Atlanta-based Evans Bowers representing the plaintiffs, said a grassroots effort helped bring the project to light.
“Our clients had no idea that this was going forward until the project was already several weeks or several months in the works,” he said. “And it’s almost hard to describe all the efforts they’ve made to try to get information. They held town hall meetings, they contacted county commissioners, they contacted other government regulators, entities, to try to figure out what’s being proposed, who was proposing it, what work was going to be done, and then they even tried to contact some of the defendants directly and couldn’t make any progress. And so they really didn’t know the full scope until right before we filed the lawsuit, I think.”
Kasey Sturm, an attorney with the law firm Weissman representing the defendants, said that’s not accurate.
“I don’t think that’s a fair characterization,” she said. “The property is zoned agricultural. It has widely been acknowledged that chicken farming is an acceptable practice in agricultural land. And again, these family farmers obtained the requisite authority both from the state and from the county to construct and operate chicken houses on their respective farms.”
Sturm also rejected the characterization of the project as the largest poultry operation in the state.
“This is five separate farms, each with 12 houses, which is common and consistent with poultry across the state, consistent with what you see in Coffee County,” she said. “Coffee County is number 15 as far as counties in the state of Georgia for poultry production; this is a very common occurrence in Coffee County.”
Brooks’ order puts the project on hold until the court holds a final trial. Lott said it’s still too early to guess how long that could take.
“Every court is different. Sometimes it’s a matter of months. Sometimes it takes years to get to the final trial. So it’s hard to predict the timing of all of this, but in the interim, until the court holds a final hearing, there is an injunction that prevents further construction on site.”
Sturm said the farmers are evaluating their options and are concerned the ruling could discourage poultry businesses from coming to Georgia.
“We’re disappointed with the ruling,” she said. “We believe it’s contrary to the evidence that was presented at the hearing. The ruling has somewhat of a chilling effect on the marketability of title in the state of Georgia, such that farmers now need to look at when they go and sell property, are they going to be hauled into court for the potential future use of that property by somebody they sell it to? That’s a concern.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderVoting rights advocates in Meriwether County have filed a lawsuit challenging the districts drawn for local county commission seats, which they say illegally dilute the voting power of Black residents under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court Thursday, alleges that district maps enacted in 2022 have contributed to the lack of Black representation on the board of commissioners, despite the fact that Black voters make up “a substantial percentage” of the county’s population. The Georgia NAACP, which according to the lawsuit has roughly 100 members who reside in the county, is one of the plaintiffs.
“We will not stand by and watch Black voters in Georgia be stripped of their right to fair representation,” Georgia NAACP President Gerald Griggs said in a statement, calling the maps “a direct attack on this community’s political power.”
Meriwether County is located about 50 miles south of Atlanta. Its five-member board of commissioners, which is tasked with adopting county policies, establishing a budget and maintaining roads, bridges and other infrastructure, is currently all white.
Hani Mirza, who serves as director of the power and democracy program at Advancement Project, a civil rights organization involved with the case, said the new maps have “had an immediate impact on Black representation at the county level in Meriwether County.” 
The new maps, the lawsuit says, were adopted over the objections of the county’s then-only Black commissioner, who is no longer in office. 
In one district, Black representation has hovered around 50% before and after redistricting, but in another, the Black voting age population decreased from about 45% to less than 30%. None of the three Black candidates who have run for a county commission since the new maps took effect have been successful, according to the lawsuit. 
One remedy proposed in the complaint would redraw the maps to create two new Black-majority districts for the county commission. One district would span the north and central parts of the county, including towns like Greenville, Woodbury and Lone Oak, while the other would include southern Meriwether County areas like Manchester and Warm Springs.
Rev. James Clements, a Black Meriwether County resident and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said that the board of commissioners once included two Black members, and described the hopelessness members of the Black community feel as a result of the loss of representation on the commission.
Now some Black residents he’s talked to, Clements said in an interview with the Recorder, “don’t feel the need to even go to a commissioner meeting, because they don’t feel that their voice is going to be heard.”
Clements ran as a Democrat for a seat on the commission last year, losing to the Republican candidate by only 12 votes. But he says his involvement in the lawsuit “has nothing to do with” his own candidacy.
If a white candidate wins in a majority-minority district, “that’s because they’re the better candidate,” he said. “But we’d just like the opportunity to be able to be represented at the board of commissioners’ office.”
Meriwether Board of Elections and Election Supervisor Patty Threadgill did not respond to requests for comment.
However, the voting rights law that the lawsuit hinges on may itself be on shaky ground. Next week, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to rehear arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case filed by white voters in Louisiana challenging the 2024 congressional district maps that included two Black-majority districts. Voting rights advocates say the Supreme Court’s ruling has the potential to overturn a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial gerrymandering that dilutes minority voting power.
Mirza with the Advancement Project said he is monitoring the Supreme Court case.
“We’re, like others, watching to see what happens and will respond accordingly,” Mirza said.

Reporting Highlights

Serious Charge: Drivers are rarely charged with murder in fatal car crashes unless they have aggravating factors — such as past DUIs or excessive speed.
Uncommon Plea Deal: Unlike most people facing these charges in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, this defendant was not offered a plea deal for a lesser charge.
Unusual Suspect: Years after the crash, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on why it went so differently than similar cases — and what they believe was bias.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

When 19-year-old Jorge Ruiz walked into the Autauga County Jail in handcuffs on Oct. 28, 2018, he wasn’t a typical suspect. He was out of place and in big trouble in a deeply conservative part of Alabama.
That morning, he’d been driving about 70 miles per hour in a 55 zone when he crossed the center line of a two-lane rural highway. His Ford pickup collided head-on with a Honda Civic, killing the woman behind the wheel. Paramedics took Ruiz to the hospital, where a blood test found a trace amount of alcohol. At just 0.016, it was below the legal threshold for intoxication.
But rather than charging him with manslaughter, which typically would be the most extreme charge brought under the circumstances, police went further. They arrested him for murder.

To support such a murder charge, prosecutors are supposed to show that a defendant’s conduct displays “extreme indifference” — behavior so reckless that someone is likely to die, as when a person fires a gun into a crowd or steers a boat into a group of swimmers. Suspects charged with murder after car crashes often are documented to have blood alcohol levels more than twice the legal limit and 10 times the level found in Ruiz’s blood, according to a review of Alabama cases from the last 20 years by ProPublica. Many others had prior DUIs or were driving 100 miles per hour or more. In this case, the suspect had a clean criminal history and wasn’t even going fast enough to be ticketed for aggravated speeding.
Ruiz’s trial attorney said that as soon as he started talking to the district attorney’s office, the case felt different. Across the three counties in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, only a handful of people have been charged with murder for a car accident in the span of a decade — and most wound up taking a plea deal for a lesser charge.
But this time around, the prosecutor’s offer could hardly be considered a deal at all: The teenager would have to plead guilty to murder, and it would be blind plea, meaning he would have to hope for mercy from the court in his sentencing. “In my 30 years of practicing law, I have never been offered a deal like that,” Ruiz’s court-appointed lawyer, Richard Lively, said.
The lead prosecutor eventually budged, but only a little. He wouldn’t reduce the charge, but he would recommend that the teenager spend 30 years in prison.
That’s longer than any other sentence handed down since at least 2004 for a car crash fatality in Alabama’s 19th Circuit Court, which includes Autauga, Chilton and Elmore counties. A man who fled the scene of a fatal crash — and had a 0.09 blood alcohol level nine hours later — received a 15-year sentence in 2017. A woman who had three times the legal limit of alcohol in her system received 23 years in 2007 after she killed a University of Alabama student.
For defendants who were teenagers when they caused fatal car accidents, the courts can be even more lenient. In 2012, a Madison County judge granted youthful offender status to a man who was 19 when he was charged with murder for a drunk driving crash that killed a high school sophomore in Huntsville. The driver, who had a blood alcohol level of 0.15, was sentenced to a year in jail and two on probation.
Lively had a hard time squaring his client’s charges with the results of his blood test and recorded speed. Alabama’s murder statute does not require a driver to be legally intoxicated, and people have faced murder charges for killing someone by racing or fleeing police. But neither applied here. Lively reasoned that for murder to fit, the teenager would have had to be intentionally driving into oncoming traffic.
He thought his client could beat the charge and told him not to plead guilty. Years later, attorneys involved in the case would attempt to shed light on what was so different about it — and on one fact in particular that they believed eclipsed all the others.
He was a Mexican immigrant.
The case against Ruiz was, as one legal expert put it, “a perfect storm of horrible facts.”
The night before the accident, he stayed up late after drinking at a music festival in Birmingham. At the scene of the crash, police found beer cans in his truck. He was in the country on a temporary work visa and did not have a driver’s license. He spoke little English, relying on his 17-year-old cousin to translate his Miranda rights and the string of questions from police.
The only reason Ruiz was in Autauga County was to visit his extended family after finishing a monthslong job in Georgia and South Carolina clearing brush from power lines. He was days away from returning to Mexico.
The woman he killed was named Marlena Hayes. She was a 29-year-old nurse who’d just finished the night shift at Prattville Baptist Hospital. She wasn’t even supposed to be working at that time. She’d planned to see her brother perform that weekend with the marching band at the University of West Alabama. In the end, though, she took the shift as a favor to a colleague.

Newspapers and TV stations in central Alabama quickly picked up the story. Some referred to Ruiz as an illegal immigrant even though he’d been in the U.S. on a six-month H-2B visa, which are approved when employers can’t find enough American workers. One of those articles appeared in the Montgomery Advertiser, the largest newspaper in the area.
When Lively was assigned to the case, he felt compelled to show that his client had been in the U.S. legally. Ruiz’s visa had only lapsed when he was in jail. Lively tracked down the Montgomery Advertiser reporter at the Autauga County courthouse to show him that Ruiz’s visa had been valid when he was arrested. But even after that, the newspaper failed to acknowledge that he was in the country legally at the time of the crash. “The Montgomery Advertiser stands behind our reporting,” the newspaper said in a statement released through its parent company, Gannett.
In the years leading up to Ruiz’s arrest, Alabama had established itself as a particularly unwelcoming place for foreigners. In 2011, then-Gov. Robert Bentley signed a bill that criminalized everyday activities like transporting, employing and renting homes to undocumented immigrants.
At the time, historians and legal experts worried the law could usher in a new era of racial injustice similar to Jim Crow that would be enforced by the police and courts. But the impact of the immigration law remains largely unknown because Alabama prisons don’t collect ethnicity data and therefore don’t know how many inmates are Hispanic. In 2013, the state agreed not to enforce most of the provisions as part of a lawsuit.
“The HB 56 legislation brought nativism and xenophobia into the political mainstream in Alabama” wrote historian Raymond Mohl. At the height of the debate over the law, a congressman from north Alabama said that to prevent illegal immigration to the state, he would do “anything short of shooting them.”
Back then, those harsh policies made Alabama an outlier. But with the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, the state’s positions started going mainstream. Alabama even supplied one of the foremost architects of Trump’s first-term immigration policy: U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, a fierce champion of border crackdowns, was tapped to be Trump’s attorney general.
Ruiz was arrested nearly two years into Trump’s first term. At the time, Alabama was growing more red even as a blue wave nationally elected dozens of Democrats to Congress. In Alabama, Republicans swept statewide office that year and expanded their majority in the Legislature.
Some members of Ruiz’s extended family had started moving to Alabama from Mexico nearly 15 years earlier and stayed in the area even after the political winds turned against them. Sandra Ruiz, his 17-year-old cousin, moved from Texas to Autauga County at age 2 and had lived near Prattville, a suburb of Montgomery, nearly all her life. She knew that some of her neighbors could be ignorant of, or even hostile to, people from Mexico. She and her family were afraid for Jorge Ruiz when he was arrested and followed the police to the station. Investigators allowed the high school senior to translate their questions and Ruiz’s responses.
A judge granted Ruiz bond in March 2019, four months after he was jailed. Ruiz’s family members in Alabama sold tamales and organized a raffle of an ornate belt buckle to raise funds for bail. They posted the money to free him.
And they began to wait.
In the weeks and months leading up to Ruiz’s trial, Judge Bill Lewis made several decisions that, according to Ruiz’s lawyer, put his client at a disadvantage.
One of the first things Lewis did was revoke Ruiz’s bond. Because of a technicality, Ruiz’s family never recovered the $5,000 they’d paid to get him out of jail. The news coverage that followed the decision sparked intense, and often misinformed, debate online about the case, and Lively worried that bias would affect potential jurors. Not long after Ruiz’s bond was revoked, the judge got a letter in the mail from a local resident. The writer thanked him and asked Lewis to “do everything in your power to get justice for Marlena.” The letter went on to describe Ruiz as “in this country illegally” and “operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol.”
About a week later, Lewis denied Ruiz’s application for youthful offender status. That meant he would not be eligible for a sentence capped at three years. Lewis did not respond to a list of questions from ProPublica, including one about not granting Ruiz youthful offender status.
But as the trial neared, Lewis took several steps to attempt to keep bias out of the courtroom. He gave special instructions to the prosecution and the defense, barring any mention of Ruiz’s immigration status and directing attorneys involved in the case to call him “George.”
The judge’s efforts couldn’t erase the obvious difference between Ruiz and almost everyone else in the courtroom: the language barrier. “Longtime courthouse observers don’t recall a case in Prattville where an interpreter was used at trial,” the Montgomery Advertiser reported.
The district attorney had charged Ruiz under the reckless murder section of the statute, reserved for offenders who unintentionally cause a death. Courts have found that driving without a license, a misdemeanor that in Alabama carries a fine of $10 to $100, doesn’t constitute underlying recklessness for charges like manslaughter or murder. Prosecutors only briefly brought up at Ruiz’s trial that he did not have a license. What made the case amount to murder, the prosecutor said throughout the case, was that Ruiz was both speeding and had crossed the center line.
Ruiz’s use of alcohol also played a central role in the trial, even though he hadn’t been charged with DUI — and even though the prosecutors conceded that the evidence didn’t support that charge. A toxicologist testified that almost four hours had passed between the crash and the blood test at the hospital. He said the average elimination rate for alcohol is 0.015 percentage points an hour. That testimony suggested Ruiz’s blood alcohol level would have been higher than 0.07 at the time of the accident.
If the prosecutors could scientifically confirm that figure, it would have been enough to charge Ruiz with DUI because the legal intoxication threshold is lower for underage drivers. But such estimates have been described as unreliable by some scientists and legal experts, with one calling them no better than a “wild guess.” Some states have imposed higher bars than Alabama for the admission of such evidence, and at least one, Massachusetts, doesn’t allow it at all if the blood alcohol reading was, like Ruiz’s, below 0.03.
Lively produced no expert to dispute the toxicologist. In fact, he called only one witness, Ruiz’s date the night of the festival, who testified that Ruiz rode with her to her apartment after the festival, at around 1:30 a.m., and slept on the couch until he left at around 5 a.m.
Lively said in his closing argument that the evidence failed to show that Ruiz’s behavior was so brazenly dangerous that it amounted to murder.
“This was a person who was driving home and fell asleep behind the wheel,” Lively said.
Then-Chief Assistant District Attorney C.J. Robinson said there was no evidence Ruiz fell asleep. “In Alabama, we recognize that you can do something so dangerous that it could kill somebody, and you should realize what you’re doing is that dangerous,” he said during closing arguments. “I submit to you that anyone’s life was in danger, and therefore it was reckless murder.”
Jurors were instructed that, as an alternative to murder, they also could consider the lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide. They deliberated for less than an hour.
The foreman announced guilty verdicts on three counts: minor in possession of alcohol, driving without a license and murder.
Three weeks later, everyone gathered again for the sentencing. Robinson invited members of Hayes’ family to speak about their loss.
The family, along with friends, had come to every hearing. Hayes’ mother, Laura Liveoak, had spoken out on social media about her grief, describing how her daughter had texted her right before she left work that morning, asking what the weather was like. Liveoak said in a Facebook video: “It’s hard to be the parent of a victim, knowing that she’ll never be a mother. I’ll never be a grandmother to the sweet little redheaded kids that she probably would have had.” She declined to comment for this story.
Liveoak told the judge how much her daughter loved being a nurse: so much that she spent some of her days off visiting patients. She’d recently bought a house in a nearby town, Deatsville, and adopted two German shepherds who became the center of her world. She’d texted her mom right before she left work that morning. Her last message was about her dogs.

Then it was Ruiz’s turn. He spoke for the first time in court.
“I want to say that I am sorry to the family,” Ruiz said. “I wouldn’t have wished for this to happen. I wish that this would have only been a dream.”
Lewis peered down from the bench at Ruiz.
“This is America,” Lewis said. “It’s the greatest country in the world and we have the right to trial in this country. I would never penalize you for exercising that right, but Mr. Lively talked about acceptance of responsibility, contrition, remorse. I haven’t seen any of that from you.”
He sentenced Ruiz to the maximum possible punishment, longer even than the 50 years requested by prosecutors: 99 years.
The court went quiet. Even the prosecutor was shocked.
Years later, Robinson remembered that moment. “That was not something that I had expected,” he said.
In 2023, four years after the sentencing, a human rights lawyer from Mexico reached out to the Southern Center for Human Rights, a nonprofit law center in Atlanta that focuses on criminal justice. He let them know that the Mexican Consulate had been following Ruiz’s case from the time he was arrested through the slow-moving appeals process. His 99-year sentence had shocked them, and they wanted to find a lawyer in the U.S. who could steer the increasingly complicated appeal.
Ruiz’s family had cobbled together money for a private attorney, who filed motions to challenge his conviction and sentence. But they had run out of funds. Ruiz was preparing to represent himself when the attorneys from the center stepped in.
“I was like, ‘We need to help this kid,’” SCHR attorney Paulina Lucio-Maymon said. “Otherwise, he’s just gonna end up forgotten by the system.”
The Mexican Consulate connected Lucio-Maymon and her colleague Michael Admirand with family from Prattville, who in turn connected the attorneys with family in Ruiz’s hometown, José María Pino Suárez, in the Mexican state of Durango. Many in the small community knew Ruiz. As a young boy, he had helped his grandfather work a shared plot of farmland and manage his livestock. He dropped out after middle school to support his family and got his visa to come to the U.S. in the spring of 2018. He needed to make more money after his mother’s unexpected death.
“He was always trying to make sure everyone was taken care of,” said his cousin, Sandra Ruiz.
In the U.S., he was part of an all-immigrant crew of temporary visa workers employed by a contractor for the power company. The team trudged through Georgia and South Carolina backcountry, their feet snagging on roots and vines as they cleared vegetation from power lines. They often walked for 10 to 12 hours a day while carrying heavy canisters of weed-killing chemicals, and Ruiz suffered heat stroke twice, one of Ruiz’s fellow workers testified in an appeal hearing. Workers wore out their shoes every eight days, the worker said.

Ruiz wanted to spend his last few weeks in the U.S. visiting family in Prattville before returning to Mexico. He missed his daughter, Noeli, and had begun making plans for her third birthday.
None of that history had been presented at his sentencing hearing. His attorney also failed to highlight his clean criminal record in Mexico.
In September 2019, less than a month after he handed down that 99-year sentence, Lewis had issued an unusual order. He removed Lively from the case despite there being no motion seeking his removal. Lewis determined Ruiz had received inadequate representation.
Lewis cited an offhand comment Lively made at the sentencing hearing. In response to the judge admonishing Ruiz for not being contrite, Lively told the judge that the decision to take Ruiz’s case to trial “may be more of a reflection of my bad advice to him than his own acceptance of responsibility.” Lewis wrote that he saw that as an admission that Lively was questioning his own representation of Ruiz. (Lively later told ProPublica he was trying to “deflect some of Judge Lewis’ criticism of Jorge onto me” and lamented how “that one sentence has been used as a cudgel against me and a tool to scapegoat me in this case.”)
In the hearings and filings that followed, Lewis continued to express concerns about the information that had not been presented at trial or sentencing.
“The Court, when rendering a sentence in this case should have as much information as possible,” Lewis wrote in a more recent order. “Mr. Lively failed to provide any, despite having access to many different sources of information that could have affected the Defendant’s sentence.”
Lively did provide some evidence at Ruiz’s sentencing, calling his aunt and cousin to testify. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals later rejected a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him.
In a statement to ProPublica, Lively wrote that he believed he competently defended Ruiz. He said that he only called one trial witness because he felt the state had not proven his client’s guilt. He pointed to the state’s experts, who testified that Ruiz had a very low level of alcohol in his system and drifted slowly into oncoming traffic, which, according to Lively, showed Ruiz did not intentionally jerk the car across the center line. “The most powerful witness is one that is called by the opposition who proves your case,” Lively wrote.
He also described the case as “the most traumatic” he’s encountered in his 30 years as an attorney. “I have made the law my life’s work, and Jorge’s case caused me to question almost everything I believed about the legal system,” he wrote.
When Lucio-Maymon and Admirand first took on Ruiz’s case, they appealed both his murder conviction and his 99-year sentence. Lewis rejected their challenge of Ruiz’s conviction but agreed the sentence deserved another look.
To make their case for a shorter sentence, Ruiz’s attorneys compiled information about other fatal car crash cases. His former attorneys had appealed his conviction to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and lost. The one notable dissent on the panel of judges was penned by Republican Judge J. William Cole, who wrote that the facts did not support a murder conviction.
“Ruiz had consumed alcohol before the accident, but he was not determined to be legally intoxicated, nor was he charged with driving under the influence of alcohol,” Cole wrote. “Although he crossed to the wrong side of the road, there was no evidence that he was racing or driving in a grossly wanton manner.”
Admirand and Lucio-Maymon looked at the four cases cited in the decision to uphold his conviction. The drivers in those cases had blood alcohol levels that ranged from 0.16 to 0.3 — from double to nearly quadruple the level of criminal intoxication. Their sentences ranged from 12 to 25 years in prison.
The attorneys created a simple graph that compared those sentences and blood alcohol levels. Although Ruiz had the lowest amount of alcohol in his system, his sentence was by far the longest.
After Lewis granted a new sentencing hearing, Admirand and Lucio-Maymon felt hopeful. That disparity — along with testimony from Ruiz’s friends and family in Mexico — could help sway the judge toward mercy, they believed. They said they even started talking with the district attorney’s office with the goal of making a deal, though Robinson said he remembered those conversations differently. He recalled that he agreed to listen to evidence about Ruiz’s background but wouldn’t consider reducing the charge and would be hard-pressed to recommend less than 50 years.
“They did initially express some openness to discussion in this case,” Admirand said. “And then something changed.”
Although Lewis had presided over Ruiz’s trial and granted him a resentencing hearing, he was not behind the bench when Ruiz was set to be resentenced in 2024. By then, Lewis had been appointed to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals.
The case was transferred to Sibley Reynolds, who had retired from the bench but still took cases as needed. When Admirand and Lucio-Maymon arrived early on Aug. 14, 2024, to prepare, they found the judge sitting in the courtroom, paging through a purple binder they had never seen before. It contained pictures of Hayes and letters from friends, family members and even a few local officials.
Each of the dozens of letters urged the judge to uphold Ruiz’s 99-year sentence. Prosecutors asked the judge for 50 years. Lucio-Maymon and Admirand, citing several sentences from cases across the 19th Circuit Court, were seeking 10 years.
Admirand said he watched as Reynolds carried the binder with him to the bench. The hearing he oversaw was short but eventful. At one point, Ruiz addressed Hayes’ family.
“I am profoundly sorry for having caused you this pain,” he said. “I want to say I’m sorry or forgive me, the way I have asked God to do every day during the almost six years.”
Admirand presented all the evidence he believed had been missing from Ruiz’s first sentencing hearing in 2019. He told the judge about the cases they had found in the same judicial district with sentences that ranged from one to 25 years. And he presented mitigating factors — witnesses who testified about Ruiz’s character and work ethic.
His attorneys also played a series of videos of family members in Mexico, accompanied by dramatic music.
When Robinson, who had been elected district attorney in 2022, started to make his argument against Ruiz, he invoked a patriotic anthem as a sort of rebuttal. He said the victim’s family was ready to move on and that he was going to make a case for them “courtesy of the red, white and blue.”
It was a reference to the title of the Toby Keith song “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue,” which includes lyrics like, “We’ll put a boot in your ass, it’s the American way.” Robinson would later tell ProPublica the comment was taken out of context and was meant as a critique of the music in the video, which he described as “manipulative.”
Shortly after, Hayes’ mother asked the judge to uphold the original sentence.
“I’m asking for the 99 years that Judge Lewis saw fit to give,” she said. “Marlena’s life is worth that and so much more.”
At the end of the hearing, the judge announced his decision: He would reduce Ruiz’s sentence to 50 years.
He didn’t offer an explanation for why he chose what’s still an unusually long sentence. Admirand suspected the reason might be found in the purple binder. He objected to the judge considering it without the defense having seen it. He then asked for a copy of the material.
“I mean, it’s literally letters from the victim’s family,” said Assistant District Attorney Mandy Johnson in response to the objection.
When Admirand read it right after the hearing, he found much more than that, including notes from local public officials and incorrect information about the case. He said that, more alarmingly, there were letters that included language he considered biased. One letter said that if Ruiz was released early and deported, he would surely return to the U.S.
“He will again commit crimes,” the letter said. “He will again be a draw on our judicial system and society itself. He will once again be an unnecessary threat to all our lives, including yours.”
“Fry him!” demanded another one.

The binder presented an opportunity to challenge what Admirand had come to believe was an underlying bias that permeated the case from the first moments after the crash, when a state trooper threatened to take Ruiz to jail if he did not speak English. In September 2024, he and Lucio-Maymon filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the letters contained improper references to Ruiz’s nationality, including racially derogatory claims. In February, the Mexican Consulate filed an amicus brief in support of the appeal, only the second time in five years it has done that in a criminal case in the United States.
“Ruiz’s equal protection rights were violated from the moment this prosecution began,” the appeal said. “From his earliest interactions with law enforcement through the resentencing proceedings, Ruiz was treated more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race. The Court should remedy this injustice.”
In June, Ruiz’s attorneys identified another 17 car crash cases over 15 years that were heard in the 19th Circuit Court. Most defendants received sentences of less than 15 years in prison, even in cases involving multiple fatalities or high blood alcohol levels. Only one, Ruiz, had a sentence longer than 25 years. Robinson argued those cases were different, though not because of the defendant’s race. Defendants in most of them had accepted plea deals. He did not acknowledge that all of those plea deals were more lenient than the one offered to Ruiz.
Lewis did not respond to questions, including ones about alleged bias in the case. In response to ProPublica’s questions, Robinson wrote that neither he nor the district attorney’s office “treated Jorge Ruiz more harshly than other similarly situated defendants because of his race.”
Though the district attorney’s office did not charge Ruiz with DUI, Robinson wrote that alcohol “was illegally consumed at a rate much higher than legally permissible for Ruiz to be operating a vehicle.” He also wrote, “I do not assess cases using a least common denominator approach. I do my best to evaluate them based on a totality of the circumstances approach.”
In August, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals asked for more information from Reynolds about his reasoning behind the 50-year sentence. Admirand and Lucio-Maymon have asked the court to take Reynolds off the case, arguing that he improperly reviewed the purple binder material. Reynolds did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.
Hayes’ family members have been outspoken about their loss. At every hearing, they tick off the milestones Hayes has missed. Her brother’s graduation. Her sister’s wedding. The births of nieces and nephews.
Ruiz’s family members are quietly marking off their own list. His daughter’s kindergarten graduation, her First Communion. The 9-year-old still doesn’t quite comprehend where he has gone.
Ruiz has learned a little English but still struggles with the language. He said through his attorneys that he’s never been able to adequately convey how bad he feels about the accident. It’s not just the language barrier, but also that his role in Hayes’ death left him so distraught that he felt like “my life didn’t matter anymore.”
Still, the hearing last year that reduced his sentence kindled some optimism. He said that when he first faced the prospect of 99 years behind bars, the only thing he could think about was never seeing his daughter again. After the hearing, his outlook changed.
“That gave me back hope that one day I’ll be able to see my family again,” Ruiz said.

Dubbed by fans and peers as the King of Reality TV, the Detroit-born producer has built franchises that travel beyond the coasts. His “Love & Marriage” franchise has turned Huntsville, Alabama, Detroit and Washington into must-see television along with “Family Empire: Houston.” His other hit “Belle Collective” put Jackson, Mississippi, on the cultural map and returned with a new season this month on OWN.
As a former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” producer, King is showing that compelling stories thrive wherever real people live, love and grind. Through his company, Kingdom Reign Entertainment, he says more than 60% of OWN’s original programming carries his imprint, crediting the network’s top executives such as Oprah Winfrey, Tina Perry and Drew Tappon for backing his vision.
Beyond television, King has expanded his reach with the popular podcast “Reality with the King” and on-camera hosting, cementing his status as both creator and voice of the culture.
In a recent conversation with The Associated Press, King opened up about independence, building generational wealth, navigating racism and homophobia as an openly gay Black man. He also touches on how he feels about being called the “Black Andy Cohen,” a nod to the “Real Housewives” executive producer and late-night host who became Bravo’s on-air face.
AP: What does the “King of Reality TV” mean to you?
KING: It solidifies my place in this business of unscripted television. Having a successful production company, Kingdom Reign Television, having the No. 1 show on Oprah Winfrey’s Network, “Love and Marriage Huntsville,” to a number one podcast, “Reality with the King,” so all those things are underneath me, my brand and my empire. The title means a lot to me and my brand. The audience understands I’m multifaceted and multitalented. It holds a lot of weight, but I’m definitely somebody that understands the assignment.
AP: Why is ownership such a priority for you?
KING: In our business, unfortunately, you create a show and you’re at the mercy of the network, which is just our business. And that’s just the way things are, right? You do the work and once you sell the show to the network, you don’t own the show anymore. I’m all about ownership and the fact that if I put in the sweat equity, then I want all of the profits. I want all of the margins coming to me because I did the work, I created the idea. I found the cast. I developed the show. I want to own everything that I do, and that’s where my vision is right now.
The beauty of my podcast is the fact that I own it. No one can tell me what to do with it. Those opportunities of ownership is fantastic because you’re able to really create your own destiny and look for partnerships that makes sense versus doing the archaic way of this business that I just don’t have the desire to do anymore.
AP: How have you navigated systemic barriers?
KING: I have seen it all, I’ve been through it all: homophobia, racism. I’ve seen that all of my life, personal and professional. However, for me, I never allowed that to be my disadvantage. I found ways to make that my superpower. I found ways to make sure that I stood up for myself and for my people in meetings, in conversations, and inappropriate discussions where shade was thrown very subliminally. I allowed myself to be a disrupter in a very different way.

I didn’t feel the need to be super outspoken in the moment and made a scene out of it. Because I knew that if I did that, I wouldn’t be asked back to do the job. I knew to stand up for myself and my community in a way that was digestible to them. But I always knew that you have learned a valuable lesson, and you take these conversations that are happening around you, and you allow that to fuel you into being an agent of change in other situations.
AP: What are the three keys to building a successful reality show?
KING: No. 1, the cast. A show lives or dies by the cast. You got to find a great cast. No. 2 is what’s the angle? If I did a show about a group of Black people in Atlanta … oh right, kind of seen it. But if I do a show about Black couples in Huntsville. Well, that piques my interest. Tell me more about it. Find the angle that isn’t already out there. No. 3, authenticity is key. Have an authentic group of people who want to share their lives.
The three things that don’t work:
First is a group of cast members who do not want to share their reality. You’re losing. Two, an angle that is familiar. I get pitched sometimes, “I’m going do a show about X, Y and Z.” And I’m like, “That’s already on the air. There’s nothing special about that. Take another big swing at the idea.” Find out what’s missing on television and create that yourself. Don’t create another copy of a show that’s already on the air. And No. 3, fakeness. Oh my gosh, the audience can spot a fake. I can spot a fake.
AP: Why did you set “Love & Marriage” in Huntsville and “Belle Collective” in Jackson?
KING: I wanted to tap into a market that I felt was underserved and just wasn’t getting their just due. I wanted to tell Black stories in inner cities and towns that aren’t prevalent like a LA, New York, Miami. I wanted to be able to show the world that these people do exist, and they should not be forgotten about. Not a lot of people, including me, have heard of Huntsville until I met some of the people and I’m like, “Oh, you guys have a great story.”
AP: How do you feel about being referred to as the Black version of Andy Cohen?
KING: I want people to really pay attention to the individualism that we both offer in this community of unscripted. For me, when it comes to my legacy, I feel very confident that people are now seeing the difference between (him) and I, and they’re now seeing the amount of work I’m doing with my podcast, my YouTube channel, the work that I’m doing with creating shows in different parts of the world that are untapped.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As the former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, my job was to protect both public health and the environment, including protecting Americans from toxic exposures. In that mission, the EPA and the Make America Healthy Again movement are aligned. Children cannot thrive in a degraded environment, and it’s up to agencies like EPA and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to safeguard the most vulnerable. Together, they are on the front lines of Making America Healthy Again.
We’ve recently seen a pernicious narrative begin to circulate that the state of Idaho “quietly rewrote” its cancer regulations to benefit Idaho’s Stibnite Gold Project, and in doing so, put children’s health at risk.
Let’s be clear: That’s not what happened.
U.S. Forest Service approves Stibnite Gold Mine in Central Idaho

The Stibnite Gold Project has been carefully studied, engineered and permitted over the course of 16 years. This is not a slapdash process, but one rooted in science and wrapped in safeguards to protect workers, communities and the environment.
Idaho DEQ didn’t rewrite the rulebook on assessing cancer risks; in fact, it used the EPA’s. The EPA has a conservative, gold standard methodology for assessing health risk. It’s been used for decades, and is designed to be protective of sensitive populations, like pregnant women and children.
Using EPA and Idaho DEQ’s standard formula, regulators considered the project’s maximum possible arsenic emissions if the mine operates all day, every day, for 16 straight years, which is an extremely conservative assumption that cannot in fact occur under actual operational constraints.
Nonetheless, based on this conservative assumption, Idaho DEQ calculated the lifetime additional cancer risk from project emissions to be four in one million or about 1 in 240,000; Idaho’s protective standard is 1 in 100,000, which means the excess cancer risk from the project is 41% less than what Idaho law requires. To further put that in perspective, the odds of being struck by lightning in your lifetime are 1 in 15,000.
The conclusion? Emissions from the Stibnite Gold Project do not pose unacceptable excess cancer risk for anyone.
Claims that Idaho somehow bent the rules to accommodate the project were tested in a full administrative hearing before an independent hearing officer, during which multiple toxicologists, scientists and permit engineers testified. After reviewing the evidence, the hearing officer concluded that Idaho correctly applied the risk assessment methodology and wholly rejected litigants’ claims. The Idaho DEQ Board unanimously upheld that decision.
Zooming out, while this debate has focused on permitting and risk methodology, Idahoans deserve to understand the broader picture and why this project matters:
The Stibnite Gold Project will supply the only American reserve of the critical mineral antimony, which is controlled by China. We need antimony for our national defense, our military needs it for artillery, munitions, and equipment. We also need it for civilian and renewable energy uses, including batteries and semiconductors.
The United States sets the gold standard for environmental regulations while China has terrible environmental practices. The choice is to mine antimony and other minerals in an environmentally responsible manner in the U.S. or rely on China and others who will increase global pollution through their mining practices.
What’s more, this project will actually remediate the environment and eliminate toxins polluting the environment today. The Stibnite Gold Project sits on an abandoned mine site, where one ton of arsenic currently flows into the river every single year. This project will pick up and reprocess 10 million tons of mine waste and tailings, get heavy metals out of Idaho rivers, and make the environment cleaner and safer for everyone.
We must encourage projects like this in order to address the waste from abandoned mining sites that plague the West.
Protecting people and the environment is the core mission of environmental regulators. EPA standards are deliberately conservative, independent experts vet the data, and this project was only approved after demonstrating it would protect both human health and the environment. The Stibnite Gold Project doesn’t clash with MAHA — it embodies it.
Suggesting otherwise isn’t advocacy, it’s fearmongering. Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth. On all counts, the Stibnite Gold Project meets the mark.

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Vanderbilt Faculty Senate, an elected body composed of deans and representative faculty members, has formally opposed entering into a compact with the Trump administration to comply with new directives in exchange for preferential access to funding.
In an emergency meeting Wednesday, the senate passed a resolution that condemned the proposed compact as a likely violation of state and federal law, and an infringement on the constitutional rights of university members.
“The Faculty Senate of Vanderbilt University firmly opposes this Compact as written and calls upon Chancellor (Daniel) Diermeier and the Board of Trust to also reject this Compact outright as well as any similar proposal compromising the mission, values and independence of the University,” the resolution said. 
The resolution was enacted with a 30-11 vote with one member abstaining.
Vanderbilt campus groups push back against Trump administration higher ed ‘compact’

The demand that Vanderbilt and eight other elite universities sign onto the so-called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” whose details were first reported in the Wall Street Journal, has drawn criticism from campus groups and free speech advocates. 
The 10-page proposed contract would require the schools to adhere to a number of ideological goals set by the Trump administration. Among them is that campus faculty and employees abstain from actions and speech about off-campus political events, capping foreign student enrollment and a commitment to use “lawful force if necessary,” to combat protests that impede access to campus facilities.
The directives, the resolution said, “”contains provisions antithetical to the missions and traditions of the university” and “endanger(s) the independence and integrity of the university.”
A Vanderbilt spokesperson referred to a statement posted on the university’s X account that said, “we look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.”
In addition to Vanderbilt, letters proposing the compact were sent to Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Virginia.

But as a small business owner who relies on data-powered advertising, analytics, and personalized outreach to customers, I was alarmed to see Maine lawmakers downplay the risks of adopting rigid “data minimization” rules like those in the Maryland Online Privacy Rights Act. Maryland’s law is an outlier, going further than even California or Europe in restricting how data can be collected and used. If Maine were to enact similar provisions, it would seriously hurt small businesses like mine.
Fourteen years ago, my wife and I started making soy-wax candles in a boathouse on our Edgecomb property. Today, we sell our candles in L.L. Bean, Whole Foods, and specialty retailers nationwide, as well as from our own studio in Edgecomb, Boothbay Harbor store, and online shop. 
Data plays a critical role in our business’s growth. Aggregated data — showing things like which products most interest our customers and the regions where our products are popular — helps us understand our customer base and improve our marketing. And past-purchase data allows us to tell existing customers about new products or special deals, helping build customer loyalty. 
In addition, our digital advertising partners use non-personally identifiable data to show our ads to people most likely to be interested in our products — for example, people who’ve been searching online for candles or gift shops in our area. That means we don’t waste money advertising to people who aren’t interested in scented candles. And data analytics from our partners show which ads are most effective, allowing us to pull or tweak poor performers. In short, data helps us make the most of our small marketing and advertising budget — enabling us to connect with customers, generate sales, compete with much bigger manufacturers, and grow our business.
“Data minimization” rules would prevent Maine small businesses like ours from fully leveraging data for these critical purposes, because they’d limit us to using customers’ data only to provide products or services customers specifically requested. If we can’t use data to inform and power our marketing and advertising, we’ll struggle to understand and reach customers — and make sales. And because the data in question is non-personally identifiable, the benefit to consumers’ privacy would be minimal.
Protecting consumers’ privacy is important. But overregulating data would make it harder for Maine small businesses to survive and grow — at a time when we’re already struggling with economic uncertainty, inflation, and tariffs. I know that lawmakers are well-intentioned, but they also need to be realistic about how data regulations will affect small businesses. Mainers will be best served by balanced legislation that safeguards consumers’ data while allowing small businesses to grow, compete, and succeed.

(Alex Brandon/AP)In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross rejects all political commentary that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?”
For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it.
“What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.
The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, one of America’s founders, laughing louder than anybody.
That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself.
If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact.
Saying “no” — especially to those in power — is an underrated American pastime, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.”
I could go on. Because he did.
 
Birth of a revolutionary
Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London, sailed to America, and there found his true métier as a pamphleteer and radical.
Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine renounced, repudiated and ridiculed at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. Hereditary privilege, colonialism, the supernatural: no, no, no.
But what Paine made his name lambasting — what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force — were kings. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime.
“Common Sense,” his first major work, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.
 
‘Simple facts, plain arguments’
Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings?
The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence.
This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s difficult to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it.
Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.”
Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch.
“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.
 
Bring the Paine
The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.
This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal.
But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.
“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.”
Federal worker firings, court settlements, a government shutdown. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.
Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown.
This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke.
The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.
Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)If there were a trophy for squandering opportunity, Nebraska would already have it on the shelf.
On Sept. 3, the Nebraska Broadband Office, or NBO, released its draft final proposal for how to spend $405 million in federal broadband funds. Advocates for rural broadband like myself fought hard for that money, challenging providers’ overstated coverage and identifying tens of thousands of missing locations.
The federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program, or BEAD, promised to fix rural broadband in Nebraska once and for all. Instead, NBO fumbled. Out of $405 million, the plan spends barely $43 million and connects fewer than 1,300 locations to fiber broadband. More than $350 million is left untouched, likely to go back to D.C. without benefiting our state. That’s not planning. It is malpractice.
Fiber is permanent infrastructure. It is reliable, weatherproof and built to last for decades. It is the backbone of education, healthcare, precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, manufacturing and remote work.
NBO’s alternative? Fixed wireless and satellite. Both have their place, and they aren’t inherently bad solutions for rural connectivity. But their performance, reliability and future scalability pale in comparison to fiber. Relegating over 10,000 rural homes and businesses to second-class broadband is a disservice to every Nebraskan — a patch job, not progress. Betting Nebraska’s future on them is like renting a tent in tornado alley and calling it a house.
NBO claims Nebraska’s proposal is “connecting homes, businesses and community anchor institutions.” Optimistic and only half-true. More than 700 schools, libraries, fire departments and health centers were identified as eligible for BEAD’s funding for that purpose. NBO chose to connect only 54.
NBO’s biggest misstep was how it handled location eligibility. Nebraska started with nearly 30,000 eligible locations. Then NBO let unlicensed wireless providers claim coverage without proof. No maps. No evidence. Just “trust us.” Overnight, 7,500 locations were suddenly reclassified as “served.” Add in federal map changes, and Nebraska lost 52% of its list. Most states cut none.
Then there are the satellites. NBO is spending $2.3 million on Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a service with zero customers and a handful of test satellites in orbit. The proposal trusts Jeff Bezos’ hobby project to serve 1,500 Nebraskans. SpaceX’s Starlink, which already covers Nebraska, gets another $2.5 million to serve places it already serves. This is internet meant to power a campsite, not an economy.
Transparency is scarce. Since Sept. 3, NBO has revised its project list three times, each time cutting funding for schools and libraries with neither explanation nor notice. Just moving numbers around and leaving the public and providers in the dark.
Meanwhile, our neighbors are lapping us. Iowa and Kansas, with the same “flat and treeless” terrain Nebraska used as an excuse, each connected about half of their locations to fiber. Wyoming and Montana, with tougher topography, managed two to three times Nebraska’s fiber commitment. North Dakota? 93% fiber. Nebraska? Dead last — an outlier in the worst way.
Yes, the rules changed. Yes, it made the job harder. But the job is not to roll over when Washington makes things difficult. The job is to fight for Nebraskans, not fold. That is surrender, not leadership.
Excuses might make the politics easier, but they do not bring lasting infrastructure to our farms, schools, businesses and families. If other states can push back and still commit to fiber, Nebraska could too.
Our state’s chance at full connectivity is fading before our eyes. Nebraska appears poised to leave more than $350 million on the table and lock rural communities into second-rate service.
Nebraskans didn’t fight for $405 million to watch it evaporate. Fiber is the gold standard, and we deserve leaders with the backbone to deliver it. Anything less is a betrayal of every family, farmer, business and student left behind on the wrong side of the digital divide.

(Sandra Mu/Getty Images)The Nebraska Broadband Office (NBO) is proud to announce the achievement of our most significant milestone – the allocation of more than $42 million in Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program awards to connect the final 14,032 unserved and underserved Nebraska locations to high-speed, reliable broadband.
These awards, pending final approval by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), represent the biggest step yet toward total connectivity in our state.
This achievement is the result of years of steady effort, persistence and adaptation to changing federal guidance. NBO has worked tirelessly to meet every requirement of the BEAD program while keeping our focus on the needs of Nebraskans.
Creation of the NBO was one of Gov. Jim Pillen’s first initiatives. Our work now is to carry out his vision to meet Nebraska’s broadband needs — especially in rural communities — by ensuring access that is affordable, reliable and high-speed.
The final 14,000 locations are the most challenging to connect. These are the places that providers have historically been reluctant to serve, as evidenced by the lack of applications to serve them received by our office.
For the first time, every one of these locations now has a firm commitment to receive the same quality of broadband service available in our most connected communities. This is an extraordinary accomplishment that reflects a commitment to broadband for all.
Nebraska’s plan embraces every solution, creating a deployment strategy that is practical and forward-looking. These technologies not only exceed NTIA’s current requirements but are evolving rapidly, operating at the cutting edge and advancing before our eyes. Most importantly, this approach gets service to families and businesses faster.
Our plan also extends impact beyond homes and businesses by connecting 54 community anchor institutions, such as libraries, hospitals and fire stations that serve as vital hubs for communities. This new infrastructure will strengthen Nebraska’s capacity for healthcare, education and emergency response while laying infrastructure that nearby communities can build upon.
Our work will not stop here. As of this proposal, approximately $324.6 million of Nebraska’s BEAD allocation remains unspent. NBO is aggressively working to keep these funds in the state. This would allow us to pursue non-deployment investments that will multiply the impact of these funds – enhancing precision agriculture, expanding access to healthcare technologies, supporting digital workforce readiness and preparing communities for an AI-driven economy.
These efforts, combined with our deployment plan, will broaden opportunities for every Nebraskan, ensuring that both our people and our communities thrive in a rapidly evolving world.
This plan reflects the very best of Nebraska: persistence, adaptability and innovation. By combining the strengths of multiple technologies and preparing for what comes next, we are setting the stage for a broadband network that will serve Nebraskans today and keep our state at the forefront of connectivity tomorrow.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Maryland police leaders face an unprecedented crisis in American law enforcement. The Trump administration’s deployment of masked federal agents, militarization of immigration enforcement and attempted use of National Guard troops for civilian policing represents a fundamental threat to constitutional governance and professional law enforcement.
The current federal approach bears little resemblance to traditional law enforcement. More than 75% of people booked into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than an immigration or traffic-related offense, with less than 10% convicted of serious crimes like murder, assault, robbery or rape.
This isn’t targeted enforcement of dangerous criminals; it’s indiscriminate sweeps of immigrant communities.
Federal agents hide their faces during arrests. U.S. citizens have been detained by masked agents in plain clothes. These are methods of authoritarian regimes, not constitutional democracies.
Federal law enforcement resources are being diverted wholesale from their core missions. FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, ATF agents, DEA agents and Homeland Security personnel who should be investigating terrorism, organized crime, drug-related crimes and white-collar crimes are instead conducting immigration sweeps.
Against this backdrop, Maryland’s expansion of 287(g) participation from three to eight sheriff’s offices in 2025 entangles local police in a fundamentally compromised federal operation. When Maryland agencies sign 287(g) agreements, they become part of a system that operates without accountability, violates constitutional norms and destroys community trust.

Research shows 287(g) programs significantly reduce violent crime reporting among victims. In Maryland’s diverse communities, home to significant immigrant populations in Baltimore, Montgomery County, Prince George’s County, Frederick County and elsewhere, domestic violence victims won’t call police, witnesses won’t cooperate with homicide investigations and human-trafficking victims will remain hidden – subjected to greater risk.
The current federal immigration enforcement crisis makes community policing principles more essential than ever. Decades of research demonstrate that effective policing requires community cooperation, trust and legitimacy. When communities view police as partners in public safety, crime reporting increases, witness cooperation improves and crime prevention becomes possible.
Many Maryland agencies have invested in community policing models, building relationships with neighborhood groups and earning legitimacy through fair treatment of all residents. These relationships take years to build but can be destroyed overnight.
The Trump administration’s aggressive tactics are already creating fear in immigrant communities across Maryland. Children are afraid to go to school. Workers won’t report wage theft or workplace safety violations. Domestic violence victims are staying in dangerous situations.
For Maryland police leaders, this environment demands a choice: Double down on community policing efforts or sacrifice community trust and collaborative problem solving for politicized federal immigration priorities. There is no middle ground.
Professional law enforcement organizations, the Police Executive Research Forum, Major Cities Chiefs Association and International Association of Chiefs of Police, all warn that immigration enforcement by local police fundamentally undermines community trust and public safety.
Maryland chiefs and sheriffs have professional and constitutional obligations that transcend federal pressure. They must maintain operational independence, protect constitutional policing, preserve community relationships, consider exiting 287(g) where applicable, resist militarization and document federal overreach.
Maryland has worked for decades to professionalize law enforcement, implement community policing and build trust with diverse populations. Community policing isn’t just a buzzword – it’s an operational necessity that enables police to solve crimes, prevent violence and maintain public safety.
This moment demands that Maryland police leaders remember why community policing principles emerged in the first place: because enforcement-only models don’t work. Aggressive, militarized policing that treats communities as occupied territory creates the conditions for crime to flourish by destroying the community cooperation that effective policing requires.
The question facing Maryland police leaders isn’t whether immigration law should be enforced, that’s a federal policy matter. The question is whether local police will maintain their professional integrity and constitutional obligations in the face of federal overreach.
The evidence is clear: 287(g) participation exacerbates every problem created by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. Maryland police leaders who prioritize public safety, constitutional governance and professional policing must reject this false choice between federal cooperation and their core mission. Their loyalty is to the Constitution, to professional standards and to the communities they serve, not to a federal administration that has abandoned all three.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54348554551_ce02f39035_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) canceled an environmental review of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project – a sprawling development of seven geographically contiguous utility-scale solar projects that would cover more than 62,000 acres  nearly 100 square miles — of public land about 30 miles west of Tonopah, Nevada.
The joint project was proposed by six solar energy companies, including NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy.
All together, the network of solar panels and batteries in Esmeralda County was expected to produce as much as 6.2 gigawatts of energy under ideal conditions, or enough electricity to power nearly two million homes.

After months of delays, the Department of the Interior this week said it was canceling its broad environmental review of the joint project and would instead review the seven projects that make up the development separately “to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”
The Department of the Interior said the impacted energy companies will now have the option to submit a separate application for their individual project proposals. 
“The BLM did not cancel the project. During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada,” said an Interior spokesperson in an email Friday.
“Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts,” the email continued. 
It’s unclear how many of the impacted solar companies will continue to pursue their individual projects after the change in how the proposals will be reviewed.
A spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said the company was committed to their individual project – the Esmeralda Energy Center – which is a part of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project. 
“NextEra Energy Resources is one of six companies pursuing projects in Esmeralda County, Nevada. We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management,” a spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said in an email Friday. 
A spokesperson for Leeward Energy, one of the companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said “we don’t have any information to share regarding the project update.”
Representatives for the other four energy companies involved in developing the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project did not respond to requests for comment.
Kevin Emmerick, the co-founder of Basin and Range Watch, said he’s skeptical solar companies involved in the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project would be eager to resubmit applications after “tariffs and roadblocks set by the administration.”
In July the Trump administration mandated that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, a threshold that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo said has already stalled several solar projects in the state. 
Emmerick, who opposed the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, said he isn’t surprised the project’s broad environmental review was canceled given the new rules under the Trump administration, and suspects singular approval of each project will be even more cumbersome.
“Solar and wind energy have several new layers of approval for each individual project so this programmatic review for all seven projects makes that kind of individual scrutiny very difficult,” Emmerick said. 
Federal land managers began reviewing the developers’ joint proposals in 2023 under former president Joe Biden. But the project’s environmental review process has been stalled since Donald Trump took office. 
Federal land managers were expected to issue a final environmental impact statement for the project — the last step before a record of decision is issued — at the end of April, but neither materialized. 
The project has attracted strong opposition from locals and conservation groups who caution the size of the project could negatively impact the environment and rural communities’ way of life. 
Several conservation groups have asked federal land managers to move the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project to areas the BLM has earmarked as “solar energy zones” — areas it sees as prime for solar development. Esmeralda County has two solar energy zones, encompassing about 21,000 acres of land. 
Shaaron Netherton, the executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, said she hopes the cancellation of the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project “will be an opportunity moving forward to find better sites for solar development.”
“We need to focus on disturbed  areas and utilize warehouse and data center roofs for solar before using vast stretches of our public lands,” said Netherton, who opposed the joint project. 
“Storey County is being completely developed for industrial buildings. This would be a great place to cover with solar. Producing energy right where it is needed,” she said. 
Locals have also expressed frustration with solar companies’ lack of communication when proposing projects. Esmeralda County commissioner Fred Perez said more than a dozen solar companies have proposed projects in his county. Perez said none of those companies have been in communication with him, including the companies that comprise the Esmeralda Seven Solar Project.
Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the BLM needs to further clarify “its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process.”
“We remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Norris said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sevensolarblmcover-1024x698.jpeg,,,2025-10-11 00:57:08.108551

He identifies with the Black Robe Regiment, a coalition of pastors committed to tearing down the wall of separation between church and state.
Still, the Rev. Jack Martin insists politics won’t interfere with his volunteer school service.
Living in Hernando County since 1997, he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2016 and in 2022. In the 2022 Republican primary, Martin came in second to U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, earning 9.2% of the vote.
Martin remains politically active, particularly through his Facebook and Rumble accounts, posting an array of social media videos supporting Republicans and criticizing Democrats. Among his posts:

An ode to Charlie Kirk.
A video criticizing U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the government shutdown, calling him “Uncle Chuckles.”
An image boosting “Pastors for Trump.”
A photo calling for former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be deputized so he can arrest former President Barack Obama.
A video advocating for ivermectin to treat COVID-19, which Martin says saved his life after catching COVID.

“If we want our country back, we can’t stand as spectators applauding Donald Trump.  We need to take our armor, get out there in the battle alongside of Donald Trump,” Martin said during an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly.
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin told the Phoenix that “without apology there are things he [Trump] does I don’t like, too,” and that his support for Trump is “in areas that are restoring our country to be a more sound republic.”
Still, Martin insists his motivation to serve as a chaplain is “not anything political, it’s not to proselytize, it’s to help kids.”
Registered as clergy under the Christian Life Assembly of God church, the Rev. Martin is listed as a chaplain on the Hernando County Schools’ website, meaning he is qualified to “provide support, services, and programs” to students who seek it out.
A 2024 law, HB 931, that permits volunteer chaplains drew backlash from some faith leaders for the possibility it would lead to religious proselytization of students, “undermine the secular nature of public education,” and violate the Establishment Clause, the part of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits government establishment or preference of a religion, the Phoenix has reported.
Faith leaders warn schools of dangers of optional, voluntary chaplain program

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is asking the district to backtrack and not only take away Martin’s permission to serve as a chaplain but to eliminate the entire program, which is voluntary for students.
“Rev. Martin has openly promoted Christian nationalism and disparaged public education itself. His stated views are incompatible with the religious neutrality required of public schools and threaten to undermine the trust and inclusivity essential to serving Hernando County’s diverse student body,” the foundation wrote in its letter to Hernando officials.
The foundation advocated for access for students to “trained professionals such as school counselors, psychologists, and social workers — not clergy advancing religious or political agendas.”
“Please understand that permitting a religious chaplaincy in a public school district jeopardizes the rights of students and parents and invites legal challenge,” the organization’s legal counsel, Christopher Line, concluded in his letter.
Constitutional concerns
The retired Pentecostal pastor told the Phoenix in a phone interview this week he does not share constitutional concerns about the program. He’s “100% sure before the Supreme Court that it would be proven pure and good.”
As chaplain, Martin said, he will try to be “one more layer in a system that’s trying to help our kids get through school and graduate as healthy as they can.”
A father of six homeschooled children, Martin served as chaplain for Spring Hill Fire and Hernando County Fire for 17 years. That experience, he said, has prepared him to work with students.
If a tragedy such as a school shooting were to happen, “I would be the most trained — even out of their counselors — I would be the most trained to be able to go in and immediately start to help,” Martin told the Phoenix.

Citing his outspokenness about Jan. 6, 2021, and his commitment to the Black Robe Regiment, the Freedom From Religion Foundation has called Martin a Christian nationalist.
His response: “I am a Christian who loves the United States of America, the nation that God has allowed me to be born and live in. And I respect the laws of the land. And I respect the word of God. And I attempt, the best I can, to live in a manner that would be the life the way Jesus would have done it.”
Martin does identify as a Black Robe Regiment pastor. The national organization with that name bills itself as a “modern-day network of patriotic pastors and religious leaders striving to safeguard liberty by helping clergy and community leaders step into their God-given duty of leading from the pulpit, in the community, and in government.”
A 2022 Vice report cited by the Freedom From Religion Foundation asserts the Black Robe Regiment does fall within the rubric of Christian nationalism, having ties to Gen. Flynn, who in his Reawakening America tours has argued “the church should be at the heart of all aspects of American society.”
Martin says the Vice story is inaccurate. “I mean the Black Robe Regiment is a term, it’s not one group of people,” he said.
Last month, Martin posted on the Black Robe Regiment Facebook group, of which he’s an administrator, “I say this in humility but mark down that the first Public School Chaplain in the State of Florida is a Black Robe Regiment pastor.”
Martin insists the topics he’s been outspoken about would not be part of his offerings as a chaplain.
“In the past, at school board meetings, I’ve spoken on vaccines, on mandatory masking, and things like that. But those were as a citizen and those were prior to any chaplaincy program existing. But they would not be something that would be talked about,” Martin said.

In an appearance before the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly in August, Martin said he could help combat bullying in schools and calm kids after any bomb or gun scares.
Martin said he was invited to speak to the organization, which declares “everything else will fall into proper place by reforming the Republican Party with Judeo-Christian conservative constitutionalists with the Courage to do what’s right.”
“I hear a lot of pastors say, ‘We’ve fixed the problem, we’ve got Christian schools.’ My only problem with that is, what about all the kids that are still in public school and who are still being forced to believe stuff they shouldn’t?” Martin told the Assembly.
The Rev. Martin has amplified right-wing talking points blaming transgender people for political violence. The day after a shooter opened fire at a Catholic school in Minnesota, Martin told the Lake County Florida Republican Assembly that, “if long before that, somebody had sat down and helped those young people, they would have got the help they need.”
In addressing gender-confirming care, Martin told the Phoenix, “My personal view — and, again, I could not use this one in the school, obviously — but my personal view is that you’re hurting kids. It would be like telling the anorexic if you eat more it will get better, you’re just hurting them. And I think my whole heart in trying to be a chaplain is to help kids, not to hurt them and not to create a bigger problem than already exists.”
(Screenshot via Rev. Jack Martin’s Facebook profile)
Martin has a Rumble channel called “THE HARD RIGHT SAVING AMERICA” and publishes songs he’s written. One title is “The Ballad of J6ers,” a “tribute” to participants in the events that transpired in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, which he called “no insurrection. It was a 1A protest by citizens.”
“I am a man who loves my country, I was in D.C. that day along with my good buddies believing free speech worked that way,” Martin wrote in his  lyrics, although he stresses he wasn’t there.
There’s an accompanying video featuring clips of  the insurrection and an artificial intelligence-generated image of Obama being handcuffed by FBI agents in the Oval Office as Trump watches.
“And maybe justice will be served and the bad folks are put in jail,” the song continues.
Martin told the Phoenix the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s criticism is incorrect.
“They referred to a song that I had written and I used the quote the president [Trump] used. I want them to go be peaceful protests, and they tried to make it as if I said that was a peaceful protest. I have my own view on that day,” Martin said — going on to allege that more than 270 Deep State “insiders” were among protesters. “I have questions that there was at least some shenanigans with that day.”
Xs and Os
The Hernando County School Board approved language implementing the state’s first public school chaplain the program earlier this year, making it the first district to welcome the volunteer religious figures.
“Pastor Jack, I want to say that I appreciate everything that you have done in leading this chaplain program. I have worked with you hand-in-hand, day-after-day, week-after-week, we’ve had a few months at this, and it’s been some long, hard discussions,” Hernando School Board Chair Shannon Rodriguez said during a school board meeting last month. “I’m honored to come alongside of you.”
The district’s policies outline that chaplains:

May provide religious or spiritual guidance to students, lead students in prayer, and offer reflective, non-judgmental listening to students who are going through a difficult time.
May not seek to persuade or force any student to participate.
May not proselytize for or disparage any religion, belief, lack of belief, or faith group
Provision of care, help or counsel is not proselytization or disparagement.

The district, which operates more than 20 schools, requires chaplains to obtain “an ecclesiastical endorsement from their faith group” to certify they are indeed a leader in the faith, “qualified spiritually, morally, intellectually, and emotionally to serve as a chaplain for the board,” and “sensitive to religious pluralism and able to provide for the free exercise of religion by all students.” 
The policy prescribes that “the selection of a chaplain should reflect the expectations of the local community.”
The program has officially started, although Martin said his counsel has not yet been called upon. 
The policies require interested parents to opt in and provide Martin protections from lawsuits. 
The law requires interested school chaplains to first pass a Level 2 background check, “a state and national fingerprint-based check and consideration of disqualifying offenses and applies to those employees designated by law as holding positions of responsibility or trust.”
After passing the background check, a chaplain wishing to provide services must schedule a consultation with a school principal and interested parents to earn signatures from both parties.
“I would like to look at this three years down the road and see the value of what’s come out of the program, and be able to look back and say, ‘See, this is why I thought it was effective,'” Martin said. 
After the Phoenix’s interview with Martin, a second chaplain was added to the district website, Shawn May, registered with Great Life Church, a non-denominational church in Spring Hill.
State definition of ‘religion’ too narrow, Satanic Temple says

Although groups have raised criticisms and threatened legal action, Martin said he hopes Hernando’s program “can prove to be effective to the good of the school and the students in a way that, if other counties wanted to try it, they would model a program. 
“The school board has done an incredible job of implementing a program that limits what I can do and that’s fine with me,” he added. 
Last year, pastors opposed to chaplains entering schools told the Phoenix they disagreed with its “scout’s honor” system to not proselytize.
Following the passage of the chaplain law, the Satanic Temple told the Florida Gannett newspapers that it intends to take advantage of the law, the Phoenix reported last year. They since have complained that the state’s model policy for districts to carry out the law was too narrow.

A majority of the Douglas County Board, which oversees the county jail as the Board of Corrections, issued a statement Friday objecting to the idea announced Thursday by Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

The statement by Commissioners Chris Rodgers, Jim Cavanaugh, Brian Fahey and Board Chair Roger Garcia offered several reasons for the rationale of the majority on the seven-member elected board.
Garcia previously rebuffed the idea of contracting jail space to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees. If put to a vote, that majority would douse the possibility of such a county contract. 
“We will not support any expansion of immigration detention at the Douglas County Jail,” the commissioners’ said in a statement urging instead the state’s federal delegation to work toward comprehensive immigration reform. 
 Financial benefit?

The four said their preferred approach “requires coalition-building and advocacy at the federal level, not contracts that perpetuate harm.” They said that “true humanitarian choice is not to detain mothers, fathers and workers” whom they described as “essential” to the local economy.

While the commissioners said they “fully support” holding violent and drug-trafficking criminals accountable,” they said 72% of ICE detainees nationally have no criminal history. “Detaining hardworking and law-abiding residents who have built lives and families here does not make us safer; it only deepens fear, trauma and economic loss across our communities.”
They also questioned any financial benefit, saying the cost to house an inmate at the county jail is $220 per day, an amount they said exceeds the $175 per diem contract ICE currently pays nearby counties.
Hanson, in response, told the Nebraska Examiner that the county is in an “enviable position” to negotiate a better deal. He said the new revenue stream could be reinvested back into his department’s own trimmed budget, offer tax relief and enhanced public safety measures for county residents and potentially create a national model that could direct money to local immigrant communities.
He’s urged the County Board to put the idea to a public vote.
“This should be on an agenda in which people can come and voice their opinion pro or con, and ultimately elected leaders can do what we are supposed to do, make tough choices,” Hanson said.
A county agreement with ICE for detention, the sheriff said, would allow individuals arrested in the Omaha area to stay close to their families and the area’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.” 
He cited the June 10 Omaha Glenn Valley Foods raid in which most of the nearly 80 undocumented workers detained were transported roughly four hours away to a North Platte jail in Lincoln County, which has a contract with ICE.
In an Oct. 7 memo to County Board members, Hanson said the county jail had space and was operating at a “historic low capacity.”
 ‘Deeply troubling’

But according to the director of Douglas County Corrections, Michael Myers, the county jail population has steadily increased since late last year. The total incarcerated population as of today is 1,101, up from 914 in December, Myers said in a statement from a county spokesperson.
Douglas County sheriff urges ICE detention contract for jail, County Board chair balks

Projections, Myers said, show the county on pace to process roughly 1,500 more inmates this year compared to last year, when it booked 15,500 individuals.
Two legal centers that advocated for workers detained in the Omaha Glenn Valley immigration raid weighed in Friday on the ICE-Douglas County proposal, one calling it “deeply troubling.” 
“Immigration detention should never be a business model,” said Roxana Cortes-Mills, legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement. “The Douglas County sheriff’s proposal to profit from detaining immigrants is deeply troubling, especially at a time when fear and uncertainty are already at an all-time high.”
Said Cortes-Mills, “Let’s be honest, this isn’t about access to health care or staying close to family and legal support. It’s about expanding detention in Nebraska and profiting from an administration intent on dehumanizing immigrants.”
She said CIRA attorneys would continue serving communities across the state “to uphold due process and dignity for all.”
 Promote dialogue

American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, which also represents several Glenn Valley detainees, objected to what it called the “illusion” that closer ICE detention facilities would benefit immigrant families.

ACLU executive director Mindy Rush Chipman said that “trying to sprinkle in incentives of money and geographic closeness” is an effort to “hide the ball, so to speak, about what this would actually mean for our communities.”
She said if one asked ACLU’s Omaha clients, they’d likely say it would have been “easier” to have loved one detained closer than North Platte. She, however, doubts those families would support increased ICE detention space in their community.
ACLU believes heavier ICE presence and jail capacity would lead to increased likelihood of “unlawful detentions and liability to the county itself.”
“We all need to push back against the concept this is happening anyway, so we might as well get paid for it,” Rush Chipman said. “This is not good for our communities, no matter if you try to describe and disguise it.”
Hanson sees his proposal as humane for families and a “lucrative opportunity” for the county.
“The biggest thing I’m trying to promote here is dialogue,” he said. “Can we find a way to mitigate the thing that we cannot control — federal detention?”

The State Board of Education was set to vote this week on a controversial measure that many school officials and education advocates say would bar local municipalities from providing much-needed funding and support services to local schools. 
Instead the board voted unanimously on Thursday, at a DEED official’s request, to take no action and return the proposal to the department for further development.

“As a result of the feedback we received, the department will be recommending that the state board take no action on this item, return the proposed regulation to the board or to the department for further collaboration and input with key stakeholders,” said Heather Heineken, the division director for finance and support services for the department, to the board Wednesday, the first day of a two-day meeting. 
The proposal came under sharp criticism and public alarm beginning in June, when DEED introduced the measure as an emergency regulation change. Officials said the move was intended to redefine the amount local municipalities provide for schools — called the local contribution — to include “services provided at no charge to a district by the city or borough.” 
At the time, DEED officials said it was a way to address the balance of funding for schools ↣— in Alaska’s complex school funding formula which includes local, state and federal funding — and avoid failing a federal disparity test. 
The disparity test is required by the U.S. Department of Education to regulate the spread between the highest and lowest funded districts, because of the way the state uses some federal funding, called impact aid. The state failed the test earlier this year, but is in the process of appealing the ruling. 
Education Commissioner Deena Bishop, however, reversed that argument and told board members further discussion was needed with districts and financial offices to clarify what “in-kind” contributions are being made and how they were accounted for. She said that was needed to align with state law and standards for equity between districts. 
“We’re not reacting to the federal government. What we are (doing) is trying to meet the state statute that calls for that equitable funding,” Bishop told the board on Wednesday.
Public raises alarm at unclear change to local contributions
State board members received more than 600 public comments, mostly opposing the measure, in June and July when the regulation was introduced, calling the proposed change vague and potentially limiting vital municipal funding for schools. 
During public comment on Thursday, several district officials expressed opposition and concern.
Valdez School District Superintendent Jason Weber said the change could jeopardize essential city funding, including for transportation and school meals. 
“Our Food Service Program is also at a breaking point. Even after raising lunch prices by $1 per meal last year, we’re still operating at a deficit. Every dollar cut from food service funding is $1 taken away from the plates of kids, these regulations would directly reduce the food we can provide for our students, something no community should have to accept,” he said. 
“Each Alaskan community has unique needs and challenges the decisions about how to support and operate schools should be made by those who live and work closest to them, not through a one size fits all mandate from the state level, undermining local authority threatens the very foundation of community supported education in Alaska,” Weber said.
Juneau School District Superintendent Frank Hauser pointed to the state’s own appeal of the federal disparity test as evidence the change is unnecessary. 
“According to DEED’s July 14 letter, the state would meet the disparity standard, not with a regulation change, which isn’t even mentioned, but by a different accounting method,” Hauser said.
Hauser asked board members to vote the regulation down. 
“I am terrified of version 3.0 of this regulation. Each subsequent attempt at this regulation change has had exponentially more negative impacts, impacts beyond what the department realizes, even to REAAS, home school and correspondence students, instead of enacting the oft quoted definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, I ask you today to take a different direction and ask the department to stop with this effort altogether,” he said.
During public comment, district officials also raised concerns at a recent DEED Facebook post, which shared a statement over an image of a burning dumpster fire, calling several Anchorage officials’ out by name, saying that their information was “inaccurate” and saying DEED no longer was pushing the proposal. Commenters called the social media post “unprofessional” and not “positive or proactive communication.”
Anchorage officials had penned an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News, opposing the regulation change, saying it could “gut” the district and strip $15 million in municipal funding, including for school buses and school resource officers. 
State board members vote to return proposal to DEED
Before the vote, several state board members questioned whether the proposal should come back to the board.
“I guess I’m questioning now, is it really an issue, or is that needs to be addressed, or does it just need to go away?” asked board member Pamela Dupras on Thursday. 
Bishop responded that DEED will gather more feedback, and work with districts to adhere to state law and requirements for equitability. She also pointed to the new Legislative Task Force on Education Funding that may take up the issue and recommend new legislation to define local contributions.
Bishop said DEED would work with district officials and finance departments to further clarify the requirements. “I’m glad that you’re pulling this back,” she said. 
She also acknowledged the frustration of districts. “Every two weeks from August until now, I’ve been sharing the same message that, yes, we do not want to put this forward. So I understand the frustration with what was in writing, certainly superintendents that attended all those meetings knew the intent,” she said. 
“I think just the stress about school funding, a lot of trust isn’t there,” Bishop added. “The Department wants to earn that trust back and continue with the work.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6721-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

Mike Dunleavy’s re-election campaign in 2022 must comply with a subpoena issued as part of a yearslong investigation, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled Friday.
In a 13-page decision, the court rejected a series of arguments offered by attorneys representing the Republican Governors Association, and it ordered the organization to comply with the subpoena.
The decision was authored by Justice Dario Borghesan, a Dunleavy appointee.
Attorneys representing the RGA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Since 2022, the Alaska Public Offices Commission has been seeking documents from the RGA — a national group that backs Republican candidates for governor — to determine whether or not the group illegally colluded with Dunleavy’s 2022 campaign.
The RGA is considered an “independent expenditure” group and thus is barred by law from coordinating with a political candidate’s campaign. In 2022, two progressive groups filed complaints against the RGA. 
The state watchdog agency APOC, which regulates political campaign spending, began an investigation, but the RGA refused to comply with a subpoena seeking banking information and relevant communications.
Anchorage-based attorney Scott Kendall, who represents the political groups that filed complaints against the RGA three years ago, said that if RGA now complies with the subpoenas, APOC can actually judge the original complaints on their merits.
That could have implications for next year’s governor election, Kendall said on Friday.
“Are they going to participate (in the 2026 election)? If they’re going to participate, are they going to disclose their donors if they participate?” he asked. “What will the public think of them if, in fact, APOC does find that they broke the law? I have to believe the RGA has the intention of trying to participate in this upcoming election, and whether they broke the law last time, and whether they intend to follow the law this time, I think, are very, very relevant issues.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1280273369-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers contemplate the need to spend from savings to balance next year’s state budget, a unique investment by the state’s departing revenue commissioner is drawing their attention.
Shortly before leaving office in July to run for governor as a Republican candidate, former commissioner Adam Crum approved a $50 million private equity investment with the firm DigitalBridge, using money from the state’s principal savings account.
That account, the Constitutional Budget Reserve, has about $2.9 billion and until now has been invested in ways that can be easily convertible to cash in case the state needs to spend it on short notice. 
Private equity investments, which typically involve taking a share of a company that isn’t yet listed on a stock market, frequently take years to mature. This is the first time the CBR has been invested in private equity.
The DigitalBridge investment can’t be canceled, said a spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Revenue.
Though the investment involves less than 2% of the budget reserve’s funds, state legislators expect to spend — at the least — hundreds of millions of dollars from the reserve next year in order to pay for services and the Permanent Fund dividend.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said in a written statement on Oct. 3 that they “were caught off guard” when they learned about the move.
They said putting “tens of millions of dollars into an illiquid, high-risk investment” undermines the purpose of the budget reserve, which is to provide stability. 
“Future high risk investments of this nature should not occur without the involvement of the Legislature,” they said. 
Crum’s successor as revenue commissioner, Janelle Earls, was also concerned about the process used for making the investment, said Aimee Bushnell, a spokesperson for the Department of Revenue. 
“After being advised of the acting commissioner’s concerns, the governor apprised legislative leadership of the transaction, forwarded documents to the legislative auditor for review, and directed an outside third-party review be conducted to determine whether there were in fact any violations of policy and make process recommendations as appropriate,” she said.
Crum, speaking by phone on Thursday, said he was surprised by the reaction, in part because he had been working on the investment for more than a year.
In 2000, lawmakers and then-Gov. Tony Knowles created a subaccount within the budget reserve to allow higher-risk, higher-yield investments. That subaccount was drained in 2015, at a time of plunging oil revenue.
The budget reserve’s money moved to low-risk investments, but that comes at a downside; those investments barely keep up with inflation.
“It actually means you’re deteriorating the buying power of the CBR over time,” he said. “And so that actually is a harmful thing.”
Crum said he asked the Department of Law and then-Attorney General Treg Taylor whether he could pursue alternative investments via the disused subaccount.
The answer was yes, and Crum signed a revision to the CBR subaccount investment policy on July 29. He left office on Aug. 8, and the DigitalBridge investment closed three days later.
The money isn’t going to in-state projects, and Crum said he has no personal ties to DigitalBridge.
“In fact, both myself and DigitalBridge would be in incredible trouble if there were any financial ties,” he said.
Crum said that as revenue commissioner, he had a fiduciary duty to make sure the state’s investments were working as best as they could.
“If we can actually make greater returns, we actually can just make sure that we’re building up the fund over time,” Crum said.
Senate President Stevens, by phone on Thursday, said he understands that the investment is a small part of the CBR, but “we’re concerned that we don’t know what’s going to happen in the economy. We don’t know if oil is going to go to zero. It has in the past, and we’re concerned about having the money we need to run government.”
In May, members of the Senate said at a news conference they were worried about a gap between revenue and expenses in 2026 and said that gap could be as large as $600 million.
An unexpected drop in oil prices or production could widen that gap.
Crum said he believes that if the Legislature needs the last $50 million in the CBR, the state will have much bigger issues by that point.
“The $50 million is such a low dollar amount that I do find it amusing that legislators are clutching their pearls about it, because if we somehow burned through $3 billion in savings and we’re down to our last $50 million, we’re dead in the water,” he said. “That is the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. That is not the $50 million that is going to save the state.”
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and operating budget chair for the House Finance Committee this past year, said he doesn’t think the Legislature will need all of the CBR, but added, “I think there’s a greater concern about the fact that we need readily available cash, and that’s what the CBR was designed to provide. And you know, these high-risk investments may not be conducive with that goal.”
He noted that lawmakers have repeatedly clashed with the executive branch in recent years, including on the topic of financial disclosure. In August, legislators overrode Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill intended to compel the Department of Revenue to release information related to oil tax audits. The department had declined for years to release that information to legislators.
“It’s just — we’re suspicious,” Josephson said. “We don’t know when we can have our $50 million back.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/230120-Crum-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 21:57:24.367336

(Photo by Ryan Hagerty/USFWS)Alaska judges will not hear a lawsuit alleging that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has mishandled the state’s valuable salmon returns.
On Friday, the Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower-court decision that dismissed a case brought by Juneau resident Eric Forrer in 2022.
Forrer had argued that years of declining salmon returns in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers clearly showed that the department was violating a section of the Alaska Constitution that requires fish be managed for sustained yield. 
Forrer, a long-time Alaska resident, has a history of personal-use and commercial fishing, including on the Yukon River. 
In his suit, he sought a declaration confirming that the Fish and Game was violating the constitution and sought an injunction directing the department “to fulfill the sustained yield mandate.”
Bethel Superior Court Judge Nathaniel Peters dismissed the case in 2023, but Forrer appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court.
In an 18-page order published Friday, the five-member court said unanimously that because Forrer didn’t challenge a specific policy, law or regulation, Peters was correct and the case should be dismissed.
If the court had allowed the suit, wrote Justice Dario Borghesan, it would have amounted to “judicial management of the fisheries at issue” and “would be contrary to constitutional design and practically untenable.”
Borghesan wrote that if the court were to eventually issue an injunction, Fish and Game would almost be required to guess what solution would be acceptable to the court.
Forrer was represented by attorney Joe Geldhof, who frequently participates in public-interest lawsuits in front of the Alaska Supreme Court.
By phone, Geldhof said he was disappointed by the decision and begs the question of what Alaskans are supposed to do when a state agency isn’t fulfilling its mandate.
“Where do you go when there’s a systemic failure?” he asked.
Friday’s Supreme Court order implies that if that’s the case, elected officials need to fix the issue.
The Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers have seen severe declines in salmon returns despite restrictions on fishing that are intended to increase the number of fish that return to local rivers to breed.
“The separation of powers doctrine prohibits Alaska courts from reviewing nonjusticiable political questions,” Borghesan wrote on behalf of the court. “A claim is not justiciable if ‘deciding the claim would require us to answer questions that are better directed to the legislative or executive branches of government.’”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/e6332b94-ab76-4b9a-a536-98a0e73dbbfe_1336x1110.png,,,2025-10-10 20:58:19.875421

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)When 11 babies were exposed to measles in Cache County last month, public health workers rushed to get in touch with their families and helped provide emergency medication to keep the infants from getting sick. 
“I was just really proud of the work that the local health department did, and the local health care facilities,” said Amelia Salmanson, an epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS. “I went to bed knowing that we were going to be providing this support to these vulnerable babies.”
Salmanson’s still not resting easy, though. She and her colleagues are anticipating a rise in cases of the highly contagious disease, in Utah and beyond. They’re especially focused on other infants too young to be vaccinated but who may come in contact with the virus in day cares or other settings. 
“I get very nervous,” Salmanson said. 
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Utah has recorded 55 cases of measles this year, with the majority – 41– in the southwestern corner of the state. 
That outbreak along the Utah-Arizona border is prompting local health officials to recommend early MMR vaccination (protecting against measles, mumps and rubella) for babies living in or traveling to Washington County. 
The standard MMR vaccine schedule starts at 12 months old, Salmanson said, but babies are eligible at six months. 
DHHS isn’t recommending early vaccination for kids in other counties, but said it will do so later on if it determines a county’s transmission levels put babies at risk. 
Any children who do get an early dose will still need the two standard doses later on, at 12 to 15 months and then at 4 to 6 years, according to the health department. 
Outside of the southwest corner of the state, Utah recorded four cases in its northern Bear River district and three in its southeast district, along with seven in Utah County. 
Utah County doesn’t have any current cases, said spokesperson Aislynn Tolman-Hill. Still, measles has continued to show up in its wastewater, appearing in its most recent sample from Sept. 30.

While no infants were diagnosed in the county’s outbreak, its health department is preparing for the possibility they’ll be exposed. 
“That’s something that, yes, we definitely are concerned about, with how young of a population we have,” Tolman-Hill said, noting Utah County is one of the youngest in the nation. “Along with that, we are concerned about all of the pregnant moms we have out there in our community.” 
Salmanson agreed. 
“In terms of severe illness and risk for complications, young babies and pregnant women are definitely at the top,” she said. 
There’s some indication those with immunity to measles can transfer antibodies to their babies before birth, Salmanson added, but women aren’t eligible to get the vaccine while pregnant. She recommends that those seeking more information visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s website.

California card rooms emerged victorious in the latest battle over whether tribes should have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling.


Over the years, casino-owning tribes have spent millions in court, in the Legislature and at the ballot box trying unsuccessfully to force their only competitors out of California’s casino business. 
A judge today blocked their latest effort.
Last year, tribes persuaded the California Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom to allow them to sue gambling halls called card rooms over the tribes’ claim that they have exclusive rights to offer Las Vegas-style gambling in the state.
Since the tribes are sovereign governments, they had lacked standing to sue the private businesses until Newsom signed Senate Bill 549, which gave the tribes one shot this year to resolve their dispute in Sacramento County Superior Court.
Superior Court Judge Lauri Damrell today dismissed the tribes’ case, saying federal gambling law superseded the measure Newsom signed.  
“The court is mindful that previous efforts to resolve this longstanding dispute – whether through regulatory action, legislation, ballot initiatives, or litigation – have been unavailing,” Damrell wrote in a tentative ruling that she approved during a hearing. The court “recognizes the genuine desire, shared by many stakeholders, including the California Legislature, to reach the merits and achieve a final resolution. The court does not take lightly the importance of the issues at stake and, were it within its authority to provide a definitive resolution, it would endeavor to do so.” 
Still, Damrell wrote she was “bound by the limits of federal law.”
California’s card room industry applauded the ruling. 
“We are encouraged by today’s decision,” California Gaming Association President Kyle Kirkland said in a written statement. “Our member cardrooms will continue to support good jobs, vital public services, and local economies across California while upholding the highest standards of integrity, accountability, and compliance.”
Tribes say they strongly disagree with the court’s decision and plan on appealing it.
“This outcome is especially troubling given that it was a state law enacted just last year that explicitly gave tribes standing in state court,” James Siva, chairperson of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association, said in a written statement. “It’s difficult to reconcile this ruling with the clear intent of the Legislature, and once again, a court has sidestepped the actual merits of the case — effectively denying tribes a fair opportunity to seek justice.”
Tribal revenues vs. city taxes
The tribes sued on Jan. 2, the first day the courts were open and the day after SB 549 took effect.
The tribes’ suit alleged that the dozens of gambling halls scattered across California were illegally offering card games such as black jack and pai gow poker that cut into the tribes’ gambling revenues.
“Defendants brazenly profit from illegal gambling,” the tribes said in the opening line of their lawsuit.
Tribes say California voters years ago gave them the exclusive rights to host table games, which they use as a critically important source of revenue to support their historically disenfranchised communities.
Under the bill, tribes cannot receive any money or attorneys’ fees from the lawsuit. Instead, they  could only petition the court to decide whether card rooms can continue to offer the disputed games.
The stakes are high outside of casinos since some cities receive nearly half of their budgets from taxes on card rooms, meaning a tribal victory in court would have jeopardized money for police, firefighters and other local services.
San Jose City Councilmember Sergio Jimenez told lawmakers last year that the city receives $30 million each year from card rooms, enough to fund 150 police officers or 133 firefighters. Jimenez said that money’s in jeopardy if the tribes prevail in court.
The card room industry claims the games are legal and that the attorney general’s office has approved each of them over the years. 
The tribes have tried to sue card rooms for unfair business practices before. But California’s courts have ruled that the tribes don’t have standing.
“There is little doubt that commercial cardrooms are flouting the law by offering illegal games and operating outside the bounds of state regulations,” Siva said in today’s statement. “All we have ever sought is a clear judicial determination on whether these practices are lawful under state law. That is not an unreasonable ask — and tribes should not be denied
their day in court.”
An expensive political fight
The fight over SB 549 was one of the most costly political battles of the two-year legislative session that concluded last year.
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, many of them with large tribal casinos in their districts, pushed for the gambling measure, while a smaller group of lawmakers with card rooms in their districts opposed it.
It followed a failed 2022 sports betting initiative that the tribes spent millions of dollars to sponsor and that included a similar provision that would have let the tribes sue.
The opposing gambling interests donated at least $4.3 million to the 120 members of the Legislature since January 2023, according to the Digital Democracy database.
Facing what they saw as an existential threat, card rooms responded to SB 549’s introduction with a massive lobbying blitz. In 2023, Hawaiian Gardens Casino alone spent $9.1 million on lobbying, the second highest amount reported to state regulators. Only the international oil giant, Chevron Corp., spent more.
Then, despite Newsom signing the law, the card room industry spent more than $3 million in the lead up to the November election in retaliation against four lawmakers who played key roles in the bill’s passage.
Three of the candidates targeted by the card rooms ended up losing, including the bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Josh Newman of Fullerton.
Meanwhile, the tribes’ efforts to push out other gambling competitors from California continued in the Legislature this year. 
The Legislature approved Assembly Bill 831 in September. The measure bans online gaming companies from offering digital sweepstakes that the tribes see as another threat to their exclusive rights to gambling.
Newsom hasn’t yet signed the measure into law. He hasn’t indicated whether he will. He has until Monday to make a decision.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/031423_SoCal-Cardrooms_TS_CM_45.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774

(Photo courtesy of Department of Enterprise Services)A Washington man suspected of breaking into and vandalizing the state Capitol is undergoing a mental health evaluation, an attorney confirmed Friday. 
Authorities initially arrested Gunnar McLean Schubert, 29, on suspicion of first-degree burglary, first-degree arson, and first-degree malicious mischief. But prosecutors on Wednesday charged him with only second-degree burglary, a felony, and third-degree malicious mischief, a gross misdemeanor.  
To be convicted of both charges, the prosecution would need to prove that Schubert entered or remained unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime inside, and that he damaged less than $750-worth of property. 
Schubert’s arraignment was scheduled for Friday afternoon, but was delayed a week to allow him to complete his mental health evaluation as previously ordered by the court. His hearing is now scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Oct. 17. 
The evaluation will determine whether Schubert is mentally capable of proceeding with his case. If he is found incompetent, he will be admitted to an involuntary treatment facility. 
In a rampage late Sunday night that lasted roughly 10 minutes, according to authorities, Schubert allegedly parked his car on the sidewalk of the campus flag circle, broke into the Capitol through a window, set fire to county, state and U.S. flags and damaged what the state calls the “world’s largest single-loom carpet” that is almost a century old in the state reception room. 
He is also accused of knocking over busts of George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. and damaging an electronic card reader for an elevator. The card reader has since been fixed, according to the Department of Enterprise Services.
He sustained a cut on his left arm during the incident and was treated by Olympia Fire Department personnel on the scene. His right arm was in a cast at the time. 
Schubert was released from jail on Tuesday, Oct. 7, without needing to post bail. A judge found that bail was not necessary to secure his reappearance at court, but determined that several conditions of release were necessary. 
Undergoing a mental health evaluation was one of those conditions. Another prohibits him from visiting the Capitol campus without an official escort. 
He was also required to contact the court’s pretrial services department within two days of his release, but failed to do so, according to court documents. A violation report has been added to his record, but has not yet been addressed by a judge. 
An attorney representing Schubert confirmed Friday that he is in custody at an undisclosed location while he undergoes his mental health evaluation. 
Schubert’s possible motivation remains unclear. Some officials attributed his alleged actions to mental health issues. 
In videos posted to social media in the days leading up to the break-in, Schubert rambled through sometimes nonsensical rants. In separate posts, he posed with a gun, invoked a Democratic state lawmaker and wrote current events-themed poems as captions. 
Two weeks before allegedly vandalizing the Capitol, Schubert posted a photo inside the Capitol rotunda with one of those poetic captions. 
Schubert played baseball at Gonzaga University and is a former minor league player. 
The incident has stoked concerns of politically motivated violence locally, after the killings this year of Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as Republican commentator Charlie Kirk. 
“I take his family at their word that there are mental health considerations,” Lt. Gov. Denny Heck,  a Democrat, said Monday. But, Heck added, “How is it not a political statement to enter the state Capitol building and do damage? He could have entered any of a thousand buildings in Thurston County.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/George-Washington-bust-tipped-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 19:59:15.411774

Rossman, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, argued that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement is making no plans to immediately remove him, he should be released from detention. He also argued that since March, when the Trump administration erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a mega-prison in El Salvador, to the present, Abrego Garcia has been “in continuous containment” way past the six-month limit set by the Supreme Court regarding the detention of immigrants.“The real aim of the government… is punitive, which is just to keep him incarcerated,” Rossman said. ""It's an overtly political purpose.”

Rossman told Xinis that he has not received an answer from the federal government as to why they will not remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, after he agreed to that proposal in August.Xinis asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.Ensign said that it was not clear to the government until Friday that Abrego Garcia had agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, because Abrego Garcia had previously expressed fear of being sent there. Abrego Garcia changed his position after Costa Rica assured him he would be given refugee status.“That is a new development that I will report back to people,” Ensign said.Supreme Court rulingA 2001 Supreme Court ruling does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them. After 90 days without efforts to deport an immigrant, a challenge can be made because detaining that person any longer than a maximum of 180 days, or six months, would likely be unconstitutional, the high court found in Zadvydas v. Davis. Earlier this week, Xinis seemed likely to order Abrego Garcia’s release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, where he has remained since late August. Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica to the United States after she found his removal to El Salvador unlawful, is overseeing his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention.Protesters rally outside the courthouseAhead of the hearing, dozens of supporters from the immigrant advocacy group CASA gathered in front of the District Court for the District of Maryland, chanting, “Somos todos Kilmar,” or, “We are all Kilmar.” Rallygoers also chanted “What do we want? Justice!” “When do we want it? Now!” Some also held signs urging the Trump administration to free Abrego Garcia.

Two Maryland state legislators, Dels. Nicole Williams and Bernice Mireku-North, both Democrats, joined the rally.Williams sponsored legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to prohibit local police from entering into certain agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the ban, the biggest loss for Maryland immigration advocates this year.“We are going to be working on legislation with regards to masking by law enforcement officers,” Williams said. “We need to start treating everyone, I don’t care where you’re from, in a humane and decent way. And that’s what we’re going to be fighting for every single day until Kilmar is free and Kilmar comes home. So stop using Kilmar for your own political gain. Bring Kilmar home.”White House involvementSchultz, the DOJ witness, revealed that the White House had direct involvement in picking Uganda as a potential third country of removal for ICE’s deportation of Abrego Garcia. The move was unusual because the State Department typically coordinates third-country removals for the Department of Homeland Security.Schultz said the Homeland Security Council, which operates within the White House, notified ICE of Uganda as a third country of removal. The Homeland Security Council works with the National Security Council of the White House. While Uganda is no longer a third country of removal for Abrego Garcia, ICE is trying to now remove him to Eswatini. Schultz said Eswatini has not agreed to take Abrego Garcia, but discussions, which he said started on Wednesday, are underway. “The discussions are continuing,” Schultz said. Schultz said he is not aware if ICE has not made any efforts to determine if Abrego Garcia would face persecution or be tortured or confined in Eswatini, or be removed a second time to El Salvador.  Eswatini has previously agreed to accept third-country removals from the U.S. and the two countries have a memorandum of understanding, he added.Ghana another potential destinationSchultz said that ICE has also identified the west African country of Ghana as a potential nation for Abrego Garica’s removal. Schultz said once a third country has agreed to accept Abrego Garica, he could be removed by ICE within 72 hours.However, Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, wrote on social media that the country will not accept Abrego Garcia. “This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,” he wrote. “In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.”Schultz said that ICE ""prematurely"" sent a notice of removal to Abrego Garcia with Ghana as the designation.The Costa Rica alternativeOne of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.Schultz said he was unaware of the letter from Costa Rica’s government saying it would accept Abrego Garcia.Another attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the Trump administration offered to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in August if he were to plead guilty to criminal charges in a federal case in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to get him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses. Rand asked Schultz if anyone from DHS was in contact with Costa Rica.Schultz said he was unaware if there were conversations between the federal government and Costa Rica about removing him there. Rossman said based on Schultz’s testimony, it was clear the Trump administration was “holding hostage passage to Costa Rica.”“They aren’t presently intending to remove him,” he said. “They have spun the globe and picked various (African) countries… to fail on purpose.”William J.

The tariffs would be stacked onto existing tariffs his administration has imposed on the country, he said.Trump added that he would impose his own export controls “on any and all critical software.”“It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,” he wrote.Trump left open the possibility of scrapping or adjusting the additional tariffs before November, saying in the Oval Office late Friday that “We’re gonna have to see what happens.”“That's why I made it Nov. 1,” he said. “We'll see what happens.”He told reporters he has not canceled a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, at an international economic conference in South Korea this week, but raised some doubt that the meeting would take place.“I don't know that we're going to have it,” he said. “But I'm going to be there regardless, so I would assume we might have it.”Tariffs a main part of Trump policyTrump has used tariffs, taxes paid by the importer of foreign goods, as the central tool of his trade policy, applying broad tariffs on U.S. allies and adversaries alike, with a particular focus on China.The two countries imposed escalating trade barriers on one another since Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs in early April. The U.S. tariff rate for Chinese goods peaked at 145% before the two sides negotiated an end to the trade war. Chinese goods still see a base tariff rate of 30%.Trump invoked emergency authority to raise tariffs on China, arguing that the tariffs were a putative measure for China’s inability to control fentanyl supplies flowing into the U.S., but federal courts are still deciding the legality of that move.",,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

The projected $56.6 million state budget deficit was calculated in the October Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and Revenue Monitor report, which the Idaho Legislative Services Office released Friday. 
The Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from running a budget deficit where expenses exceed available revenue. 
However, the state’s top budget official told the Idaho Capital Sun late Friday afternoon that Gov. Brad Little will do what needs to be done to ensure the fiscal year 2026 budget balances. 
Little already ordered all state agencies – other than public schools – to cut their budgets by 3% before the end of the fiscal year June 30. A short time later, Little said those cuts will continue into 2027 and be made permanent. 
No decisions have been made, but state officials are discussing the possibility of additional cuts and deeper cuts, said Lori Wolff, administrator of the Idaho Division of Financial Management.
“Obviously we are watching this very closely and talking amongst the governor’s office staff about what we need to do to make sure we submit a balanced budget,” Wolff said. “We’ve already done the 3% holdbacks and are starting to examine other places where we may need to reduce expenses.”
 Through first quarter of fiscal year 2026 budget, revenue is 6.8% below forecast

Wolff said budget officials will brief Little this month and then he will prepare his gubernatorial budget request in November. 
Wolff said Little and the Division of Financial Management are committed to doing what it takes to avoid a budget deficit of any kind.
“We are continuing to watch revenues and make decisions to make sure whatever we submit is a balanced budget,” Wolff said. “At the same time we don’t want to overreact. This may correct itself, and we definitely don’t want to put too much weight into one month of revenue.”

Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. The October budget and revenue report covers the first three months – or first quarter – of the current fiscal year 2026.
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money available to spend on expenses in the state budget. The largest source of revenue is taxes.
Through the first three months of fiscal year 2026, revenues have come in $94.1 million, or 6.8%, below the revised revenue forecast issued by the Division of Financial Management, the new budget and revenue monitor report shows.
The revenue shortfalls are occurring after the Idaho Legislature and Little reduced revenue by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for eligible education expenses, including tuition at private religious schools.
 Idaho’s budget picture has changed since record surplus three years ago

News of a projected budget deficit is a big change for Idaho. 
A little over three years ago, Idaho ended fiscal year 2022 with a record state budget surplus estimated at $2 billion. 
The budget picture has even changed considerably since legislators adjourned the 2025 legislative session April 4, when they projected ending fiscal year 2026 with a positive ending balance of $439.8 million. 
But in the six months since legislators adjourned the session, that $439.8 million surplus has now become a projected deficit of $56.6 million, according to the October Fiscal Year 2026 Budget and Revenue Monitor report.
Wolff emphasized that the state’s overall economy remains strong and rainy day budget reserve accounts are sitting at record levels. Wolff also pointed out that Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth announced Thursday that the financial investor services firm Moody’s Ratings just affirmed Idaho’s AAA credit rating.
Idaho is not the only state grappling with revenue shortfalls. The Colorado Legislature called a special legislative session this summer, in part to address shrinking revenue, Colorado Newsline reported. Meanwhile, the Washington State Standard reported that state tax revenue in Washington is down by $500 million.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Dozens of Arkansas municipalities will continue to go without certain monthly allotments of state funds because they haven’t yet filed required audits of their water and sewer systems.
After a two-hour debate Friday, Arkansas lawmakers on the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee rejected a proposal to expunge a July vote to withhold “turnback funds” from 43 cities and towns whose 2022 water and sewer audits were outstanding at the time.
Seven legislators voted for the motion while eight voted against it and five voted present. Several members of the 35-member committee were absent.
The committee voted last month to give grace to the 40 cities and towns that still had not submitted their reports for fiscal years 2022 through 2024. Three cities had filed those reports, and two more had done so as of Friday, said Rep. Richard Womack, R-Arkadelphia, House chair of the committee’s Counties and Municipalities subcommittee.
The committee’s September vote asked Treasurer John Thurston to release the funds and require each municipality to provide the delinquent report to Arkansas Legislative Audit or an engagement letter with a certified public accountant promising the report will be submitted by Dec. 31.
However, that vote had no legal authority, according to an opinion issued Monday by Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office. Thurston’s office requested the opinion after the committee’s vote in September. The opinion stated that only expunging the initial vote to withhold funds would allow Thurston to release them.

2025-096 
Act 453 of 2023 states that lawmakers can ask the state treasurer to withhold the funds if a municipality misses the 18-month deadline and that the funds can only be restored if the municipality submits all its reports through the most recent fiscal year.
If those audits are not submitted, the committee may — but is not required to — direct the state treasurer to withhold turnback funds until the reports are submitted. However, once the treasurer is directed to withhold the funds, it is required to do so, Assistant Attorney General William Olson wrote in Monday’s opinion.

Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, proposed the failed motion to expunge the July vote. He insisted that the opinion “is not law until it goes to court and is proven in court” and that lawmakers do not have to take action that aligns with it even though he agreed with it.
Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, proposed that the committee release the turnback funds to municipalities “that are actively showing efforts” to submit their outstanding audit reports but to continue withholding funds from those that “have produced no evidence of actively complying with the law.”
Thirteen municipalities have shown no effort to submit their reports, said the committee’s House chair, Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs.
“I’m struggling between grace, mercy and rewarding effort, but not rewarding those who are blatantly disregarding the law, because I think that is an injustice to the cities that have gotten the message and are making an effort,” Hammer said.
The committee rejected Hammer’s motion, which also would have required representatives of the noncompliant municipalities to appear before the committee at its next meeting. The motion failed by a similar margin as Ladyman’s.
Arkansas lawmakers agree to return withheld funds to 40 municipalities after two-hour debate

Most of the municipalities flagged for delinquent audit reports in July have populations of fewer than 1,000, Ladyman noted.
“[For] a city of 200 people that has to pay either $3,500 or $10,000 for an audit, that puts them in a bad situation, especially since they haven’t gotten turnback [funds] for two months,” Ladyman said. “That may be keeping them from complying.”
Local governments receive two types of turnback funds from the state. General revenue turnback funds support basic local services such as emergency response. Turnback funds from state highway revenue go to municipalities and are required to be spent on maintaining roads that are continuations of state highways or former state highways.
Lundstrum reiterated her previous opposition to releasing the withheld funds from noncompliant entities.
“If they have a water and sewer department and you don’t pay your water bill, what happens?” she said. “You get your water cut off. At some point, they’ve got to be able to do an audit.”

Last month, Roshani, an Afghan case worker in Vermont, heard that her clients with Special Immigrant Visas would be losing access to food stamps. 
It has been a hard message to explain to them, she said.
It’s not just that her clients come to Vermont with few or no resources, said Roshani, whose real name is being withheld while she seeks asylum. Special Immigrant Visa holders are largely Afghans who were granted that status after assisting the U.S. government in their home country before American troops withdrew in 2021. They have come to the state as legal permanent residents. 
But Vermont’s interpretation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s language on the issue renders these visa holders ineligible for food stamps. Advocates are contesting the state’s reading, which they say appears to be among the first of its kind in the nation.
Roshani said cases of this kind make her “want to melt into the ground.” “They tell me, ‘Hey … do you know how I saved my boss in this war?’” she said.
Officials at the Vermont Department for Children and Families said federal law mandated the denial of food stamp eligibility to this group. Following the passage of the Trump administration’s spending bill in July, the state has begun implementing a sweeping set of changes to its version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The wider population of non-citizens has been significantly affected, with 119 households experiencing a partial or complete loss of benefits, according to the department’s most recent estimate.
But for most humanitarian entrants, a green card has been enough to keep food stamp access, due to exemptions in federal law. Special Immigrant Visa holders, who by programmatic design are seeking promised refuge from both conflict and persecution for past allegiance to the U.S., have lost benefit eligibility in Vermont even though most have green cards.
Federal guidance on issuance of Special Immigrant Visas lists one condition as an “ongoing serious threat as a consequence of employment” with the U.S. government or associated entity.
Tracy Dolan, director of the state’s Refugee Office, estimated that there might be 20 or 30 households with Special Immigrant Visas that would be affected by the eligibility change, but expressed some uncertainty around that figure.
A number of legal advocates have called the state’s position on Special Immigrant Visa holders into question, citing laws they said have been unaltered by the new federal budget.
“The part that we disagree with is Vermont’s interpretation of Afghan (and Iraqi) SIVs in particular,” said Meredith Owen Edwards, senior director of policy and advocacy at Refugee Council USA. 
Edwards’ organization argues in its legal analysis — based on provisions in previous laws governing SNAP and federal guidance that has emerged since the creation of the Special Immigrant Visa program — that those visa holders should still qualify for food stamps without needing to satisfy other conditions.
Vermont’s position is different, according to Miranda Gray, deputy commissioner for the Economic Services Division of the Department for Children and Families. The department’s legal team concluded that under new federal law, Special Immigrant Visa holders are not entitled to that eligibility.
“We are feeling confident in our legal analysis,” Miranda Gray said. “We were essentially taking two different laws and seeing where they intersected.”
Molly Gray, the director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, called the state’s implementation an “unnecessarily cautious and narrow” reading that “seems incorrect,” citing similar arguments to Edwards.

For many of her organization’s clients, she said, food stamps are an indispensable part of the transition period rather than a permanent fixture. The changes may also affect her organization’s future plans to welcome more Special Immigrant Visa holders to the state, Molly Gray said.
“These individuals are arriving with no money and the clothes on their backs,” she said. 
‘Leading the charge’
In making these eligibility changes on Oct. 1, Vermont appears to be among only a few, if any, states to withhold benefits for Special Immigrant Visas in particular, according to officials and advocates. 
Agencies in a number of states across the country did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.
Vermont is “leading the charge” on implementing SNAP changes, according to Edwards. “That is one of the reasons it’s particularly important to ensure that Vermont falls on the right side of interpretation,” she said.
When asked for clarification of the state’s legal reasoning, Miranda Gray responded in an email that she was unable to provide more specific information or connect VTDigger with the department’s attorney.
Dolan said that Vermont’s Special Immigrant Visa holders are now subject to a five-year waiting period for SNAP eligibility after arriving in the U.S. Essentially no Special Immigrant Visa holders in the state are currently eligible under that rule, Dolan said, because they would need to have been lawful permanent residents for at least five years. Vermont only began receiving such entrants in 2021, according to Dolan, with few exceptions. 
This five-year bar and its associated exemptions appear to originate in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act governing SNAP, according to Edwards, which predates the Special Immigrant Visa program by 15 years.
“The rationale for choosing to have one population eligible and another not in this situation is difficult to understand,” Dolan said. “There’s no doubt about that.”
The state has been under pressure to implement changes to SNAP quickly and with little margin for error, Miranda Gray said. In the background, threats of huge federal penalties loom if the state’s “error rate,” or percentage of misdirected funds under the new guidelines, is too high.
“We have to talk about the full picture,” Miranda Gray said.
One of the central shifts in the Trump administration’s transformation of SNAP is a greater financial burden on states as opposed to the federal government. Administrative costs, which used to be shared equally, will now be 75% covered by each state. But perhaps more crucially, the rate of administrative error will begin to determine how much each state will need to contribute to the direct cost of the benefits themselves.
An error rate of 6% or higher, just 0.87% above Vermont’s result last year, will result in the state being responsible for 5% of the program costs — up to $7.8 million in additional fees. Each successive error rate threshold would add another 5% in required coverage.
Miranda Gray said that kind of expense could result in major cuts elsewhere in the program. 
“I think that impacts, as well, how states are making decisions,” she said of the implementation process. 
All parties agree that a lack of federal guidance on the details of SNAP eligibility has hampered the process. Miranda Gray said part of the issue has been significant turnover and organizational changes at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Sonali Samarasinghe, director of the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said that communication around those on the margins of SNAP coverage has been hard to follow for providers and recipients alike.
“Everything is a little murky,” she said. “Guidance changes from day to day.”
Roshani said her clients had often received multiple letters, with one warning of a change in benefit amount, and another withdrawing benefits entirely.
Dolan said the state had requested federal clarification around non-citizen SNAP eligibility “pretty early on,” but that some instructions had not arrived on the promised timeline. The alterations began taking effect Oct. 1, coinciding with the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.   
“We would all benefit from more comprehensive guidance,” Dolan said.
‘A kind of betrayal’
Special Immigrant Visas of this type date back to early years in the United States’ war in Afghanistan, when new legislation sought to offer support to Afghan and Iraqi nationals who assisted the U.S. in its missions abroad. The document affords immigrants under these particular circumstances access to legal permanent residence in the United States. 
Afghans who worked with the U.S. have often faced persecution under the Taliban regime. In recent months, Afghan outlets have reported thousands of refugees have been forced to return home from Iran and Pakistan as the neighboring countries cited security concerns and strain on resources.
The vast majority of Vermont’s Special Immigrant Visa population is Afghan, part of a community which is already reeling after President Donald Trump cut federal refugee resettlement programs in January. When the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, it left behind tens of thousands — estimates including open cases have exceeded 150,000 — of Afghans who were entitled to visas as a result of their work.
In the period since official resettlement channels closed, other pathways to the U.S. for Special Immigrant Visa holders became available, most notably through the veteran-run nonprofit No One Left Behind. Vermont, among other states, has therefore continued to receive Afghan immigrants under these circumstances.
“The U.S. government should issue clear guidance to all states confirming that SIV holders remain eligible for nutrition assistance,” said a spokesperson for No One Left Behind in a statement on Friday. “Our allies kept their promise, and we must keep ours.”
Molly Gray said a lack of food stamps could threaten her organization’s ability to welcome newcomers in the Special Immigrant Visa program going forward.
The alliance assists new Afghan entrants with temporary housing, finding work, and a number of other necessities. But, “​​we don’t have any funding to support food assistance,” Molly Gray said.
“Afghans arriving in Vermont are not looking for a handout, they’re already working second shift,” she said.
The alliance’s purpose is not solely to fulfill a promise made to Afghan people, Molly Gray said, but also simultaneously to grow Vermont’s workforce and economy.
Ali Zenie, executive director of Central Vermont Refugee Action Network, said she was currently working with a family set to lose benefits based on their status as green card-holding Special Immigrant Visa recipients. Having arrived in March, the family’s financial situation has been difficult due to medical issues, and they have relied regularly on food assistance.
Because of religious dietary restrictions, Zenie continued, it has often been difficult to accept food in contexts where the family has not been doing its own shopping. The model of food stamps has allowed the family to accept support in a dignified manner that works for their specific needs. While Zenie hopes that an exemption for disability will allow the household to retain part of their monthly allowance, the case remains up in the air.
It’s crucial, Roshani said, to understand the circumstances that brought these individuals to the United States.
“We’re kind of neglecting the fact that we are receiving people from parts of the world that have experienced a lot of trauma,” Roshani said. 
Samarasinghe said that in the context of their life-threatening support of the U.S. back home, these cuts are especially bewildering.
“I think what it means for them is a kind of betrayal,” she said.

The Missoula County Attorney’s Office has charged a 29-year-old man with a felony hate crime after he allegedly assaulted another man in downtown Missoula because he was Jewish, according to county officials.
Authorities are hoping other people who witnessed the assault will come forward with more information.
According to Missoula authorities, at around 1:30 p.m., Tuesday, Missoula Police went to the 1100 block of West Broadway on a report of an assault. Once they arrived there, they saw a man with “obvious injuries” who was bleeding from the face. They received a description of a man who had allegedly beaten the victim, and found Michael Cain not far away.
Based on statements and other evidence obtained by officers, the police believe that Cain had assaulted the victim because he had been motivated by the victim’s religious, ethnic or cultural identity of belonging to the Jewish religious community.
Cain was arrested and is being held at the Missoula County Detention facility on the charge of malicious intimidation or harassment relating to civil or human rights, a felony. This is often referred to as a “hate crime.” 
The police department is also asking anyone with additional information about the crime to contact it at 406-552-6300.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2013-11-23_Thanksgiving_Parade_Silver_Spring_514_Police_Lights_11029946016-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

(Photo courtesy of the University of Arkansas)The University of Arkansas Fayetteville is preparing to hang hundreds of donated Ten Commandments displays in its buildings in compliance with a new state law. 
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to the law, posters shall be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions to a local school board, building governing entity or the Building Authority Division. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
The state has eleven, four-year public universities, according to the Arkansas Department of Higher Education. The Advocate emailed all of them Friday, and the University of Arkansas Fayetteville is the only one that confirmed receipt of donated posters. 
Arkansas school district responses to Ten Commandments law mixed

“The University recently received about 500 donated posters of the ‘Ten Commandments’ and is beginning to install the posters in university buildings and facilities as required under Act 573 of 2025,” said John Thomas, director of media relations and core communications.
Spokespeople for Arkansas State University, Henderson State University, University of Arkansas – Fort Smith, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and University of Central Arkansas all confirmed they had not received donations as of Friday.
Nate Hinkel, director of communications for the University of Arkansas System, also confirmed no donations had been made to UA Grantham, an online public university based at the UA System’s Cammack Campus in Little Rock.  
Arkansas Tech University, Southern Arkansas University and University of Arkansas at Monticello did not respond to requests for comment by publication. 
The new state law faced its first legal challenge in June when a group of families of varying religious backgrounds filed a lawsuit against four Northwest Arkansas school districts. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks temporarily blocked the law at the four districts on Aug. 4, one day before it was set to take effect. 
The Conway School District in Central Arkansas was later added to the suit, and Brooks ordered Ten Commandments posters already displayed in the district to be removed in late August. 
Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a notice of appeal on Sept. 23. Brooks last week denied the attorney general’s motion to stay proceedings pending the appeal and a motion for a 30-day extension of upcoming deadlines due to two lawyers’ “personal obligations and heavy workload.”
“These excuses do not constitute good cause to stay the Court’s deadline,” Brooks wrote. “The deadlines are perfectly reasonable, and the Attorney General’s Office is not short of staff to litigate this case.”
The state’s appellant brief is due Nov. 17, according to a scheduling order.

,California,2025-10-10 22:06:45+00:00,CalMatters,Why ‘no tax on tips’ may have limited benefits for California workers,Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/no-tax-on-tips-california/,"Experts doubt the effectiveness of ‘no tax on tips,’ especially for California workers who are facing cuts in other benefits.","In summary
Experts doubt the effectiveness of ‘no tax on tips,’ especially for California workers who are facing cuts in other benefits.


No tax on tips, a campaign promise by President Donald Trump, is now part of the U.S. tax code, but experts across the political spectrum see limited benefits for California workers.
The Treasury Department and the IRS late last month released details of their proposed regulations around the new tax deduction, which Republicans included in their spending bill. 
Under the provision, taxpayers who make less than $150,000 a year, or $300,000 if filing jointly, could deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes, regardless of whether they itemize their deductions. Among the nearly 70 occupations that qualify are restaurant servers, gig workers, barbers, cosmetologists and golf caddies. The deduction is effective starting this tax year and runs through 2028. The public can submit comments to the IRS until Oct. 22. 
Workers and experts who spoke with CalMatters about no tax on tips had more questions than answers, because income tax outcomes can vary significantly depending on people’s circumstances. Are they single, married filing separately or married filing jointly? Do they have kids? Do they deduct mileage or other expenses? Experts also said the provision brings up issues of fairness: Some low-wage service workers will get deductions that workers with comparable wages in other industries won’t get. 
“I would be hard-pressed to think of a stupider tax policy that’s become law,” said Brian Galle, a law professor at UC Berkeley whose focus includes taxes. 
Galle said the provision makes taxes even more complicated. He also said it could lead some employers to cut workers’ pay “by the full amount of tax savings.” 
Meanwhile, polls show consumers are tired of tipping, so they might stop doing so if they assume that all tipped workers will now be able to deduct their tips, Galle and other experts said. 
In addition, for some workers the deduction may not be enough to offset the negative effects of other aspects of the Republicans’ spending bill.
“It’s a bit of a distraction from the overall bill and how disproportionately it’s helping rich folks at the expense of low-income folks,” said Kayla Kitson, senior policy fellow at the California Budget & Policy Center, a left-leaning think tank. “Many low-income tipped workers will likely be harmed by the cuts to health care and food assistance and the failure to extend enhanced premium tax credits.”
What workers think
Dale Randle, a self-employed barber in Fairfield, a Bay Area suburb, thinks he could take advantage of the new deduction. But he doesn’t know how much in tips he will actually receive.
“It’s kind of hard, because everybody doesn’t tip,” he said. “It’s hit or miss, there’s no consistency. I might go a whole week without someone giving me a tip.”
Also, business has been slow since the pandemic’s onset five years ago, because lots of new barbers have oversaturated the market since then, he said. Data from the state confirms that: Barbers licenses issued this fiscal year totaled 42,958, a 33% increase from fiscal year 2019-20. Business has been especially bad in the past several months, Randle said. 
“The benefit of this (deduction) will depend on how good business is,” he said. “Business is slow, so I can’t count on something that’s not there.”
That’s in line with a Yale Budget Lab analysis that not taxing tips may not benefit more than a third of tipped workers because they do not make enough to owe income tax in the first place.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Crissie Brown said she makes about $95,000 to $100,000 a year from being a server at two different restaurants in Alameda. She said she’ll probably have to hire a tax preparer to see if she could benefit from the new deduction, but she’s skeptical because she doesn’t believe the Trump administration is “looking out for the working class at all.” 
“With the economy, I still live pretty poorly,” Brown said. “I can’t even afford to pay what I owe (in taxes) now.” She said keeping tips tax-free “sounds good, but I have a feeling it will bite us” in the end.
Only tips that are given voluntarily by customers will count toward the deduction. That means restaurant servers will not be able to deduct service charges that some restaurants automatically apply to diners’ checks. 
California food service workers’ reliance on tips vary. In September, 27% of bartenders’ income came from tips, according to payment-processing company Square, which analyzed payroll data from more than 100,000 employees. Full-service restaurant workers’ tips made up about 17% of their income last month, just like cafe workers. For workers at quick-service restaurants where there is no table service, tips were about 11% of their income.
Trump said he got the idea for no tax on tips from a Nevada restaurant server who complained about taxes she had to pay on tips. The union that represents Las Vegas food and hospitality workers is mostly supportive of the new deduction, though it has some complaints about the details.
As for gig workers, they might see uneven benefits from the new deduction, said Sergio Avedian, a ride-hailing driver in Los Angeles and a contributor at the gig-work blog Rideshare Guy. 
“For drivers, who often rely on tips to offset low base pay, this could feel like an immediate raise,” Avedian said. But he added that the new deduction may not benefit drivers much because he thinks only 15% to 20% of Uber and Lyft riders tip. He said the deduction could be more beneficial for food-delivery drivers, such as those who deliver for DoorDash, while it would probably not help Amazon Flex workers who don’t typically get tips. 
More than 53% of food-delivery drivers’ income is from tips, according to 2024 data from Gridwise Analytics, which is based on information from more than 260,000 drivers. Tips made up only about 10% of ride-hailing drivers’ pay, while for couriers who deliver packages that number was less than 4%.
Avedian also said gig workers have to pay self-employment tax, so that could eat into any benefit of the new tip deduction — again, if the workers qualify for it at all, depending on their income. 
Almost 40% of taxi and ride-hailing drivers nationwide are on Medicaid or receive health care subsidies, according to Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. In California, those drivers could be among the more than 1 million people expected to lose Medi-Cal coverage under new work-hour requirements in the Republican spending bill.
Fairness and other issues
The uneven effect of the deduction will apply to other industries, according to analyses by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank. Both think tanks criticized no tax on tips during the 2024 presidential election, when both Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris proposed it. They said it has “no other redeeming quality” and that only some low-wage workers will get the tax deduction.
Another way the deduction is unfair is that it has a marriage penalty, said Andrew Gradman, a tax lawyer in Los Angeles County. 
“If two tipped workers are married, they can only claim $25,000, while a single person would get to claim $25,000,” he said.
Another possible problem: Because the new deduction introduces even more complexity to tax law, some workers risk committing tax fraud or being accused of it, Gradman said. 
If someone works for an institutional employer, “they’re going to have accountants who will do the heavy lifting,” he said, and that could help taxpayers know whether they qualify for the deduction. “If you get your paycheck from Patreon or whatever, it’s gonna be burdensome.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/041624_San-Ysidro-Border-Economy_AH_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

(Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s longest-serving death row inmate died this week in a prison infirmary of natural causes, the Department of Corrections said Friday.
Fred Singleton, 81, died Monday, according to an online post by the agency that oversees the state’s prisons. He was one of 25 inmates on death row at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia after executions resumed in September 2024. The state prisons agency, in its statement, did not explain why it waited four days to notify the public of Singleton’s death.

A jury convicted Singleton in 1983 of raping and strangling 73-year-old widow Elizabeth Lominick to death in Newberry County the year before. Officers had arrested Singleton in Georgetown County with her car, her diamond and gold jewelry, and about $100 of her money, according to court records.
However, Singleton couldn’t be executed because the state Supreme Court found him mentally incompetent. In the 1993 opinion deciding Singleton’s mental state meant he couldn’t face the death chamber, justices set the standard still used today for what makes a death row inmate able to face execution.
Singleton didn’t understand that he could die in the electric chair, which was the default execution method at the time. He could only respond to attorneys’ questions with a “yes” or “no,” making it difficult to communicate, his appeals lawyers argued to the court.
Although the court agreed Singleton shouldn’t face execution, justices also decided a judge couldn’t reverse Singleton’s sentence because the court couldn’t be sure his condition was permanent, according to the opinion.
Medication might have rendered Singleton competent, but justices decided officials couldn’t force Singleton to take medicine for the sake of his execution, according to court records.
Singleton spent the rest of his life on death row.
The next longest-serving inmate is Jamie Wilson, whose case also remains in legal limbo because of questions over his competence.
As executions continue in SC, these inmates can’t receive death warrants

Wilson, convicted in 1989 of killing two 8-year-old girls in a school shooting the year prior, pleaded guilty but mentally ill before receiving a death sentence. His attorneys argued during a 2004 hearing that he was incompetent for execution, but a judge has yet to issue a decision.
Six inmates have been put to death since South Carolina resumed executions last year following a 13-year hiatus. Two more received judgments deeming them competent for execution but are appealing the decisions.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0542-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

The state agency that administers New Mexico’s food stamps program says as many as 32,000 residents’ eligibility could be impacted next month by new federal rules.
The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed July 4 contains many changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, but most don’t go into effect until next year or later.
But Nov. 1, the bill will change how energy assistance payments are applied to SNAP eligibility determinations, according to an announcement Wednesday from the state Health Care Authority. 
Before the bill, states like New Mexico would automatically lower a household’s calculated income by a standard amount if the household received assistance from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. 
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

The deduction is important because it affects how much SNAP benefits a household receives. According to the federal Agriculture Department the standard deduction in New Mexico’s, known as the Heating and Cooling Standard Utility Allowance, is $408. 
However, thanks to the law, that deduction is only automatic for households with members aged 60 or over or those with a disability.. SNAP recipients without those household members will have to jump through other hurdles, including showing utility bills, to receive the deduction. 
HCA officials said the office will provide assistance to recipients with questions about the change. 
“We’re reaching out early so families have time to prepare,”Niki Kozlowski, Income Support Division director at the HCA said in a statement. “If you’re unsure how this affects you, please contact us now, before your next renewal date, so we can walk you through what you may need to provide.” 
The change goes into effect for new benefit applications or renewals beginning Nov. 1. The new requirements don’t affect current SNAP benefits before then, according to the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-10-10 18:57:52.136190

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Washington has abandoned its effort to force Catholic priests and other religious leaders to divulge information on child abuse and neglect they learn of in confession.
With a pair of legal filings, the state agreed not to enforce the controversial provision of a new state law that adds clergy to a list of professions that must report to law enforcement when they have “reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect.” 
Stipulations filed in federal court on Friday will largely preserve the law, while casting aside the controversial component related to confessions. Catholic bishops and Orthodox churches sued over that element, arguing it was unconstitutional.
The agreements the state reached in those cases reflect the preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge that has prevented the state and counties from enforcing the confessional reporting provision since the law took effect July 27.
Lawmakers approved the law during this year’s legislative session, and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed it in May.
The Trump administration had also weighed in on the case, siding with the churches.
In the case brought by three Catholic bishops, U.S. District Court Chief Judge David G. Estudillo ruled that requiring disclosures on information learned in confession infringed on their First Amendment right to practice religion and would force priests to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
State attorneys concluded that, given the judge’s reasoning, settling the legal fights now was the best possible outcome.
“It keeps crucial portions of Washington’s mandatory reporting law in place, while also preserving the Legislature’s authority to address issues with the law identified by the court,” Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. 
Catholic leaders and their lawyers celebrated the legal victory.
“Preventing abuse and upholding the sacred seal of confession are not mutually exclusive — we can and must do both,” said Jean Hill, executive director of the Washington State Catholic Conference.
“That’s why the Church supported the law’s goal from the beginning and only asked for a narrow exemption to protect the sacrament,” she said. “We’re grateful the state ultimately recognized it can prevent abuse without forcing priests to violate their sacred vows.”
Mark Rienzi, president and CEO of Becket, one of several firms involved in the case, called the state’s decision to settle “a victory for religious freedom and for common sense. Priests should never be forced to make the impossible choice of betraying their sacred vows or going to jail.”
But a leader of a group that works to assist individuals abused by clergy members criticized the outcome.
“There are some fights worth fighting for. This is one of them,” said Mary Dispenza of the Catholic Accountability Project. “Priests are not above the law. This secrecy or ‘priest privilege’ fails children and keeps perpetrators safe — able to molest and assault children again and again. The federal judge who blocked [Senate Bill] 5375 is putting the law above the life and protection of children.”
Senate Bill 5375 added clergy to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families. 
A “member of the clergy” is defined in the legislation to cover any regularly licensed, accredited, or ordained minister, priest, rabbi, imam, elder, or similarly positioned religious or spiritual leader.
The three bishops filed their lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Tacoma in May, naming Ferguson, Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties as defendants. The Orthodox Church in America, along with other churches and individual priests, filed a similar case in federal court in Spokane in June.
Both cases and stipulations are now in front of Judge Estudillo in Tacoma. If he signs both orders, they will go into effect and the cases will end.
The stipulations do not require any action by the Legislature, said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Attorney General Brown. It does not foreclose lawmakers addressing pieces of the law the court found problematic if they want, he said.
Ferguson, a Catholic, has said requiring disclosures about information learned in confession did not give him pause and he was disappointed his church was suing “to protect individuals who abuse kids.” State attorneys consulted the governor before deciding to file stipulations in each case.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, wrote the new law, which represents years of effort to add clergy to the state’s list of mandatory reporters.
“My goal all along with this bill has just been to protect children, and I hope that closing the book on this lawsuit allows for that to happen,” she said in an email. 
“Children need to know that when they go to a trusted adult in their life to ask for help, like a member of the clergy, they get help,” Frame said. “That’s how we break the cycle of abuse and do better by our next generation.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-clergy-bill-signing-may-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington’s new sales tax on services faces a second lawsuit that could undercut the state’s moves to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
A Sequim-based security company is suing to pause the tax on its services that took effect last week. 
Security Services Northwest wants the state’s tax on security services blocked until Jan. 1, arguing its implementation moved too quickly and violated due process. The company filed the 6-page lawsuit Sept. 30 in Thurston County Superior Court, with the state, the Department of Revenue and agency director Drew Shirk named as defendants.
A Department of Revenue spokesperson declined to comment on the complaint, other than to say the agency “is reviewing the lawsuit with legal counsel.”
The law in question expanded taxes on a number of services and is expected to fuel $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and over $2.6 billion over four years. Hundreds of millions of dollars will also flow to local governments, as they get a share of state sales tax proceeds. 
Other services covered by the tax law include live presentations, information technology and temporary staffing. 
The levy on investigation, security and armored car services makes up $127 million of the anticipated four-year collections, according to the Department of Revenue. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Security Services Northwest provides security officers, remote video monitoring and security alarm installation. 
Senate Bill 5814, signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson in May, already faces litigation from cable giant Comcast over a separate provision targeting digital advertising services for taxation. Comcast says the statute violates federal law because it doesn’t apply the tax to all advertising services equally.
Late last month, the state filed its response to Comcast in court, disagreeing with the allegations and asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. A hearing in the case could be months away. 
The advertising services tax is projected to bring in $475 million to state coffers over the next two budget cycles. 
The lawsuits bring into question new revenue that state lawmakers relied upon to fill a gaping budget shortfall and fund a $77.8-billion two-year operating budget. The challenged law is part of a package of new and increased taxes and fees that Democrats in the Legislature pushed through this year in hopes of raising $9 billion in the next four years.
Over the summer, the Department of Revenue hosted listening sessions with businesses covered by the new taxes on services. Over 90,000 businesses are expected to pay under the law. Companies complained of a lack of clarity on how the taxes would be implemented and the adverse effects on their bottom line. 
Ahead of the law’s Oct. 1 implementation, the Department of Revenue released detailed guidance on companies’ obligations, including on Sept. 12 for security services. Included in the tax are private investigators, bounty hunters, security guards, fingerprinting, background checks, missing person tracking and lie detectors and polygraphs.
Security Services Northwest says in the lawsuit that this wasn’t enough time to “adapt to and implement internal controls and procedures to ensure that proper sales tax is charged.”
Department of Revenue spokesperson Mikhail Carpenter said the state notified all businesses set to pay the new tax via letter or email between Aug. 13 and Aug. 22. Notices of the changes were also issued in late July, around the time of the listening sessions.

But campus was relatively quiet when it went into effect Friday.,"For much of the last two years, tensions have been elevated on the campus of Yale University, where students protested the Israel-Hamas war with signs, flags and encampments.
But the campus was relatively quiet following the long-awaited announcement of a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. A permanent ceasefire had been a cornerstone demand of Yale protesters. 
On Friday, as the agreement took effect, Yale students said they felt a mix of relief and trepidation about how it would play out. Students said that on campus and online, there was little activity from their peers — on either side of the issue. Some advocates said they planned to continue their activism.
President Donald J. Trump brokered the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza after weeks of negotiations and help from Arab and Muslim allies. The war began after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, when militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted over 250 others. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, displaced most of the population of Gaza and leveled vast areas.
The conflict hit close to home for many students on higher education campuses in the United States, and protests have gripped college communities around the country since the fighting began. Yale was no exception.
Alex Greene, a Yale senior and president of the Peace and Dialogue Leadership Initiative — an educational fellowship that takes Yale and West Point students to Israel, the West Bank and East Jerusalem — said he’s not optimistic about peace prospects in the Middle East because the conflict is so entrenched. 
“Some of the underlying problems are still not addressed,” Greene, who described himself as a political moderate, said. As a result, he said, he expects that “pro-Palestinian protests are not going away. It may not be about the war in Gaza, it may be about the West Bank or something else.”
Still, Greene said he’d seen “surprisingly little” online discourse about the ceasefire, except “maybe a few peers” posting about the return of hostages, specifically videos capturing celebrations in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv.
Yale senior Arjun Warrior, an organizer with Yale’s Endowment Justice Collective — which advocates for ethical distribution of university funds, and has recently researched ties between Yale and Israel — said pro-Palestinian student advocates “feel determined” and will “keep fighting.” 
In a text message, Warrior said the collective remains focused on other long-term goals such as divestment from military weapons manufacturers. “I feel relief, but also grief and uncertainty. This ceasefire is far too late and may not last,” Warrior wrote.
Student protesters at the University of Connecticut also said the ceasefire would not put an end to their activism. A group known as UConn Divest said in a statement that it “understands the ‘ceasefire’ as nothing but empty words to refocus media attention.” 
“So long as the people live under the harshest of conditions, we will continue to fight for them,” the group’s statement read.
On Wednesday, the day before the Israeli Cabinet approved Trump’s deal framework, student protesters staged a “die-in,” lying down on Yale’s Cross Campus green holding pictures of slain Palestinians.
Since the ceasefire went into effect, Yale’s pro-Palestinian activist groups have not posted publicly.
Roee Benya, a Yale junior from Israel, said he is cautiously optimistic about the ceasefire. “Obviously this is great news,” he said. “The most important thing for me as an Israeli is the hostages, bringing them back.”
Benya said he hasn’t seen any visible change at Yale relating to the ceasefire, but he said he thought there might be some next week when Hamas is expected to return the Israeli hostages.
“There has basically been a division in the Yale community between the Palestinian and Israeli camps, and it should have never been like that,” he said. “I hope that a ceasefire will naturally enable getting back to the framework of discussing this conflict.”

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A former Iowa City physician who is suing the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics is now seeking court intervention in a disciplinary case involving allegations of professional incompetence.
In 2021, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Shafik N. Wassef, 42, an Iowa-licensed physician who formerly practiced in Iowa City, with violating patient privacy standards.
A year later, in March 2022, the board amended and expanded its statement of charges in the case, charging Wassef with the added offenses of professional incompetence, practicing in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, and unprofessional conduct.

The board has not publicly disclosed the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges.
In 2024, the board agreed to hand the case off to an administrative law judge. Wassef then sought summary judgment in the case, seeking dismissal of the charges before the planned disciplinary hearing in the case — which is scheduled, according to conflicting court records, on either Nov. 5, 2026, or Nov. 5, 2027.
The administrative law judge denied the request for summary judgment, which prompted Wassef file a petition last month in Polk County District Court, seeking judicial review of the decision.
With that matter still pending before the court, the administrative law judge has agreed to stay any proceedings in the disciplinary case until there’s a court ruling on the summary judgment issue.
In his court petition, Wassef alleges all of the charges against him are “related to alleged violations of federal regulations codifying patient privacy rules.”
Court records indicate Wassef is currently a resident of Florida where he has an active medical license. In his petition, Wassef argues his Florida license will be adversely affected by the pending disciplinary charges if the case is permitted to proceed to a full disciplinary hearing.
The Board of Medicine has yet to file a response to Wassef’s court petition.
Separately, Wassef is currently suing the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, alleging that in June 2018, just before his graduation from the UIHC residency program, he was contacted by the hospital’s compliance office and informed he had “committed multiple violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,” the federal law that includes patient privacy regulations.
The hospital, Wassef alleges, then filed a complaint against him with the state licensing board and contacted the alleged patient “victims” in the matter to inform them of the situation and invite them to make formal complaints with the board.
The lawsuit alleges the hospital’s allegations are false and have caused “catastrophic professional damage in his field that is ongoing to this day.” The hospital has denied any wrongdoing. A trial-setting conference in the case is scheduled for Oct. 22, 2025.

(USDA photo / Christopher Willis)The Montana Department of Commerce is set to divvy out $300,000 in agritourism grant funding following the passage of legislation this session.
The agency is taking applications for the program until Oct. 23 and it’s the second cycle of funding for agritourism in the state, commerce spokesperson Mitch Staley wrote in an email. The funding started in 2023 and was reupped as part of Senate Bill 405, brought by Montana Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, this past session. 
“Especially in some of the more dry land areas, diversifying how they get their income helps alleviate a lot of the risk that some of these farmers, ranchers face with bad weather years,” Zolnikov said during a Senate Finance and Claims meeting earlier this year.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines agritourism as “farm services for recreation (such as hunting or fishing), hospitality (such as overnight accommodations), or entertainment (such as festivals or petting zoos)” which it says generated $1.26 billion in revenue for farms and ranches around the country in 2022. 
This is extra revenue beyond whatever they are generating from farming or cattle ranching operations. America’s farms contributed about $222 billion total to the U.S. economy in 2023.
A new nonprofit, the Montana Agritourism Association, works closely with producers around the state.

“Our work is a producer-led knowledge hub, helping farmers, ranchers and producers open their gates to visitors safely and successfully, connecting them with training, resources and partners across Montana,” said Debbie Queen, an agritourism specialist with the organization. “We focus on three things producers tell us matter most: business fundamentals, safety and risk awareness, and a great guest experience. When those are in place, everybody wins—hosts, visitors, and the local economy.”
A 2024 survey of Montana producers found that 71% said agritourism strengthens their ability to keep working their land, the organization states.
Individual grants are worth up to $50,000, presenters said.
“We’re encouraging projects and activities of all sizes. The intent is to help farmers and ranchers diversify revenue options through a new or enhanced agritourism activity,” Susan Joy, a program specialist with the Department of Commerce said during the presentation. “The grants are also meant to support activities in rural, under visited and tribal locations throughout Montana that will generate tourism revenue for the benefit of your local economy.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/50432161802_dace50f690_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Des Moines Area Community College board officials will consider next week whether to implement a search for an interim president after two of three candidates for the position withdrew from consideration.
Members of the community college’s presidential search committee met Friday to lay out next steps in the presidential search process, starting with questions of whether, and how, to select an interim president. Current DMACC President Rob Denson is set to retire at the end of the year, and two of the three finalists who were expected to come to campus this month for interviews withdrew their bids for the job, the college announced Wednesday.

While no decisions will be made on the search for an interim or permanent president without full board of directors approval, search consultant Larry Ebbers suggested extending the main search into the spring with the goal of starting a new president July 1, with an interim to lead the college in the meantime.
Ebbers reiterated during the meeting that the candidates who pulled out did so for personal reasons, and not because of anything to do with DMACC, and the third candidate told him they would be willing to remain one as the search is extended. He said the mid-year timing of the start date was an issue brought up by candidates.
“Both of them commented to me in their letters of withdrawal that in fact, they thought DMACC was an excellent school and an excellent opportunity, and they were withdrawing for personal reasons only,” Ebbers said.
The DMACC board of directors will conduct its regular meeting Oct. 13, board President Kevin Halterman said, and members will vote on Ebbers’ recommendation to “cultivate additional candidates” and to work with him on an interim president search.
Ebbers said he plans to recommend the board hire an interim president for the period of Jan. 1 to June 30, with the new president scheduled to start July 1. Interviews for additional nominations to the role would take place in late February and early March.
“I’m very comfortable we’ll be able to find a really good president,” Ebbers said. “There’s no question in my mind about that.”
A screening committee of DMACC and other community college officials narrowed down the initial list of more than 50 candidates to six people before handing the names to the presidential search committee to identify finalists, said board member Denny Presnall during the meeting.
Presnall said he was disappointed to hear the now-former candidates hadn’t figured out whether they could make the job work for them by the time they were in the top three, and that the screening committee had eliminated so many people before coming to the search committee.
The presidential search committee can be the group to screen new crops of candidates, Ebbers said, if the board would rather not use a separate screening committee. In searches like this, the initial candidate pool should have a wide range of backgrounds and experience, and Ebbers said that through the first iteration of the search, it’s been made clear that experience in a community college is paramount.
Board member Trish Roberts said anyone who makes it far enough in the selection process should be asked whether they are a “serious candidate,” as it was disheartening to see this happen.
“I understand Denny’s frustration, because we did have good candidates,” Roberts said.

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, urged Senate colleagues to pass a budget resolution to reopen the government and reduce risk of an aviation disaster.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Moran, urged Senate Democrats to end the government shutdown that exacerbates the shortage of air traffic controllers. He argued  reopening government would reduce the risk that personnel or equipment failures could lead to an aviation disaster. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran sounded an alarm that the ongoing federal government shutdown threatened to break the nation’s “fragile” aviation system.
Moran, a Kansas Republican who chairs the Senate’s subcommittee on aviation, space and innovation, made reference to the Jan. 29 crash of a commercial jet from Wichita that collided with a military helicopter in crowded airspace above Washington, D.C.
“Our system is too fragile, and the stakes are too high, for us to continue operating the national aviation system in the manner we are doing so,” Moran said. “We will reach a breaking point, and this could result in the closing of our airspace or portions of it.”
He said he never found value in government shutdowns and urged Senate Democrats to collaborate with Republicans to pass a short-term budget resolution so people could return to their jobs and government work could resume.
The budget impasse prompting closure of nonessential elements of the government reached its 10th day on Friday.
There has been concern that continuation of the political dispute could undermine operation of U.S. airports. Air traffic controllers and TSA officers are considered essential employees and required to work during this period without timely paychecks. The existing national shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by illness of personnel during the shutdown, has been responsible for an increase in flight delays.
“Every day we remain in a shutdown, the air traffic controller shortage gets worse and the strain on the aviation system intensifies,” the senator said in a Senate floor speech. “I hope that this dysfunction we are undergoing … stops before we see dramatic and damaging consequences.”
The U.S. House passed a resolution to keep the government open, but the U.S. Senate hasn’t found the votes to mirror that step.
Moran said failure to “pass a continuing resolution is slowly crushing our aviation system.”
In January, American Airlines Flight 5342 and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter collided mid-air over the Potomac River. The incident near the Reagan National Airport killed 67 people aboard both aircraft, including 64 passengers and crew on the airliner. The jet had departed from Eisenhower National Airport in Wichita.
“We should be doing everything we can to make certain that our air traffic system and the necessary components are in place to make sure that the traveling public has a safe and secure flight when they board a plane in the United States,” he said. “That work is significantly hindered without an open and functioning government.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/U.S.-Sen.-Jerry-Moran-aviation-1024x532.png,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)The Harrisburg man accused of firebombing the Governor’s Residence in April is set to appear in the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas on Tuesday. He faces 50 felony and misdemeanor charges including attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism, aggravated assault and related offenses in connection with the incident.
Cody Balmer, 38, last appeared in magisterial district court April 14, where he pleaded not guilty and District Judge Dale Klein denied Balmer’s attorney’s request for bail, citing a danger to the community if he were released.
Court records list the appearance next week as “plea court.” The Dauphin County district attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the proceeding. 
Neither Balmer’s public defender nor the governor’s office immediately responded to a request for comment.
Balmer turned himself in after allegedly setting off Molotov cocktails in the Governor’s Residence on the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday. Shapiro and his family were sleeping inside. No one was harmed, but the Governor’s Residence suffered major damage.
Following the incident, Balmer called police to turn himself in and told a 911 dispatcher that he “will not take part in [Shapiro’s] plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.”
Shapiro had faced criticism for his support of Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the militant group Hamas, which led to the war in Gaza that has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians. Shapiro also pushed the University of Pennsylvania to quell student protests over Israel’s response.
Shapiro is the highest-ranking Jewish official in Pennsylvania.
Following his arrest, Balmer’s mother told reporters that her son suffered from mental illness, though Balmer denied this at a hearing in April.

Officials with Canyon County announced on Friday that the first section of a new boat ramp at the park was installed. The new project marks the first construction phase of a two-phase process that has been in the works for two years, according to a Canyon County press release. The boat ramp is closed for the season and is not operational while the project continues.
“This has been a huge undertaking and something we are very excited about,” said Nichole Schwend, Canyon County parks director, in the press release. “It’s the first major boater improvement to the park in 30 years.”
The first phase of the project will cost around $600,000, while the second phase is expected to cost around $275,000, the press release said. The project’s cost is offset by two Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation Waterways Improvement Fund grants, which together covered the entire cost of phase one, according to the release.
Schwend said in the release that part of the reason the project took two years to get to this point was to ensure that the new boat ramp would not cause harm to the area or impact archaeological sites.
“Maintaining and preserving the park’s history and archaeology is of the utmost importance,” Schwend said in the release.
Celebration Park, which was established as Idaho’s only archaeological park in 1989, features huge basalt melon gravels deposited by the Bonneville flood that revel petroglyphs believed to be 100 to 10,000 years old. Free guided tours are available during the park’s visitor center hours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Mental Health Department will need an extra $20 million legislative appropriation to cover some costs in the current budget year. 
And in addition to its current state appropriation of $403 million, the agency says it’s requesting an extra $79.5 million in the upcoming budget year. This will cover $20 million in Medicaid matching costs for both the current and upcoming budget year,  $22.5 million in IT software upgrades and $17 million to implement a court agreement to fix the state’s competency restoration system and to cover any related fines for noncompliance.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ $20 million fiscal year 2026 supplemental budget request will cover the agency’s share of Medicaid matching costs, which is the state’s share of the program’s funding. It comes after the agency already received an extra $27.4 million appropriation from the Legislature and as officials continue to cut or eliminate contracts with mental health and substance abuse providers .
The agency was not yet able to provide a number Friday identifying the total scope of these cuts. 
Rep. Carl Newton, R-Cherokee, said Friday he wasn’t familiar with the details of the agency’s budget request, but he’s not surprised that a supplemental appropriation is needed. 
Newton, chair of the House Health and Human Services Oversight Committee and a member of a select committee investigating the department’s finances, said he doesn’t think the Legislature would be opposed to an additional appropriation. 
“We planned on doing a supplemental but we had to make a budget,” he said. “It’s our constitutional responsibility to get (the budget) done by May, and so we get that, but we knew that if they could get a handle on the budget, we’d probably have to add some more to that. But we wanted at least have something to get to them to get started.”
In the tumultuous final weeks of Legislature’s session, deficiencies in the agency’s budget first came to light and led to weeks of investigative hearings, the firing of former Commissioner Allie Friesen and an emergency appropriation so the agency could make payroll. 
Various reports, including from the State Auditor and Inspector and the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency, found a pattern of overspending at the state agency. 
In an attempt to right-size the agency’s budget, at least 300 line items, or parts of provider contracts for specific services, had been identified for cancellation or nonrenewal as part of its process to identify duplicative or unnecessary services. 
Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic, appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, said the cuts “brought spending in line” with the agency’s budget. However, the agency is still receiving invoices for the 2025 budget year. He said that’s a “remnant of past practices” where funding from the current budget year paid for costs from previous years. 
The agency is also struggling to implement a legislatively-approved court settlement that requires the agency to provide improved competency restoration services on a set timeline. The state fell short of the agreed standards during their first compliance check. The settlement sets forth financial penalties for noncompliance.
The Mental Health Department cannot publicly identify a dollar amount for the total scope of contract cuts needed to correct spending until all of these invoices have been received, an agency spokesperson said. 
“Every program has a personal story behind it,” Slavonic said in a statement.  “We understand how much peer support and community services mean to the people they’ve helped. But our responsibility is to fund programs that align with our behavioral health mission, meet statutory requirements and stay within the budget provided by the Legislature.” 
The agency’s contracting process has been “reformed” to ensure a more competitive bidding process with an open request for proposals system, according to a news release. 
“Stabilizing the budget was one of my top priorities, but it’s only part of the story,” Slavonic said. “Reorganization, transparency and meeting our consent decree milestones are equally important. We’re proving that good stewardship and good care go hand in hand.” 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said she’s concerned by the latest budget numbers provided and wants to be sure what data this budget request is based on. She said she needs a better idea of what the agency needs and specifics of their plan for providers. 
“We need a lot more solidity,” she said. “But mental health care does not stay stagnant, so I mean, costs go up and down based on challenges folks are facing. So it’s going to be very hard. We have to look at averages. We have to look at it over time. So I hope they’re using historic data to help inform them”
Kirt said she would like to take action before session begins in February, potentially through a special session. 
“I would love to do a supplemental sooner because I think if these cuts are about cash flow, we need to take care of that,” she said. “If they’re not willing to do a special session … make it be one of the first things we do when session opens.”

State Superintendent Lance Evans and his executive team made a case at the hearings for their $3.38 billion appropriation request from the Legislature this coming year, while senators subtly signaled their support for the state’s public education system. It could foreshadow a fight between the House and Senate in the 2026 legislative session, as the House leadership makes a full-court press for expanding “school choice” and using public money for private education options.
Over the course of two days, Wendy Clemons, the Mississippi Department of Education’s chief academic officer, and Paula Vanderford, chief accountability officer, gave a detailed account of the public education system’s successes over the past 10 years, including increased graduation rates and higher elementary reading and math scores.
A decade ago, Mississippi had some the nation’s lowest fourth-grade reading scores. That changed in 2019 when the state began making headlines for having the most gains in the country in fourth-grade reading.

ExcelinEd’s senior policy fellow Christy Hovanetz moderated the first hearing on Thursday, and said the state’s educational progress is a direct result of targeted policy decisions and funding investment, such as the 2013 literacy act that established a third-grade reading test and drastically changed how reading is taught in Mississippi. MDE has also pushed districts to adopt and teach using “high-quality instructional materials.”
“Mississippi is a national story,” she said. “Be proud of your success. You have done amazing things for students and your state.” 
But there’s more work to do, officials said. 
The agency hopes to build on the work of the literacy act, expanding it into grades 4-8. Data shows that despite “miraculous” growth in reading proficiency among fourth graders, it’s challenging to sustain those gains through eighth grade. Increased math proficiency, too, is a focus for the education department.
And while the state has ramped up teacher recruitment, Mississippi still faces a teacher shortage. That’s largely due to low pay, Vanderford said. 
Though legislators gave teachers a pay raise in 2022, health insurance increases almost immediately absorbed the extra money. Nearby states also have increased teacher pay in recent years. Adjusted for cost of living, the agency says Mississippi’s teacher pay — at $54,200 — is ranked 46th out of 49 states, as of May 2024.
That means Mississippi, once again, is near the bottom.

Legislators seemed surprised to hear that the agency’s accountability model, the system by which schools and districts are measured, was recently revamped to include more college and career standards and is already being implemented across the state. As a result, Vanderford said, we’ll likely see fewer A- and B-rated schools this coming year. 
That’s not an indication that student learning is getting worse, though. This year, there were some A-rated districts with less than half of students proficient in reading or math. The revisions to the accountability model are in effort to increase those proficiency levels, Vanderford said.
The agency also plans to focus on decreasing chronic absenteeism, which is defined as missing 10% of the school year, or 18 days, in Mississippi. Since the pandemic, those absentee rates have seen a significant uptick, according to MDE data. 
Moving forward, the agency will set up consistent systems for documenting absenteeism, emphasize graduation success rather than dropout prevention and build outreach systems to intervene earlier when students start missing school. 
Those efforts will likely also implement the work the agency is doing to support low-performing districts, especially the four struggling “districts of transformation” that the state has taken over. 
“We have no intention of losing momentum,” Evans said at the end of the hearings. “I personally feel the full weight of everything we’ve talked about. I live it every day, and I impose that on the people at the department. 
“We’re not satisfied with where we are. We’re the type of people who will never be satisfied with where we are.”

Senators peppered the education leaders with questions through the two days of presentations, pressing officials on early education initiatives and what they were doing to help the state’s lowest- and highest-achieving students.
Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, said the committee would likely meet again on Oct. 28. 
“We’re on the right track,” he said in closing remarks. “As we move forward, we are hesitant to make major changes in the way we operate. These minor tweaks are necessary. We’re going to keep pushing you as a department to make these changes. We’re here to work with you and give you the tools you need to support these districts.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09143236/3X0A1070.jpg,,,2025-10-10 17:58:36.725728

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A former senior aide to two state Senate leaders is returning to Annapolis, this time as the new budget secretary in Gov. Wes Moore’s Cabinet.
Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann, currently the vice president of government relations and community affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, will succeed Helene Grady, who announced this summer that she was leaving in October.
While Grady has a more traditional budget background, Weissmann brings a depth of relationships with the General Assembly to his new role, at a time when relations between the legislature and the Moore administration are strained.
In announcing the appointment Friday afternoon Moore called Weissmann “an experienced public servant and one of the most effective policy minds in our state.”
“His deep understanding of the Maryland budget, developed over years in both the legislative branch and in local government, makes him uniquely qualified to lead DBM,” Moore said in a prepared statement.
He went on to call the appointment “critical as we continue to execute on our budget priorities to make Maryland more affordable, competitive, and ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”
At UMBC, Weissmann worked to strengthen relationships with policymakers and secure operating and capital funding, according to the governor’s office. It said he has also served as an assistant chief administrative officer for Montgomery County, coordinating economic development and serving as the direct point of contact for several departments, including environmental protection, housing and community affairs, permitting services, and transportation.

“I am humbled and excited to serve under Governor Moore and to honor his administration’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, even during deeply challenging times,” Weissmann said in the statement released by the governor’s office.
“Working in collaboration with our partners in the Maryland General Assembly, we will ensure the steady management and administration of a balanced budget that delivers for all Marylanders,” his statement said.
Weissmann emerged as a late contender for the secretary’s job. The administration had considered a pool of other candidates including Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard); Deputy Treasurer Jonathan Martin; Rich Madaleno, a former Montgomery County senator who served as vice chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, and the current county administrative officer to Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich; and others.
News of Weissmann’s appointment came just two days after Deputy Budget Secretary Marc Nicole was named acting secretary on Wednesday. Nicole will assume that role on Oct. 15; Weissmann is slated to take over as secretary on Oct. 22.
Weissmann holds a bachelor’s degree in social work and psychology from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He earned a master’s degree in social work from the University of Maryland School of Social Work and later a law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
He also currently serves on the Maryland State Board of Elections, a position he may have to give up as he assumes a job that determines the election agency’s budget.
Weissmann has a wealth of Annapolis experience, including three years as the top aide to two Senate leaders. After seven years as deputy chief of staff to Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., Weissmann took over as chief of staff. He remained in that position after Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) succeeded Miller. During his time as a senior adviser to Miller and Ferguson, he did help oversee legislative efforts on the budget.
Weissmann’s collegial demeanor and longstanding ties to the Senate, and by extension the General Assembly, could be an asset to Moore, who is entering the final legislative session of his first term.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore entered office riding a wave of excitement among legislative Democrats who had just finished eight years of partisan conflict with Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. But the relationship between Moore and the legislature has shown signs of strain of late.
Moore’s public positions on issues such as ending automatic inflation-based increases to the gas tax and allowing the sale of beer and wine in grocery stores rankled legislators in his own party. Recent vetoes by Moore, including one on a bill to study the issue of reparations, have drawn open criticism from Democratic lawmakers who are threatening override votes.
Legislative audits are also becoming more critical of Moore’s departments and becoming fodder for public hearings.
On budget issues, there have been frustrations between legislative budget committees and the administration over “miscalculations” including hundreds of millions in underestimated Medicaid costs.
Weissmann’s knowledge of the legislature and personal relationships with many of its leaders could be a balm for Moore’s frayed legislative relationships.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)It’s easy to watch Brad Pitt’s flyline unfurl in a perfect ‘S’ curve over the Gallatin River and know that image has helped feed into Montana’s status as an angling destination. 
It’s more difficult to determine exactly what kind of impact the fishing world has on the Treasure State. 
But that’s what the 2023 Legislature wanted to know when they requested Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks partner with the University of Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research to estimate fishing’s economic contributions across the state. 
The report by the BBER, published in August, showed anglers contributed more than $910 million to Montana’s GDP in 2024 and supported more than $1.5 billion in total economic output — gross receipts to Montana businesses — across the state, making it one of biggest contributor’s to the state’s outdoor economic sector. 
“Fishing is deeply woven into the cultural and economic fabric of Montana,” the study authors wrote. “This study demonstrates that coldwater and warm-water fishing are not only popular recreational activities but also powerful economic drivers that support jobs, income, and business activity across the state.”
Researchers with BBER conducted their study by surveying a random sample of adults who purchased a Montana fishing license last year. The final dataset includes 1,181 completed responses — a roughly 30% response rate. Results were weighted using FWP license data as well as demographic benchmarks. 
The study splits anglers into warm-water fishing and cold-water fishing and analyzes trip-related expenditures among the more than 450,000 adults who purchased Montana fishing licenses in 2024. 
Data published by FWP show the department issued 180,328 individual resident fishing licenses and 261,734 individual nonresident licenses. 
More than 84,000 residents and 30,000 nonresidents also purchased combination licenses in 2024, which include fishing licenses, but the study focused exclusively on individual fishing licenses. 
Data shows that Montana’s fishing season is concentrated between June and October, though a clear bump in two-day license purchases shows the prevalence of ice fishing in the state.

The survey questions focused on trip-related expenditures including guiding services, equipment rentals, food, fuel and lodging, and modeled the corresponding impact to the local and statewide economy. 
A majority of the angling impact in Montana comes from cold-water fishing — for trout, salmon, grayling and whitefish — à la the classic “River Runs Through It” iconography. 
According to the study, these trips tended to be longer, involve more travel and generate higher spending on lodging, guides and dining. Cold-water fishing also weighted more heavily toward nonresidents, with 86% of nonresidents surveyed indicating they only engaged in cold-water fishing, compared to 52% of residents.

Warm-water anglers, by contrast, seek out fish such as walleye, northern pike, bass and sturgeon. These anglers were “overwhelmingly” Montana residents, fishing often and close to home with spending habits that reflected the nature of their trips — fuel and groceries dominated over guides or rentals. 
The average annual trip expenses for resident license holders was $1,897, compared to $3,923 for nonresidents. 
 Residents spend the most on fuel ($337), accommodations ($331) and retail ($284), while nonresidents overwhelmingly spent the most on accommodations ($1,490), outfitter and guiding fees ($704), and dining out ($436). 
In looking at the difference between the two types of fishing, cold-water fishing trips also correlated with significantly higher expenditures compared to warm-water fishing — roughly $4,900 compared to $380 annually. 
“This aligns with the finding that cold-water fishing more often involves travel and planning, while warm-water fishing more often involves shorter, local day trips,” according to the study.

In total for the 2024-2025 fishing season, anglers spent an estimated $1.29 billion on fishing-related goods and services. 
That spending supported an estimated 15,978 jobs, generated $427 million in personal income, and contributed nearly $1.5 billion in total economic output across the state. 
“Montana’s amazing angling opportunities are no secret, but this research shows just how important fishing is to communities and businesses around Montana,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in a statement.
The ripple effects of the angling economy is similarly distributed between the cold-water and warm-water fishing split. 
Among jobs supported by the fishing industry, 14,355 are tied to cold water fishing, while just over 1,600 are tied to warm-water fishing. 
“Though smaller in overall scale relative to cold-water fishing, warm-water fishing still represents an important source of in-state tourism and local spending — particularly for the anglers and businesses surrounding warm-water fisheries,” the study states. 
While researchers note the methodology of the study means that estimates are likely on the conservative side, it shows the broad importance of angling for Montana and highlights the importance of FWP to manage fisheries and waterways. 
“The impact of angler spending extends well beyond the state’s lakes and rivers,” the study concludes. “Whether through the wages paid to workers, the profits earned by local businesses, or the taxes collected by governments, the dollars spent by anglers flow throughout Montana’s economy.”
Here are a few additional highlights from the economic impact of Montana anglers:

450,000+ Individual Montana fishing licenses purchased by residents and nonresidents. 


33.6% of license holders reported not fishing once during the license year. 


41% of Montana residents who purchased a fishing license did not fish last year. 


7 average number of days Montana resident license holders spent fishing last year.

A particular concern for administrators is a new requirement that demands Medicaid recipients report their work status at least twice per year. A similar requirement implemented in Arkansas led to 18,000 people becoming uninsured.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Health care providers eye collaboration as federal cuts loom.","Lamoille County Mental Health Services in Morristown. Photo via Facebook
This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 9, 2025.
Area health care providers specializing in treatment for mental health-related issues and substance-use disorders are collaborating to better serve their shared patients, even as looming cuts to public insurance threaten to make treatment more challenging.
Lamoille County Mental Health Services CEO Jennifer Stratton, who has been on the job for about 18 months, said working with other health care providers like Lamoille Health Partners and Copley Hospital — as well as area law enforcement agencies — has been a main priority.
Both Lamoille Health Partners and Lamoille County Mental Health Services serve patients with overlapping health issues. Stratton said she often meets with health partners CEO Susan Bartlett, as many patients have what she calls co-occurring needs, which refers to their intersecting medical problems like substance-use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Lamoille County doesn’t have the “situation table” setups being explored in other Vermont towns — formal protocols for involving various health care, social support and police organizations when dealing with cases where various issues intersect. Instead, the Lamoille Health Collaborative, founded by Lamoille Health Partners to address the increasingly overlapping health issues faced in the early pandemic period, allows organizations to coordinate. 
Lamoille County Mental Health Services fields an around-the-clock crisis response team that responds, alongside police, to mental health emergencies. Many of them occur at Copley Hospital, leading Stratton to work closely with CEO Joe Woodin to coordinate resources.
Between the local Lamoille Health Collaborative, and the Woodin-led New England Health Collaborative — which includes other Vermont hospitals, the Lamoille Health Partners and other organizations — health care providers in Lamoille County have never been so strategically aligned, their executives say.
In one small example of how the health collaborative members look out for one another, the Lamoille Health Partners sold Lamoille County Mental Health Services some equipment for new sensory room equipment.
It may soon be more necessary than ever. 
Last year, Lamoille Health Partners laid off its former director and sold off its two Washington Highway offices to Copley Hospital to stem a financial crisis. 
And looming cuts to Medicaid, passed in the so-called “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” in July by the Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump, would eliminate about $1 trillion in funding over 10 years for the federal program that provides insurance to low-income and disabled people, and children. Those cuts would particularly threaten funding for rural health care providers.
“At Lamoille County Mental Health Services — and I’m sure I’m speaking collectively for all of the individuals who are part of the Lamoille Health Collaborative, because we all work really well together — we want to meet the needs of our community and the individuals,” Stratton said. “If we’re not receiving the funding to do so, we can’t. Most of us are so dependent on Medicaid that it makes it difficult, financially, to be able to continue to provide those services without individuals receiving that funding.”
Bracing for impact
Stratton worries not just about a larger number of uninsured patients but also about the new work requirement provisions included in the bill that demand Medicaid recipients report their work status at least twice a year. A health policy research report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a similar program implemented in Arkansas led to 18,000 people becoming uninsured.
“Individuals are going to have to be reapplying for their Medicaid twice a year, and I am concerned that there’s going to be a lot of individuals that are going to be kicked off, at least temporarily, for their Medicaid,” Stratton said.
This potential change could mean even those who do continue to qualify for public insurance will face increased bureaucratic barriers and a higher likelihood of insurance interruptions. For patients juggling an interconnected suite of ailments across multiple doctors and specialists, even a brief interruption in insurance can delay necessary and potentially life-saving treatment.
Stratton has started an effort to get Lamoille County Mental Health Services staff trained as Medicaid assessors, which will allow them to have better access to patient’s insurance applications, and has urged her fellow health collaborative members to train their staff members as well.
Copley CEO Woodin echoed that sentiment.
“I think we’re always relearning that we need each other,” Woodin said. “Hospitals, primary care, specialists, home health agency, nursing home. We’re all sort of a team taking care of the same folks, so it’s important that we get along and support each other.”
On the front lines
The ongoing shutdown of the federal government stems from an effort by Democratic lawmakers, including Vermont’s federal delegation, to force Republicans to reverse planned cuts to Medicaid and public option insurance subsidies passed in their bill over the summer. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders told CNN on Tuesday he was concerned the proposed cuts could “literally collapse the entire (health care) system.”
At the Johnson Health Center, directors Geoff and Caroline Butler are on the frontline of a system that is already badly frayed, providing primary care with a substance-use disorder focus in both Johnson and Burlington.
“The looming cuts are something that we think about every day over at the health center,” Geoff Butler said. “With the potential of thousands of Vermont owners losing their coverage, it’s a devastating thought.”
At the health center, patients are already being treated for their intersecting medical, mental health and addiction issues, and staff are already trained to assist patients with insurance paperwork, and they have an on-staff social worker. Butler said it’s the material issues — like access to housing, something that no doctor can address — that are the biggest barriers to care.
“I think one of the biggest things though we are seeing lately with mental health and substance-use issues is housing,” Butler said. “We work with the majority of the unhoused population in Burlington, and that housing piece, making sure people are housed through the winter, at least have a warm place to go for the night.”
In a recent policy report from the Vermont Department of Health laying out initiatives for the next five years, the first goal proposed is to “improve the availability of affordable, accessible, and safe housing.” The fourth goal proposed is to “strengthen the capacity of the mental health and substance use services system to support individuals and communities.”
There are already “no great options for inpatient mental health care in Vermont,” Butler said, and long waiting lists for those that are there. Lamoille County Mental Health Services has a handful of beds in Morrisville and Johnson, and a couple of beds dedicated to the needs of patients in crisis.
“The organizations doing that work are doing great work. It’s just so limited,” Butler said.

Florida Open Primaries, an advocacy group working to open Florida’s closed primary voting system, along with the group Open Primaries and its Let Us Vote campaign, says that of the 626 Florida Democrats surveyed, 87% support having the party unilaterally open its primary election to nonparty-affiliated (NPA) voters. Among the 684 NPA voters surveyed, 80% support the proposal.
Florida is a closed primary election state. That means only registered voters from the Republican and Democratic parties can participate in partisan primary elections.  Election observers nationally disagree about how many states are truly “closed” primaries. Ballotpedia says 13 states require closed primaries. The National Conference of State Legislatures puts the number at nine.
Whatever, the survey found that 96% of NPA voters in Florida and 93% of Florida Democratic voters support open primaries.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said earlier this year that she and her staff were collecting information about an open primary to present to party members. The Phoenix reported in July that the proposal was controversial among some Democrats, who feared it would divide a party that hasn’t seen a member of its ranks win a statewide race since 2018.
Jeremy Gruber, senior vice president of Open Primaries, says that the organization conducted the survey of 1,310 Florida voters by itself, without assistance from an outside firm.
The Florida Democratic Party did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo via Google Earth)Attorneys for Summit Carbon Solutions argued Friday in Polk County District Court that the company’s proposed amendment to its permit for a carbon sequestration pipeline through Iowa should be decided on before a legal case against the permit can move forward. 
The Iowa Utilities Commission approved a permit in June 2024 for Summit Carbon Solutions to build more than 600 miles of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Iowa, with the condition that the company gain permits in the Dakotas before beginning construction. 
The Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, along with several counties and individual landowners, then filed a lawsuit in fall 2024, seeking to overturn the IUC’s permit approval. The lawsuit alleged the proceedings were unfair and that Summit did not meet the definition of a common carrier.

Summit filed a petition with the IUC on Sept. 15 to amend its approved permit. The amendment would remove the condition that required approval in the Dakotas and add several route and pipe-size modifications to the permit. This action followed Summit’s second permit denial in South Dakota and the enactment of a law barring the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines in the state.

Summit also requested the court remand the Sierra Club and landowners’ case to the IUC and stay any future actions on the case until the IUC decided on the filed amendment petition. This was the issue before Polk County District Court Judge Scott Beattie Friday morning. 
Summit’s attorney, Bret Dublinske of Fredrickson & Byron in Des Moines, argued the IUC needed to rule on the amendment petition before the case against the permit could proceed. 
He argued the facts in the case would be outdated once the IUC ruled on the amendment and the courts would be presented with either duplicative litigation or a scenario in which the ruling did not match the most recent version of the permit. 
“It makes little sense to proceed to litigate over outdated facts that are in the process of being amended, and would be contrary to judicial economy to split the Summit 1.0 case in such a way that it may be litigated twice – once for the original permit and once for the decision on the Petition to Amend that permit,” Summit wrote in its request to remand the case. 
Wally Taylor, on behalf of the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, argued Summit did not supply sufficient information as to how the amendment would change the nature of the lawsuit against the IUC’s decision.
“The proposed amendment does not impact any of the issues in this decision,” Taylor argued. “… It does not change the lack of public convenience and necessity, the issue of eminent domain, the damage to farmland … none of the petitioners have raised issues about the route or even impact of the condition on the South Dakota permit.” 
Taylor asked the court to deny the motion to remand the case to the IUC. 
Brian Jorde with Domina Law Group, based in Nebraska, represented landowners in the case and took a similar stance to Taylor, arguing it would make more sense for the case to continue without regard to Summit’s amendment with the IUC, so that the Iowa Supreme Court can give guidance on the carbon pipeline issue.
Jorde said the landowners and affected parties in the case “don’t need to go through eight more weeks of hearings” in the multi-year case for the same “mistakes” to be made by the IUC on the amendment.

“We need guidance from the Supreme Court; frankly, the IUC needs guidance from the Supreme Court,” Jorde said. “Is a carbon dioxide pipeline that you know has no drop off points in the state of Iowa,  does that promote public convenience and necessity? We need the Supreme Court to tell us, or we’re just going to have 15, potentially, other dockets fighting that same issue.” 
Michelle Rabe, on behalf of the Iowa Utilities Commission, said while the IUC believes Summit’s request for remand is, “slightly outside” of how a remand is typically used, she believes there are three options forward, “none of which are ideal.”
Rabe said Beattie could deny the remand and allow the case to continue, in which case it would advance through the courts until eventually the Supreme Court issues what she said could be a “moot order” at that point because the permit might have changed via the IUC proceedings. 
The second option she presented was for the court to grant the remand and allow the IUC to rule on the amendment, in which case she predicted the parties would appeal the IUC’s decision and then the courts would be presented with potentially “parallel” cases. 
The third option, she said, would be for the court to stay the decision and allow the IUC proceedings to play out, so that when that decision is appealed, the two cases can be consolidated. 
“I don’t think there’s a clean way to do it at this point,” Rabe said. “I think what Summit is asking … on the amendment, may not directly affect the bigger issues in the case. I think potentially it could, but we don’t know.” 
Summit to change routes?
Summit’s amendment petition with the IUC, per Dublinske and the filing, does not seek to do away with the IUC’s protections against a “pipeline to nowhere.” Instead of listing North Dakota as the ending point, Summit asks the permit be changed to instead condition pipeline construction to the company’s securement of “access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage.”
Dublinske said the changes that occurred in South Dakota since the permit was issued, along with carbon sequestration site potential in Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas, are “fundamentally the reasons” the company submitted the amendment and requested the remand in the case. 
Opponents suggested the amendment means that Summit plans to change its original route, which would have ended in North Dakota where the CO2 could be pumped into an underground rock formation. 
A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the amendment “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota.” 
“Our focus is on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” the spokesperson said.
Beattie said he will work to issue an order as soon as possible, though he suspected it would be a “couple of weeks” before he able to issue a written order.

Oct. 10, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAfter the preliminary examination of former attorney general candidate Matt DePerno and former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) kicked off on Thursday, the review of evidence has been put on pause over a dispute on whether a series of text messages should be admitted as evidence.
Rendon and DePerno, as well as attorney Stefanie Lambert Junttila, were indicted in 2023, following an investigation into potential tampering with election equipment following the 2020 election, led by Special Prosecutor D.J. Hilson.
The three defendants are each accused of participating in a conspiracy to gain access to voting tabulators, where a group of information technology experts allegedly performed “testing” on the machines. 
While Lambert Junttila opted to move straight to trial, Judge Jeffery S. Matis of the Oakland County Circuit Court moved for DePerno and Rendon’s case to be remanded to the 44th District Court in Royal Oak for a preliminary examination, where Judge Derek Meinecke is reviewing the evidence brought by the prosecution to determine whether it is sufficient to move to trial.

Although the prosecution planned to reference the text messages on Friday as part of its examination of Ben Cotton – one of the IT specialists who allegedly examined voting machines from Barry, Missaukee and Roscommon counties – DePerno’s attorney, Michael Cronkright, objected, arguing the text messages were privileged work products tied to Deperno’s case seeking a “forensic audit” of election results in Antrim County. 
A human error in reporting unofficial 2020 election returns in Antrim County briefly showed former President Joe Biden had won the GOP stronghold. While the results were later corrected, the error sparked conspiracy theories in line with President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was rigged. 
According to a report from the Detroit News, the text messages at issue were initially raised during preliminary examination on Thursday. The messages stemmed from a group called “Michigan forensics” where DePerno exchanged messages with cybersecurity specialists about unproven theories that technological issues contributed to President Donald Trump’s loss in the 2020 election. 
DePerno’s Antrim County case was dismissed by the 13th Circuit Court in May of 2021 and was subsequently rejected by the Michigan Court of Appeals and the state Supreme Court.
After a bench conference with Hilson and his assistant prosecutor Heather Bloomquist, as well as Cronkright and Rendon’s attorney Camilla Barkovic, Meinecke postponed further examination until both parties are able to file a motion on whether the text messages should be permitted. The court will hear the motions on Nov. 21. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hilson called the decision to delay further examination “an unfortunate glitch in the proceedings.”
“Certainly we feel very confident about the evidence that we want to introduce, and I understand the due process aspect of it, and we’re just going to go through that and hopefully the judge sees it our way,” Hilson told reporters. “Ultimately, if he doesn’t, we’re still going to move forward, because I still think that our witnesses helped carry this case.”
According to Hilson, the text messages originated from Cotton’s cell phone.
While speaking with reporters, Deperno maintained that the messages were a work product from the Antrim County case, where Cotton had served as an expert witness. He said Cotton had been threatened with prosecution if he did not turn over the messages. 
“They’re clearly work product and attorney client privilege and only Bill Bailey can waive that privilege,” DePerno said. 
Bailey, DePerno’s client in the Antrim County case, died in 2024.
While DePerno has filed campaign finance paperwork to run for Michigan attorney general in 2026, he would not confirm to reporters whether he was once again seeking the position. 
“I’m not saying I am and I’m not saying I’m not,” he said. 
The preliminary examination is tentatively scheduled to continue on December 18 and 19.

(Getty Images)West Virginia pharmacists can now give COVID-19 shots without prescriptions, according to guidance issued Oct. 6 by the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy.
Earlier in the season, prescriptions were required because of a state law that requires pharmacists to have a valid prescription for a vaccine they administer unless the shots are on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list of recommended vaccines.
The CDC panel met Sept. 19. On Oct. 6, the agency officially adopted the panel’s recommendations that vaccinating everyone aged six months and up be determined by individual decision-making.
Some pharmacies, including Walgreens locations in the state, have been administering the vaccines with no prescription for longer. A Walgreen’s spokeswoman said the pharmacy began offering the shot with no prescription on Sept. 12. 
According to the state Board of Pharmacy: People over age 65 years and those with conditions that put them at increased risk for severe COVID-19 benefit the most from vaccination. Those conditions can include cancer, kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes and other health conditions. 
In the state of West Virginia’s guidance to public health partners, it notes that the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, including pregnant women, and for children ages 6 to 23 months. People aged 2 through 18 should get a COVID-19 shot if they’re at increased risk of severe COVID, the agency recommends. 
State guidance also notes that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children 6-23 months old and all children who have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 receive a vaccine. AAP also recommends vaccinating children who live in long-term care facilities and those who live with people at high risk for severe COVID-19.

Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday afternoon that he’s creating a new court in Chittenden County that will address the county’s backlog in legal cases by trying repeat offenders. 
The new court, called The Community Accountability Court, is part of Scott’s “response to increased concerns about quality of life crimes and disorder in Burlington,” according to a press release from his office. 
The initiative comes about a month after Scott declared he had a plan to address public safety concerns, many related to drug use, in the Queen City. Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak previously claimed that Scott wasn’t doing enough to help the city combat persistent social and economic challenges.

The new court will target additional resources for three to four months toward trying repeat offenders who have many pending legal cases against them, the press release said. It’s part of a multi-step plan Scott plans to roll out in the coming days. 
“These additional resources for the Chittenden County Superior Court will help alleviate the backlog, ensure people receive a trial, and provide the kind of immediate follow up that is necessary for (Burlington Police Department)’s enforcement activities to be most effective,” Mulvaney-Stanak said in the governor’s release. 
She and Scott are discussing immediate solutions, like the new court, as well as long-term strategies, Mulvaney-Stanak said in the release. 
Chittenden County Criminal Court, from July through September of this year, has seen a large uptick in criminal cases, Defender General Matt Valerio told a legislative committee Thursday. Public defenders in the county are handling a 37% increase in criminal cases compared to the same quarter of last year, he said. 
That’s a big issue because 39% of total legal cases in the state come from Chittenden County, Valerio said. So when that county’s courts are backed up, it has a really outsized impact on the state, he said. 
In Vermont criminal court, public defenders represent over 90% of people accused, Valerio said in an interview. That makes their caseload pretty representative of how many cases the courts are handling more broadly. 
A dedicated judge will be appointed by the judiciary to oversee the new court, and Scott will select a prosecutor to handle the cases litigated within it, the release said. 
This story will be updated.

Janet Mills is urging Maine voters to reject the referendum question on the Nov. 4th ballot initiative that aims to require voters to show identification at the polls. “Our elections are already safe, secure, and trustworthy,” Mills said in her weekly radio address Friday. “Let’s not make it harder for Maine people to exercise […]","Voting at the Portland Expo on Tuesday was steady and smooth, said poll workers. (Emma Davis/Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills is urging Maine voters to reject the referendum question on the Nov. 4th ballot initiative that aims to require voters to show identification at the polls.
“Our elections are already safe, secure, and trustworthy,” Mills said in her weekly radio address Friday. “Let’s not make it harder for Maine people to exercise that important freedom. Reject Question 1 at the ballot box on November 4th.”
The campaign for this referendum question was launched in April 2024 by the Dinner Table PAC as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at polling places. The submitted proposal also seeks to modify a variety of election laws including absentee voting, according to the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January. 
Though there was pushback on the wording from the campaign and its proponents, Maine’s highest court gave it the OK in mid-July. 
Mills argued that the changes proposed in Question 1 would make it harder for seniors, people with disabilities, rural residents, first responders and workers with unpredictable schedules to vote by banning pre-paid return postage for absentee ballots and prohibiting voters from requesting absentee ballots by phone or through family members.
The proposal also seeks to repeal the current provision in statute allowing immediate family members to drop off ballots for each other. It also wants to roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to have absentee ballots mailed to them automatically for each election cycle. This option was implemented last February for voters over the age of 65 who self-identify as having a disability.
Additionally, the petition would remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes, instead requiring them to only have one. 
The petition also seeks to change the process for challenging someone’s right to vote. Under current law, it is up to a challenger to prove that someone doesn’t have the right to vote in a certain election. Challenged voters may still cast a ballot, but it is marked as being challenged so that it can be reviewed in the event of a close race.
“Whether you vote in person or by absentee ballot, you can trust that your vote will be counted fairly,” Mills said. “But that fundamental right to vote is under attack from Question 1.”
The democratic governor, who is poised to announce a run for U.S. Senate to challenge Republican Susan Collins, has also come out against Question 2 on the November ballot, which seeks to implement a red flag law.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A white banner spanning the width of the Chartercare Foundation’s website declares its independence from the similarly named Chartercare Health Partners.
“To our Supporters and Clients: The recent notification of bankruptcy for Chartercare Health Partners does not apply to the Foundation,” the notice reads. “We are a separate and distinct 501(3) community foundation and have been since our inception in 2014.”
And yet, the prospective buyer for Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence, is looking to the charitable foundation to help finance the purchase of the struggling hospitals that the nonprofit was created to support, as first reported by The Providence Journal.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation, confirmed the Atlanta nonprofit wants a “return” of donations meant to help the hospitals before they parted ways with the foundation in 2014. 
“As the original donors intended, these funds would be dedicated to supporting the mission and work of the hospitals, to support access to programs and services for our most vulnerable patients, many of whom are [on] Medicaid and Medicare,” Brown said in an email Friday. “The hospitals continue to provide a significant amount of uncompensated care, which these funds would also support. Consistent with our new 501c3 status, we would also be concentrating resources on our community health needs assessment and priority areas, consistent with state health equity initiatives.”
Brown did not specify the amount of money CharterCare Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s local subsidiary, wants from the foundation. However, Brown noted the foundation’s sizable assets — $6.8 billion as of September 2024, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Since the split in 2014, Roger Williams and Fatima have struggled to stay afloat under the financial and operational mismanagement of its now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings. Meanwhile, the foundation — which has an office in North Providence two miles west of Fatima hospital — has carved out a niche in local health care grants and student scholarships while paying the six-figure salary of its executive director, Paula Iacono, according to tax filings. Iacono, the only paid employee, with a $101,616 salary in fiscal 2023, declined to comment when reached by email Friday.
Like the foundation, Iacono used to be connected to the hospitals directly, helping raise money for their operations and related primary care and specialty clinics, according to news reports.
That changed in 2014, when Prospect bought Roger Williams and Fatima, turning them from nonprofit to for-profit entities no longer able to accept tax-exempt charitable contributions. The foundation split off as its own organization, and Iacono followed.
The pending sale to The Centurion Foundation, if finalized, returns the hospitals to nonprofit ownership — making them eligible to take back the donations made on its behalf through the foundation years ago.
“We believe this development makes a strong argument for returning these assets to their rightful purposes,” Brown said in an email.
Support from lawmakers
Centurion has enlisted heavy hitters on Smith Hill to back up its request.
“These hospitals are critical community assets which need to be preserved, employing roughly 2,400 people and providing essential community hospital services to thousands of Rhode Islanders, including over 50,000 emergency room visits last year alone,” reads the Oct. 3 email signed by Senate President Valarie Lawson, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and 75 other members of the Rhode Island General Assembly.
The email, addressed to Patricia Wegrzyn McGreen, president of the foundation’s board of directors, urges the foundation to consider returning some of the donations received when it was still linked to Roger Williams and Fatima hospitals to help Centurion close the deal.










We believe this development makes a strong argument for returning these assets to their rightful purposes.


– Otis Brown, spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation


Brown said Gov. Dan McKee and local physicians have also “fully supported” its request. McKee’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday afternoon.
Not named among the supporters: Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who has played a key role in reviewing and setting conditions on the pending sale.
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said they were “not in a position to comment at this time,” in an email Friday.
Since granting conditional approval for the sale in June 2024, the state’s top prosecutor has kept close watch on the transaction, agreeing to four rounds of revisions to aid Centurion in financing the deal.
Finding investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds — lowered from a $165 million value earlier this year — has proven difficult. Centurion executives blamed the challenge on the financial conditions imposed by state regulators, which include an upfront cash injection into the hospitals’ balance sheet. But credit ratings agencies may have also spooked investors, noting the “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s pending bonds in ratings assessments earlier this year. Meanwhile, federal spending cuts are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks. 
But without the bonds — or an alternative source of funding, such as decade-old donations — the sale appears at risk of failure, in turn putting the hospitals in jeopardy. 
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, equal to more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide.
Neronha has repeatedly warned of the cascading consequences if either or both hospitals close, a concern echoed by state lawmakers in their letter to the foundation.
“We are deeply concerned that the closure of these hospitals would cause a significant loss of access to emergency room care, primary care, cancer treatment, behavioral health and substance abuse treatment services to thousands of Rhode Islanders that we represent, many of whom are ill-equipped to find other hospital-based services,” the letter states. “These hospitals are vital safety-net health care facilities, with a large majority of their patients being covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Significant impacts would also be felt by other hospitals in the region and the delivery of emergency services in communities around the state.”
Neronha said in an interview on WPRI-TV 12’s Newsmakers Friday that he expects the bond sale to close by the end of the month.

Biden’s Energy-Efficient Home Credit to End in 2025 After Big Beautiful Bill, Time Running Out to Save $2000.  
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware homeowners planning to upgrade their homes with new insulation, energy-efficient windows, or heat pumps will need to act fast. A federal tax credit that helps offset the cost of energy-saving improvements is ending much sooner than expected.
The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, originally allowed homeowners to claim 30% of the cost of certain energy-efficient upgrades made through 2032. But under the new One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, that timeline has been sharply cut short.
Early Sunset, Big Impact
The credit will now expire after December 31, 2025, reducing the available window for improvements from ten years to just three. Qualifying upgrades must be installed and in service by the end of 2025 to count.
The program provides annual credits of up to $1,200 for improvements like doors, windows, insulation, and home energy audits, and up to $2,000 for high-efficiency systems such as heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and biomass stoves or boilers.
“The early sunset means homeowners who were spacing out upgrades over several years will need to accelerate plans,” said Ben Boyce Sr., owner of Aire Serv Heating and Air. “We’re already hearing from homeowners who are electing to try to squeeze in an upgrade before the deadline.”
No Carryover or Refunds
The credit remains nonrefundable—it can reduce a taxpayer’s bill but cannot produce a refund. Unlike before, unused credits can no longer be carried forward to future tax years.
In another change, beginning in 2025, only equipment from qualified manufacturers with a product ID number listed on the tax return will be eligible.
The related Residential Clean Energy Credit, which covered solar panels and battery storage, was also cut short and will now end after 2025, instead of 2032.
Delaware Families May Feel the Pinch
For Delaware and Brandywine Valley families, the shortened timeline could pose challenges. Many households planned to take advantage of both federal and local incentives, such as Delmarva Power’s energy efficiency rebates, to make upgrades affordable over time.
“This was a well-designed, bipartisan incentive that encouraged smart energy investments,” said Evans. “Cutting it short removes an important tool for families trying to lower energy bills and improve their homes responsibly.”
Homeowners can still claim the credit for qualifying projects completed in 2023, 2024, or 2025 using IRS Form 5695.

Cecil Brockman (Photo: ncleg.net)A judge has set bond at $1,050,000 for Rep. Cecil Brockman during a Friday court appearance after he was charged with multiple sex crimes against a minor.
Brockman, a 41-year-old Democrat who represents Guilford County, appeared over video call from a hospital room during his first court hearing. He was arrested Wednesday and charged with two counts of indecent liberties with a child and two counts of statutory rape of a 15-year-old victim, according to a Guilford County magistrate’s order.
Initially set to appear at the Guilford County Courthouse in Greensboro on Thursday, Brockman’s hearing was postponed until Friday after he was hospitalized due to a medical emergency. Court staff informed reporters late Friday morning that the hearing would be moved from 2 p.m. to 11:30 a.m.
Brockman wore a hospital gown and appeared to have a patch on his chest during the video call, the News and Observer reported.
Greensboro attorney Alec Carpenter represented the lawmaker. He told the court Brockman is waiving his indigency claim. Carpenter did not immediately return a call Friday afternoon.
Judge Gordon Miller said the maximum sentence Brockman faced was life in prison without parole, according to the News and Observer.
Miller ordered Brockman not to have contact with the victim and to remain in the state of North Carolina, WFMY reported. If Brockman makes bail, he must wear an ankle monitor.
During Friday’s hearing, Guilford County District Attorney Avery Crump said Brockman met the minor on an online dating app near Atlanta in May. He lived with the teen there, and the two moved to an apartment in High Point in August.
The victim turned 15 in June.
Prosecutors said Brockman tried to track the victim through Life360 on Sunday, sending an Uber to the minor’s location, according to WFMY. After the driver was unable to find the victim, Brockman directed 911 to the location in Davidson County.
Law enforcement contacted the High Point Police Department, who in turn reached out to the State Bureau of Investigation, FOX8 News reported.
Brockman reportedly made attempts to gain access to the victim while the minor was in a local hospital on Wednesday, including attempting to enter a locked room, reports said.
The victim’s phone contained 14 videos, some of which allowed officials to identify Brockman, multiple outlets reported.
Brockman’s next court date is scheduled for Nov. 13.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Sales of Minnesota products to foreign countries fell by 19% over the past year, according to data released Friday by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. 
The steep decline was driven by a falloff in sales to Minnesota’s three top trading partners: Mexico, China and Canada. American consumers and companies are paying 25% to 35% taxes on imports from those countries, and President Donald Trump threatened again Friday to hike taxes on Chinese goods even higher. 
Minnesota has been hit harder than the nation as a whole: U.S. exports overall were up 6% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. 
Exports to Canada — the largest buyer of Minnesota goods — have dropped by 45% in one year. Mineral oil and fuel exports to Canada accounted for more than half of the overall decline in exports, according to DEED. Canada imported 96% less oil from Minnesota last quarter than in the second quarter of 2024.
“Minnesota’s export statistics were particularly sensitive to changes in the oil market this quarter, but overall declines to our biggest export markets illustrate the risk of tariff uncertainty to our economy,” DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek said in a press release.
Excluding mineral oil and fuel, exports of other goods fell by 10%, with machinery, vehicles, optic and medical equipment and some construction materials seeing the steepest drops. International sales of electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, dairy, eggs and honey all increased. 
Minnesota soybean producers are particularly concerned because their largest buyer, China, has not purchased American soybeans since May. (Argentina is filling the gap in the market while receiving financial assistance from the U.S. to stabilize its economy.) Meat exports to China from Minnesota have dropped 45% over the past year. 
Exports to some countries, including several in Europe, are up from this time last year. The Trump administration brokered a trade deal with the European Union in July, bringing tariffs to 15% with some exceptions.

The Essex town planning commission denied a zoning request from the state that would have advanced plans to build a new women’s prison. 
The decision, the latest roadblock in state attempts to build new secure facilities for adults and juveniles, may force officials back to the drawing board as they evaluate how to address ongoing challenges with Vermont’s existing women’s prison, which is overcrowded and in need of significant repairs.
“I’m not against the concept of a prison,” Joshua Knox, the commission’s chair, said at the Thursday night meeting before the vote. But he and other members felt the state was unable to make key promises, such as ensuring public transportation near the potential facility. “I want that to be locked in and decided,” he said. 
All commission members casting a vote rejected moving forward with the state’s zoning request.
The vote may end a 14-month process during which the Department of Corrections and Department of Buildings and General Services considered two state-owned properties in Essex as possible sites for a new women’s correctional and reentry facility.

Women incarcerated in Vermont are currently detained at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington. But the facility, built in the 1970s, suffers from faltering infrastructure, issues that women held there have said they want addressed. In recent weeks, the prison has hit capacity, with some units holding more women than they were designed to. 
Irene Wrenner, an Essex town resident and a former state senator, spoke at Thursday’s meeting about the importance of constructing a more dignified prison. 
“The showers reeked of human waste and were infested with sewer flies, maggots and mold,” she told the planning commission, describing the South Burlington prison. 
While Essex residents who participated in recent public meetings about a possible new prison have been split on their views, most have opposed building a new facility in Essex.
Haley Sommer, a Department of Corrections spokesperson, said the state was still evaluating the planning commission’s decision and what it means for future plans for a new women’s prison.

New Mexico lobbyists have continued spending at the highest level in at least five years, according to the latest state filings, shelling out more than $230,000 to wine and dine lawmakers, along with other expenditures, over the last few months. 
In total, 140 lobbyists reported $234,000 in expenditures between May and October, including paying for mailers, catering legislative meetings or holding events.
Lobbyists were required Oct. 8 to report their last few months of expenditures and political contributions.
The recent expenditures bring the total spent so far this year to a little over $1.26 million, which is already the most spent since at least 2021, even with two months left in the year. Lobbyists have spent, on average, about $750,000 annually the last four years.
The biggest spender in the latest reporting period, University of New Mexico lobbyist Mike Puelle, reported spending about $38,000 between May and October, including approximately $20,000 alone for a single event: the late September “1st Annual Rivalry Weekend” football game between UNM and New Mexico State University. 
According to Puelle’s filings, he invited state lawmakers, along with the other local and state officials and staff from both universities.

Most of his other expenditures covered catering meetings of interim legislative committees, including ones discussing radioactive and hazardous materials, health care, economic development and more. 
Puelle did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment Thursday about his spending on behalf of the state’s biggest university. He is one of seven UNM lobbyists, according to Secretary of State filings.
While state law requires lobbyists to periodically report their spending, it does not require them to tell the public which bills they’re lobbying for or against.
The Legislature earlier this year passed House Bill 143, which would have required lobbyists to specify the legislation they hoped to influence, as well as their employers’ positions on specific bills. But Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed it, saying that while she supported the bill’s intent, it would impose “an onerous requirement” on lobbyists and their employers and that some of its provisions were unclear.
Recent ProPublica reporting tied the New Mexico governor’s veto to nationwide rollbacks of state-level transparency and ethics legislation. 
While state law does not require lobbyists to specify bill numbers, the second-biggest spender in the most recent reporting period did so voluntarily.
Sarah Hetemi, reported more than $32,000 in spending as a lobbyist for Americans For Prosperity, a conservative think tank founded by the billionaire Koch brothers.
All Hetemi’s spending, according to her filings, related to House Bill 11, the Paid Family and Medical Leave bill. She reported spending money on mailers thanking lawmakers for opposing the bill or criticizing those who supported it. The bill did not pass the Senate.
The biggest spender this year so far is Missi Currier, CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. According to her latest spending report, she’s reported more than $360,000 in various expenditures.
Lobbyists this week were also required to report their political contributions to candidates or political action committees between May and October. 
The biggest contributions came from lobbyists for oil and gas companies, including $155,750 that Chevron lobbyist Patrick Killen reported spending in the last few months. His filings report a $50,000 donation to the Our Values PAC, a conservative political action committee based in Roswell, as well as $31,000 to the Speaker Fund, the New Mexico House Democrats’ PAC. 
He also reported 12 donations of $6,200 each — the maximum allowable under state law — to elected Democratic and Republican state lawmakers.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana leaders on Friday met with Vice President JD Vance for the third time as they work to secure support for mid-cycle, partisan redistricting. They remained tight-lipped about the meeting’s contents as protesters rallied in opposition. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, called it a “productive” and “fruitful” discussion. He said his caucus hadn’t yet made a choice, but hinted an answer to the redistricting question could come soon. 
“Obviously, the conversation was about redistricting,” he told reporters. “We talked a lot about that — pros and cons — and so, no decisions were made. But we’re going to work on that and hopefully have a decision very soon.”

President Donald Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census. 
Indiana’s current map, drawn in 2021, is 7-2 Republicans. Democrats hold seats in northwest and central Indiana
House Speaker Todd Huston declined to talk to reporters but released a statement thanking Vance “for again talking with our caucus members and facilitating an open dialogue on this important topic. It means a lot to us that he is willing to spend time in our state, personally communicating with and answering questions from Hoosier lawmakers. We had another productive conversation today and we’ll keep discussing this within our caucus and with the Hoosiers we represent as we come to a decision soon.”
Upon leaving the Statehouse, Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, shared that he was fully in support of new maps, regardless of consequences or constituent opposition. 
“I would rather be courageous and take a stand and do something that I know a fair amount of voters are going to say, ‘You know what? We’re not going to vote for you.’ I would rather lose my seat than my grandkids lose their country,” he said.
Gaskill said he doesn’t feel pressure from higher-ups. He knew the debate was coming when Texas and California moved to change their maps.
“We ought to do our part … if one side’s fighting the other side can’t be doing ‘rock paper scissors,'” Gaskill said. “You’re going to get run over.”

When asked about the Senate Republican caucus’ delay, Bray said his members like to be “thoughtful and contemplative and understand the issue very well” before coming to a decision. 
He declined to share meeting specifics and didn’t say whether there were enough votes to support new maps. 
“We’ve been working on this for a while, so we’d like to come to a resolution fairly shortly,” he concluded.
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, offered a more blunt analysis. 
“They don’t have the votes, currently,” she said during a joint news conference with House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta.
“There’s something happening here because (otherwise) the vice president wouldn’t have to come here — twice now — in order to twist some arms,” said GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne.

Protesters bring props to VP’s visit
The Democratic leaders spoke following another energetic rally at the Indiana Statehouse.
Protesters lined the dual marble staircases and filled the space in between, raising anti-redistricting signs and following speakers’ chants. One protester — in drag as Trump — puppeteered drag versions of Vance and Braun, who writhed upon the marble floors.
Some assembled earlier at the library, jeering as Vance’s motorcade rolled in. Law enforcement officers urged them away from the security perimeter.
Other protesters arrived even sooner. 
A quartet of Hoosiers set up a reclining couch early Friday morning on the sidewalk in front of the Indiana Statehouse as a “gift” to the vice president, who was subject to a false claim involving couches based on a passage from his memoir.
Indiana resident Cassie Jackson said she hoped the prop would stop Vance from pressuring state lawmakers further on the topic of redistricting.
“You can have the couch as a gift,” Jackson said. “But please, don’t come back.” 
She said the group transported the couch on a car roof and set it up before lawmakers arrived. The group recounted how one Republican senator, on his way in, privately told them that he wouldn’t be voting in favor of new maps. 
Jackson’s friend was unconvinced, saying, “These guys lie to us all the time.”

“They’re here to be persuaded so they can go back to their constituents and say, ‘Oh, we were going to say we’re Indiana boys and we’re tough. But then JD came in and he told us what’s what,’” Charlie Spears said. “… I can’t believe a guy from Ohio is going to come in here and tell Indiana how to vote.”
It was Vance’s second trip to Indiana in about two months, as the map-drawing push stalled. 
At least two Hoosier congressmen joined: U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, who flew with Vance on Air Force Two, and 3rd District Rep. Marlin Stutzman. 
Vance also met with Braun, who thanked the vice president for taking the time to visit Indiana in a statement posted to X.
“I appreciated the thoughtful discussion about how our state is serving Hoosiers through common-sense and strong leadership,” he wrote. “We discussed redistricting and the importance of ensuring fair representation for every Hoosier. I look forward to continuing our partnership to keep Indiana — and America — moving in the right direction.”
The meeting was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. at the nearby Indiana State Library. Lawmakers began streaming into the underground tunnels of the government campus center — and underwent security scans by Secret Service agents — just after 9 a.m.

Members of the Braun administration exited the tunnels at 11 a.m. Indiana Senate Republicans began filtering out from their gathering at 12:20, while the House GOP caucus left at 1:40 p.m.
Some exiting lawmakers were enthusiastic about the visit, including Rep. Ryan Lauer, R-Columbus, who extolled Vance’s virtues and called him an “absolutely wonderful family man.”
The vice president last visited Indiana in August to meet with Braun, Bray and Huston and rally support for early redistricting. Neither the governor nor legislative leadership signaled any firm commitment to the proposal at the time.
Later that month, dozens of GOP lawmakers from Indiana’s House and Senate traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Vance and other federal officials about a variety of topics, including redistricting. Bray and Huston met in person with Trump during that visit.
Braun has since repeatedly floated the idea of a November special session for early redistricting. The next regularly scheduled legislative session will kick off in January, around the same time that Indiana’s window to file congressional bids opens.
Multiple polls — including one released in August and one this week — have found that the majority of Hoosiers oppose early redistricting.

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (9-1-4, 2-1-2 CUSA) earned their first home Conference USA victory defeating Jacksonville State, 2-0.
 
NEWARK— Amid a black night sky Freshman goalkeeper Sophia Hall was bound to stand out in her vibrant pink kit. Instead, it was her play in goal that caught the attention of the Delaware crowd at Stuart and Suzanne Grant Stadium Thursday night.
The Blue Hens led Jacksonville State by a goal with a little more than 20 minutes remaining in the game. The Gamecocks set up for their fifth corner of the match and booted it to the top of the box. Gamecock defenseman Reina Herndon got a running start on her touch and fired a powerful blast to the top left of the net. Hall leaped and dove through the air to meet the ball stretching her arms all the way out to deflect the ball away from harm.  
The tipped ball hit off the top of the post and bounced back into play. Hall got to her feet quickly to prepare for another game saving play, but her teammates had her back. The UD defense blocked a few Jacksonville State kicks before they could reach the Pennsylvania native in net, helping lead UD to a 2-0 victory against Jacksonville State.
Hall has made an immediate impact for the Blue Hen’s defense 14 games into her blossoming career. In her first season as a Blue Hen, Hall has 54 saves (third in CUSA) and a save percentage of .831 (second in CUSA). She’s been in goal for every minute of every game and recorded her sixth shutout putting her in a three-way tie for sixth in program history for shutouts in a single season.
Hall’s defensive performance was the catalyst for UD’s second goal of the evening. Following the defensive stand, the Blue Hens pushed on the counterattack moving the ball through the left side of the midfield to the right side in their offensive zone. 
The ball reached the foot of sophomore Brooke Vogel with one defender blocking her way. Vogel blew past the defender, set up her shot with the goalie bearing down on her and rocketed the ball to the back left corner of the net. 
Vogel’s third goal of the season provided the Blue Hens a comfortable cushion with about 17 minutes remaining in the game. Fellow sophomore Gabby Riley started the scoring with her second goal of the season in the early minutes of the second half. Riley’s goal came off a corner kick that managed to evade a touch by either team, sneaking through the mass of players into the back left of the net.
The Gamecocks’ led the game with 17 shots — six on target — but UD’s defense was stout, keeping the Gamecocks off the scoreboard. The Gamecocks are winless in conference play this season and hold an overall record of 6-6-3. They’re currently 11th in the conference standings, two spots away from making the conference tournament.  
UD’s win was its first home win against a CUSA opponent in program history. It was also head coach Kelly Lawrence’s 20th win at UD.  
The Blue Hens remain at home for two more games against Kennesaw State and the leader in the CUSA standings, Liberty. As of now, the Blue Hens are fourth in the CUSA standings fighting for a spot in the conference tournament.
UD will need to finish as one of the best eight teams in the conference to make the conference tournament in its inaugural CUSA season.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MR128677-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 15:57:00.367241

Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) tapped Sen. Michael A. Jackson (D-Calvert, Charles & Prince George’s) as the next superintendent of the Maryland State Police Friday, replacing Col. Roland L. Butler who is set to retire Nov. 1.
Before he was elected to the legislature, Jackson spent 22 years in the Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Office, the last eight, from 2002-2010, as elected sheriff. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 2014 and appointed to the Senate in 2021, winning reelection to the seat in 2022. He serves on the Budget and Taxation Committee.
“He’s one of our best members,” Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) said of Jackson’s work on the commitee “I’m thrilled for him. It’s a good opportunity for him. That makes me sad because he’s a really good friend and he’s really good on Budget and Tax.”

Butler took the helm at the State Police in early 2023, shortly after Moore’s inauguration. He became the first Black superintendent of the State Police in the agency’s history.
In a statement Friday afternoon, Moore applauded Butler for 31 years in law enforcement, calling him a “true public servant.”
“During Colonel Butler’s tenure at the helm of State Police, Maryland has become a national leader in crime reduction and public safety gains. He leaves behind a profound legacy as he enters retirement,” Moore said. “And I also know Senator Michael A. Jackson—an exceptional public servant in his own right—will build on the foundation Colonel Butler laid.”
Butler took the job after a lengthy career in the State Police, including time as chief of the Field Operations Bureau. But he faced a difficult confirmation battle, as a group of Black lawmakers argued that Butler had not done enough to promote diversity and address complaints of racism and discriminatory treatment of Black officers.
At the time, Jackson was one of four senators, all from Prince George’s County, to vote against Butler.
Last year, the State Police agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle a Justice Department investigation that found written and physical hiring tests used by the department discriminated against Black and female applicants.
The investigation in that began in 2022, before Butler’s tenure, and the funds were to be divided between 48 failed applicants. President Donald Trump’s (R) administration has since signaled that it intends to walk away from similar suits around the country.
Butler plans to retire Nov. 1, Moore said, and Jackson will take over Nov. 12. Lt. Col. Daniel C. Pickett will serve as superintendent in the interim.

It’s the second time House Speaker Pro Tempore Kate Hogan and Senate Assistant Majority Whip Julian Cyr have filed legislation (S 1504, H 2450) that would phase out the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of chemicals that do not break down fully in the environment and are linked to harmful health issues like thyroid disease, liver damage, some cancers and immune system suppression.
The bills gained favorable reports last session from the Joint Committee on Public Health and Health Care Financing, but died in House Ways and Means Committee last session. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that more than 99% of people in the U.S. have detectable levels of PFAS in their blood, according to Laurel Schaider, a senior scientist at Newton-based Silent Spring Institute who spoke at a State House briefing on Thursday.
PFAS are often used in nonstick, stain-resistant, waterproof and grease-resistant products. Well owners and users, farmers and firefighters from across Massachusetts have testified before the Legislature in recent years and gathered at the State House Thursday to discuss the illnesses and other issues that have resulted from water and soil contaminated with PFAS and firefighting gear designed with PFAS in it. 
“I think there’s two hurdles here. One is that we’re talking about complex policy related to environmental science, and the more that we learn about PFAS, the more we understand its ubiquity,” Cyr told the News Service. “As you build a statutory and then a regulatory scheme around it, this isn’t easy policymaking.”
“We continue to see that the manufacturers of products that contain PFAS have opposed these efforts in numerous states. Massachusetts is not immune from some of that opposition,” Cyr continued. In part that’s why the bill targets specifically how people are most exposed to PFAS, not how it’s present in industrial applications, Cyr said. 
The Legislature in 2024 passed a few measures, according to Hogan, including those phasing out PFAS in firefighter protective gear and increasing funds to MassDEP to provide support for PFAS testing.
Other lawmakers have filed varying forms of legislation this session aiming to address different PFAS-related issues. A delegation of Massachusetts lawmakers visited Maine in August in an attempt to better understand how the state tackled contamination caused by PFAS specifically related to sewage sludge on farms. 
“Massachusetts, we like to be in the vanguard of public health, of environmental health and safety. We are no longer in the vanguard. I think there are 13 or 14 other states that have passed some form of legislation related to PFAS. So we’re losing ground a bit,” Cyr said. 
Alaska, New Jersey and New Hampshire also recently passed laws specifically addressing PFAS used in firefighting equipment. States including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont have passed varying laws phasing out the use of PFAS.
The Massachusetts bill would establish a remediation fund to assist entities attempting to clean up PFAS from their water supply, as well as direct the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to include PFAS monitoring requirements. It’s based on recommendations from the PFAS Interagency Task Force, which Hogan and Cyr chaired and that came out with a report in 2022.
“We’re trying to keep our bill current,” Hogan said, naming biosolids and ambient air as additional PFAS-related issues she anticipates ahead. “What we’ve set forth will really be foundational to moving forward and to dealing with all of the aspects of PFAS that are going to keep making their way into the general public and our conversations about PFAS.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/68e7e4225e6fe.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 14:57:30.273642

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have restricted the use of data from such camera systems. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Lawmakers in at least 16 states this year introduced bills to regulate the use of automated license plate readers responsible for collecting large amounts of data on drivers across the country.
But just three states — Arkansas, Idaho and Virginia — enacted laws this session that establish or amend rules for law enforcement agencies using the high-tech camera systems and the manner in which license plate data should be stored. And this month, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have restricted use of such data.
The new Arkansas law, which was signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in April, also allows nongovernmental entities, such as private landowners and commercial business owners, to use license plate cameras on the condition that the data is deleted after 60 days. State agencies and parking enforcement can store license plate data for up to 150 days.
Measures in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are still under consideration. While the Pennsylvania bill outlines a permitting process for state agencies interested in installing license plate cameras, the measures in Massachusetts and New Jersey aim to strengthen privacy protections by ensuring only authorized employees can access driver data.
Comprehensive data privacy laws go into effect in 8 more states this year

Automated or automatic license plate readers, also known as ALPRs, are high-speed camera and computer software systems that automatically capture license plate information as vehicles drive by. These readers, which are typically mounted on street poles or the roofs of police cars, also record the location, date and time that license plates are captured.
ALPRs have been used by law enforcement agencies for more than 20 years. The camera systems are typically used as a tool for traffic accident and crime investigations. 
Despite the technology’s popularity, privacy and technology groups have raised concerns over data storage and appropriate uses of ALPRs. 
License plate readers collect and store large amounts of data, which is susceptible to data breaches and hacking, according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice. Several law enforcement agencies and officers have also used the technology to target immigrants and could track people seeking reproductive health care, according to an analysis from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.
Lawmakers in at least 10 states — Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and Utah — introduced ALPR legislation this year that didn’t advance.
This month, Newsom vetoed a measure that would have restricted how and when police agencies use and share data collected by ALPRs. The bill, which was approved by the legislature amid reports police were misusing the data, also would have required agencies to undergo random audits by the state and to delete some collected data within 60 days.
In his veto message, Newsom said the measure “does not strike the delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring public safety,” citing examples of how the bill’s provisions could impede criminal investigations.
In New Jersey, Democratic legislators introduced another bill in June that would prohibit law enforcement agencies and individuals from sharing license plate information during interstate investigations into people seeking reproductive health care services, such as abortion, that are legal in New Jersey.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s fiscal debates usually circle the same questions: whether to cut taxes, which ones, and who pays the price. Lately, rapid growth in residential property values has thrown the property-tax formula out of balance. Instead of commissioning a serious study of how to fix it, some state leaders and candidates have floated proposals to cap or even eliminate property taxes. The idea sounds attractive on paper, but in practice it would destabilize the institutions most South Dakotans depend on: local schools, city services and county governments.
At the heart of the matter is a misunderstanding of the causes of the pain some homeowners are experiencing. There is little indication that total property taxes have taken an inordinate jump in recent years. Instead, an increase in home values has apparently distorted the formula for allocating property taxes between residential, ag and commercial property.
Meanwhile, state government lives mostly on sales taxes and federal transfers. Yet it is state officials and politicians, some with little to no experience in local governance, who are calling for property tax cuts while leaving their own revenue streams untouched.
This disconnect raises a larger question: What kind of reform does South Dakota really need? Businessman Toby Doeden, a political newcomer who wants to be governor, has suggested that he would “DOGE” state government, an acronym for Department of Government Efficiency that evokes the idea of slashing wasteful programs. But while such rhetoric resonates nationally, it misses the mark in South Dakota.
Unlike Washington, South Dakota’s state government isn’t awash in bloated agencies or ridiculous programs. Instead, it more closely resembles a struggling family-run shop: lean, underfunded, reliant on dated systems, and often vulnerable to inefficiencies or fraud. What the state lacks is not austerity but modernization. Outdated processes slow delivery of services. Fragmented structures increase costs. And the absence of coordinated, professional oversight leaves opportunities for improvement untapped.
A more constructive project would look less like DOGE and more like modernization and consolidation. Imagine a task force of seasoned executives from some of South Dakota’s best-run companies taking a hard look at state operations. With a mandate to find efficiencies, improve service delivery, and apply modern technology, such a group could identify changes that truly move the needle. The likely results: streamlined systems, smarter spending, and improved outcomes for citizens.
That is why proposals like Gov. Larry Rhoden’s 2024 bill to cap property-tax growth, which is now state law, or Doeden’s talk of eliminating property taxes feel misguided. These measures target the wrong level of government. Property taxes sustain local governments, which must balance budgets each year while maintaining schools, roads, and public safety.
When Pierre restricts their revenue without offering alternatives, the result is predictable: local officials are forced to cut programs or raise fees, shifting the burden in less transparent ways.

There is, of course, a more obvious option, one that almost no politician dares to talk about. South Dakota has too many governments. With 66 counties, hundreds of townships, and more than 150 school districts, the state maintains a costly system of governments with redundant and unnecessary facilities and employees. Consolidation of counties or school districts could lower administrative costs and deliver services more efficiently. Yet such structural reform demands courage, political will, and a willingness to confront entrenched local loyalties.
For now, state leaders and politicians prefer easier sound bites: cutting property taxes without tackling the underlying system. The contradiction is glaring. While protecting their own sales-tax revenue, state officials are restricting the lifeblood of local governments. The unanswered questions loom large: When revenues fall short, will the state step in with replacement funding? Or will school boards and city councils be left to close libraries, shorten school years, or defer infrastructure repairs?
Perhaps the better path for local government outsiders would be to first gain hands-on experience in local government. Let them run a school district or a county commission, grapple with balancing budgets, and decide which programs to cut when dollars run thin. Only then will they appreciate the complexities behind the talking points.
The real opportunity in South Dakota is not to starve local governments of revenue but to rethink how government at all levels operates. Modernization, efficiency, and consolidation, not blunt tax cuts, hold the key to a stronger, leaner state. What South Dakota needs is not a DOGE project, but a serious conversation about how to align its government structure with the realities of the 21st century.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A special election to fill an Arkansas House seat left vacant by a lawmaker’s resignation will be held June 9, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared Friday.
Rep. Carlton Wing, a North Little Rock Republican, resigned on Sept. 30 to become CEO and executive director of Arkansas PBS, necessitating the special election.
Sanders previously set June 9 for a special election to fill the Senate vacancy created when Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, died Sept. 2.
At least two Democrats and one Republican have said they intend to run for Wing’s vacant seat. Four Republicans have said they’ll run for the Senate District 26 seat left by Stubblefield.
Sanders’ proclamation on Friday set the party primary elections for March 3, the same day as other state primaries.
State law requires the governor to call a special election to fill a legislative vacancy as soon as possible after the seat is vacated. The law also requires the special election to be held within 150 days unless it is impractical or “unduly burdensome” to do so, which Sanders said it would be.
Sanders made the same determination in setting the primary and general election dates to fill the Senate seat and drew criticism from some Republicans and the state Democratic party, who said the dates deprive District 26 residents of a voice in the legislature’s fiscal session in April.
A resident of the Franklin County portion of District 26 filed a lawsuit Monday, asking a Pulaski County judge to move up the special election to December so the district’s voters can be represented in the 2026 fiscal session. Lawmakers likely will consider funding for construction of a controversial state prison in Franklin County during the session.
The filing period for candidates in the House race will begin at noon on Nov. 3 and end at noon on Nov. 12, according to Sanders’ proclamation. The political parties must issue certificates of nomination by noon on April 10, and the candidates must file the certificates by 5 p.m. on April 13.
Any Independent candidates for the special election must submit their notices of candidacy, political practices pledges, affidavits of eligibility and petitions to the Secretary of State’s office by noon on April 13.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Senate President Nicholas Scutari became the latest state lawmaker to call for an independent monitor to oversee the work of a state anti-corruption unit that has routinely seen cases tossed because of alleged prosecutorial missteps.
Scutari’s call comes a week after a Superior Court judge dismissed charges against more than a dozen correctional officers accused of misconduct and other charges brought by the state Attorney General’s Office’s public integrity and accountability office, commonly called the OPIA, over inmate beatings at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, New Jersey’s lone women’s prison.
“It is clear from the track record of the office that greater oversight and accountability are needed,” said Scutari (D-Union) in a statement. “The credibility of law enforcement is at stake. The public needs to have confidence in the ability of the office to carry out its responsibilities fairly, effectively and with adherence to the law. An independent monitor will help restore trust in the OPIA.”

Last week, Superior Court Judge Christopher J. Garrenger called the indictments against the correctional officers “unconstitutionally vague” because they did little to differentiate between the actions of each defendant, and cited a laggardly pace that ran afoul of New Jersey’s speedy trial rule.
Garrenger dismissed the charges with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot reraise them at a future date, though the Attorney General’s Office is appealing his decision.
The dismissal was only the latest black eye for the OPIA. In 2022, judges dismissed charges brought by the office against a Lakewood rabbi accused of misappropriating more than $200,000 in school funds and a separate indictment against Saddle Brook Police Chief Robert Kugler, who was accused of providing police escorts to his own funeral home. A Superior Court judge dismissed revived charges against Rabbi Osher Eisemann last year.
In both cases, judges said prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence. Charges against a Paterson officer accused of shooting an unarmed man were dismissed for a similar reason when, 18 months in, prosecutors revealed evidence showed the man had a gun the morning of or the night before the shooting.
Also in 2022, a judge dismissed charges against a separate correctional officer accused of having ties to organized crime after prosecutors said investigators had failed to record an interrogation, as state law and the Attorney General’s Office require.
Racketeering charges against South Jersey powerbroker George Norcross and a bevy of allies — perhaps the OPIA’s most public case — were dismissed in February after a state judge said prosecutors had failed to state the elements of a crime. The office has appealed the dismissal.
The Attorney General’s Office did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
Scutari’s call for independent oversight of the state’s anti-corruption unit is notable — he is the state’s highest-ranking legislator — but it wasn’t the first.
At least six state senators belonging to both parties have called for stricter oversight or investigations into the office, as have New Jersey NAACP President Richard Smith and New Jersey AFL-CIO President Charles Wowkanech.
Sen. Joe Cryan (D-Union), a former Union County sheriff and a vocal critic of the OPIA, has called for an investigation into the office and introduced legislation that would require it to more quickly review misconduct cases.
Then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal created the public integrity and accountability office in 2018 as a response to court decisions that weakened federal bribery and corruption laws and to boost public confidence in police oversight amid rising scrutiny of fatal police shootings.
In addition to corruption cases, the office investigates allegations of civil rights violations by authorities, reviews internal affairs complaints, and evaluates wrongful conviction claims.

The Detroit-based nonprofit Mothering Justice — which centers its work on the needs and rights of mothers and families, from paid sick leave to affordable child care — hosted the grand opening of their new center in Detroit’s Eastern Market neighborhood on Thursday evening. Community members, friends and family members, and Mothering Justice staff gathered to share their hopes for the new, larger space. 
“We are welcoming you here. Please come back, please visit, bring your friends,” Danielle Atkinson, the executive director of Mothering Justice, said in an opening speech. “This space is living with all of the energy of all the movements and all of the causes that we are working for, for the liberation that we will see in our lifetime.”
While Mothering Justice is a national organization, their home has long been in Detroit — and that is intentional, Atkinson said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“When you talk about issues that are affecting moms, you can’t not think about economic and health issues and Detroit is ground zero for how moms have been mistreated, overlooked, underrepresented,” she said. “We have one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the country, and also a lot of poverty. So when we’re talking about hitting those issues head on, we need to be in community, because we believe that the wisdom of the people who are affected by the issue is also what is going to change the world.”
“In 2025, we remain rooted in resistance. We will be ready for what’s to come,” said Liz Dupee, the team’s deputy director for strategic partnerships, as she welcomed guests into the space. “Our message is loud and clear: We won’t back down.”

Much of the work that Atkinson and her staff tackle involves the input of mothers in the community, especially mothers of color. Some of that involves qualitative research, led by Dr. Keiondra Grace, who noted how important it is to have a dedicated home for the work that she and her colleagues do. 
“I do a lot of interviews and focus groups and things like that. And so having this space is really helpful because then we can bring folks in,” she said, referencing an upcoming focus group on understanding how potential cuts to social programs like SNAP under the Trump administration are impacting mothers. 
It follows an October 2024 focus group, where mothers shared fears about those very cuts and how it could make things worse financially for them and their communities. 
“I’m really excited to talk at the end of the month to really understand, now that we are here in this space of, these things are likely going to happen, states don’t have money in the budget to really cover some of the things,” Grace added, “what they’re thinking and how they’re going to make ends meet, how they’re finding sources of resilience and joy, in spite of that.”

Other members similarly expressed excitement about having access to the space.
“We have access to what we need. We have full storage, and it just feels more comfortable,” said Toyja Bridges, an outreach coordinator who runs sessions known as Cocoa Conversations to connect with mothers in the community. “It’s just that one less thing that we don’t have to worry about, so it keeps you kind of focused on what’s important.”
“I’m excited to bring mamas here. I’m excited to have one-on-ones here,” said Christina Hayes, an organizer who manages work on ballot initiatives put forward by Mothering Justice. 
As she works towards a potential state-level ballot initiative on paid family leave, she noted the many considerations for that goal, from finances to ballot signatures. But the new home for Mothering Justice, she said, will be key to getting the community input that she needs to make it happen. 
But Atkinson also noted that the new office is not just helpful for research and advocacy — it’s also set up to be a place where mothers feel welcome. There is a kitchen, as well as a room specifically set up for kids to play, a very intentional setup. 
“This space means a lot for us,” Atkinson said. “It’s our first physical home since COVID. And having a place where moms can come, whether they work here or they’re just involved in the movement in some way, is really important because it just allows for collaboration, like a safe space and your babies can be loud here.”

In 2024, the Iowa Board of Pharmacy filed charges against the Food Land Pharmacy of Woodbine, alleging that on July 18, 2023, a Harrison County home-health worker noticed that the medication she was giving her patient did not match the description on the pill bottle.

In October 2023, the board alleged, the pharmacy failed to update its records by removing a “duplicative therapy” for a customer and as a result, the pharmacy dispensed the wrong strength of his medication for three months.
Around that time, another patient was allegedly given a lower-strength medication than was prescribed. The board also alleged that in July and August 2023, Food Land Pharmacy employed Sabine Guinn as a pharmacy technician despite Guinn’s lack of a registration as a pharmacy technician. The store failed to determine whether Guinn had the required registration before putting her to work in the store, the board alleges.
As part of a settlement agreement with the board, the store agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and have all pharmacists and pharmacy technicians undergo additional training in patient safety and medication errors.
Also in 2024, the Board of Pharmacy alleged that pharmacist Christopher Steele of Underwood had incorrectly filled prescriptions for at least four patients in 2023. Steele told the Iowa Capital Dispatch the errors occurred at the Food Land Pharmacy where he worked.
Steele agreed to settle the disciplinary case by paying a $1,000 civil penalty and having his license placed on probation for one to two years.
Second set of charges filed in 2025
Earlier this year, the board charged Food Land Pharmacy with 10 additional regulatory violations — an exceptionally large number of violations for a pharmacy of that size.
The charges include failing to follow board rules related to recordkeeping, failing to follow board rules related to temporary pharmacy staff, failing to follow proper procedures related to controlled-substance registrations, failing to follow proper procedures for a change in the pharmacist in charge, failing to follow board rules related to accountability of controlled substances, failing to follow rules related to system security and safeguards, and failing to comply with the required drug utilization review process for a patient.
According to the board, those charges are tied to five separate complaints received by the board in the spring of 2024, and are tied to allegations of poor recordkeeping and lack of oversight concerning controlled substances.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, the pharmacy’s representatives recently agreed to surrender the business’ pharmacy license.
Food Land lawsuit led to major court decision
Court records show that Steele’s hiring at Food Land resulted in a significant court decision on the scope of a state law that legislators passed in 2022 in an effort to discourage price gouging by staffing agencies working for health care entities.
Shortly after the legislation was signed into law, a staffing agency called PharmServ Solutions sued the Food Land store, alleging the store had asked PharmServ to provide a pharmacist for six days in early 2022. PharmServ routed Steele to the job, after which Food Land allegedly hired Steele as a permanent employee of the store’s pharmacy. PharmServ then sued Food Land, alleging the store was refusing to pay an agreed-upon fee of up to $30,000 for Steele’s hiring.
Food Land argued the new price-gouging law prohibited employment agencies in the health care field from charging fees when temporary workers were hired by the agency’s clients on a permanent basis.
PharmServ argued the law didn’t apply since Food Land was not a “health care entity” as defined by the legislation. A Harrison County judge disagreed and dismissed the lawsuit while ruling that the new law applied to Iowa pharmacies and pharmacists.

Former Gillette librarian announced the settlement of her lawsuit against Campbell County and conservatives on the library board days before a key legislative meeting.
The post Fired Wyoming librarian hopes $700,000 settlement deters conservative lawmakers. They say it won’t. appeared first on WyoFile .","The Gillette librarian who this week settled a lawsuit against Campbell County over her July 2023 firing for a $700,000 payment says she hopes Wyoming lawmakers take note of the hefty sum.
Terri Lesley sued in April, alleging the Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees violated her First Amendment right to free speech and dismissed her in retaliation for her opposition to efforts by local conservatives to control where LGBTQ-centered books appeared in the library.
“My hope is that this will be a deterrent,” Lesley told WyoFile on Thursday, “that we can shut down all these censorship efforts in Wyoming and beyond.” 
But two Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers who want the Legislature to weigh in on library materials statewide were quick to dismiss the idea that the hefty settlement should serve as a warning. The settlement does not include an admission of guilt by the county or trustees, they said, and is a separate matter from their legislative efforts.
The lawsuit Lesley settled this week was one of two she’s brought since her firing, with the second coming against members of a family, the Bennetts, who had prominently advocated for her removal as library director.
That lawsuit remains ongoing. Both suits were filed in federal court.
The Gillette News Record broke the story Wednesday and it quickly became a national news story. That news came just days ahead of a pivotal legislative committee hearing in Wyoming’s ongoing political debate over who should control access to library books. Lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee will vote Monday on whether to bring a bill to the 2026 legislative session that would impose steep fines on public libraries and schools that leave books containing sexual material in places accessible to minors. 
Lesley, her lawyers, and a group of Wyoming advocacy organizations, librarians and other bill opponents see the court settlement as vindication of their stance against such laws.

“This case is about accountability and the rule of law,” Azra Taslimi, one of Lesley’s attorneys, told WyoFile. “It’s about what happens when government officials cross a constitutional line and try to prevent and punish a public servant for doing her job. Ms. Lesley was fired for standing up for the First Amendment, and the $700,000 settlement speaks volumes. It says the censorship has consequences that are legal as well as financial.”
Taslimi, who said her firm has worked on cases on behalf of librarians in other states, described efforts to regulate the material available in Wyoming  libraries as part of a nationwide push by conservative politicians to censure LGBTQ literature.
“These bills are not about protecting children,” Taslimi said. “They’re about controlling what people can read, think and talk about. What these bills are really trying to do is criminalize inclusion and erase stories that make some politicians uncomfortable.”
Lawmakers undeterred
In text messages to WyoFile, two House lawmakers from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, who have been prominent advocates for regulating young people’s access to some books, indicate the lawsuit is unlikely to dissuade their efforts.
Rep. Anne Lucas, a Cheyenne Republican, Freedom Caucus-endorsed lawmaker and architect of the legislation now in front of the Judiciary Committee, told WyoFile the lawsuit settlement did not give her any pause in pushing forward. 
“The Library isn’t admitting any wrongdoing,” she wrote of the settlement agreement, and “by accepting it, Ms. Lesley agrees.” 
Lucas described the lawsuit as “an employment case, not a first amendment case and has nothing to do with legislative considerations.”
House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Bear, whose wife Sage Bear is a library trustee and was a defendant in the lawsuit, accused Lesley of being out for money, not standing on principle. 
“It is clear that the terminated librarian was more concerned about fleecing her prior employer than the supposed altruistic motive of standing up for LGBTQ rights,” Bear wrote. 
“I don’t believe the county’s insurance company or their attorneys should have settled this case, but I understand the business decision to attempt to keep costs of frivolous litigation minimized,” Bear wrote. Instead, he called for reform to Wyoming’s tort laws, which govern civil lawsuits and allow people like Lesley to sue for damages. 
Until lawmakers pass such reforms, “the left will always take advantage,” he wrote. 
The library book bill currently under consideration would likely open the door for more lawsuits against the government, but from people on the political right. The legislation creates a pathway for citizens to sue schools and libraries they believe are violating the rules. 
For her part, Lesley described standing up to political pressure for two years before her firing, including that brought by Sage Bear, as personally difficult but driven by obligations to her work and community. The same was true of her decision to sue, she said. 
“It has been very hard,” she told WyoFile. “But I felt like I had to do it, that I had to stand up for the First Amendment. It’s what libraries are about.” 
Lesley had worked in the Campbell County library system for nearly thirty years before she was fired.
Conservatives behind book regulating measures have pushed past legal warnings before. In Campbell County, the library trustees fired Lesley despite an explicit warning against doing so from a deputy county attorney in March 2022. In hindsight, the attorney nearly predicted this week’s settlement years before it became reality. 
“Litigation regarding censorship — which is waiting in the wings on all sides — would be cripplingly costly, time consuming, and very likely unsuccessful for the County,” the attorney wrote, according to a copy of her email included in Lesley’s lawsuit.
On Thursday, Rep. Bear continued to uphold the efforts of Campbell County conservatives, which resulted in the contested books ultimately being moved into the adult section of the library after Lesley’s firing. 
“Gillette public libraries are the first in the nation to stop the left’s onslaught on the innocence of children by moving books that sexualize children to the adult section of the library,” Bear wrote to WyoFile. “Is $700,000 too much to pay to save our children?”
But Lesley, who still lives in Gillette, said she does not believe the Freedom Caucus speaks for most Wyomingites on the issue. 
“I think they are representing a minority,” she said, describing herself as a fourth-generation resident of the state. “It’s a live-and-let live kind of state, and I just don’t see the people I know signing on to this.”

The librarian has received an outpouring of support from around Wyoming since taking her stand against the efforts to remove library books that began in Gillette in 2021, she said. At the special meeting where Lesley was fired, hundreds of people showed up to support her, while a few dozen residents attended to back the board, according to Gillette News Record reporting at the time. 
Legislative debate
Lawmakers have also seen mounting public opposition as Monday’s bill has moved through the interim period. In Casper in August, they faced a packed meeting room, the majority of whom were there in opposition to the bill, though it also drew supporters. Testimony at that meeting included a Methodist pastor who read lawmakers sexually explicit passages from the Bible — arguing their legislation would censure that religious text from children’s eyes as well.

In Cheyenne on Monday, the Judiciary Committee will not take further public testimony, having sat through hours of it in Casper. The Legislative Service Office’s website already lists four proposed amendments, and lawmakers are likely to bring more on the spot. Ahead of the meeting, advocacy groups have continued to call on their members to write lawmakers in opposition to the measure.
“Terri Lesley stood up for freedom, families, and the First Amendment, and she was proven right,” Nate Martin, a Laramie school board member and director of one such group, Better Wyoming, told WyoFile. “Now, as lawmakers consider a statewide ban along the lines of Campbell County’s, and they’re getting a thousand individuals contacting them in opposition to the bill, they’re finding out that the people of Wyoming don’t like book bans any more than the courts do.”
Local political activists, namely the Bennett family, did not just push for Lesley’s firing, they also sought to have her prosecuted. The Bennetts in 2021 pressed the Campbell County District Attorney’s Office to prosecute Lesley for providing obscene material to minors.
Prosecutors declined to bring charges after conducting what they described as an extensive review of state statutes, according to that still-active lawsuit, which Lesley filed in September 2023. The county attorney found that the books in question did not meet state statute’s definition of obscene materials, which requires sexual content to also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
The bill in front of the Joint Judiciary Committee would circumvent that language, which is derived from the legal test established by a pivotal 1973 U.S. Supreme Court case. In that case, Miller v. California, the justices found that literature or other content that carried those broader values could not be regulated as obscene without violating the First Amendment. 
Monday’s draft bill instead would insert into Wyoming law a list of definitions of sexual acts that cannot be depicted in literature available to a minor. 
The definitions include graphic descriptions like “ejaculation onto the person of another” or “contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus.” But critics say it does not take in the value or purpose of the work as a whole — like the more graphic passages of the Bible, which play into larger themes of the religious text. 
It would instead, Lesley said, allow conservative activists to go in and cherry pick sections of texts that offend them, without considering what value those books may bring young readers.
The current draft bill carries a suggestion from the Legislative Service Office — the state attorneys who draft bills and guide lawmakers on how to avoid conflicts with existing or constitutional law. 
“The Committee may wish to consider the use of the existing definition for ‘obscene’ as the designation of sexually explicit material,” LSO staff attorneys wrote in the bill draft. They are referring to the language derived by the Miller case, and cited by the county prosecutors who declined to criminally charge Lesley.

Administrators and teachers at the Danville School say closure could harm students with learning disabilities, who they say are underserved by nearby private high schools and would face long travel times to other public schools.

Danville residents are poised to vote in December on whether to shutter its high school grades at the Danville School and instead pay tuition for students to attend other schools, following a petition submitted to the school board Tuesday.
The petition has set the district on a collision course with a potential outcome public school faculty say would be devastating for the region’s most vulnerable students. The school board proposed a Dec. 6 special meeting for the vote, though the meeting won’t be officially set until next month. If the vote is successful, Danville School’s grades 9 through 12 would close by June 30.
The district would then pay tuition for those high school students to attend public or private schools, according to the language of the petition.
The potential closure of Danville’s high school presents troubling implications for public school students in the area, and has underscored long-held contentions around whether the region’s public and private schools share the same responsibility to serve students with disabilities or with other academic achievement barriers — a population on the rise in Vermont.
“They don’t have to take your kids,” David Warren, a Danville School social studies teacher, said Tuesday about two larger neighboring private schools. “And how do I know? Because we’ve been giving kids from those schools here in Danville a second chance.”
Danville School Principal Natalie Conway wrote to the school board in advance of its Oct. 7 meeting that the high school closure would leave “our area of the (Northeast Kingdom) a public high school desert.”
The closest high school would be St. Johnsbury Academy, followed by Lyndon Institute, both private institutions and designated by Vermont law as “independent schools” that are eligible to receive public dollars as tuition from school districts lacking public schools serving those grades. 
Since 2022, Vermont State Board of Education rules have required schools that accept public dollars to educate students eligible for special education services. However, Danville public school leaders and faculty have said they believe students with disabilities would go underserved by the closure — a claim that their counterparts at St. Johnsbury Academy refute.
“Students from all walks of life and all abilities who need a second chance, a smaller school, or more individual attention and support find a home in Danville School,” Conway said in her letter. “Students with disabilities find a home at Danville School.”
‘Imagine the costs’
The Danville school district, like many in the state, finds itself on shaky ground as Vermont works toward a major overhaul of its public education system.
Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill signed into law in July, calls for a vast consolidation of the state’s 119 school districts and a reorganization of how the state funds education.
A redistricting task force, made up of legislators, former superintendents and other experts, is tasked with crafting new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system in time for next year’s legislative session, which begins in early January.
But many fear the law’s implementation could mean the closure of small schools, pointing to required minimum average class sizes of at least 18 students for grades 9 through 12.
The petition, Danville board members wrote in a letter to the state’s redistricting task force after the Tuesday meeting, “is a direct result of great uncertainty due to Act 73 and your task force’s mission.”
Danville School hosts about 344 students from kindergarten through high school from Danville and surrounding towns, with roughly 70 students in the high school grades, according to district board Chair Clayton Cargill.
For the past month, the school board members have weighed whether to get ahead of changes envisioned by the new education law.

Their district is a member of the Caledonia Central Supervisory Union, which includes the Cabot and Twinfield school districts. Both of those districts also operate a K-12 school, with high school grades even smaller in size than Danville’s.
The uncertainty around Danville School’s future spurred a financial analysis, presented by board member Eric Hewitt during a September school board meeting. The analysis suggested that tuitioning out Danville’s high school students may produce a lower tax rate than if it were to continue operating its high school grades.
But that analysis has since been questioned by other board members and community members.
Cargill said in an interview Wednesday that the analysis did not take into account high school-aged students in Danville whose families currently pay for private school and would take advantage of a tuition system.
There is also the expense of ensuring that the district’s obligations to students with disabilities are being met, Danville high school’s principal noted in her letter. 
The next closest public high schools, Hazen Union and Lake Region Union, are each at least a 30-minute drive away from Danville School, Conway wrote.
“Imagine the costs associated with this transportation for general and special education students,” she wrote. “Imagine the costs for us as a (Northeast Kingdom) community associated with students who struggle to attend school dropping out at higher rates than we already experience.”
A state senator’s opinion
Nearby school boards have had similar discussions about potentially closing their high school grades. For Danville and Cabot, those discussions were prompted by a warning from Vermont Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, the chamber’s minority leader, according to their school board chairs. Those warnings were first reported last week by Seven Days.
Beck, a faculty member at St. Johnsbury Academy, warned school district and community leaders that lawmakers would likely seek to limit a district’s ability to offer its students the choice of attending a private school after a school closure in the next phase of educational reform.
Beck pointed to specific language that had been in an earlier version of the legislation requiring school districts that close a school to designate just three public schools to receive their students.
The Cabot School District had previously considered circulating a survey to residents about closing their schools and opting for school choice. But Cabot school board Chair Chris Tormey, said in an email this week that the board has decided to hold off on the survey “until we find out next year how Cabot School will be placed within the new statewide map.”
Audience members at the Danville board meeting were split on the urgency of making a decision about the high school. But several attendees zeroed in on accusations that Beck had unduly influenced the petitioners by spreading false information.

Warren, the high school social studies teacher, said the motivation behind the petition was “flat out wrong,” that the Act 73 process would not necessarily lead to the high school’s closure.
“Despite what you hear about small schools, we do offer a quality education. And about this decision, the politician that is behind it, in my opinion, is a coward, and worse, a bully,” Warren said.
Cargill said at the meeting that he felt he had been misled by Beck. 
“I paraded this information around town, and told people this information, and I feel lied to in the situation,” he said. “I feel like I’m part of a problem here.”
Beck refuted claims that he had a conflict of interest, and said in an interview Wednesday that he was merely offering his opinion to his constituents.
“People can certainly disagree with me, that’s fine, but I was straightforward,” he said. What he has been telling school district leaders like Cargill “is that I don’t think that you have forever to have this conversation.”
“I don’t think I misled or lied to anybody,” Beck continued. “It’s the opinion I conveyed last summer and it’s the opinion I still have today.”
‘We don’t do that’
Danville School faculty argue their school plays an outsized role in serving students with intellectual disabilities and from poorer backgrounds.
And without Danville’s high school grades, “there are going to be a fair number of students who will not be provided the opportunity for the free and appropriate education that they also deserve,” Beth Nishball-Williams, a special educator at the Danville School, wrote in a letter to the school board.
“Where do our autistic, intellectually disabled, multiple handicapped students go?” Nishball-Williams wrote. “Where do our students with social anxiety, speech and concerns, depression, or trauma go?”
That claim is partly borne out in public data, released last month by the Agency of Education in response to requests from the redistricting task force about the concentration of students with individual education plans, or IEPs, in different schools and school districts.

Twenty-two percent of Danville School students are on IEPs, while 49% are eligible for the federal free or reduced lunch program, indicating they live in households earning less than 185% the federal poverty level, according to data from the Agency of Education for the 2023-24 school year. 
Twenty-five percent of students from other school districts who attend Danville School are on IEPs, while 62% are on a free or reduced lunch program, according to that data. Data from previous years was not available.
Meanwhile, only 8.7% of St. Johnsbury Academy’s student body are on IEPs, according to that data, while just over 14% are on a free or reduced lunch program.
Lyndon Institute has higher percentages — 19.52% of the school’s student body are on IEPs, while just under 22% are on a free or reduced lunch program.
The data suggests that the academy is not enrolling students with disabilities. St. Johnsbury Academy officials contend that the opposite is true — that their low percentage of students with IEPs shows that they’re making progress toward the mandates in Act 173, Vermont’s 2022 special education law that sought to increase effectiveness of support services.
Academy Headmaster Sharon Howell said it was “patently false” that they are not serving students with IEPs, and said “the fact that we have fewer students on IEPs is not an indicator of failure. It’s actually a success story.”
Mathew Foster, the director of student services at St. Johnsbury Academy, said the data discrepancy is due the fact that some students are designated as being on 504 plans versus IEPs. The 504 plan categorization is another federal designation for students who need special support for learning, and does not follow the same procedures and requirements that an IEP would.
Howell said the academy’s philosophy is to shift their enrolled students with IEPs toward 504 plans or other in-house support services.
“Our philosophy is we want students to be able to do as well as they can, to be able to move into general education classes when that’s appropriate, so not just be stuck in individualized services classes in content areas, but to actually join some of the some of the gen-ed classes, if that’s appropriate,” she said.
Data provided by the academy for the 2023-24 school year shows a number of publicly funded students — about 24% — enrolled at the school are on IEPs, 504 plans, or “other support plans.”
Lyndon Institute officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Administrators and teachers at the Danville School nonetheless say their school is the fallback serving those students in the region.
In her letter, Danville School special educator Nishball-Williams wrote that “the truth is not everyone will be successful” at the two nearby private schools. She said she works with students from most of the surrounding towns that tuition out their students.
“I know this first hand because in the past five years I’ve had students on my caseload from Barnet, Peacham, Walden, Cabot, Lyndon, St. Johnsbury, Concord and Sheffield, as well as Danville,” Nishball-Williams wrote.
Caledonia Central Supervisory Union Superintendent Matt Foster said the nearby academies “don’t have to, nor (do) they, gear to try to meet the needs” of all students.
“There is flexibility at the academies where they are able to basically say, ‘We don’t do that’ with certain populations,” Foster said.
“Those aren’t my schools, so I can’t say what exactly they’re doing or not doing at this point in time,” he added, “but they definitely have a history of saying there are certain students that they don’t feel equipped to be able to take.”
‘An existential crisis’
The petition delivered at Tuesday’s meeting was organized by Peter Mantius, a faculty member at St. Johnsbury Academy.
“It’s my hope that every voting resident shows up at our special meeting fully informed and capable of voting on maybe the most important decision this town is going to make in a generation,” Mantius said during the meeting.
Mantius did not respond to a request for comment, but said during the September board meeting and in an op-ed published in the Caledonia Record that he and others had concerns similar to Beck’s — that the Legislature may soon block the district’s ability to adopt school choice.

Hewitt, the Danville School board member, was asked during Tuesday’s meeting for his position on potentially closing the school. He said he wanted more clarity on what comes of the redistricting task force.
“The question is, how is the redistricting community committee viewing us, Danville, in our current situation,” Hewitt said.
The school board, in its letter to the task force, asked members for clarity.
“We are at risk of making a very reactionary decision that will change this town considerably in
unforeseen ways,” the board’s letter reads. “With the lack of certainty or clarity around what will happen to a school like ours, which is in a remarkably unique situation in the state, we are forced to assume and plan for the worst case scenario, and do everything in our power to prevent it.”
Cargill expressed similar concerns before the meeting.
“We’ve been operating a pretty successful high school that we’re proud of throughout all these years,” Cargill said in an interview last week. “I think that’s the truth, but with what the state is forcing now, we’re sort of sitting in an existential crisis.”

,DC,2025-10-10 17:17:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘Substantial’ layoffs of federal workers launched by Trump administration amid shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/substantial-layoffs-federal-workers-launched-trump-administration-amid-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Friday it had begun mass layoffs of federal employees, a step not taken during previous government shutdowns and one that could significantly reshape the size and scope of the government. White House budget director Russ Vought posted on social media mid-day that Reductions in Force, the technical name for layoffs, had started.“The RIFs have begun,” Vought wrote.  Vought didn’t share any other details on social media and a budget office spokesperson only said that the layoffs would be ""substantial"" after States Newsroom asked for information about how many federal workers and which departments would be impacted. The government shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Congress failed to pass a short-term spending bill.President Donald Trump has signaled for the last couple weeks that if Democrats didn’t help Republicans advance the stopgap funding bill in the Senate, he would take action. “I’ll be able to tell you that in four or five days if this keeps going on,” Trump said Tuesday. “If this keeps going on it’ll be substantial and a lot of those jobs will never come back.”Trump said Thursday that he would cut funding approved by Congress for programs he believes are supported by or generally benefit Democrats, but he didn’t provide any more details during a Cabinet meeting. Trump has also floated the idea of not providing back pay for furloughed federal employees, though he hasn’t made any firm determinations about whether he may try to reinterpret a 2019 law that guarantees back pay for all federal workers after a shutdown ends. The Congressional Budget Office estimated before the shutdown began that some 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed. Others have continued working but without pay.Thune blames ‘far-left activist base’ for shutdownVought’s announcement came just as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., wrapped up a joint press conference on Capitol Hill, where they called on Democrats to vote to reopen the government. “We have a majority of United States senators — 55 out of 100 senators are voting to open up the government,” Thune said. “We need five bold, courageous Democrats with a backbone who are willing to take on their far-left activist base and join us in passing this.”Thune largely rejected the idea floated by some Republican lawmakers that the chamber should get rid of the 60-vote threshold for advancing major legislation, which has so far blocked the House-passed stopgap spending bill from moving toward final passage. “There are folks out there that think that is the way we ought to do things around here, simple majority,” Thune said. “But I can tell you that the filibuster through the years has been something that has been a bulwark against a lot of bad things happening to the country.”Thune added the legislative filibuster, which is different from the talking filibuster that most people are familiar with, is necessary to protect the rights of the minority political party and give it a voice in running the government. Johnson nixes vote again on military payJohnson, R-La., remained consistent during an earlier press conference that he will not bring the House back into session to vote on a bill to ensure on-time pay for military members during the shutdown. He’s repeatedly said the best way to avoid delayed paychecks for federal workers is for Democrats to advance the House-passed stopgap spending bill. The stalemate over government funding largely revolves around whether congressional leaders will be able to find bipartisan compromise and enact legislation to extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, which are set to expire at the end of the year.Democrats argue lawmakers need to broker an agreement now, before open enrollment begins on Nov. 1. Republican leaders contend they’re willing to talk after the government reopens, but they haven’t provided any commitments and have been tight-lipped about what they’d be willing to consider. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said during a morning press conference before the layoff announcement that Republicans must compromise on health care. “What we’ve said to our Republican colleagues is we have to address the health care crisis that they’ve created decisively — that means legislatively and that means right now,” Jeffries said.",,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)This weekend, festivals celebrating Acadian and Creole culture will take over the Lafayette area, but some Canadians won’t be coming. Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, says their absence is because of rhetoric from the White House, and he’s asking President Donald Trump for an apology.
Since taking office in January for his second term, Trump has made several comments about Canada becoming the 51st state and has chastised the country in his ongoing international trade war. Just this week, in a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cracked a joke about a “merger” of the two countries. 
During a recent trip to the country to promote Louisiana tourism, Nungesser said many Canadians upset by Trump’s remarks told him they’re staying away from the U.S. — and Louisiana. Nungesser is now asking the president to apologize to Canadians in hopes of stopping the loss of tourism and diplomatic relations.
“They just pretty much said that they’re not coming back until he’s either out of office or he apologizes,” Nungesser said.
This weekend is the start of the Grand Reveil Acadien, or “Great Acadian Awakening,” near Lafayette, Louisiana. The nine-day festival happens every five years and celebrates the Acadians, descendants of early French settlers who came to Louisiana from Canada in the 1700s. It typically attracts many tourists from Canada, but some will not be making the trek this year because of Trump.
At least one tour company with plans of bringing four charter buses full of people canceled, according to Randal Menard, the president of the non-profit that puts on the festival.
“ After the tariffs and the president’s comments, he let us know that people were dropping like flies,” Menard said.
Trump’s trade war risks undoing Michigan’s hard-earned progress

Nungesser hasn’t heard back from the president and admits that an apology might not fully fix the issue. But he doesn’t know what else to do.
Tourism from Canada is down 20% to 30%, he said, and data from Canada shows a 25% drop in U.S. visits in July compared to last year.
He said the U.S. has become an unpopular destination for Canadians.
“Airlines still have the flights, but they’re not advertising travel to America,” Nungesser said.
As for this weekend, Grand Reveil Acadien will go on and will be flooded with Louisiana French music and the smells of good ol’ Louisiana cooking. But locals will celebrate without many of their Canadian cousins, said Menard.
“I mean, we’re gonna miss their presence. The program will go on, but it’s not gonna be the same without their participation,” Menard said.
He hopes their absence will only be temporary.

,DC,2025-10-10 17:10:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump undertakes a MAGA-centric makeover of US civics education,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-undertakes-maga-centric-makeover-us-civics-education,,"WASHINGTON — A slew of conservative groups will lead a new coalition to spur civics education and push the subject in a more patriotic direction, the U.S. Education Department announced last month, raising alarms for some traditional civics and education groups that were not included in the initiative.The America First Policy Institute, a think tank with close ties to the president, is organizing and coordinating the America 250 Civics Education Coalition made up of more than 40 national and state-based groups, including prominent conservative advocacy organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and Turning Point USA.The vast majority of the groups in the coalition promote a vision of U.S. identity that downplays historical wrongs associated with race and gender and projects the country as an exceptional force for good. Many are well-known conservative groups that have promoted President Donald Trump’s political agenda.The coalition lacks many of the more traditional civics education groups who say their nonpartisanship is a fundamental element of civics education, leading to concerns from those groups that civics education is really the initiative’s goal. “Our organization serves students in every state and over 80% of counties,” said Shawn Healy, the chief policy and advocacy officer at iCivics, a group that promotes public support for civics education. “You can’t do that if your curriculum is shaded red or blue — it has to be fiercely nonpartisan.”The coalition will have nothing to do with school curricula, a department official said last month, acknowledging that the agency legally cannot dictate what schools teach. And it will not receive any federal funding from the department, the official added.But the agency has taken other steps that appear designed to steer curricula in a more partisan direction.The same day the coalition launched, the department announced it would be prioritizing “patriotic education” when it comes to discretionary grants. The agency said patriotic education “presents American history in a way that is accurate, honest, and inspiring.”Earlier in September, the department said it would invest more than $160 million in American history and civics grants — a $137 million increase in the funds Congress previously approved.Civics as cultural battlegroundCivics — a branch of social studies that focuses on rights and obligations of citizenship and the basic mechanics of government — has been a bipartisan priority, though it’s become a hot-button issue within education culture wars regarding how and what is taught as America grapples with its complicated history. Many on the political right, including Trump, have long bristled at how that history is taught. Going back to his first presidency, Trump has sought to exert control over the subject.After retaking office in January, he reestablished the 1776 Commission — an advisory committee meant “to promote patriotic education.”“Despite the virtues and accomplishments of this Nation, many students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains,” notes the executive order first establishing the commission during his first term. The commission released a 41-page report in January 2021 that drew criticism from historians and educators, including the American Historical Association.In a statement signed by 47 other organizations, the association wrote that the report makes “an apparent attempt to reject recent efforts to understand the multiple ways the institution of slavery shaped our nation’s history.” Trump formed the commission after The New York Times published the 1619 Project, which aimed to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.” Heritage Foundation, Turning Point USA sign up In its September announcement, the department said the coalition “is dedicated to renewing patriotism, strengthening civic knowledge, and advancing a shared understanding of America’s founding principles in schools across the nation.” The coalition will include more than 100 events and programs across the country over the next year as part of the administration’s celebration of the country’s 250th anniversary. The coalition is set to feature a 50-state “Trail to Independence Tour,” a “Fundamental Liberties College Speaker Series” as well as “Patriotic K-12 Teacher Summits and Toolboxes” aimed at supporting “patriotic teaching nationwide.” The America 250 Civics Education Coalition includes right-wing organizations like the Heritage Foundation — the architect of the sweeping conservative policy agenda known as Project 2025 — as is America First Legal, a conservative advocacy group founded by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. Turning Point USA, co-founded by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September, is also part of the initiative. PragerU, a conservative nonprofit that has drawn questions among researchers and scholars regarding the accuracy of its content, was also listed as a member of the coalition.Education Secretary Linda McMahon was the chair of the board of the America First Policy Institute between her roles in the first and second Trump administrations. She had to sign an ethics waiver to participate in the coalition, according to the department official, who did not provide further details on what exactly this entailed. ‘News to us’While conservative political organizations were made part of the coalition, leading civics education groups were not even aware of it before its public launch.“Certainly, it was news to us about this coalition being formed,” Healy, of iCivics, said.Healy added that his group encourages the America 250 Civics Education Coalition “to be more pluralistic in orientation” and that the organization is “eager” to have a conversation with the coalition about what they’re doing.iCivics, a nonpartisan organization founded in 2009 by the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, launched CivxNow. The latter group describes itself as the country’s “largest cross-partisan coalition working to prioritize civic education in the United States.”CivxNow’s nearly 400 members comprise a broad swath of mainstream civics education groups. “It’s our fundamental belief, both as an organization and as a coalition, that civic education has to be fiercely nonpartisan and nonideological,” Healy said. But only one group — Constituting America — is a member of both CivxNow and the America 250 Civics Education Coalition. Momentum for civicsOthers in the civics education field said the added attention the initiative brings to the subject will be positive.The coalition “provides an opportunity for everyone interested in civic education and patriotic education to do something right now,” said Donna Phillips, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan Center for Civic Education, pointing to “decades where there hasn’t been enough, or any, attention to civic education.” Phillips, whose organization is a member of CivxNow, said she hopes “the civic education field more widely can benefit from the momentum behind the need for this and that we can all find a place within this momentum and this moment.” Hans Zeiger, president of the nonpartisan Jack Miller Center, described the administration’s initiative as the “latest development in what we take to be a growing movement for civics in the country.” Zeiger, whose organization aims to empower college professors to work on civics education and is a member of CivxNow, said his group is “very interested in growing the national civics movement, and glad that there are people all across the political spectrum getting involved in the push for civic education.”“It is always a good thing to have national dialogue on civics education,” the National Council for the Social Studies said in a statement. The council, part of CivxNow, added that they “strive for balanced conversations that will continue to elevate high quality social studies standards.” Teachers unions criticize coalition  The two major teachers unions, which are politically aligned with Democrats, blasted the coalition as unserious, and noted the lack of traditional civics groups.“We have decades of research on what works in civic education,” Mary Kusler, senior director at the National Education Association’s Center for Advocacy, said in a statement to States Newsroom. “The proposal they are peddling lacks the rigor and respect our students deserve — which is evident by the lack of any respected civics or civil rights organizations as signers.”Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement the 250th anniversary of the nation should have been “an opportunity for parents, teachers, historians and students to learn, celebrate, critique and think critically about our democracy.”“Instead, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and the America 250 Civics Education Coalition rushed to create programming based on a single Trump-approved, ideological narrative, excluding the very people who know our history best: civics teachers and historians,” she said.",,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

Newsom introduced CARE Court to bring more people experiencing severe mental illness into treatment. It has helped fewer people than he projected, but a new law will make more people eligible for it.","In summary
Gov. Newsom introduced CARE Court to bring more people experiencing severe mental illness into treatment. It has helped fewer people than he projected, but a new law will make more people eligible for it.


One of Gov. Gavin Newsom‘s marquee mental health programs may broaden its reach despite persistent questions about the number of people it’s helping and whether it’s achieving the goals he set out for it when it launched.
Newsom today signed a law that expands eligibility for CARE Court to include people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder. Under the law’s previous constraints, only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders were eligible.
Newsom in a written statement called the law and its expansion an important part of his administration’s efforts to bring people with serious mental illness into treatment. 
“California doesn’t sit on the sidelines while people fall through the cracks,” he said. “We don’t stand by while people spiral on our sidewalks or cycle through emergency rooms and jail cells — we step up. We built CARE Court to connect people to treatment, dignity, and accountability — because care and accountability belong at the center of how we serve our communities.”
Newsom introduced CARE Court in 2022, creating a program that allows family members, first responders, doctors and others to petition the courts on behalf of people with severe psychosis who couldn’t care for themselves. 
Once a petition is accepted, individuals are presented with a voluntary treatment plan, which can include counseling, medication and housing. If they refuse, a judge can, in theory, order them to participate in a treatment plan.
Almost two years in, CARE Court has struggled to fulfill Newsom’s initial promises. A recent CalMatters investigation found that the program has so far reached a few hundred people, far short of the thousands originally projected. 
The new law, by Sen. Tom Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat, sailed through the Legislature with nearly unanimous bipartisan support, no votes against and just a handful of abstentions. 
“The beauty of CARE Court is that it holds both institutions and individuals accountable, ensures individuals get the care they need and gives judges a clear role in overseeing and guiding the process,” Umberg said in a written statement today. “This bill focuses on implementation by listening to and learning from counties about what’s working and what’s not, in order to meet the goals of the original CARE Court legislation.”
But the bill faced plenty of criticism in the community, with counties questioning how they will implement an expanded program on a tight timeline and disability rights advocates raising concerns about the effectiveness of a program they consider “unimplementable.”
“We have to tell the truth,” said Lex Steppling, a founding member of All People’s Health Collective. “This is not workable. It’s not going to be workable. And I personally believe the cracks in the foundation are getting bigger and bigger and it’s going to collapse.”  
Steppling saved his harshest criticism for “the state’s self-described ‘liberal and progressive’ politicians,” who he said were too afraid of the Newsom administration to oppose the bill.
Wide estimates on CARE Court expansion
Umberg’s legislation could expand CARE Court enrollment, though it’s unclear by how much. Umberg’s office doesn’t have an estimate of how many more people will be eligible for the program under the new parameters. San Diego County said the new rules could increase its numbers by anywhere from 3.5% to 48.1%.
“We’re trying to focus on the right populations,” Umberg said. “I do think it will expand it, but not dramatically.”
Monica Porter Gilbert, a mental health policy advocate with Disability Rights California, said the lack of clear information from the state about how the program has been implemented thus far is a big part of the problem. 
“It feels concerning to massively open the gates to expand eligibility for the program when we really have no evidence that the program is having a positive impact,” she said.
Umberg initially wanted to expand CARE Court in a way that would have made even more people eligible for it. An earlier draft of his legislation would have included all mood disorders with psychotic features. But critics, including the County Behavioral Health Directors Association, warned that “massive expansion” would lead to people flooding into CARE Court faster than counties could provide services. As a concession, Umberg eventually limited his bill to bipolar disorder. 
Newsom’s mental health overhaul
In addition to expanding eligibility, Umberg’s bill also eliminates what he said are some “inefficiencies” from the CARE Court process. That includes combining two early court hearings into one, he said, thereby reducing the amount of time participants have to spend in court and saving administrative resources. 
The legislation also allows the criminal justice system to refer someone directly into CARE Court if they are charged with a crime and are deemed incompetent to stand trial.
Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the California Behavioral Health Directors Association, said her organization opposed the new law. She worries that counties won’t have the staffing or housing resources necessary to handle an influx of people. And they are still working out kinks in a system that is still relatively new, she said. 
At the same time, she said, county behavioral health departments are also pivoting to address dozens of other new initiatives, including Newsom’s 2024 mental health housing bond known as Proposition 1 as well as CalAIM, the governor’s overhaul of Medi-Cal for mental health services.
“We need to allow counties to implement the very many things that have been put on the table,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/032923-NEWSOM-MENTAL-HEALTH-OVERHAUL-AP-AH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678

Laura Kelly and Adam Proffitt, the state's budget director, gathered public ideas about shaping of the state government's next budget in 2026 during a town hall on Thursday evening at Salina South High School. The governor has scheduled seven more town halls through Nov. 12. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)SALINA — Anna Pauscher Morawitz devoted her opportunity to directly lobby Gov. Laura Kelly to request more be done to help Kansas rise above 47th in the nation in state appropriations for the arts.
During the first of Kelly’s eight town halls devoted to seeking public input on the next state budget, Morawitz said the arts in Kansas represented a $5.5 million industry and supported thousands of jobs despite the Kansas Legislature’s decision to cut funding and place new grant restrictions on the Kansas Arts Commission. In the 2025 session, the Kansas Senate went so far as to consider deleting the state’s $1 million annual investment in the commission hosted by the Kansas Department of Commerce.
“I’d like to know how you will encourage legislative and bipartisan support for funding and improving access for the arts commission and other creative commerce initiatives that build on our shared history, support educational and social benefits that make our state a place that people want to invest in and live?” Morawitz said.
Kelly, who was a member of the Senate in 2011 when Gov. Sam Brownback issued an executive order that temporarily defunded the commission, said she pledged during her 2018 campaign for governor to restore the important role of the arts commission. That was accomplished, she said, but arts funding remained a political target.
“I’m a true believer in the value of the arts,” Kelly said. “Now, what can we do about the Legislature? Well, unfortunately not all of them share my appreciation for the arts. I will propose in my next budget to restore the funding to the levels before the cuts.”
Exchanges like that between Morawitz and Kelly were repeated about a dozen times as Kelly and Adam Proffitt, the state’s budget director, met Thursday night with more than 100 people at Salina South High School.
Topics ranged from issues related to special education funding, the overall K-12 funding formula, college affordability, residential solar incentives, economic development, court-appointed public defenders, Medicaid expansion, funding of county treasurer offices, support for nonprofit organizations and the potential of National Guard troops being deployed in Kansas.

The first in line
The first person to address the governor was Justin Spiehs, who was irritated that he was arrested in June for criminal trespass at the Kansas Capitol during a political rally. He was repeatedly asked to move from a restricted space on the statehouse steps but declined. Speihs filed a lawsuit against members of the Kansas Highway Patrol and other officials, including Proffitt.
“I would say the worth of the state of Kansas depends on how much the government is willing to follow the Constitution,” Spiehs said.
“Sir, this is a forum on the budget,” the governor said. “Do you have a question related to the budget?”
“If you let me finish, governor, I’ll get to my question,” he said. “How much do you think that’s going to cost taxpayers to defend that lawsuit?”
“Sir, I’m going to cut you off,” Kelly replied. “If you want to go to the back of the line and formulate a question regarding the budget, we’ll be glad to respond.”
During a brief news conference after the town hall, Spiehs continued to toss questions at the governor about his lawsuit.
Jeff Hayes, executive director of the Central Kansas Cooperative in Education, which serves special education students in 12 central Kansas school districts, said it was important for the Legislature to comply with a state law to fully fund programs for disabled and gifted students in special education programs statewide. Currently, the Legislature doesn’t provide money to meet a mandate to cover 92% of excess special education costs otherwise borne by individual school districts.
“I know you’ve advanced in your budget a considerable amount of special education funding that has not been passed through the Legislature,” Hayes said. “Education isn’t fully funded until special education is fully funded.”
Kelly proposed a multiyear approach for Kansas to address its spending shortfall on special education. She said the federal government had also failed to deliver on an obligation to provide special education funding, which exacerbated the challenge for states.
“I bring this up regularly with our congressional delegation, hoping they will give it it’s due,” Kelly said. “I’m not optimistic given how things are right now at the federal level that we’re going to see that.”
Colin Burke, a student in Salina public schools, requested the governor work to concentrate her advocacy for continued funding of K-12 public schools and to make higher education affordable to residents of Kansans, which could include moderation of tuition rates and allocation of funding for scholarships.

Solar power, National Guard
Compensation that Kansans with residential solar panels receive for pushing power onto the electric grid should be improved, said Phil Black, a homeowner who said net metering policy in Kansas was tipped in favor of utility companies. Existing standards in Kansas provide homeowners a dollar-for-dollar credit for solar energy production up to the amount consumed by that homeowner, he said.
He said he received only 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour from Evergy. The Kansas Corporation Commission wasn’t interested in modifying compensation to small producers, he said.
“Is there anything budgetarily that could be done to help offset what we’re not getting?” Black said.
Kelly, who has supported development of wind and other forms of renewable energy, said she would refer his inquiry to others in her administration.
“This is not something we’ve thought about before, but it’s something we will take back and we will talk with folks who know more about this that we do,” she said.
Shelby Hermosillo, who was among a group of women arrested in September during a protest in Washington, D.C., sought assurances from Kelly that she wouldn’t allow National Guard troops to violate civil rights if deployed in Kansas. President Donald Trump has argued National Guard troops should be sent to cities or states led by Democrats to quell protests, safeguard ICE personnel or quell protests.
“As an activist in the community who cares about the community safety but also our financial security, particularly for impoverished, marginalized people, how would you balance the financial and community impact if the National Guard were deployed to Kansas?” Hermosillo said. “What safeguards would you put in place to make sure that their use aligns with both fiscal responsibility and protection of Kansas’ civil rights?”
Kelly, who is chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said no one needed to worry about her deploying the National Guard to advance Trump’s agenda.
“I have been adamantly vocal about how inappropriate it is to use our National Guard to do law enforcement,” Kelly said. “That is not what they signed up for. That is not what they’re trained to do. That’s not what they’re budgeted to do.”
Kelly has scheduled comparable town halls between Oct. 29 and Nov. 12 in Hays, Garden City, Leawood, Emporia, Pittsburg, Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas. The objective, she said, was to gather insights from the public as she prepares budget recommendations for the 2026 Legislature.
“We’re going to take what we’ve heard here tonight, and what we’ll hear in the next seven stops that we make, and we really, truly will put that together … to put the budget together,” Kelly said. “We will do what we can to reflect the kinds of things that we’ve heard here and that we expect to hear across the state.”
She urged participants at the town hall to share their budget priorities with legislators representing the Salina area.
“Go where they are and express your concerns about this and anything else that you’ve got,” Kelly said. “It really is the responsibility of elected officials to be transparent, to be receptive to their constituents’ input.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Proffitt-Kelly-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 13:58:34.858678
,Mississippi Today,2025-10-10 16:34:39+00:00,Mississippi Today,Historian looks at Mississippi Medicaid through Rep. Robert Clark’s early advocacy,Derrion Arrington,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/10/historian-mississippi-medicaid-robert-clark-advocacy/,"Historian says that policies advocated more than 50 years ago by Robert Clark, the state's first Black legislator since Reconstruction, are still important today.","Editor’s note: Historian Derrion Arrington reflects on early positions taken by Robert Clark, who in 1967 became the first Black Mississippian elected to the state Legislature in the 20th century, and how those issues championed by Clark are being addressed today.

Mississippi’s struggles with Medicaid are deeply tied to the state’s broader history of social, racial and political tension.
When President Lyndon Johnson established Medicaid nationally in 1965, it marked a landmark federal expansion to provide health care for low-income Americans. The program coincided with sweeping civil rights reforms, placing the provision of basic health care at the center of debates about equality, federal authority and social justice.
In Mississippi, resistance to Medicaid reflected long-standing patterns of political conservatism, racial segregation and apprehension toward federal oversight. Many state leaders feared that expanding social programs would upset the established social hierarchy and erode local control. Southern governors repeatedly requested delays in implementation, citing concerns about raising funds and securing legislative approval, while conservative lawmakers warned against what they framed as a slippery slope toward socialism.
Amid this climate, state Rep. Robert Clark Jr., the first Black legislator in Mississippi in the 20th century, emerged as a rare voice insisting that moral imperatives should outweigh political caution. Clark called for a special session to prioritize Medicaid over other state programs, arguing that the needs of Mississippi’s most vulnerable citizens demanded immediate action.

“Before we place any new tax burdens on the backs of poor people, we must do something to help them survive,” Clark declared.
Clark’s proposals were ambitious. He sought to fund Medicaid by reallocating state resources, including defunding the state Sovereignty Commission – a segregationist spy agency that had long promoted racial hierarchies under the guise of preserving state autonomy. He also proposed expanding Medicaid to include welfare recipients who had previously been excluded.
Conservative factions, led by figures such as Sen. W. B. Alexander of Cleveland, opposed these measures vigorously, arguing that Medicaid expansion threatened to increase taxes and represented a form of “government overreach.”
Ultimately, in 1969 Gov. John Bell Williams did call a special session as Clark proposed. It was intense. Legislators debated heatedly, weighing fiscal concerns against human need. At one point, Rep. Sterling Seabrook collapsed on the House floor, a stark illustration of the session’s tension.
Despite the opposition, the Medicaid bill passed the House 79-34 and later secured Senate approval on Aug. 7, 1969. Mississippi, though late to the program, became the second-to-last state to implement Medicaid — a testament to the persistence of advocates like Clark, who fought to protect the state’s most marginalized residents.
This episode established a pattern that would endure for decades. Medicaid and other social programs in Mississippi were repeatedly subjected to political compromise, delay and retrenchment. Welfare reform in the 1990s introduced work requirements and time-limited benefits, disproportionately affecting Black and low-income communities.
Starting in 2010, Mississippi has repeatedly rejected Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, leaving hundreds of thousands without coverage and cementing structural gaps in health access.
The historical arc of Medicaid in Mississippi demonstrates a fundamental tension between the ethical imperative to protect vulnerable populations and the political pressures to restrict government programs. Each policy decision, delay or rollback reverberates through communities, shaping health outcomes, economic opportunity and intergenerational equity.
The battles of 1969 are not distant history. They are a lens for understanding contemporary struggles over access, equity and the moral responsibilities of government.
The 2025 policy context
More than five decades after Clark’s advocacy, Mississippi faces another high-stakes battle over public health coverage. In July 2025, the federal government enacted what supporters labeled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping package that significantly reduces Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding.
While the bill – now law – was framed as a measure to promote fiscal efficiency and personal responsibility, public health experts warn its provisions could have profound consequences for the state’s most vulnerable populations. The law imposes work or community engagement requirements for Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64, tightens SNAP eligibility and reduces overall Medicaid spending by 12%.
Proponents argue the reforms encourage self-sufficiency and reduce federal spending, yet in a state like Mississippi – where poverty is widespread, rural infrastructure is limited and access to health care is already precarious – the practical effects are stark. Analysts estimate tens of thousands could lose coverage and critical nutritional support, amplifying structural inequities that have persisted for generations.
The Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus convened a hearing in September to examine the fallout. Lawmakers, researchers and advocates warned that the federal law threatens health outcomes, workforce stability and community well-being. Nearly 1 in 5 Mississippians lives below the federal poverty line, and the state ranks among the worst nationwide for maternal mortality, chronic disease management and child nutrition. For these communities, Medicaid and SNAP are lifelines, not abstractions.
Dr. Laila Henderson of the University of Mississippi Medical Center testified: “Policy is never abstract. It determines who lives and who suffers. Cutting Medicaid coverage for working families destabilizes entire communities.”
The debate over the federal law also highlights the persistent tension between federal mandates and state autonomy – a tension that has shaped Mississippi’s social welfare history. Just as Southern governors in the 1960s delayed Medicaid citing funding and legislative concerns, modern leaders navigate the pressures of balancing political priorities, federal requirements and urgent public needs.
Looking forward: A moral imperative
The struggle over Medicaid in Mississippi is both a continuation of a decades-long battle and a reflection of enduring questions about the role of government in protecting its most vulnerable citizens.
From Robert Clark’s 1969 advocacy to the debates surrounding the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in 2025, the state has repeatedly confronted the tension between political priorities and moral responsibility. Clark framed Medicaid not as a political program but as a matter of survival and justice.
“There’s no need for babies to continue to suffer for lack of medical attention,” he said.
This ethos remains urgent. Today’s policymakers face the consequences of decades of delayed or restricted programs. The cuts  in the 2025  federal legislation threaten to widen health disparities, destabilize families and strain fragile rural and urban infrastructures.
The moral question is clear: Will Mississippi once again prioritize political expediency over human need, or will it act decisively to protect access to essential services?
The stakes are both ethical and practical. Reductions in coverage jeopardize public health, weaken the workforce and threaten economic stability. They exacerbate cycles of poverty and inequality that have long defined Mississippi’s social landscape.
Conversely,  expanding access to Medicaid and SNAP strengthens communities, stabilizes local economies and promotes intergenerational equity – the very goals Robert Clark championed more than 50 years ago.
Ultimately, the fight over Medicaid is a measure of Mississippi’s values. Clark died earlier this year. His legacy reminds contemporary leaders that social programs are not merely budgetary line items. They are lifelines that define the character and conscience of the state.
As Mississippi navigates the 2025 policy landscape, the state faces a choice: continue a legacy of resistance that leaves vulnerable populations at risk or embrace a vision of governance that prioritizes care, equity and moral responsibility.
The stakes are profound, the consequences tangible and the opportunity to act morally and decisively is as urgent as it was in 1969.

After weeks of waiting, California’s governor signed a bill that will allow mid-rise apartment buildings near major transit stops in California’s biggest metro areas.


Ever since the Legislature narrowly passed a bill last month that will pave the way for more apartment buildings around major public transit stops in the state’s biggest metro areas, the California political universe has been impatiently awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature or veto in a heated statewide game of “will he, won’t he.”
Today, he did. 
Newsom’s sign-off on Senate Bill 79 means that apartment developers will soon be able to pack more homes into neighborhoods within half a mile of major rail, subway, and bus rapid transit stops, overriding local zoning restrictions and any possible objections of surrounding neighbors. Buildings immediately surrounding these transit hubs will be entitled to max out as high as nine stories, with those farther out topping out at roughly four.
“The world looks to California for leadership — it’s time to build modern, connected communities that fulfill California’s promise, meeting the needs of today and the next generation,” the governor wrote in a signing statement.
The signature caps a legislative year full of housing policy overhauls that even just a few years ago would have seemed unthinkable. It also reaffirms the governor’s political alignment with the “Yes In My Backyard” movement, which has been championing the cause of building more housing in the face of a statewide housing shortage for nearly a decade. This summer Newsom signed YIMBY-backed legislation to exempt most urban apartment projects from review under one of the state’s signature environmental protection laws. “Go YIMBYs,” Newsom said when signing that bill into law. 
The new law is, indeed, a signature victory for the movement. The bill’s author, San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat, introduced an earlier version of the policy in 2018 with the support of the then still relatively new political organization California YIMBY. This year’s version, which narrowly passed both the Senate and Assembly last month with few votes to spare, marks Wiener’s fourth attempt.

 Scott Wiener
 Democrat, State Senate, District 11 (San Francisco)



“In California we talk a lot about where we don’t want to build homes, but rarely do we talk about where we do—until now,” said Wiener in a statement. “SB 79 unwinds decades of overly restrictive policies that have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people away from jobs and transit and into long commutes from the suburbs or out of the state entirely. It has been a long road to tackling these decades-old problems, but today’s signing marks a new day for affordable housing in California.”
Newsom’s signature comes as a grave disappointment for many local governments and neighborhood groups, particularly in Southern California. Last month, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass urged Newsom to veto the bill, saying that it would “erode local control, diminish community input on planning and zoning, and disproportionately impact low-resource neighborhoods.” Irate homeowner groups and state legislators raised concerns that mandating higher levels of housing density would “fundamentally reshape” suburban-style neighborhoods.
The “upzoning” policy was meant to be a two-fer: Allow for much more housing construction as a way to alleviate the state’s housing shortage and its resulting affordability crisis, while also steering more residents towards cash-strapped public transportation systems. 
Despite the ferocity of the opposition, the bill that Newsom signed is considerably more modest than the version introduced at the beginning of the year. 
After 13 separate rounds of amendments, the law will be restricted to just eight highly urbanized counties — Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Santa Clara, Alameda, Sacramento, San Francisco and San Mateo — and apply only to select transportation stops (train, subway, light rail and high-frequency buses routes with designated lanes). The law will also give local governments alternative means to comply with their own local programs, require a certain share of units constructed under the bill to be set aside at below-market rents and go into effect on a delayed schedule in certain lower income neighborhoods.
Even in that more muted form, the law is one of most consequential changes to statewide zoning rules in modern California history. 
Over the last weeks, Newsom has come under sustained pressure from both supporters and opponents. Advocates for historic preservation, tenant rights, local control and affluent neighborhood groups, along with Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton and former reality TV star Spencer Pratt, have rallied their respective audiences to inundate the governor’s office with calls and emails urging a veto. Supporters — among them national political commentators, billionaire megadonor Tom Steyer and every corner of the organized YIMBY online universe — have urged their supporters to do the opposite. 
Popular interest in the outcome of the bill seemed to escape the confines typical of California legislative debate. Earlier this week, an online betting pool popped up (the odds were always good for Newsom’s signature). The topic even came up during the governor’s guest appearance on the recent livestream of the popular online gamer known as “ConnorEatsPants.” 
Responding to a stream of public comments from his audience packed with incessant inquiries about the bill, the streamer prompted Newsom: “I don’t know what this is, but they’re saying you need to talk about SB 79.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/030925_BART_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 12:59:20.814066

Michael Padilla discusses appropriating capital outlay funds for New Mexico's 89 public schools security,"State Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) pushed to include funds for security technology and infrastructure at all 89 of New Mexico's public school districts. (File photo/Source NM)New Mexico public school districts have begun receiving portions of $35 million appropriated during the regular legislative session earlier this year for school security and safety improvements during the 2026 fiscal year.
The funds were appropriated through House Bill 450, which set aside funds for myriad capital outlay projects across the state. That includes include $50 for school security, continuing technical education equipment, school maintenance and repair, of which $35 million will benefit security upgrades. Majority Whip Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) advocated for including the security and safety fund appropriation in the bill.
“The objective here is to make sure that the school grounds are safe, warm, inviting. That they’re a place of learning, not a place that you need to be worried about going to,” Padilla told Source NM. 
He added that school districts have made large investments in recent years to improve security measures through various technologies. The $35 million is a way to supplement the previous investments and further improve districts’ security approach.
“We’ve seen the proliferation of cameras all around schools, all around our community,” he said. “This [money] actually really helps to tie all that together with an innovative approach to gun detection…you know, what’s coming into the school grounds and in bags and this and that.”
The funds will be distributed by the New Mexico Public Schools Facilities Authority among all 89 New Mexico public school districts, in proportion to the district’s proposed projects. Gallup and Gadsden schools districts will receive the largest amount of funds —approximately $5.9 and $4.1 million respectively. 
“Even if you’re a smaller district than, say, Las Cruces or Albuquerque or Santa Fe or whatever, you might have greater needs from a technology implementation standpoint than some of these larger districts, because they’ve had more money already on hand to implement this stuff,” Padilla said. “We want to make sure that every district is eligible, including the smallest schools in the state.”
Padilla added that this is a one-time appropriation, as lawmakers cannot guarantee that these funds will be included in the appropriation budget each year. He emphasized that New Mexico is undergoing changes due to federal funding cuts and the natural variability in the oil and gas industry.
However, he said the appropriation is one small way to help districts be proactive in improving school security and stop dangerous scenarios from playing out before they occur.
“This is one way for us to do that,” he said. “Our children deserve the absolute best, safest, warmest, inviting environment… Take that noise out of their way so that when they’re in the public school, all they’re worried about is learning rather than, ‘Am I safe here?’”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HK7A0398-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 12:59:20.814066

Gov. Joe Kelly during the first Trump administration.
The Republican-led U.S. Senate voted 51-47 Tuesday to approve a backlog of more than 100 nominees at once, which included the appointment of U.S. Attorney Lesley A. Woods for Nebraska. Senate Republicans changed internal rules last month to allow most executive branch nominees to be confirmed as a group, rather than individually.
Former President Joe Biden did not nominate a permanent U.S. attorney after taking office in 2021. Kelly served between 2018 and 2021 after being confirmed by voice vote.

President Donald Trump nominated Woods on May 6, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed her as interim attorney a few days later. Woods previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney for Nebraska between 2017 and 2023. She was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas between 2014 and 2017.
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, Nebraska’s senior senator and a Republican, recommended both Kelly and Woods for Senate confirmation, and Fischer offered her congratulations to Woods this week.
“I am confident that Lesley will excel in this role, which is why I strongly recommended that President Trump nominate her for this position,” Fischer said in a statement. “I look forward to seeing Lesley work efficiently and effectively — as she has done throughout her career — to keep our families and communities safe.”
A spokesperson for the Nebraska U.S. Attorney’s Office reached Thursday said the office could not comment on Woods’ confirmation due to the federal shutdown.
While an assistant U.S. attorney for Nebraska, Woods served as Nebraska’s violent crime coordinator, where she prosecuted gang cases, homicides, armed robberies and firearms conspiracies. She also served on the federal judicial district’s Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force and prosecuted human trafficking cases and other complex matters.
Between late 2023 and early this year, she was a trial attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Security Division, Counterterrorism Section. Woods was assigned to a Justice Department task force around the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack against Israel. She also served as a national security and cybercrimes prosecutor in Maryland between January and May of this year.

Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers on Thursday posted on X that he is “proud to be her teammate in our efforts to keep Nebraska safe!”
“We are very lucky to have Lesley in this role — in her short time at the helm, she has proven to be a highly skilled, tough, energetic and principled leader,” Hilgers wrote.
Woods is a native of Colorado and a graduate of the state’s Metropolitan State College and the University of Colorado. She earned a law degree from the University of Iowa and enlisted in the U.S. Air Force after. Nebraska became home after Woods met her husband, who is from Grand Island.
Kelly, in a statement to the Nebraska Examiner, described Woods as “a highly skilled and experienced prosecutor.”
“She is uniformly respected by local, state and federal law enforcement partners,” Kelly said. “Lesley is a fantastic selection for this position, which will help keep Nebraskans safe.”

The federal government shutdown is stretching into a second week with no end in sight. As Democrats and Republicans in Congress face a politically charged funding impasse, nutrition experts warn that women and children reliant on federal food assistance funding are particularly vulnerable to imminently losing their grocery benefits.
In the midst of it all, America’s ability to track the real-world impacts of the shutdown on hunger is disappearing. Shortly before the shutdown, the Department of Agriculture moved to scrap the Household Food Security Report, the nation’s primary tool for tracking food insecurity, and in doing so, stripped away the very infrastructure needed to remedy rising hunger in America.
“If you want a functioning country where people are food-secure, this is the survey that gives you an indication of how food-secure people are. And that data shows us that food insecurity has gone up,” says Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist researching climate change and food insecurity at the University of Colorado Boulder. “So, actually, as a country, the government response to that should be, ‘How do we fix that?’ rather than say, ‘Oh … let’s cut the whole survey altogether.’”
If the shutdown continues into next week, the lapse in government funding could directly affect the nearly 7 million American pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children that rely on WIC, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The National WIC Association has warned that the program is days away from running out of money. The USDA told state agencies last week that they will not receive their quarterly allocation of money for WIC because of the lapse in federal funding, CNN reported.
On Tuesday, the White House stated that it would use revenue from some of President Donald Trump’s tariffs to pay for the WIC budget shortfall. Just how much funding would be provided, and how that would work, however, went unspecified. “While Democrats continue to vote to prolong the government shutdown, blocking funding for mothers and babies who rely on Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), USDA will utilize tariff revenue to fund WIC for the foreseeable future,” a USDA spokesperson told Grist. The representative did not provide clarification on the impacts of the shutdown on nutrition funding, nor did they provide further details about Trump’s proposed tariff revenue strategy. The White House declined Grist’s request for comment.
According to Mitch Jones, managing director of policy and litigation at Food & Water Watch, the president’s tariff move is “likely impossible” without an act of Congress to appropriate the funds. The nonprofit mapped where the most young children at risk of losing benefits live, finding that the shutdown will affect the highest proportion of kids in Puerto Rico, California, and New York.
“It is poor women and children who will feel the impacts first and worst,” said Jones.
In the U.S., food insecurity is not a problem of production. (America grows and imports more than enough food to feed its population.) Food insecurity is an economic and social condition. When low-income households are forced to decide between rent, utilities, gas, or groceries, research shows that food is almost always one of the first costs that people cut.
The 2023 Household Food Security Report found that 13.5 percent of American households, or roughly 47.4 million people, were struggling to afford enough food to meet basic nutritional needs. Nearly 14 million of them were children. The survey gathers data about economic status, food accessibility, and participation in federal and other food assistance from a nationally representative sample of roughly 30,000 U.S. households. That report, which contains the most recent data available, also revealed that not only had food insecurity overall risen from the year before, but that the number of food-insecure children had leapt by 3.2 percent in that same time period.
The idea for the survey came to a head during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, when anti-hunger activists and policymakers ramped up discussions about tracking the economic levers that contribute to food insecurity on a large scale. It became evident that there was no relevant government data to enable their work, which sought to counter the Reagan administration’s move to shrink nutrition assistance funding based on a stagnating number of people using federal food benefits — a benchmark of national hunger. The government’s stance was in sharp contrast with soaring demand reported by food banks, and what activists and media coverage were capturing at the time.
In 1990, Congress passed legislation that mandated nutritional monitoring and research, which would serve as the formal basis for the creation of the annual food security survey carried out by the Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, or ERS.
Officials, local leaders outline what shutdown means for Nevada

In the decades since, the data has been widely regarded as the federal government’s most accurate, reliable, and comprehensive way of measuring national food insecurity and Americans’ economic well-being. “I think that it is on the same level as the unemployment rate and the poverty rate. It’s one of those central measures,” said Colleen Heflin, a professor at Syracuse University who researches food insecurity, nutrition, and welfare policy.
When the USDA announced its termination of the survey on September 20, the agency called it “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous,” and claimed that it does “nothing more than fear monger.” Shortly after, roughly a dozen ERS staffers were placed on administrative leave.
Other federal datasets do capture some of the indicators recorded by the food security survey. But those reports are scarce and limited in their scope, according to Heflin. The Household Trends and Outlook Pulse Survey is one example — collected every other month, it asks fewer and much less detailed questions about food insecurity. Heflin says it’s a poor substitute for the annual report. She also strongly objects to the USDA’s claim about the purpose of the survey. “Clearly the person that wrote that announcement has never read the food security report,” said Heflin. “It is a very, very dry and clearly written report that just describes the statistics. There’s nothing about fear-mongering. [That’s] so far from the truth.”
The USDA’s press release also noted that trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained “virtually unchanged” despite substantive increases in SNAP spending — and evidence of rising food insecurity captured by earlier surveys.
“For 30 years, this study — initially created by the Clinton administration as a means to support the increase of SNAP eligibility and benefit allotments — failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder,” a USDA representative told Grist. When asked how USDA plans to track food insecurity in America moving forward, the spokesperson noted the agency “will continue to prioritize statutory requirements and where necessary, use the bevy of more timely and accurate data sets available to it.”
Heflin warns that the loss of the report will have wide-reaching consequences. “It really leaves a huge hole in our understanding of who is food insecure, where food insecurity is most prevalent, and how changing economic conditions and policy conditions are impacting the American population,” said Heflin.
“I think of it as driving without your speedometer,” she said. “We’re not going to have accurate information to guide our reactions, both from a federal policy level and community level … We really are driving blind.”
The timing could not be worse. Food prices are at the highest they’ve been in five years, up 29 percent since 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. America’s public safety net is shrinking, too: Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” cut an estimated $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and tightened work requirements that reduce eligibility of who can qualify for the benefits.
“People are struggling to put food on their tables, and farmers are losing support, and food banks are being pushed beyond capacity,” said Jenique Jones, the executive director of the nonprofit WhyHunger. “Removing this data specifically — it silences the reality of hunger in America.”
All the while, climate change is further inflating the cost of food. It’s another reality that University of Colorado Boulder’s Mehrabi sees worsening as Trump continues his misinformed climate denial campaign and regulatory rollbacks. The growing destabilization of food supply chains — wrought by the compounding impacts of extreme weather events, global warming, the spread of diseases and pests, and migration and conflict — makes climate change one of the biggest threats to global food security, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
Rising carbon levels also diminish the nutritional values of the food we eat, making it even harder for people to get the base nutrition they need.
“There’s really clear evidence that things like zinc, vitamin A, iron, these really important micronutrients that we are really dependent on, are going to go down with climate change,” said Mehrabi. “Climate change is putting up the price, and pushing down the nutritional content. So what do you think that’s going to do to low-income households that are trying to feed kids that need their micronutrients?”
All the while, the government shutdown has left thousands of workers across the nation bereft of income, in danger of falling behind on bills and over the “hunger cliff.” And without the national hunger dataset, Mehrabi warns that our ability to track the longer-term effects of government policy on food insecurity — or of the shutdown’s possible lapse in food assistance benefits — will be very difficult to do. As will efforts to combat what’s driving more and more Americans to struggle to afford food.
“The government wants to reduce accountability. This is the big picture of what’s happening right now. You’d be blind to think this is just the USDA, just one thing. This is a whole systematic attack,” he said. “There’s a story being told that this is going to make America great again. Actually, this is going to make America worse.”

Without admitting any wrongdoing, Blount recently agreed to surrender her license with the understanding that she can seek reinstatement in one year, according to board records.
It’s not the first time Blount has been sanctioned by the board.
In 2007, the board charged Blount with employing or permitting an unregistered person to practice dental assisting, and with failing to maintain adequate infection control protocols. As a result, her license was placed on probation for two years.
In 2013, the board again charged Blount with employing or permitting an unregistered person to practice dental assisting. In that case, the board imposed a $500 civil penalty but took no action restricting her license or practice.

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills is supposed to announce a run for U.S. Senate next week, in an attempt to unseat Republican Susan Collins. 
On Friday, the online news publication Axios reported that Mills plans to announce her run Tuesday, based on an internal document it obtained. The Associated Press also reported that two people familiar with Mills’ plans confirmed that she is planning to announce her run.
The two-term governor has been the choice of national Democrats, who have been focused on unseating Collins. She gained national attention earlier this year after her tense exchange with President Donald Trump over Maine’s inclusive transgender student policies. 
The field to unseat Collins has already garnered national attention as oysterman Graham Platner has made waves as a newcomer, drawing a crowd in Collins’ hometown just last week. 
In a crowded Democratic primary, Mills would face not only Platner, but also Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, David Costello, Jordan Wood, Daira Smith-Rodriguez, Andrea LaFlamme, Tucker Favreau and Natasha Alcala.
The announcement is expected to be a turnaround for Mills, who said in April that she had no plans of running for Senate. Last month, she said she was “seriously considering” a run and had planned to announce her decision in November.
Spokespeople from the governor’s office did not comment on Mills’ run.

Educator and mountaineer, he climbed the Grand Teton more than 400 times, including a one-day ascent at age 75.
The post Teton mountain guide and avalanche expert Rod Newcomb dies at 91 appeared first on WyoFile .","Teton mountain guide and avalanche expert Rod Newcomb, who climbed the Grand Teton more than 400 times in a 48-year career, died in Jackson on Thursday at the age of 91.
A family member said Newcomb, former co-owner of Exum Mountain Guides, died of natural causes surrounded by family.
Newcomb first came to Jackson Hole as a teenager in 1953, leaving his family’s citrus nursery in California’s Coachella Valley for a seasonal food-service job in Grand Teton National Park.
In 1954, his second summer in Jackson Hole, the plucky youngster made his first ascent of the 13,775-foot high Grand Teton, an undertaking he would repeat again and again. By the end of his mountain-guiding career, Newcomb could only guess how many times he had been atop the peak.
“He was never sure,” his son, Mark, said Thursday. The two estimated the lifelong count based on Newcomb’s decades of guiding.
“It was more than 400,” Mark Newcomb said.
“He devoted his career to giving people the tools they could use to build whatever they wanted out of their lives.” Mark Newcomb
Rod Newcomb moved to Jackson just as Jackson Hole was evolving from a cow, dude and tourist town on Yellowstone National Park’s doorstep to an international resort. Working first as a ski patroller in the winter and climbing guide in the summer, he founded the American Avalanche Institute in 1974, an organization that’s educated some 30,000 people.
Newcomb taught others how to climb, ski safely, guide others in the hills and forecast avalanche danger. The lessons he imparted were about more than the mountains.
“He devoted his career to giving people the tools they could use to build whatever they wanted out of their lives,” Mark Newcomb, chair of the Teton County board of commissioners, said.
“If you look at all of his summits — hundreds, if not thousands — the vast majority weren’t for him. They were for the people he was giving those tools to.”

Born in May 1934, Rod Newcomb spent a couple of years of college and two years in the Army before settling in Wyoming. His folks hooked him up for summer work with a manager for the Grand Teton Lodge Company. His first season in Jackson Hole in 1953 hooked him.
“I just sort of kept coming back,” he said in a recent interview. “I was really attracted to the country. This was the place for me.”
He first wintered in the Jackson Hole valley in 1959, a time when there was, as he put it, “no winter economy.”

“Once the summer tourists left, the motel owners and café owners would get together and decide who would stay open over the winter,” Newcomb said, “and everybody else would take off.”
Jackson was “a poor little mountain village,” he recalled. Neil Rafferty was losing money running the double chairlift in the winter at Snow King Mountain, keeping it open for the locals on his summer tourist profits.
Newcomb began working for climbing guide Glenn Exum in 1963. It was the year Newcomb and other Teton climbers made their mark by pioneering a route up Denali’s East Buttress in Alaska.
Around that time he met his wife, Anne, who had been in college in Pennsylvania where she said a counselor told her of a mountain town in Wyoming “where the streets aren’t even paved.” They brought their first daughter, Lisa, home to Newcomb’s guide service summer wall tent near Jenny Lake.
The development of the Jackson Hole Ski Area, now Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, in 1964 was “the beginning of the evolution,” he said of Teton County’s change. The ski area’s European style aerial tram swung over steep cliffs and chutes — high-danger avalanche country — and the fledgling resort needed workers. Olympic gold medalist Pepi Stiegler hired fellow Austrians for his budding ski school; Newcomb signed on to the ski patrol.
After six years, Newcomb moved to a Bureau of Reclamation cloud seeding project in Colorado, designed to increase runoff from the San Juan Mountains. Snow and avalanche awareness was part of the undertaking.
Cloud seeding works, he said “but it’s not a viable way to suck water out of the clouds.” The project folded.
There was only one avalanche school in the country at the time and Newcomb thought it was inadequate for the legions who were beginning to tour into the backcountry. He began teaching snow safety and avalanche awareness in 1974 through his new avalanche institute, which he ran for 30 years.
He became a co-owner of Exum Mountain Guides in 1978. Newcomb celebrated his 55th season in the Tetons in 2009, climbing the Grand with son Mark in a day. He was 75.
Newcomb is survived by his wife, Anne, daughters Lisa and Maria, son Mark and four grandchildren.

(Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)DES MOINES — Iowa biofuels and corn experts congratulated Nebraska for its first shipments of carbon dioxide on the Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline, but said Wednesday that the development means Iowa is no longer king at turning corn into ethanol.
Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said now that Nebraska has a functioning CO2 pipeline, ethanol plants in the state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.
“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a new conference Wednesday. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”
Trailblazer and 45z
Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3.
The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide. By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit.
These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican led tax cut law, known as the “one big beautiful bill.”
Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.”
Impacts to Iowa
According to IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.
“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.”
Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy.
Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs have also added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.
“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”
Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050.
Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases.
“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.”
Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”
“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said.
Harder said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend.
Challenges
Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”
“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.
Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.
The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.
Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They have also said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain.
Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines.
On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026.
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restricting law in South Dakota. The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage.
Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.”
“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.

(Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent.)A man who has insisted upon his innocence in the 2005 murder of a Missouri highway patrolman is scheduled to be executed next week, even though the jury that convicted him could not reach agreement on his death sentence. 
In most states, a deadlocked jury would have resulted in a life sentence. But Missouri is one of two states, along with Indiana, that allow judges to unilaterally choose the death penalty when a jury is split on how to sentence a defendant for a capital offense. 
Lance Shockley was issued a warrant of execution in June after exhausting state and federal processes to appeal his conviction of the murder of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr.
Graham was found shot dead in the driveway of his home in Carter County in March 2005. He had been investigating Shockley’s role in a fatal 2004 drunk driving accident, which prosecutors said gave Shockley a motive to kill him.
Shockley’s defense team argued on appeal that his trial was flawed by a lack of physical evidence or eyewitnesses placing him on Graham’s property on the day of the murder, and that Shockley was entitled to DNA testing of items from the scene of the crime that could exonerate him. 
With a clemency petition pending in Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office, Shockley’s case has stirred scrutiny of the state’s unusual judicial sentencing law. 
Anti-death penalty activists protested at the Missouri Capitol Tuesday, with some carrying signs asking, “What if we got it wrong?” 
Group of Republican lawmakers raise concerns about Missouri death penalty

At a presentation at the University of Missouri Law School later that evening, Shockley’s lead attorney, assistant federal public defender Jeremy Weis, said Missouri law puts circuit court judges — who in most jurisdictions are elected, not appointed — under “a lot of pressure” to choose the death penalty. 
“Nobody ever wins an election for county judge or circuit judge by arguing that, ‘I’m going to be fair with defendants,” Weis said in an interview Thursday.
Every year since 2018, Missouri lawmakers have considered at least one bill to repeal the law.
State Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, sponsored bills in 2023, 2024 and 2025 that would have required a sentence of life imprisonment without parole in cases with deadlocked juries. This year, the bill stalled when it reached the full Senate, but she said she plans to sponsor the measure again in 2026.
“No matter what anybody’s individual belief system is about the death penalty, I think we can all agree that it should be consistently applied,” Coleman said in an interview Thursday. “And when you have one person making a decision on behalf of the state about the life and death of a citizen, I think it’s really inappropriate.”
But bills like Coleman’s have faced opposition from lawmakers who argue that current state law allows judges to ensure victims see justice for serious crimes.
Senate Majority Leader Tony Luetkemeyer, a Parkville Republican, opposed Coleman’s bill when it came up for debate in March. 
“A vote in favor of this legislation as it sits right now,” he said at the time, “is to protect some of the most heinous murderers in the state of Missouri.”
Members of Shockley’s legal team argued that, aside from the possibility of his wrongful conviction, his work as a mentor for fellow inmates over more than a decade Potosi Correctional Center should qualify him to continue that role while incarcerated.
Alyssa O’Brien, a mitigation specialist on Shockley’s legal team, said Tuesday that Shockley oversees Christian programming at Potosi and volunteers in the section of the prison housing inmates with developmental disabilities, counseling and praying with them. 
Shockley was selected for the prison’s Institutional Peer Support program, O’Brien said, which allows him to respond to correctional officers’ calls and help de-escalate when inmates are in crisis.
“Lance is looking out for the guys in the prison, but he is also helping the officers, because he’s helping maintain safety and facilitate these relationships between everybody,” O’Brien said.
Heidi Moore, executive director of Missourians to Abolish the Death Penalty, said that when she worked as an institutional parole officer stationed in Potosi in the early 2000s, the presence of inmates trusted by staff and their peers “mean[t] wonders.”
“When you get some of the younger guys that don’t know how to act,” Moore said,“they will listen to someone under a death sentence.” 
Weis said Thursday that he hadn’t heard from the governor’s office about Shockley’s clemency petition, but that he remains hopeful. This would be the first execution in Missouri since Kehoe took office in January. Under Kehoe’s predecessor, the state conducted 12 executions in six years.
“If we’re just going to say that we’re not going to give clemency to anybody who’s on death row because of the circumstances of the crime,” Weis said, “then you’re not giving anybody incentives to be good citizens, right? Might as well act out. What’s the point?”

Gretchen Whitmer signed the state’s new education budget; she also made official a number of changes to the Michigan Public School Employees’ Retirement System, or MPSERS, which provides pension and health care benefits to public school teachers. 
One of the biggest changes to that program was a $100 million cut to a program that, last year, offset a portion of the money that individual districts were required to pay into the system for pension and health care benefits of retired public school employees. 
In the Fiscal Year 2026 budget, however, that specific reimbursement was rolled into the “foundation allowance” — the per-pupil funding that every district receives based on their enrollment numbers. 
State Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), the Senate PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee Chair, said the decision to change that funding structure was what he considers the biggest thing that Senate Democrats had to give up in budget negotiations. 
“That line item just got pushed into the larger Foundation grant, instead of being something that directly goes to traditional school districts,” he told Michigan Advance. “I was frustrated by that, but that’s the nature of compromise.”

Thomas Morgan, a communications consultant at the Michigan Education Association, told the Advance that, all things considered, it could have been worse, but that doesn’t mean this should be a model for the future. 
“Despite losing that 1% of payroll, [school districts] still come out ahead so, as a compromise goes, it’s fine, but it’s not good policy to do it this way going forward,” Morgan said. 
The per-pupil funding has been touted by many, including Camilleri, as the highest per-pupil funding level in the history of the state, at $10,050 per student. In last year’s budget, per-pupil funding was $9,608.
But with these changes to the teacher retirement fund, some advocates are saying that’s misleading. 
“Districts are getting a little bit of extra money in this budget. It’s not a lot. In many cases, it’s not even an inflationary increase,” Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, said. “But you add in these additional costs that they’re now going to have to pay, you might be putting some districts in the red in terms of this year’s budget. They may have less spending power because of all these shifts than they did a year ago, even ignoring inflation.”
Camilleri pushed back against that, saying that the per-pupil funding level is higher even without factoring in the re-allocated MPSERS money. But the impact of the shift varies district-to-district, largely depending on how many employees each school has that are eligible for coverage by the retirement fund. 

Charter school employees are largely not paid retirement benefits through the MPSERS fund, so those schools are not required to pay back into this system — but they did receive the same boost in per-pupil funding that traditional public schools received. 
“Charter schools receive the same amount of money as the traditional school districts do, but don’t pay into the MPSERS system,” McCann said. “So those systems are already tilted in their favor, meaning they get whatever they get from the state and keep all of it, and while a traditional school has to send a whole bunch of it right back to the state to cover that MPSERS payment.”
The debate over this funding boils down, in many ways, to freedom for districts to allocate their money as they see fit, with this change eliminating some of that freedom. 
“It’s a policy choice,” Peri Stone-Palmquist, the executive director of the Student Advocacy Center and the co-chair of the Michigan Education Justice Coalition’s school funding committee, said. “That diverts money away from our community schools, and takes away local control, because it’s a mandated cost, they have to pay it, and so the more you push that down into the school aid fund, the more that takes away local choices and resources for local communities.”
Local districts have seen changes to this program in their favor in previous years. For example, last year the amount they were required to contribute toward long-term retirement costs was reduced from 20.96% to 15.21%. These costs come from a gap between what the state has set aside for pensions and health care, and what it still needs to pay in the future. Because the health care fund is currently fully covered, districts have fewer costs to worry about in that area.
The cap shift also happened at the same time as the end of a 3% tax that many public school teachers previously paid into a retirement health care fund. 
State Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth), whose bill last year codified those rate changes, was also opposed in this year’s budget negotiations to the elimination of that MPSERS cost offset. 
“I’m afraid it’s a slippery slope,” he said, “that because there is such a large amount of money in MPSERS, it would tempt future legislators to try to find ways of raiding it further in the future, and that’s something I would definitely stay opposed to.
A former educator, he said that for current teachers seeing these changes, they get nervous to see their retirement funds on the negotiation table. 
“You work hard as a teacher,” Koleszar said. “That was deferred income. You want to know that the state’s going to uphold their end of the bargain when you go to retire.”

David Arsen, a professor emeritus of Education Policy and K-12 Educational Administration at Michigan State University, said that these are annual struggles between districts and the state on the proportion that each pays into public retirement benefits. 
“Give us greater discretion over the use of our foundation funding,” he said of what districts are asking. “Cut back on the number of categoricals. It’s too much. It’s too limiting. Give us some credit. Lansing, please give us some credit,” Arsen said.
Part of the lack of freedom afforded to districts by this change is the constitutional requirement for public employees to have retirement benefits — meaning that even with this change, teachers will not be left holding the bag on their own benefits. 
Jason Burns, a research specialist at Michigan State University’s Education Policy Innovation Collaborative, said the cut in MPSERS offset funding will be experienced by districts as a loss of revenues since that funding has been appropriated over multiple fiscal years. 
“Relative to the prior fiscal year this is a decrease in funding, but districts are now paying a smaller share of payroll toward [Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability] than they were 2 years earlier,” Burns said in an email. “In other words, on net the package of MPSERS funding/subsidies is less favorable to districts now than in FY25 but more generous than in FY24.”
In a long-term sense, Burns said that districts are overall responsible for far more retirement funding. 
“If we rewind the clock 30 years, the state basically covered, funded the entire system. Districts weren’t really paying into it at all,” Burns said, noting in a September 2025 report which he and PhD student Matthew Guzman prepared, that Proposal A, passed in 1994, established the current system of district and state funding for K-12 schools, including retirement benefits. 
Burns also said that many of the changes in this year’s budget were scheduled based on previously passed legislation. 
“Those are largely enacting legal changes that have been made in the last few years,” he noted. “So there’s nothing last minute that was like, ‘Oh, this is a big shock’.”
But that sentiment was not shared widely — especially since the school aid budget, which is required to be passed by July 1 each year, was not passed until early October. 
Legislature passes $21.3B school aid budget, securing school meals and increased student funds

“If this was something that they had passed in June, for example, we probably could have made it work best,” McCann noted. “But when you’re passing this in October, it means that districts were already starting off without any budget certainty.”
He added that the closed-door nature of the negotiations meant that no one, including rank-and-file legislators, had any idea what was going to be included in the budget, including the balance of MPSERS funding. 
It’s a broader concern that advocates, including Stone-Palmquist, also shared. 
“We have increased retirement loss and liabilities getting pushed onto our districts, and they’re mandated to spend that. So what that means is that there’s less and less resources for kids who need the most,” she said, referencing teacher salaries and building infrastructure as crucial needs. 
“I think our kids deserve better than that,” Stone-Palmquist said.

Jay Collins in his office in the Florida Capitol. (Photo by Livia Caputo/Florida Phoenix)The looming 2026 governor’s race isn’t about Ron DeSantis versus Donald Trump, and those hoping for “carnage” between their proxy warriors will be disappointed, according to Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.
Collins, a Tampa Republican recently elevated as DeSantis’ understudy, has long been weighing a run to succeed the governor. Since his August appointment, Collins has stood alongside the governor at a slew of press events, joined him at multiple football games, flown solo to California to extradite a non-citizen accused of vehicular manslaughter, and hosted conferences touting law enforcement crackdowns.
And yet — even though it’s one of the larger, poorly-kept secrets winding throughout the Capitol halls — Collins has not announced his run for governor. 
In a sit-down interview with the Florida Phoenix, he said Floridians might not have to wait much longer.
“We’re wrapping up our decision. I expect we’ll have a final line of what we’re deciding to do relatively soon — in the next few weeks, probably,” Collins said. “When we’re in, I promise everybody, there will be no doubt, no equivocation. We will be in it to win it if we jump in.”
He made sure to praise DeSantis as “America’s governor,” reinforcing the duo’s projection of unity even as President Trump backs a different candidate, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, for the post. DeSantis has derided Donalds, 47, for lacking Floridian “victories” but has refused to endorse the only other high-profile Republican in the race, former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner.
The Trump-DeSantis dynamic, incredibly volatile just a year ago, has shown signs of improvement in recent months. During a press event in July celebrating the opening of the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, Trump promised that the two would be friends. Since then, Trump has endorsed Ashley Moody and James Uthmeier, two DeSantis appointees, in their bids to continue serving as U.S. senator and state attorney general, respectively.
That doesn’t mean DeSantis will come around to Donalds. He initially hinted that First Lady Casey DeSantis would be his chosen successor until scandalous financial allegations implicated her Hope Florida charity. DeSantis has since lauded Collins, a former Green Beret, and his accomplishments at nearly every press event since the veteran’s appointment, adding fuel to speculation that Collins may be his top choice.
If so, it could set up a Trump v. DeSantis proxy war in the form of the 2026 gubernatorial race.
But Collins doesn’t see it that way.
“Last I checked the calendar, we’re not there yet…”
“This isn’t about DeSantis vs. Trump. Let’s get that out of the way. This is about Florida. Period, end of story,” he said from his Capitol office, speaking from an armchair below a hanging photo of his family. 
“Gov. DeSantis is certainly not a lame duck. He is large, he is in charge, and he matters. Just like President Trump,” he continued. “But the average Floridian who supports both of them, they don’t want a choice. They want yes, that’s what the future looks like. It’s not one against the other.” 
Politico first reported that Collins might announce in late October or November. During the Phoenix’s interview, he said that although he has his family and community supporting him in a potential bid, he wants to make sure his leadership style is what Floridians need.
“I’m a very upfront, direct, bold, I would say even conversational leader, right? I like to communicate clearly.  And I want to make sure that my approach to leadership is what’s best for the state over the next eight years, if that’s what we decided to do,” he continued.
If he runs, Collins would face an uphill battle against Donalds, who’s raised $31.5 million so far. Renner has nearly $4 million in contributions and a $1 million net worth. Collins has roughly $1 million in his political committee and a net worth of $2 million. 
Collins brushed off either potential opponent, first indirectly hitting Donalds by pointing out that, historically, early apparent favorites tend to fall short.
“History shows us many things — the first person in generally doesn’t win, hasn’t won,” Collins said. “Gov. DeSantis wasn’t in the race until January. Last I checked the calendar, we’re not there yet.”
Meanwhile, Renner, who kicked off his race last month without the support of Trump or DeSantis, had told the Phoenix that he expects to win the GOP nomination by presenting a unifying conservative message amid what he expects to be a “civil war” between DeSantis supporters and Trump loyalists.
Collins criticized that approach, claiming that betting on “carnage” was something he would personally “never” do.
“I would never want to bet on the carnage between the president and the governor creating space for victory. I don’t think that’s good for Florida,” he said. “I think it comes down to our people.”

Trump’s crackdown on immigrants and liberal dissent during a town hall event in Stamford on Thursday.
In response to the grilling, Lamont rejected the idea that he’s simply playing along with Trump — though he said he is not seeking to pick fights, either. 
“You may not like the fact that I don’t shout and get as angry at Donald Trump as you’d like me to, but I think we’ve made more of a difference in pushing back on him than just about any state in the country,” Lamont told the crowd.
“We have fewer of our folks being deported,” Lamont continued. “We have more of our kids going to school. We have more of our folks feeling safe going to hospitals. But I can’t sit on that, because tomorrow that son of a bitch could do something to change the world.”
The town hall was hosted by the Stamford chapter of Indivisible, a progressive advocacy group. It was held at the Stamford Government Center in downtown. 
Lamont, a moderate Democrat, is widely expected to announce his campaign for a third term in the coming months. If he runs, he will face a more liberal challenger, state Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, in the Democratic convention next spring.
Elliott’s name did not come up during the 90 minutes of questioning Thursday. 
Aside from Trump, attendees largely wanted to know what Lamont was doing to protect immigrants, lower costs for health care and child care, and to address the state’s chronic shortage of affordable housing.
During the event, a pair of organizers with the advocacy group Sustainable Streets Norwalk held up signs urging Lamont to sign H.B. 5002 — the omnibus housing legislation he vetoed earlier this year.
Lamont continued to defend that decision, citing some of the concerns raised by local officials over a controversial proposal to assign towns a certain number of housing units they need to plan for and eliminating mandatory parking minimums.

He also said he was not ready to commit to adding a reworked housing bill to a special session that will likely take place later this year — even as he hinted that a deal may soon be forthcoming.
“There are some other things that I thought would have made the bill better,” Lamont said. “They’re not big things. I think we got them resolved, by the way.”
Matthew Silber, one of the organizers who confronted Lamont over the veto, said afterward that he was “disappointed” by the governor’s response.
“It seemed like he kind of kept walking back why he was opposed” to the bill, Silber said. “Towns have had the opportunity to take the lead for a long time, and they haven’t done so.” 
Other speakers at the town hall urged Lamont to take additional steps to protect immigrants from being pursued and arrested by federal agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One of the measures they called for was strengthening Connecticut’s Trust Act to include more courthouse protections and provisions preventing immigrants’ data from being shared with federal authorities.
Melissa Murray, a leader of the Indivisible chapter in Norwalk, said the group has delivered three letters asking the governor to call a special session to take up revisions to the Trust Act. Prior to Thursday’s town hall, she said she had yet to receive a response.
“I thought he’s been a great governor,” Murray said. “I like him a lot, but I do not see the urgency.”
Lamont declined to offer any promises that the Trust Act would make into a special session this year, though he noted that the Connecticut Supreme Court has already prohibited ICE from making warrantless arrests within state courthouse. He also apologized to the Indivisible groups for not responding to their letters.
“If we get a court order from the federal government, sometimes there’s a limitation on what we can do and who we can keep out of different facilities,” Lamont said. “But we’re trying to be as aggressive as we can, to do what I can to keep people safe.”
Lamont did offer one concession to the crowd in response to a question about his decision to follow Trump’s proclamation to lower flags to half staff following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. 
Lamont said he saw the gesture as making a point about political violence more generally, and he noted that nearly every other state had followed suit.
Still, he added, “I have second thoughts about it today.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lamont_Town_Hall-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

It could be worse.,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/ct-coffee-prices/,"In 2020, the price of a pound of roasted ground coffee in U.S. cities averaged $4.43. In August 2025, prices hit $8.87 per pound.","An estimated two-thirds of all Americans drink at least one cup of coffee a day, but the cost of it shot up in recent years and may continue to rise under high tariffs imposed by the U.S. on coffee-producing countries.
In 2020, the price of a pound of roasted ground coffee in U.S. cities averaged $4.43 according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in 2024, prices averaged $6.32 per pound, and the most recent data from August 2025 shows prices hit $8.87 per pound.
Connecticut, like the rest of the nation, is seeing sharp increases in coffee prices. According to data collected by Toast, an operations platform that thousands of restaurants and food vendors across the country use, the price of a hot cup of coffee increased 7.7% in Connecticut from 2024 to 2025. Some states saw increases as high as 11%. 
A variety of environmental and economic factors contributed to initial price increases, but tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could push prices even higher.
In July, President Donald Trump announced a 40% tariff on Brazil. However, a 10% tariff was already imposed in April on Brazil, along with many other coffee-producing countries, as a part of the administration’s “Liberation Day” tariff package.
While dozens of countries produce coffee, Brazil makes up 37% of all global coffee production. A report published in June by the USDA found that Brazil’s coffee production has fluctuated over the past five years due to drought and high temperatures, lowering crop yield. Vietnam, the second-largest coffee producer worldwide, also saw crop fluctuations due to drought and high temperatures.
“Vietnam is reduced 1.1 million bags to 29.0 million as drought conditions limited output,” reads the report. 
Brazil is also down in production by 1.7 million bags from initial USDA estimates due to drought and high temperatures.
Initial rises in prices came from the shock the global supply chain felt during COVID, according to a release from the BLS.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-07-at-5.03.51-PM-1024x671.png,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

Meanwhile, the state is juggling a goal of 220,000 new housing units to beat the crunch while trying to plan for a world with more extreme weather, be it floods or fire.","CONSIDERING COASTAL AND inland flood projections, and with the Bay State still a relatively low fire risk compared to western states grappling with waves of destructive blazes, the future in Massachusetts looks more dangerously wet than dry. But housing experts warn that a heating planet and persistent drought conditions call for a long-view approach to planning where and how new housing gets built across the country.  
Faced with a housing crunch, they say, people will move where they can based on the information they have – even if that area might be more susceptible to climate risk in the future. 
Migration patterns show many Americans making short-term affordability decisions that ignore long-term climate risks, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. “People are moving into places with higher fire risk, and out of places with higher flood risk,” she said. When cost drives housing decisions, people can be “myopic,” prioritizing immediate affordability over future burdens. 
“It’s really difficult for people to take [climate risk] fully into account because we have this tendency to consider information that is known and ignore information that is unknown,” Fairweather said. Most people “don’t have a good way to translate fire risk into cost,” she said. The amount of risk can “be kind of random,” because “even climate risk scores aren’t going to tell you if your house will be flooded or burn down, or if the houses around you are going to burn down.” 
Massachusetts experienced that randomness last year, when an unusually dry and flammable fall saw 1,300 wildfires burn across the state. This August was the 20th driest since 1895, though paling in comparison to the record-breaking warm summer of 2024, when more acres burned in October and November wildfires across Massachusetts than in the past two years combined. 
Climate research shows that while Massachusetts is projected to receive more annual precipitation overall, summers will experience more variable and severe dry spells due to rising temperatures and less frequent rainfall. Against this backdrop, the state is juggling a goal of 220,000 new housing units to beat the crunch with the need to plan for a world with more extreme weather, be it floods or fire. 
More than two million Massachusetts residents live in areas of drought, according to the federal National Integrated Drought Information System. At the conclusion of a “notably dry” August, the state declared most of Massachusetts to be in “significant drought.”  
And where there is drought, which leaves root systems and surface fuels like leaves dry, fire tends to follow.   
“Massachusetts is preparing for a future where flooding, heat, and wildfires are more common,” said Maria Hardiman, spokesperson for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. “We’ve seen a persistent drought for the past few years, increasing the likelihood of wildfires closer to densely populated areas.” 
About 45 percent of Massachusetts homes are in or near areas at wildfire risk, “meaning that any significant wildfire event may put people and property in danger,” the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife declared last November.  
Yet, the Bay State usually rates low on the National Wildfire Risk Index, which compares an area’s relative wildfire risk to that of the entire US. In the index, FEMA considers building value and population size at risk of experiencing a wildfire, estimated annual frequency of wildfires in a year, and the percentage of buildings or population expected to be lost in a wildfire.  
More dispersed areas like Berkshire and Franklin Counties and the more urban Suffolk County are considered very low fire risk while Worcester, Essex, Middlesex, and Plymouth counties are considered relatively low fire risk and a pale blue on the maps. This is a sharp contrast to states like California, where the FEMA maps turn scarlet around Los Angeles areas with the highest relative fire risk in the country.  
FEMA’s national wildfire risk map, as of October 10, 2025.
That doesn’t predict fluke years like 2024, when 200 wildfires burned across Massachusetts in October alone – a  significant spike from the typical 15 fires the state sees each October. Fire departments battled blazes across multiple communities simultaneously, from a 188-acre fire in Middleton to a 140-acre blaze straddling Salem and Lynn, while the Massachusetts Air National Guard deployed helicopters for water drops. 
Insurance companies are attentive, noting that fire seasons are also striking the Northeast. The region is more densely populated and includes more tightly packed buildings than, say, the Carolina coasts where wildfire risk has been crawling north over the past few years. 
Fires that leaps from wild brush and forests into the areas where houses and wildland meet “in the northeast have a much greater potential to cause rapid conflagration,” the financial services company Moody’s warned in December. Moody’s specifically noted the vicious fire season in Massachusetts and Connecticut – both states with among the lowest relative fire risks. 
Insurance agency Marsh McClennan, noting the rising natural disaster rate in northeastern states, also pointed to unusually long periods of drought as a rising risk. The agency recommends more spending on mitigation and more aggressive proactive measures from individuals, businesses, and state and local governments. 
“Homeowners are already having to put their own money into houses to make them more resilient to climate change,” Fairweather noted.
In Massachusetts, Barnstable, Essex, Plymouth, Hampshire, Norfolk, and Hampden counties are all vulnerable to wildfires, according to the state’s ResilientMass Plan, which rolled out in 2023 and outlines priority resilience actions. Areas with pitch pine and scrub oak trees are the most fire prone. 
As droughts become more frequent and severe, forest types that do not usually burn and are not fire adapted will be more likely to burn, according to the plan, which notes wildfires are projected to increase worldwide by 14 percent by 2030, 30 percent by 2050, and 50 percent by 2100. 
Gov. Maura Healey did not include drought management policy in her sprawling environmental bond bill this year, though the bill did add climate risk experts to the Board of Building Regulations and Standards, which establishes the state building code and determines how resilient new development should be. 
Separately, the ResilientMass Plan recommends the state take several steps to mitigate wildfire risk including improving firefighting infrastructure, creating a statewide wildfire training program, and better managing fire-prone ecosystems. As of October, work has begun only designing and building wildfire management operations facilities at Hopkinton State Forest and Douglas State Forest and creating a comprehensive facility climate resiliency needs assessment.  
These projects were not identified for funding in the bond bill, though communities have been receiving new federal and state wildfire prevention grants since the record-breaking fires of last year. The next round of the EEA-managed drought resiliency and water resiliency grant program is coming soon, according to the state. 
Massachusetts does not currently have plans to introduce restrictions on where homes could be built based on wildfire risks. The Office of Housing and Livable Communities has mostly focused on climate hazards like flooding or extreme weather.  
Housing advocates in Massachusetts say fire risk is a fairly distant concern, since the groups are usually focused on infilling development in urban areas rather than brush, farmland, or forests where wildfire risk runs highest. 
And when it comes to new construction, Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director at Abundant Housing Massachusetts, noted that “modern building construction, especially multi-family construction, is more fire resilient than old construction.” 
But, Heather Clark, former senior director for building sector climate policy in the Biden White House, warned at the recent pro-housing YIMBYTown conference that insurance market failures will reshape American housing – and not just in obvious high-risk zones. 
“In 10 to 15 years, we will not have mortgages in large parts of our country because we will not have insurance,” Clark said. “That is not in areas that are just coasts where hurricanes are, that is not just where wildfires are. When insurance markets fail, they fail across entire regions and entire states.” 
She cautioned against setting safety and climate resilience aside in favor of only boosting production. 
“When I was at the White House, we heard all the time we can’t spend $1 more on emissions reductions, energy savings, or resiliency, because that would mean one less unit of housing for people in need,” she said. “You’re not doing anyone a favor by putting people in harm’s way by building housing in harm’s way.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC_0536-e1650488411418.jpg?fit=1024%2C847&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

(Photo courtesy of city of Eagan)A lawsuit filed by Minneapolis-based law firm Robins Kaplan LLP Thursday alleged several local and county officers ignored critical medical symptoms that led to a man’s death in November 2024.
Filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the family of the late Kingsley Fifi Bimpong, the law firm sued three Eagan police officers, seven Dakota County correctional officers and Dakota County for the death of the 50-year-old Cottage Grove resident. The lawsuit alleges the officers acted with “deliberate indifference” over the course of about five-and-a-half hours while Bimpong grew gravely ill in custody.
Rosalind Marie Lewis, the mother of Bimpong’s child, and Josephine Adu-Gyane, a cousin, are seeking $120 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The case demands a jury trial.
Bimpong’s final hours were captured by police officers’ body cameras and the jail’s surveillance system. At many times, the complaint states, Bimpong was confused, unable to communicate, and lacked bodily control, which are all early indications of a stroke.
“The shocking deliberate indifference from local authorities stripped Kingsley of his last safeguard: the right to basic medical care,” said Katie Bennett, a Robins Kaplan attorney, in a statement.

The 72-page complaint meticulously details Bimpong’s experience while with law enforcement, from his initial confusion at an evening traffic stop on Nov. 16, 2024, to losing the function of his right arm at the Eagan Police Department and urinating on himself while he laid on the floor of a Dakota County Jail holding cell on Nov. 17, 2024.
The inaction from law enforcement and their failure to seek medical care in response to stroke symptoms resulted in Bimpong’s death, according to the lawsuit.
As of Thursday afternoon, the Eagan officers had not yet been served with the complaint, said attorney Vicki Hruby on behalf of the city of Eagan. Hruby denied that Bimpong showed signs of immediate medical attention during the officers’ interactions with Bimpong on Nov. 16, 2024.
“While Mr. Bimpong’s death is tragic, he was not exhibiting an objectively serious medical condition that was obvious to lay persons at the time he was in the Eagan officers’ custody and there no indication that he required emergent medical treatment,” Hruby said in a statement.
Eagan Police Department
The complaint alleges that Bimpong’s health emergency was immediately evident when Eagan police officer Joseph Moseng stopped Bimpong after he drove into oncoming traffic and onto a median on Nov. 16, 2024. Bimpong was leaving his job at the U.S. Postal Service with what the complaint described as a headache and “decreased vision.”
Body camera footage of the incident shows Bimpong struggling to communicate with the officer, the complaint says. Bimpong couldn’t say his own name, what city he was in, or who the president was, according to the lawsuit.
Eagan police officers Liam O’Shea and Martin Jensen soon joined the scene and found that Bimpong did not have a criminal history and had no evidence of drugs or alcohol in his car, according to the complaint. They attempted to perform a field sobriety test, but Bimpong was unable to complete it as he couldn’t understand officers’ directions or walk properly, the lawsuit says.
Jensen, a “drug recognition evaluator” whose training includes additional hours to thoroughly identify drug impairment, did not perform the full 12-step evaluation to determine if Bimpong was intoxicated — no pulse or vital signs were evaluated, the lawsuit alleges. 
Rather than address Bimpong’s apparent health condition, the officers arrested Bimpong and took him to the Eagan Police Department where they worked to obtain a search warrant for his blood, according to court documents. The case stated that while the officers discussed the possibility of Bimpong suffering a medical issue, they did not seek care.
It was during this time that Moseng spoke with Bimpong’s employer at the post office and learned that Bimpong had left all his belongings at work, one of his coworkers thought he was “losing his mind,” and he had been complaining of a headache, according to the lawsuit. The officers also observed Bimpong’s right arm lose its proper function at the police department, the complaint says.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the first signs of a stroke include a headache, weakness in the arm, problems seeing and trouble walking.
The complaint states that when Moseng asked Jensen if Bimpong should receive medical care, Jensen responded defensively and said doing so would result in a transport hold that requires one Eagan officer to stay at the hospital. Jensen purportedly said Bimpong had taken a dissociative drug, the claim states.
Throughout the traffic stop and procedures at the police department, the officers were intermittently muting their body cameras, which the claim states is against the city’s policy. 
A city of Eagan policy from 2020 states: “Officers may temporarily pause the recording or mute the audio to exchange information with other law enforcement officers or legal counsel.”
When Jensen and Moseng prepared to transport Bimpong to the Dakota County Jail, the lawsuit states that Jensen muted his equipment just as Moseng told him, “Before you got there, I was like, ‘Is this dude having a stro—’”
The complaint alleges that Moseng reacted to having admitted this to Jensen by pulling his winter hat over his face, shrugging and either laughing or smiling.
Hruby, the attorney representing the city of Eagan, noted in her statement to the Reformer that Bimpong “exhibited signs of drug intoxication, including unsteady gait, confusion, and a thousand-yard stare.” Hruby also said that Bimpong spent 17 minutes with medical professionals before being transported to the Dakota County jail. 
Dakota County Jail 
Moseng and Jensen transported Bimpong to the Dakota County Jail around 1 a.m. on Nov. 17, 2024, about two hours and 15 minutes after the initial traffic stop with Eagan police. Jensen said that Bimpong had “no issues” upon arrival, the lawsuit claims.
According to the lawsuit, the video surveillance captured at the jail was limited. Although common in other state facilities, the surveillance at Dakota County Jail did not include audio recording or time stamps, the complaint states. The lawsuit also alleges that the county kept select videos from Bimpong’s time at the jail.
The lawsuit names the following correctional officers as defendants in the case: Eduardo Decache, Brittany Corbin, Ramsey Strickland, Manuel Hernandez, Heather Hedden, Christopher Severson and Lucio Manuel Marquez Zazueta.
During the intake process, the officers noted that Bimpong had a language barrier, but the lawsuit states Bimpong spoke English and the problems in communication were caused by his health emergency. The booking papers also note that Bimpong’s medical questionnaire “could not be completed,” the lawsuit says.
The intake process at the jail included Bimpong being assessed by a full-body scanner, but Bimpong was unable to enter the scanner himself. Video footage shows correctional officer Decache forcefully pushing Bimpong into the machine, the lawsuit says. 
Video footage shows at least two men helping Bimpong move through the facility during the intake process, as Bimpong seemingly could not move properly on his own. 
Alone in the holding cell with one wall made of windows, Bimpong attempted to use the bathroom but hit his head and fell down, exposed, according to the lawsuit. The footage shows Bimpong outstretched on the floor reaching toward the door. The lawsuit says he remained on the floor for about 45 minutes, while officers are alleged to have been conducting wellness checks and deeming the inmate and the cell OK.
After nearly two hours in the holding cell, Bimpong urinated while on the floor, soaking his pants, the lawsuit says. Footage over the next hour and a half shows Bimpong’s condition worsening as he continued to roll on the floor with a lack of bodily control, according to the complaint. Still, multiple correctional officers conducted wellness checks and noted that Bimpong was OK, the lawsuit says.
After three hours and 22 minutes in the cell, correctional officers Corbin and Decache discussed Bimpong’s wellbeing, though Decache assured Corbin that Bimpong had been acting the same as he had all night and that the situation was fine, the complaint states. 
The lawsuit describes Bimpong as foaming at the mouth at this time.
Minutes later, the lawsuit says, Decache and a nurse entered Bimpong’s holding cell and found him unresponsive. The complaint says Kingsley’s pupils were “pinpoint, fixed, and non-reactive to light.” Additionally, the lawsuit says his tongue was white and protruding from his mouth, while he continued to foam at the mouth; his feet were gray.
Emergency Medical Technicians arrived soon after, and Narcan was administered three times without any effect, indicating there was no drug intoxication, the lawsuit says. A Hastings ambulance arrived at the jail at nearly 5 a.m. and correctional officers carried Bimpong limb-by-limb to a gurney. 
At a local hospital, testing showed Bimpong had a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage. “In other words,” the lawsuit reads, “[Bimpong] had a massive brain bleed that had caused his brain to shift and his brain stem to squeeze out of the bottom of his skull.”
With a condition too severe for the local hospital to treat, Bimpong was then transferred to United Hospital around 9:30 a.m., where doctors diagnosed additional severe conditions and neurosurgery indicated it was not possible for Bimpong to improve, the lawsuit reads. 
Bimpong remained in the hospital until his death was reported on Nov. 19. An autopsy revealed Bimpong died of a stroke, and the only medications found in his body were those he received at the hospitals.
According to the lawsuit, a Department of Corrections investigation into Bimpong’s death found that no correctional officers on staff were up-to-date with their first aid and CPR certifications. Training hadn’t even been offered at the facility since 2022.

(Provided by Clemson University)Clemson University opened applications for the inaugural class of the Harvey S. Peeler Jr. College of Veterinary Medicine.
The American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education gave the Upstate college the initial approval it needed in the accreditation process to begin enrolling students. The school will accept applications over the next five weeks, with the window to apply closing at midnight on Nov. 17, according to a statement from the college.
Dean Steven Marks has said he expects to enroll 80 students — 60 South Carolinians and 20 from other states.
The first veterinary students will begin classes in fall 2026.
The school will still need another round of approvals before it is fully accredited.
“Today is a very exciting day for Clemson University and the state of South Carolina,” university President Jim Clements said in a statement. “The Harvey S. Peeler Jr. College of Veterinary Medicine’s application window is now open, and we are one step closer to welcoming our very first Doctor of Veterinary Medicine students to campus.”
How Clemson University is starting South Carolina’s first veterinary school

The college is building the $285 million project, funded with money set aside in the state budget, to address a potential shortage of veterinarians in South Carolina, particularly in rural and agricultural communities.
South Carolina has more than 2,700 licensed veterinarians and more than 900 technicians, according to the state licensing board. That’s up from more than 1,700 vets and 380 technicians a decade earlier.
“Our mission is to prepare world-class veterinarians who will advance animal health, support agriculture and strengthen communities in our state and beyond,” Marks said in a statement. “The students will be prepared to enter the workforce on day one after graduation or pursue their education further to become specialized.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cropped-Clemson-School-WL-Photo-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-10 14:12:01+00:00,CT Mirror,"Shutdown forces Medicare patients off telehealth, hospital-at-home programs",Tim Henderson | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/shutdown-medicare-telemedicine-telehealth/,"Both programs are for Medicare recipients, but some physicians have stopped booking telemedicine visits for any patients.","The federal government shutdown is forcing a reckoning for two remote health care programs because they automatically expired Oct. 1.
The telehealth and in-home hospital care programs were both temporary — but increasingly popular — options for Medicare recipients. They allowed doctors and hospitals to bill Medicare for telehealth appointments and in-home visits from nurses to provide care that is generally only available in hospitals.
The shutdown has prevented Congress from extending them.
More than 4 million Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth services in the first half of the year, according to Brown University’s Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research.
As of last fall, 366 hospitals had participated in the hospital-at-home program, serving 31,000 patients, according to a federal report. The program, officially called Acute Hospital Care at Home, allows patients who would otherwise be hospitalized to get inpatient care at home with a combination of nurse visits, monitoring equipment and remote doctor visits.
The programs have their roots in the pandemic, when doctors and hospitals wanted to keep patients safe from the risks of travel and hospital stays. Both are for Medicare recipients, generally people over 65 or who are disabled. But since many private insurers follow federal guidelines, some physicians have stopped booking telemedicine appointments for non-Medicare patients, rather than risk a change in insurance coverage.
Alexis Wynn, who is in her mid-30s and covered by private insurance through her employer, tried to switch an in-person doctor appointment in Pennsylvania to a video visit last week. The office told her that “all telemedicine is uncovered by insurance as of Oct. 1” — so she had to cancel the routine appointment.
“It was just a follow-up appointment  to make sure the dosing of my medication was still accurate, nothing that was pertinent to being face-to-face,” Wynn said. Her health insurance company later told her it still covered telehealth visits.
There have been other reports of insurers turning down non-Medicare telehealth appointments, said Alexis Apple, director of federal affairs for the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group.
“It’s a misunderstanding,” Apple said. “I’m not really sure what’s happening, but it’s unfortunate and very scary. There’s so much uncertainty out there now, and we see insurance payers start to pull back.”
Both telehealth and home hospital services can be a lifeline for older people, especially in rural areas, where residents may struggle to travel long distances for health care in person.
“In rural America, it’s often telemedicine or no medicine at all,” said Dr. David Newman, chief medical officer of virtual care at Sanford Health in South Dakota, in a September statement supporting congressional action to make Medicare telehealth permanent. Bipartisan bills that would have allowed telehealth to continue stalled in committee earlier this year in the Senate and House.
There’s an exception for telehealth rural residents — but only if they travel to a brick-and-mortar health care facility to get the remote health care service.
“The patients have to go to a clinic to receive that telehealth visit from a provider in a different location,” Apple said. “It kind of defeats the purpose.”
According to the Brown University report, California had the highest rate of Medicare telehealth usage in the first six months of this year, with 26% of beneficiaries using at least one telehealth appointment, followed by 23% in Massachusetts and 21% in Hawaii.
There’s no reason for non-Medicare insurers to stop covering any telehealth visits during the shutdown, and even most Medicare Advantage programs will continue to cover telehealth, according to Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, a health industry trade association.
Nevertheless, at least some health care centers are refusing to take new telehealth appointments or are converting existing ones to office visits.
“This is causing a lot of confusion. We are still working with our members who are insurers and providers to get a gauge on what folks are doing — because at this point reports we’ve seen seem to suggest it is company by company, provider by provider,” said Sean Brown, a spokesperson for the Health Leadership Council, representing CEOs of health care firms and insurers.
The hospital-at-home program serves a smaller number of patients but its pause has caused more disruption: The federal government required patients to be discharged from the program or transferred to a brick-and-mortar hospital by Oct.1.
The Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic had 30 patients in the program in Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin — all of whom either had to be released from the program or sent to brick-and-mortar hospitals. One of Mayo’s hospitals in Florida was already over capacity and had no room for transfers, according to reporting by Becker’s Hospital Review.
In Massachusetts, which requires commercial insurers to follow Medicare guidelines, all insured patients had to leave the program. Mass General Brigham, which operates many hospitals in the state, has rejiggered its plans to create more home care without relying on the hospital-at-home program, according to the Becker’s report.
Congress was unable to avert a shutdown by late September, and some individual providers and patients were caught unawares.
Nurses on social media discussed losing home-care jobs or being reassigned overnight when the hospital-at-home program closed Oct. 1. They worried about patients being taken away from children at home, or placed in hallway beds at overcrowded emergency rooms because of the abrupt change.
“Management scheduled a random call this morning with a super vague title. Then drop the bomb on us,” wrote one poster in Texas. “So no job. Perfect!”
In a direct message, the poster, who didn’t want their name used for fear of getting in trouble at their hospital, told Stateline, “This obviously wasn’t ideal for the patients. One of them had four children and now could no longer be home with them. Some didn’t even get to have a bed in the hospital because there were none available and had to stay in the ER in a hallway bed.”
Parkland Health System in Dallas started tapering off its hospital-at-home program in September because of the impending shutdown, and the last patients were discharged from the program by Sept. 30 without returning to the hospital, spokesperson Wendi Hawthorne said.
“We are hopeful that Congress will renew this innovative model of care in the future,” Hawthorne said.
Likewise, OSF Healthcare in Peoria, Illinois, had started to wind down its hospital-at-home program “to avoid needing to return multiple patients to a very crowded facility,” said Jennifer Junis, president of OSF OnCall, which handles home hospital care.
There were only three patients in the program Sept. 30, all of whom were ready to be discharged without returning to the hospital, Junis said. Since the program’s start in 2020, it has helped 980 patients with home care through OSF’s Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria.
“It is unfortunate that we will not be able to benefit by treating qualifying patients at home, where they are most comfortable and recover faster,” Junis said. “Our digital hospital program has allowed us to free up beds for our sickest patients who need them most.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. Senate has unanimously approved a bill that would allow Alaska Natives to continue sales of traditional ivory art in states that have passed laws banning the ivory trade.
The ARTIST Act, by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, is intended to address state-level bans that were instituted to limit demand for elephant ivory but have also affected products made with mammoth and walrus ivory, marine mammal bone or baleen produced by Alaska Natives.
Harvesting and carving walrus ivory is legal under federal law, but Sullivan said that laws passed by different states have dissuaded tourists from buying ivory art when they visit Alaska. 
The Senate passed the bill without dissent on Tuesday, and it advances to the House for further action.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Sullivan thanked his fellow senators for approving the bill, which was introduced in 2024 but did not pass into law before the new Congress began in January. Sullivan reintroduced the bill, and it advanced through the Senate anew. 
“States have gone too far and cast this huge net and have said you can’t buy any ivory products anywhere, including Alaska Native products from Alaska walrus … this really has hurt my state, Sullivan said.
“This is a simple bill. If a visitor wants to come buy some ivory earrings in Alaska … and bring them home to a state with a ban on ivory … we want to be able to say at the federal level that we should be able to do this,” he said.

region. John McCosh/Georgia Recorder (file)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
Georgia has cut its greenhouse gas emissions per person nearly in half in the last 20 years, mostly by replacing coal power plants with natural gas and solar. But the state still has a long way to go to cut emissions enough to make a dent in climate change, according to a new analysis by Georgia Tech researchers in partnership with Drawdown Georgia. 
Georgia’s net emissions totaled 92 megatons in 2024, down from 141 megatons in 2005.
The state’s carbon dioxide emissions per person dropped by 45% from 2005 to 2023, the third-largest reduction in the country according to the Energy Information Administration. The Georgia Tech analysis found a 49% drop by 2024.
Report author Marilyn Brown, a professor at the Carter School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech, said the decline is especially impressive because in the same period, the state’s economy has boomed.
“What we’re doing is proving you can grow your economy, you can grow your population and reduce your emissions,” she said.
Georgia’s net emissions – the amount of carbon dioxide put out minus what’s absorbed by carbon sinks like forests and marshes – dropped by 33% from 2005 to 2024, while the state’s GDP grew by 127%, according to Brown’s analysis. That means the carbon intensity of Georgia’s economy, a measure of emissions per unit of economic output, dropped by 71%.
But the state still has a long way to go to further cut emissions, which is key to fighting climate change. Meanwhile, Georgia Power is extending use of its remaining coal plants and adding natural gas capacity, which produces less carbon dioxide than coal but does still generate greenhouse gases. 
And residential use of natural gas has actually increased. Electric heat pumps are popular in rural areas without access to gas, Brown said, but Georgia’s cities aren’t switching to them as quickly.
“Heat pumps pay for themselves rapidly, but people are afraid to retire an operating gas system,” she said.
Transportation emissions – now Georgia’s leading source of greenhouse gases – are about the same as in 2005. Emissions from diesel trucks have increased, thanks to a booming freight sector and the increasing popularity of online ordering and deliveries, the report finds.
Delivery vehicles could be a potential bright spot in the years to come, though, according to another report by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, looking at electric vehicle trends in the region. Sales of non-passenger medium- and heavy-duty commercial electric vehicles soared in Georgia in the last year, leading the country with more than 3,000 vehicles sold. The SACE report credited that trend largely to delivery and cargo vans.
The Georgia Tech report lays out recommendations for further cutting emissions, including expanding EV adoption and further electrifying freight fleets, further decarbonizing electricity with large-scale solar and storage, and electrifying buildings. 
It also highlights the state’s carbon sinks like forests, which go a long way to offsetting Georgia’s emissions.
“We are sinking as much CO2 almost as the magnitude of our transportation sector’s emissions,” said Brown. “It’s very big, so we need to protect that.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Atlanta-traffic2.jpg,,,2025-10-10 09:56:40.545669

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A George Mason University report released Friday looks at how Virginia can meet its mandatory goal of decarbonizing the state’s utility providers while also getting more localities on board for certain energy projects. It comes as Virginia faces critical energy demands as ratepayers and lawmakers consider how to meet those needs and make utility bills more affordable. 
The report projects that Virginia will see an 8%increase in energy demand by 2030 and a 20% increase by 2035, driven largely by the growth of data centers and manufacturing. In 2023, the commonwealth was the top energy importer from other states. Nuclear power is providing the heaviest lift of energy production in the state, with natural gas and solar increasing the most in bringing power online.
Adjunct Professor Paul Bubbosh of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason said the report is meant to be practical in light of the state’s energy needs. He said with challenges like the loss of federal incentives for renewable energy projects and supply chain holdups, the state will have to rely on natural gas in part during the interim.
“The complicating factor is that solar and wind are on a levelized cost of energy basis cheaper than natural gas and coal and nuclear power,” Bubbosh said. “However, with the added cost of supply chain issues, it further complicates the picture.”
Natural gas is also facing supply chain challenges for proposed gas plants and with fossil fuels continuing to be a scarce commodity, it will add to the steadily increasing fuel costs, Bubbosh said.
Bubbosh encourages utilities to ramp up their efficiency efforts and consider data center advancement that will allow them to pull less power off of the grid. Under the VCEA, Appalachian Power was expected to make a 2% reduction in energy consumption by 2025, while Dominion was told to reduce by 5%. Dominion has not met those goals and additional reductions will be determined by the State Corporation Commission every three years.
“Virginia has not met its targets in energy efficiency, so it needs to do a lot more in terms of getting consumers to reduce consumption during peak periods,” Bubbosh said.
States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years. Many projects are often thrown into the queue before financing or other permits are secured; some data centers may not actually materialize. The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.
“One of the key difficulties with a lot of these large load centers is the financing. So they now need to demonstrate that they have the financing in place and that they’re ready to go and that should improve things,” Bubbosh said.
The regional grid operator PJM has taken heat from most of the governors in the coverage area for slow walking the approval of connection permits, largely for solar and wind projects. Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid. 
PJM has pointed to supply chain issues slowing down certain projects already in the queue and delaying their actions. They have also made some reforms to ramp up their permitting process.
But Bubbosh said the real focus should be put on rural Virginia communities, to educate them on renewable energy projects, their own energy needs, and how they can meet their own demand while respecting the local culture.
“The pathway to energy security in Virginia runs through rural Virginia. It’s imperative that the Commonwealth’s government understands that to achieve lasting results, we need to bring those in Virginia, whom we’re asking so much of, such as their land, to be part of the conversation,” Bubbosh said.
There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects. Currently, it is up to local boards of supervisors to vote if a solar, wind, gas, or nuclear project can move forward and what the related ordinances will entail. In some counties, the boards have approved a power-hungry data center project application and denied a solar farm proposal the same night. 
The GMU report urges local grassroots movements to aid in creating community energy-need assessments to help rural communities understand which projects need to be built out to keep their own lights on, rather than sending power up north to Data Center Alley.
“The problem with Virginia is legislators are trying to ram through siting requirements at the state level. That will backfire, and you will get greater resistance to large scale solar deployment,” Bubbosh said. “So what we’re trying to do is to say, if you really want to achieve lasting results and energy security, you’ve got to bring on rural Virginians.”
The report suggests expanding solar projects in Northern Virginia where the power need is the greatest. Then the energy will be right at the source of the need. Once the northern parts of the state’s infrastructure has been sufficiently expanded, it would be easier to ask other communities to build out their energy infrastructure.
“Then I believe it would be appropriate for Virginia legislators to turn around and say, ‘Look, we all want to keep the lights on. We have exhausted the full potential in Northern Virginia and now we want to turn our attention to, let’s say, the Southside, or Tidewater’,” Bubbosh said.
Their goal with the report and recommendations is to aid state and local governments in moving forward with solid plans on how to meet the growing energy demands, no matter which party is dominant in the legislature or who occupies the Governor’s Mansion. That will help move the needle on siting issues, researchers hope.
“One administration is gonna come in and they’re gonna want to favor these technologies, A, B, and C. Four years later, another one’s gonna come in, and you’re gonna go back and forth,” Bubbosh said.
Bills spelling out how the state may aid communities in their energy plans are expected to be filed in the next regular legislative session, beginning in January.

Max Calfo, who lost the Republican primary for the 108th District in 2024, said this week that he has documents proving the incumbent, state Rep. Mike Costlow, lied on his candidate declarations last year. Calfo has, since early 2024, been working to obtain court records from Georgia showing that Costlow pleaded guilty to a felony theft charge there in 2008.
The records were released Sept. 12, when Judge Gregory A. Voyles of Lowndes County, Georgia, found “the facts show that the defendant entered a plea of guilty,” and there was no restriction on releasing all the court records.
State Rep. Mike Costlow, a Republican from St. Charles County.
Costlow took 60% of the vote in the 2024 primary against Calfo. He is seeking re-election and Calfo also intends to file for the seat next year.
Last year, Calfo tried to get Costlow thrown off the ballot based on the guilty plea, but he did not have the document he has now and the case was dismissed. Since obtaining the document, he said, he has filed a complaint with Secretary of State Denny Hoskins that Costlow lied when he signed a declaration of candidacy, under penalty of perjury, stating he had no past felony convictions or guilty pleas.
Hoskins’ office did not respond to an inquiry Thursday about the complaint.
Asked why he has continued to pursue the issue long after the primary, Calfo said he feels cheated.
“I think it is the fact that he defrauded his voters and disenfranchised mine and that really lit a fire under me,” he said.
Costlow, in an interview with The Independent, said he expects Calfo to sue him again. He declined to discuss the specifics of the Georgia charges or Calfo’s new documents, citing the likelihood of being in court again. But he insists he did not lie on the declaration. 
“He’s just trying to find some sleazy way to become a politician, and that’s the kind of action that the voters hate, quite frankly,” Costlow said.
When Calfo first became a candidate in the west St. Charles County district, the incumbent was state Rep. Justin Hicks. Calfo obtained documents about a 2010 domestic violence case against Hicks in St. Louis County, published them on his campaign website and was in return sued by Hicks.
Instead of filing for re-election, Hicks filed in the Republican primary for Congress in the 3rd District. Costlow entered the race when Hicks declined to run again.
The disputes within the district haven’t been confined to Calfo and his direct rivals and the old Georgia case isn’t the only criminal charge.
On Wednesday, Hicks’ mother-in-law, Elizabeth Sparks, will be in court in St. Charles County to learn her trial date for charges filed in July 2024 accusing her of harassing Calfo and filing a false report. 
In the probable cause statement, a detective from the O’Fallon Police Department accused Sparks of “falsely reporting the victim allegedly sexually assaulted juvenile females to damage (Calfo’s) reputation.”
Sparks admitted she lied in the report, the detective wrote.
Max Calfo, candidate for the Republican nomination in the 108th Missouri House District (photo submitted).
The new records available from the Georgia case will, Calfo said, become the basis for a challenge to Costlow’s qualifications to be a candidate if he files for re-election.
Missouri law disqualifies any person seeking to run for elective office “who has been found guilty of or pled guilty to a felony” in the state, in federal court or in another state. If the offense occurred in another state, it must be a crime that would also be a felony in Missouri.
In 2024, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that the disqualification applies in cases where the candidate had been pardoned by the governor. While the pardon eliminated the conviction from the candidate’s record, the opinion stated, “it did not erase the fact that he pleaded guilty to a felony offense.”
In Costlow’s case, Georgia court records provided by Calfo show he was charged with theft by agreeing to take a paintball gun, barrel kit and $150 in trade for an expensive paintball gun but reneging on the deal. Costlow was charged with two similar counts and pleaded guilty to one.
Costlow, the documents show, was placed in a diversion probation program for first offenders. His successful completion of probation means, Voyles wrote in the Sept. 12 ruling, “may not be used to disqualify a person in . . appointment to office in … the public sector.”
Whether the law disqualifying candidates with a felony conviction applies to members of the legislature is a question that has not been addressed in court. The Missouri Supreme Court decision was about a candidate for a county commission seat, an office created by statute.
The Missouri Constitution only requires that representatives be a voter for two years, residents of their districts for at least one year, and at least 24 years old. State senators must have been a voter for three years and 30 years old.
Calfo said he will seek to enforce the law if Costlow files for office again.
“On March 22, 2024, he swore under oath that he had never pled guilty to a felony in a separate state and that is indisputably not true,” Calfo said.
“There is really nothing sleazier than lying to the public about one’s past,” Calfo added later.
Costlow, in response, said Calfo has been trying, unsuccessfully, to get him arrested, calling police agencies in Jefferson City and St. Charles County, as well as asking the FBI to get involved.
“Everyone recognizes him for what he is,” Costlow said. “So frankly, I’m not worried. He’s just a thorn in the side.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_mocapitol1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-10 09:56:40.545669

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Indigenous Peoples’ Day off and will return to your inboxes Tuesday.
When the town council of Los Altos Hills approved construction of new apartment buildings two years ago, it was a big deal for the affluent Santa Clara County community, writes CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
For decades the mansion-studded town permitted the construction of only one type of building, single-family homes, and no more than one per acre. But now Los Altos Hills — where the average home price is $5.5 million — is having second thoughts, and the events that are unfolding underscore how local governments continue to push back against state requirements to develop more affordable housing.
Due to state mandates, town officials begrudgingly approved the development of Los Altos Hills’ first-ever affordable housing units since its incorporation in 1956. They chose an area along Interstate 280, known as Twin Oaks Court, and California housing regulators signed off on this plan in the spring of 2023. 
But earlier this summer, the town council voted to cut the number of planned new homes by nearly two-thirds. Officials and residents say the proposed changes still meet state requirements, and that the original plan would obstruct emergency access areas, worsen traffic and disrupt local wildlife.
State regulators are expected to respond to the town’s proposals by today, but pro-housing advocates have denounced the potential changes.

The California Housing Defense Fund, in a September letter to the California Department of Housing and Community Development: “It is grossly inappropriate for the Town to carve back its most important low-income site. … Local agencies should not be allowed to amend their housing elements the moment that they are confronted with a real housing development project.”

The dispute is being closely watched by other well-to-do cities that are proposing — or have proposed, to varying degrees of success — altering their own state-approved development plans, including Carmel and South Pasadena.

Cooling down those mobile homes 🧊

From CalMatters’ environmental justice reporter Alejandra Reyes-Velarde:
Californians who live in mobile homes will soon have the right to install cooling devices, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 806 into law on Tuesday. 
Advocates for residents say lease provisions and park rules have sometimes banned air conditioning units. Tenant advocates at Legal Aid of Sonoma County, a sponsor of the legislation, said they were surprised such restrictions were legal. The bill was carried by Assemblymember Damon Connolly, a San Rafael Democrat.
Caitlin Vejby, a housing policy analyst with the organization, said the law will save lives. Many mobile home residents in Californians are low-income, elderly or have health conditions that make them vulnerable to extreme heat, and three-quarters of mobile home parks are located in inland areas, some of the hottest regions of the state, she added. 
Starting Jan. 1, tenants whose landlords don’t follow the rules can sue for damages and attorney fees. Landlords could also pay a $2,000 civil penalty.

A conviction record can hinder one’s ability to find jobs, housing and education, but a state law making many old conviction records eligible for expungement can help some of the 8 million Californians living with a record, writes Joanna Hernandez, director of strategic partnerships at the San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion Project.

A jury found him not guilty of murder by reason of insanity after he stabbed a 6-year-old child to death. (Kentucky Department of Corrections)The child killer whose Oct. 1 release from a Kentucky prison sparked outrage on social media and criticism by the Trump White House is back in custody.
Ronald Exantus, 42, was arrested in Florida on Thursday and charged with failing to register as a felon. Florida law requires convicted felons to register with the sheriff’s office within 48 hours of release or entering a county.
The Marion County Sheriff’s Office in Ocala announced it arrested Exantus at a home in Marion Oaks on Thursday and that he is being held without bond in the Marion County Jail.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said Florida officials are working to send Exantus back to Kentucky.
Exantus admitted fatally stabbing 6-year-old Logan Tipton in 2015 after driving from Indianapolis where he lived to Central Kentucky and entering an unlocked home in Versailles where the Tipon family was sleeping. Exantus killed Logan with a butcher knife he found in the house.
After his arrest, Exantus entered the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center at the state prison in La Grange. At trial a psychologist testified that Exantus, a dialysis nurse, was in a psychotic state at the time of the killing. A jury in Lexington acquitted him of capital murder and burglary but found him guilty but insane on charges of assaulting other family members.
He was sentenced to 20 years on the assault charges and became eligible for release in 2026 based on credits he earned in prison for good behavior and other activities. He was released early under a 2012 Kentucky law aimed at reducing recidivism by providing mandatory re-entry supervision as inmates make the transition to life outside prison.
He was to remain under supervision in Florida until June under an interstate compact. As a condition of his supervision he was required to report to a parole officer immediately upon his arrival. The Marion County Sheriff’s Office did not say whether Exantus had reported to a parole officer as required.
Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said, “I am proud of the quick response by my deputies and the inter-agency teamwork that helped locate and arrest this disgusting individual. The fact that he was living right next to an elementary school is even more repulsive. I have no tolerance for this type of dangerous person flaunting our laws and thinking he would hide out in our county.”
Threats against Parole Board still under investigation
Earlier Thursday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the FBI has joined the Kentucky State Police in investigating violent threats made against members of the Kentucky Parole  Board in response to Exantus’ release.
The Parole Board had unanimously recommended on Sept. 30 and previously that Exantus remain in prison but lacked the authority to keep him there, according to the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.
Kentucky State Police Sgt. Matt Sudduth, speaking during the governor’s Thursday media briefing, said threats of violence are not protected under the First Amendment and can be criminal. “We’re going to continue this investigation, and if we can, when we get to a point where we’re ready to hold those accountable, that’ll be the next steps in the investigation,” Sudduth said.
Beshear said his office has not been contacted by the White House about Exantus’ release. Last week White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reposted criticism by a right-wing podcaster, saying, “I can confirm the White House is looking into this. It’s wholly unacceptable for a child killer to walk free after just several years in prison.”
Beshear chastised Leavitt for pushing out what he called “wrong information” and putting the “lives of our Parole Board members in danger.”
Beshear also said, “If you are calling and leaving one of these racist violent messages for our Parole Board members, they were trying to do what you wanted them to do. They made the decision the way that you claim that they should have. And there’s just no acceptable reason to ever threaten another human being with violence.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-16-e1759873943605-1024x455.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)More than six weeks have passed since Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office announced the State of Nevada had been breached by cyberattackers and Nevadans are still in the dark about the scope of the damage done, or whether the state has paid a ransom.
Cybersecurity professionals say investigations of incidents of this scale will likely take months, so it’s expected that additional information is not available, but some worry information might be downplayed or delayed for political purposes.
On Aug. 24, the governor’s office announced a “cyber incident.” All state agencies, including the Department of Motor Vehicles and social services offices, were physically shuttered for at least two days. All state agency websites were taken offline in what the governor’s office described as a proactive and precautionary measure.
For weeks: The agency that processes Medicaid, SNAP and TANF applications reverted to having new applicants fill out paper forms; mandatory background checks for firearms were unavailable, halting legal sales and transfers for anyone without a concealed carry permit;  law enforcement databases containing information about criminal records and registered sex offenders were  inaccessible; and businesses like car dealerships and smog check shops that use DMV databases experienced delays and issues.
Greg Moody, director of the cybersecurity program at UNLV, called it “the largest state-focused attack in modern history.” Others in the cybersecurity world have described it as an unprecedented attack.
On Sept. 12, the governor’s office announced that “90%” of public-facing state agency websites had been restored. Since then, the governor has provided no additional updates.
On Monday, the recovery update page set up by the state displayed a banner stating all state agency websites have been restored and the recovery page will no longer be updated. It’s unclear when that banner went up, and the governor’s office did not directly respond to the Nevada Current’s question asking when the last state website was restored.
“All major constituent-facing services are back online, and Nevada is operational again,” said Josh Meny, the governor’s press secretary, in an emailed statement. “Our agencies are diligently working to resolve any intermittent back-end issues, but the majority of these issues are not directly attributable to the cyber incident but are instead linked to other recent enhancements aimed at strengthening and securing our cyber environment.”
Some specific features of agency websites may still be down, but no full accounting of that is publicly available. As Meny put it, “it may be challenging to precisely quantify the minor adjustments currently being implemented by agencies” but the state “is actively compiling an inventory of these efforts.”
The governor’s office did not directly respond to questions about additional details on the cyber attack, including what ransom was demanded by the attackers, and whether that ransom was paid by the state.
“The state remains committed to transparent communication and will share a final update once all efforts have been successfully completed,” said Meny in the statement.
Moody from UNLV says it’s not surprising there hasn’t been additional information released. Nevada is working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI on the investigation, and one or both of those agencies is likely the lead, he says.
It takes a lot of time and effort to retrace electronic actions, says Moody, and investigators must preserve evidence for possible prosecution.
“It makes the process go slower,” he added.
Meny, for the governor’s office, emphasized that the state still “has not seen evidence of any constituent PII (personally identifiable information) being compromised in this attack.”
He added, “As Governor Lombardo has previously said, if investigators eventually discover otherwise, the state will follow Nevada’s strict statutes about personal data breaches by notifying any affected individuals promptly and providing resources to help protect them.”
The state has previously said that data was exfiltrated — meaning taken off the state’s system and moved elsewhere. But it has not said what that data entailed.
Moody notes Nevada Revised Statute includes a strict definition for “personal information.” To meet the definition, the data must include a full or partial name as well as another element, such as a driver’s license number or password information.
If the information was encrypted, it would not meet the state definition, he added, because there’s “some reasonable assurance” that attackers would not have access to it.
Moody says the attackers could have gotten information that does not meet the state’s definition of personal identifiable information, or they could have been exploring how the state’s centralized IT system is set up in hopes of replicating an attack elsewhere.
“Who knows,” he said, “Until we know the hacker and the motivation it’ll be hard to know what they were looking for.”
Lombardo in an earlier press conference has described the incident as a ransomware attack, and he has suggested the motivation was a financial ransom.
While some states have passed laws banning the paying of such ransoms, Nevada has no such law.
“They could have cut a deal or paid a ransom,” said Michael Leonard, a former IT professional and publisher of Mike’s Reno Report who’s been following the cyberattack. “‘Keep quiet and we’ll give you money.’”
Leonard is critical of the lack of info, acknowledging that while the investigation must be taken into account, the state still needs “to come forward with enough information to ensure us they’re investigating and credible.”
He suspects the silence is as driven by politics as much as by the investigation itself.
“I would say it’s equal motivation,” said Leonard. “To protect the reputation of government officials and elected officials.”
“There are unanswered questions and we should be asking them,” he added.
Lombardo is up for reelection next year and considered one of the most vulnerable governors in the nation. Candidate filing does not begin until March, but Attorney General Aaron Ford is currently considered the frontrunner to challenge him, though Ford faces a Democratic primary first.
Democratic legislative leaders expressed criticism of Lombardo in the days immediately after the cyberattack but have remained relatively quiet on the issue since.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager on Sept. 9 announced he would form a legislative working group on cybersecurity. His caucus did not respond to the Current’s request Thursday for an update on that effort.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/waitingforlombo-1024x774.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

(Photo courtesy Maryland Transit Administration)During its 2022 session, the Maryland General Assembly passed and former Gov. Larry Hogan signed legislation that provided up to $1.2 billion for the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens to upgrade their home stadiums. The case made by the two franchises was that these funds were necessary to keep Major League Baseball and NFL football in Maryland’s largest city.
Although some observers identify cities and urban areas as “major league” if they house the highest level of professional sports, we believe sports franchises by themselves offer an incomplete definition of the phrase. For the Baltimore region to truly be a major league urban center, we believe it must have a major league public transportation system.
Unfortunately, years of underfunding have kept Baltimore’s transit system stuck in the minors with a losing record. The current system demoralizes current riders, discourages new ones and damages the Baltimore region in multiple ways. Unreliable bus and rail service means workers don’t get to employment sites on time and risk losing their jobs; public school students miss valuable class time; senior citizens and others with medical needs are late for appointments; while shopping, culture and recreation are out of reach for far too many.
And for all the funds spent on the two stadiums, getting there on public transportation often means long waits on packed platforms while more people are stuck in game-day traffic congestion as a result.

This situation also undermines our region’s ability to attract new businesses and residents. U.S. Census data shows that until it recorded a very modest gain this past year, Baltimore was the only major East Coast city that continued to lose population while our peer cities — including Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., New York and Atlanta — gained population. A major difference between these cities and Baltimore is their robust public transportation systems, and the density and enhanced livability that such systems support.
While each of them has challenges, those systems provide much more frequent and reliable service than Baltimore transit riders typically experience.
But it’s not just Baltimore households without cars (at least 30% in Baltimore City) that need better transit service. Indeed, many Baltimore-area residents would love to drive less or trade their cars for a Charm Pass if bus and rail service were frequent and reliable, thereby saving money that could be used for housing and other living expenses.
The good news is that the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), under the leadership of Holly Arnold, released a new strategy this summer for vastly improving public transportation in the Baltimore region. It’s called Bmore Bus and, if implemented, would transform the daily experience for Baltimore-area transit riders.
Why? Because 80% of MTA’s ridership is on its buses. And while MTA is replacing its aging Metro subway cars and received funding from Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly to replace its chronically breaking-down light rail cars by 2032 or 2033, investments in the bus system will have by far the biggest and earliest impact on the day-to-day experience of current and potential riders.
We know the upcoming Maryland General Assembly session will occur during a challenging budget environment, but we also know that governments always find a way to fund what they value. At least four of our sister states in the Northeast Corridor — including Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania — have created or identified new revenue sources for the public transportation systems in their largest urban regions.
So can we! Remember the $1.2 billion Maryland found to pay for the stadium upgrades? MTA’s projected cost to implement the Bmore Bus plan is $1.1 billion.
And while the two stadiums combined are used fewer than 100 days a year, Baltimore-area residents, businesses and institutions rely on our transit system 365 days a year!
We believe it’s time for Maryland to value public transportation and those who currently use it or would choose to use it if service were frequent and reliable.
We also believe Gov. Wes Moore when he says, “You cannot have a thriving Maryland if you don’t have a thriving Baltimore.” The Baltimore region is Maryland’s population center, economic engine and cultural mecca … and it’s time we had the major league transportation system our residents, businesses and institutions need and deserve.
The Baltimore region needs Major League Transit … NOW!",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MTA-Buses-1.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

Joanna Hernandez is the director of strategic partnerships at the San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion Project and owns a barber shop with her family in Contra Costa County.


At 15, I became a mom. Desperate to make money to support my baby, I got involved in drug sales and theft. I cycled in and out of the criminal justice system until I was 23. 
Community programs in San Francisco helped me turn my life around. Today, I work for a nonprofit that connects people in county jails to diversion programs, which help them make similar transitions. And as founders of Freedom Braiders, my daughter and I lead programs that teach the art of hair braiding and offer cognitive behavior classes in jails.  
Although the mistakes of my past do not define who I am today, my old record still stands in the way of simple things, such as passing a background check so I can volunteer at my grandchildren’s school.
I am one of the 8 million Californians — that’s 1 in 5 people — living with a conviction record. Having an old criminal record creates all kinds of barriers. It hinders our ability to find jobs, housing and an education, and often keeps us stuck in a cycle of post-conviction poverty.  
Californians now have the chance to permanently expunge old conviction records. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law in 2022 that makes many old conviction records eligible for expungement, as long as a person has fully completed their sentence and has had no further contact with the justice system.
As part of my job, I visit county jails each week and I meet women with stories similar to mine. I can envision how much promise their future holds —  if they can clear their records. I see this work as an opportunity to show them that their community will not give up on them, that they deserve a second chance. 
Most just want a chance to make a living. That’s where the idea of barbering comes in. 
While they are in jail or just leaving it, we train them to become a barber or a braider, so they have a skill to utilize when they get out. Many student barbers who come through my family’s barber shop are either formerly incarcerated or have a conviction. 
This is my family’s way of paying it forward. 
Roughly 30% of jobs in California require a person to be licensed, and many of those licenses are off-limits for people with old convictions. 
With barbering, a criminal conviction doesn’t automatically exclude formerly incarcerated people from getting licensed, but the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology has discretion. That inevitably puts some people at a disadvantage and makes getting a conviction record expunged even more important. 
Now 49 years old, I started my expungement process a few months ago. I had put it off for decades because I was afraid of being rejected. 
I attended an expungement clinic, where lawyers helped me prepare the paperwork. I’ve submitted my request for expungement and, though the process can take several months, I’m looking forward to starting fresh with a clean record and continuing to give back to the community. 
I owe my second chance to mentors at two organizations, Mission Girls and Alive and Free. They showed me a different path was possible.
Joe Marshall, co-founder and violence prevention leader of Alive and Free, always told me, “The more you know, the more you owe.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/091823-Tulare-Jail-LV_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

Depends how you measure it,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/proposition-50-communities-split/,"Prop. 50 would enact a congressional map that helps Democrats, but a new analysis finds it doesn’t change Californians’ representation much on other measures.","In summary
Prop. 50 would enact a congressional map that helps Democrats, but a new analysis finds it doesn’t change Californians’ representation much on other measures.


There’s no question that the proponents of Proposition 50 have a partisan goal.
By seeking to adopt a map to put more Democrats in power in areas currently represented by Republicans, they are asking voters to temporarily bypass the state’s independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission, which for the past two decades has prioritized maps that keep similar communities together and provide more electoral opportunities for communities of color. 
Does that mean that the proposed new congressional districts would be less representative of voters, beyond party preferences? We looked into some common questions.
Who drew the Prop. 50 map? 
Paul Mitchell, a veteran Democratic redistricting expert in Sacramento, and a group of similar consultants drew the map. Mitchell explained in an interview that he took input from California’s Democratic congressional delegation before sending a proposed map to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
The committee then sent the proposal to the state Legislature, which adopted the map as part of its vote to put Prop. 50 on the November ballot. The proposition would allow the state to temporarily use those proposed district lines. 
Isn’t California already gerrymandered?
Not quite. 
Many Republicans, including Vice President J.D. Vance, already complain that under California’s current map, Democrats control over 80% of congressional seats even though the party got just under 60% of statewide votes in the 2024 presidential election. 
But that doesn’t mean the maps are intentionally drawn to give Democrats an unfair advantage.
Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two-to-one. The citizen commission that drew the maps, composed of equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans as well as four independents, were specifically forbidden from considering party registration in deciding how to draw the lines. They did have to consider geography, and Democrats and Republicans don’t live in an even distribution across the state. Plus, several of the current blue districts are highly competitive, with the incumbent Democrats winning them last year with razor-thin margins.
Two academic institutions that rate states’ redistricting plans say California’s current map is  mostly fair. PlanScore found the map is tilted toward Democrats by two measures and balanced by two other measures. Princeton University’s Gerrymandering Project gave California’s map a “B” score on partisan fairness, docking it only for giving incumbent politicians an advantage. (The proposed new map got an “F” from the organization.)
Would the new map further divide communities?
Both proponents and opponents of Prop. 50 claim their favored map – the existing one or the proposed new one – keeps cities and counties together more often, resulting in better representation by keeping similar communities under the same congressmember. 
So which is it? It depends how you look at it, and each side phrases their claims differently. The proponents of Prop. 50 are correct in saying their map splits fewer total cities and counties into two or more districts than the current map. That’s according to analyses of both maps by HaystaqDNA, the firm that assisted with the nonpartisan redistricting in 2021. 
An analysis by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that difference to be nearly negligible.
But the Democrats’ map has more cities and counties that are split among three or more districts, rather than only two. That’s why opponents are also correct in saying Prop. 50 splits communities more times — though in their argument mailed to voters, they overcounted the number of times. 
But keeping cities and counties intact isn’t the only way to judge the quality of a congressional district.
For starters, big cities have to be split into multiple districts to ensure that each congressmember represents the same number of people. Both maps give each district 760,066 Californians, give or take one constituent.
Plenty of California cities are split in both maps because the state constitution requires independent map-drawers to consider not just keeping cities and counties together but also “communities of interest,” which the law defines as “a contiguous population which shares common social and economic interests” that should be in one district to be represented fairly.
In any region that could mean everyone who sends their kids to the same school district, or everyone who works in farming, or everyone who relies on I-5 for their daily commute. But there’s no set definition of all communities of interest, so once you consider them, it becomes a matter of opinion how well each map represents Californians.
Prop. 50’s opponents have highlighted Lodi, a 66,000-person city north of Stockton currently represented in one congressional district that would be split among three districts under Prop. 50. The Lodi City Council opposes the measure.
Mitchell said the split stemmed from efforts to strengthen a northern Central Valley district for Democrats by moving in more voters from Stockton. The resulting shuffle forced Lodi residents to be split up, but also unified Antioch and Martinez residents into one district and Vacaville and Solano County together in another. All four of the latter cities and counties are split up under the current map. 
“It’s a tradeoff,” he said. “You could have competing communities overlapping. Which one’s more important?”
But opponents say those tradeoffs should only be made with public input and without partisan goals. In deciding which cities, counties and communities to keep together or split up, 2021 independent redistricting commission member Patricia Sinay said the commission held numerous hearings and received tens of thousands of written comments. 
“Saying one splits more than the other, it’s not that informative,” said Sinay, a political independent who opposes Prop. 50. “What did the people want? What did the communities of interest ask for?”
How does Prop. 50 affect representation for people of color?
In the weeks leading up to the election, opponents have highlighted regions that Prop. 50’s maps would split up against local community leaders’ wishes.

In a press release issued by the other No on 50 campaign funded by House Republicans last month, local politicians in Temple City and Azusa denounced the proposed maps for drawing lines through Asian American and Latino communities in east Los Angeles County. 
But in general, the proposed map doesn’t actually change much, according to the analysis by PPIC. 
If there are enough minority voters in a region to make up the majority of a congressional district, it could trigger the federal Voting Rights Act, which requires states to draw districts protecting the communities’ ability to elect representatives of their choosing. There are 16 such congressional districts in California, all with a majority of Latino voters. 
Other concentrated racial communities that don’t have enough numbers to be in the majority still have districts that are drawn with their interests in mind, like Asian voters in east Los Angeles County, or Black voters in south L.A. In six districts, Asian voters are at least 30% of the population — enough to influence an election. California also has two districts where Black voters reach that threshold and seven where Latino voters do. 
Prop. 50 wouldn’t change any of that. The public policy institute even found the proposed map would add one more district where Latino voters make up at least 30% of the population. 
“Some communities may have complaints about specific lines drawn by the proposed plan,” senior fellow Eric McGhee wrote. “But the plan as a whole is very similar to the current one in most respects: it deviates mostly by creating more Democratic seats.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/110822_ElectionDayLA_PU_CM_40.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

Details of services
A music-filled service of remembrance and celebration will be held for Larry at 2:00 PM on Saturday, November 15, 2025 at Centre Congregational Church in Brattleboro, VT. A reception will follow at the Guilford Community Church in Guilford, VT.

The Reverend Dr. Larrimore C. Crockett, 92, died in his home in Dummerston, Vermont on September 10, 2025, surrounded by family. 
Larry was born March 2, 1933 in Aurora, IL, and spent his early years living in the Midwest. The son of the Reverends Barney C. Crockett and Olga Winter Crockett, he carried the family’s ministerial tradition into a long and respected career as a religious scholar and beloved preacher in the United Church of Christ. After completing seminary at Chicago Theological Seminary he was ordained to the Christian ministry in 1957 in Dummerston, Vermont. He divided his time serving church communities in Vermont and Rhode Island, earning a Ph.D. from Brown University in 1966, where he also served as Chaplain.  
In the early 1970s he was Associate Professor of Religion at Keuka College (Keuka Park, NY), and Visiting Professor of Religion at Lawrence University (Appleton, WI). In 1973 Larry moved with his family back to Vermont where they built a home on the side of Black Mountain in Dummerston, a place he loved very much. Between 1973 and 1994, he enjoyed a rich employment experience in area churches and higher education. He taught and served in administrative roles at Windham College and Southern Vermont College. He served the Vermont Conference of the United Church of Christ, as Moderator of the Windham-Union Association. He helped create the Vermont Academy of Spiritual Training (VAST), and served on its faculty for several years. In later years he was the Pastor-in-residence at Chicago Theological Seminary and adjunct faculty at Bangor Theological Seminary. 
In 1980 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities by the College of St. Joseph, Rutland (VT) in recognition of his contributions to higher education in Vermont. From 1985-1997 he was Assistant Minister of the Guilford Community Church, serving with his wife, Shirley, who was the minister. This partnership and ministry in Guilford was one of the most satisfying experiences of his life and led to his writing a history of the Guilford Church, Safe Thus Far, which was published by Black Mountain Press in 1998 and dedicated to Shirley. He subsequently published books of Shirley’s children stories, The Mended Cup (2003), I Invite the Children to Come Forward (2010), her pastoral prayers, Be Present Here (2008) and several volumes of family history. 
Larry enjoyed researching and writing about his understanding of religious thought and published articles in academic journals throughout his early life. Later, he turned to writing about people who had an impact on his life and in 2010 he wrote and published a history of the Blanche Moyse Chorale, More Than Thirty Years of Glorious Sound. For over seventeen years he maintained a blog at vividreports.blogspot.com. His sermons were grounded in scholarly research but he was able to convey his messages of radical love, inclusion, and forgiveness through language and stories that connected meaningfully to his parishioners’ lives. Larry continued to be active in local congregations for the entirety of his life. His kindness, his thoughtful manner, and his sincere interest in others were blessings to all who knew him. 
One of Larry’s greatest passions in life was his love of music. He served as director of church choirs in Guilford and Dummerston and brought his resonant bass voice to many music projects in the region. He was a longtime member of the Blanche Moyse Chorale and participated in several world music groups such as The River Singers where he met his second wife, Ellen Tolles. On June 19, 2005 they were married and embarked on a musical adventure with their shared passion. Immersed in a loving church and music community they explored multiple genres of choral music from classical pieces to hymns and traditional folk song and brought comfort to people in Hospice care, senior homes, and hospitals through their work with the Hospice-related chorus, Hallowell.  
Larry was active in his community, serving on several boards in the Brattleboro Area including Brattleboro Hospice, the Brattleboro Music Center and Sojourns Community Health Clinic. He was deeply concerned about local, national and world issues. He participated in the Selma-Montgomery March in 1965, was a frequent participant in anti-Vietnam war demonstrations in the 1960s and 1970s and supported environmental and sustainability issues. 
He was predeceased by Shirley Harris Crockett, his wife of 43 years; his brother Stewart Crockett of Elgin , IL; and his daughter, Betsey Crockett Shay. In addition to his wife, Ellen, he is survived by his son, John Crockett (Cynthia Hughes), of Westminster West, VT; his granddaughter, Katherine “Katie” Shay of St. Louis, MO; several nieces and nephews and their families; and, through Ellen, a large family of children, grandchildren and siblings.  
Larry found his highest fulfillment in caring for and nurturing others, both individually and in organizations, through his beloved family, his many friends, his vocation as a minister, teacher, counselor and administrator, his community involvement, and through his singing. His family extends their deepest gratitude to those who brought Larry delight and peace in his last days through companionship and song.

Digital rent payments, like those made online with a credit card, debit card or ACH transfer, often incur a processing fee. These service fees are usually between 1% and 3%. 
Sections 47a-4c of state law specifies landlords are prohibited from requiring electronic funds transfer as the exclusive form of payment for any lease or rental agreement executed on or after October 1, 2013. If a tenant wants to avoid service fees, a money order or a check can be used.

(Getty Images)Suicide is a leading cause of death in Utah and across the U.S., and veterans are at higher risk of suicide-related death. 
Meanwhile, research shows veteran service organizations have been having a difficult time engaging with some of the most at-risk veterans and their families and getting them mental health or suicide prevention resources. 
To help address those challenges, a new report from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute surveyed what Utah’s veterans say are their biggest barriers. 
The issue, the survey found, is complex. Some veterans wrestle with what the report called the “warrior ethos,” or fear that they’ll be seen as “weak.” But other obstacles, researchers wrote, are “more systematic, such as wait times and fear that accessing services could limit military careers.”

Kara Byrne, senior health and human services analyst at the institute and lead author of the report, said in a prepared statement that the report “highlights the critical role of personal connections in reaching service members in need.” 
“By focusing on building trust and addressing systemic barriers, the state can improve access to these life-saving resources,” Byrne said. 
The study was commissioned by the Utah Department of Veterans and Military Affairs, which in conjunction with state officials, is “committed to reducing suicide and improving mental health among service members, veterans, and their families,” the department’s executive director Gary Harter said. 
“This valuable research shines a light on where we need to focus our prevention efforts,” Harter said. “One life lost to suicide is one too many.”
Findings
Survey respondents were asked to select the “greatest or biggest barriers to accessing mental health services or suicide prevention resources for you or others in the military community.” Here’s the breakdown of their responses (the sample size for the survey was 1,376, according to the report): 

33%: “It takes too long to get into care.” 
29.8%: “I can take care of myself.” 
27.3%: “My friends, family, or community will know my business.”
22.1%: “Exposing my mental health could keep me from advancing my career.” 
21%: “Others will think I am weak.” 
19.8%: “Too expensive.”
17.2%: I am unsure how to access resources.” 
15.9%: “Services are not helpful.” 
15.1%: “Other.”
10.5%: “Services are not available in my area.” 
5%: “Exposing my mental health could keep me from being deployed.” 

The report also highlighted that accessing resources for veterans remains a challenge, with 25% that have never looked for resources and 17% that are unsure how to access them. 
Additionally, researchers found veterans tend to trust their non-military and Veterans Affairs affiliated physicians and therapists, along with their family and friends and military peers. Trust in services, however, varies. Only 36% reported they personally trust mental health crisis response resources like the crisis line or 988, while over 50% of those who had called the crisis line found it helpful. 
Based on focus groups, researchers suggested some of the best ways to reach active service members or veterans include better coordinating efforts among federal, state and community initiatives, according to the report. They also suggested “reducing the stigma” with mental health services by “addressing misinformation that receiving such services could impact their military career.”

Mackey said that Alabama could see its biggest public school enrollment drop in 40 years. (Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s public school enrollment could see its largest decline in 40 years, Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey told members of the Alabama State Board of Education on Thursday. 
Enrollment in the state’s K-12 schools in the 2024-25 school year was 729,242, a slight increase over 2023-24. The department did not release numbers Thursday for the 2025-26 school year, but Mackey said Thursday only about 12 schools have seen growth in enrollment while other districts have seen numbers decline.
About 5,000 students have been unenrolled from public schools in the state with roughly 3,000 students total taking CHOOSE Act funds to go to a private school.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that offers families up to $7,000 per qualifying child for education related expenses including private school tuition. The program currently operates under income caps scheduled to be lifted next year.
“We know a portion of [the students] took CHOOSE Act dollars and we’re working with the governor’s office and the Department of Revenue to figure out exactly what that number looks like,” he told board members.
The department is expected to release final numbers next Friday.
The loss of students is a nationwide problem. In May, the National Center for Education Statistics projected that there would be a decline in public school enrollment, due to growth in private and charter school enrollment and the general aging of the population. Nationwide, public school enrollment is expected to fall by 7.6% by 2031. Alabama’s 
Mackey said Thursday he was mostly concerned with the 2,100 students who were enrolled last year that never showed up for school.
“They didn’t transfer to private school, they didn’t go to home school, they didn’t go to school in another state. They just disappeared,” he told the School Board of Education.
Mackey said local superintendents have reported to him that a majority of the unaccounted students are Hispanic.
“We don’t know if they’re still living in this state, just not going to school. If they have moved to another state, they did not enroll in school in that state,” he told the board. “If they left the country, we don’t know if they are documenting students or undocumented, because, as you know, that’s something we are not allowed to ask, and we don’t ask under federal law.”
According to the ALSDE, about 12% of students enrolled in Alabama public schools are Hispanic. 
Mackey said getting these students back in school is important for their progress.
“If those students all come back to us in January and they missed a semester of instruction, we’re going to teach them, but we’re going to pick them up where they are,” he said. “I would implore, publicly, [for] parents to get them back in school. The sooner they get back in school quicker, we can catch them up and move them forward.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7543-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

Omar Fateh isn’t afraid to walk away.
Fateh was infuriated by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s public messaging during the fraught days of Israel’s 2023 counterattack on Hamas, accusing his DFL colleagues of tolerating Islamophobia.
Three days later, Fateh sent an email to Senate leadership inquiring how to change his party affiliation.
“Is there a formal process to switch party/caucus affiliation to independent? If so, please provide me with those details. Thank you,” Fateh wrote in a Nov. 22, 2023, email reviewed by the Reformer and first reported here.
This wasn’t the first time he threatened to decamp, according to a person with knowledge of Fateh’s maneuvers and granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak by their employer. He threatened to leave at least two other times, once in 2022 over a personnel issue and again amid a heated 2023 negotiation over a bill to give Uber and Lyft drivers a hefty raise.
He never left the Senate DFL caucus, but the implied threat underscores Fateh’s political style — marked by a refusal to be a typical go-along-to-get-along lawmaker and a willingness to aggravate his colleagues and big players at the Minnesota Capitol if that’s what it takes to get his priorities through.
Not five years after his first election, Fateh is now a leading contender to be Minneapolis mayor, challenging Mayor Jacob Frey. As mayor, his political acumen would be put to the test amid the city’s fierce factionalism, where progressives and moderates and labor and business are debating the city’s identity and future.
Fateh would be the city’s first Somali-American and first Muslim mayor of the state’s biggest city in what would be a symbolically important victory for Minnesota’s immigrant communities while also likely drawing backlash from nativists, including President Donald Trump.
Other major candidates include Jazz Hampton, an attorney and entrepreneur, and DeWayne Davis, a minister.
The two-term Minnesota senator is running on his legislative record of advocating for working families and immigrant communities. He championed the Uber/Lyft law and led the creation of a program that funds free college tuition for Minnesota families that make $80,000 or less.
Fateh’s campaign didn’t make him available for an interview with the Reformer. When asked about Fateh’s inquiry about leaving the Senate DFL caucus, a campaign spokesperson said Fateh “has always remained a committed member of the caucus, and does the hard work to make sure we are always standing up for the values Minnesotans share. What this really shows is conviction, not a negotiation tactic.”
“Sen. Fateh pushes harder for the people he represents,” his campaign said.
Sen. Jennifer McEwen, DFL-Duluth, a fellow democratic socialist, praised his courage in the face of the pressure to conform at the Capitol.
“There’s so much pressure to just lose your fight, lose the fire in your belly that caused you to run in the first place and just kind of become a part of that club, and he has not done that,” McEwen said. “He’s maintained his loyalty and his focus on advocating for the people of his district, and that is so unique within our political system.”
While his willingness to be disagreeable in the service of his constituents has notched legislative victories, at other moments it’s frustrated his Senate colleagues.
At the end of the 2024 legislative session, Fateh was absent from the Senate floor for over 10 hours as he waited for a better offer on the Uber/Lyft bill. While the clock ticked toward the mandatory adjournment for the year, Democrats were unable to pass the rest of their agenda.
Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, said at the time he called Fateh and coached him “not to go too far.”
“I care about the things he was pushing for, and I was trying to help him,” Marty said.
Calls to over 10 other Senate Democrats were not returned. 
In 2022, Fateh misled Senate Democratic leaders about his familial relationship with a campaign volunteer who was convicted of perjury in connection with a wider federal investigation into ballot fraud during Fateh’s own 2020 DFL primary. The man convicted was Fateh’s own brother-in-law.
This ordeal led to an ethics investigation, but the complaints were largely dismissed.

From a primary upset to ethics issues
Fateh was first elected in 2020 to represent a south Minneapolis Senate district after upsetting prominent lawmaker Jeff Hayden in the primary.
Fateh was a democratic socialist looking to upend the establishment. He supported a statewide $15 minimum wage and defunding the Minneapolis police after the murder of George Floyd.
He encountered a raft of political problems in his first Senate term.
The Senate ethics committee investigated Fateh’s relationship to his convicted brother-in-law; his relationship with Somali TV, which ran low cost ads for him and for which he sought a $500,000 grant; and the fact that he ran his campaign out of a south Minneapolis adult day care center for free without reporting it on his campaign finance report. The committee — a deadlocked two Democrats and two Republicans — dismissed all the ethics complaint allegations except for failing to report a $1,000 Somali TV campaign ad expenditure and recommended campaign finance training.
Fateh uses leverage during trifecta
Democrats swept the 2022 elections and entered the 2023 session with a trifecta. The Minnesota Senate was narrowly divided, 34-33, with Democrats holding a one-seat majority. This gave each Democratic senator a de facto veto.
As much as any other senator, Fateh seemed to understand this leverage, and he used it.
Throughout the 2023 session, Fateh pushed for his Uber/Lyft legislation that guaranteed minimum pay rates and expanded protections for drivers. The proposal floundered toward the end of the session amid fierce lobbying from the ride-share companies. Uber said it would pull out of greater Minnesota and only provide “premium services” in the Twin Cities if the bill passed.
He successfully pressured legislative leaders to revive his bill, telling them in an email that he would “not be voting on any conference committee report (budget bills) on the floor until this passes on the floors of both the House and Senate,” Axios reported in August. In other words: No Uber/Lyft bill, no state budget. The legislative leaders acquiesced and his bill passed.

Sen. Jim Carlson, DFL-Eagan, said lawmakers threatening to withhold their votes unless their bills are passed is a common practice.
“It’s done all the time. We don’t admit it, but it’s done more often than you think,” said Carlson, who has endorsed Fateh for mayor. He praised Fateh’s work ethic and big heart.
Gov. Tim Walz vetoed the Uber/Lyft bill, instead creating a task force that included drivers, riders, the transportation network companies and lawmakers to make recommendations for legislation in the 2024 session.
Fateh was appointed to the task force, but he withdrew and never attended a meeting.
In 2024, Fateh was the champion for Uber and Lyft drivers at the Capitol again, and again Fateh used his leverage, but this time it led to a chaotic finish. They wound up throwing nearly their entire legislative agenda into a single, 1,400-page bill, in one of the more flagrant violations of the Minnesota Constitution’s single subject rule. A judge has already tossed out a gun control measure that was part of the massive bill. 
Regardless, a group of Uber/Lyft drivers hoisted Fateh on to their shoulders outside the Senate chamber, and the measure went into effect last year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GOCL8P0WAAArwGh-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765
,California,2025-10-10 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s long-running saga over local tax measures might return to the ballot,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/local-tax-measures-return-ballot/,A recent appellate court ruling over a 2020 ballot measure in San Diego marks the latest front in California's ongoing saga over local tax initiatives. Tax gadflies vow to put a measure on the 2026 ballot.,"Last week, a state appellate court declared that a 2020 ballot measure to increase hotel taxes in San Diego is valid even though it did not receive the two-thirds approval that voters had been told it would require. The decision was the latest skirmish in a years-long political and legal wrangle over voting requirements for local tax increase proposals.
To begin at the beginning, in 1996, California voters approved Proposition 218 which, among other things, required two-thirds voter approval for local taxes designated for specific purposes. Proponents described it as an extension of Proposition 13, California’s iconic tax limit measure approved in 1978.
In 2017, the state Supreme Court hinted that while the two-thirds vote requirement applied to taxes proposed by local governments, it might not apply to those proposed by a citizens initiative, when enough signatures are collected.
Writing a 5-2 decision in a case called “Upland” because it dealt with a tax on marijuana sales in that city, Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar declared, “Multiple provisions of the state constitution explicitly constrain the power of local governments to raise taxes. But we will not lightly apply such restrictions on local governments to voter initiatives.”
Tax proponents took the hint and began placing tax measures on the ballot via initiative, but often wound up in court. While some local judges applied the supermajority standard, others declared that simple majority votes suffice.
In 2020, the Supreme Court — in a roundabout way — ended the confusion by refusing to consider an appellate ruling that validated special taxes proposed by initiative and approved by simple majorities.
Last year, the California Business Roundtable and other groups that disliked the Supreme Court’s partial dismantling of Prop. 218 fired back with a constitutional ballot measure that would reimpose supermajority votes for special taxes proposed via initiative and place very tight restrictions on the legislature’s power to raise taxes.
Once again, however, the Supreme Court interceded. It blocked the initiative, unanimously declaring that the Taxpayers Protection Act, as it was dubbed, would be a revision of the state constitution because of its restrictions on the legislature and therefore was itself unconstitutional.
“No speculation regarding potential future consequences is needed to conclude that the TPA is a revision on its face,” the court declared. “The measure would fundamentally restructure the most basic of governmental powers. The TPA would exclude the levying of new taxes from the Legislature’s control by requiring voter approval of all such measures.”
It’s against this background that the battle over hotel taxes in San Diego has been waged. Local leaders sought the increase largely to finance expansion of an already cavernous waterfront convention center in hopes of attracting more and larger conventions and trade shows.
When the issue was placed before local voters in 2020, they were told that it required a two-thirds vote. It received 65.2% of the vote and election officials declared it a loser, but the San Diego City Council nevertheless voted to say it passed.
Tax increase opponents sued, alleging that while the measure was placed on the ballot by initiative petition, it was a sham that concealed the role that officialdom played in the process. It resulted in last week’s appellate court ruling that the tax increase is valid.
Tax opponents may take the issue to the state Supreme Court, but their chances of winning seem slim. Meanwhile, however, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is promoting a potential measure for the 2026 ballot that would reinstate the two-thirds vote for local special taxes, regardless of how they made the ballot.
“The Upland loophole has allowed special interest groups to write initiatives that raise taxes, direct the money to themselves, and pass them with just a simple majority,” the organization’s president Jon Coupal said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524-Election-Fresno_LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

“We must stand firmly in our beliefs between right and wrong, justice and forgiveness,” he wrote. “Alabama is steadfast in our commitment to holding the guilty accountable because that is what honors the dignity of every victim. Justice is how we restore peace to the communities they leave behind.”
The statement, issued immediately after Alabama’s execution by suffocation of Geoffrey West on Sept. 25, makes a mockery of terms and concepts that are spiritually central to the Indigenous practice of peacemaking: accountability, dignity, restoration, healing, and community well-being.

Will Berry and Geoffrey West wanted those things. West wanted to say he was sorry, every day of his life, for having killed Berry’s mother, Margaret Parrish Berry, when Berry was only 11 years old. Berry wanted to ask questions. They wanted to meet in person. They wanted to pray together.
I don’t want Alabama to execute my mother’s killer. I don’t want revenge in my name.

The Berrys learned about West’s execution date from a news story, not from the state. After it became clear that Berry opposed the execution, West’s attorneys asked me to join the defense team as a restorative justice specialist. Preparation, which typically unfolds over the course of a year, was compressed into two weeks.
I met with Berry to ask about his needs, boundaries, and aspirations within these constraints. I then met with West to develop a profile of his personal growth so that Berry could gain a sense of who he had become in the nearly three decades since his conviction. We crafted a letter of accountability to Berry that conveyed, with moral clarity, the harm he had caused. It also conveyed an understanding of the impacts his actions have had on Berry’s life.
“My mom is my best friend, and I know that’s what I took from you,” he wrote. “I can’t imagine how many times you have wanted to talk to your own mother and the pain that must have inflicted on you.”
Geoffrey Todd West (Alabama Department of Corrections)
He expressed his sincere remorse and described what has tried to do to transform himself since then, even from within the environment of deprivation and isolation on death row.
We waited as Berry’s pleas — for clemency; a reprieve, a restorative justice conference — were stonewalled by the governor’s office. In the end, the best we could do was comfort a bewildered and outraged Berry as the state did the very thing he told them would worsen his trauma and grief.
The political landscape in Alabama equates justice with punishment, but a 2023 survey of Alabamians who had lost loved ones to homicide found that only a third reported feeling better after the person who killed their loved one was incarcerated. Like Berry, more than a quarter of respondents wanted to talk with that person. They also wanted direct support: counseling, assistance with the financial burdens that come with the sudden death of a close relative, and help navigating administrative bureaucracies in the wake of their grief.
​Berry’s requests echoed those of Toni and Terryln Hall who, in 2022, implored the governor to spare Joe Nathan James, Jr., the man who killed their mother, or at least allow them to meet him face to face. Berry made the same request to the governor’s constituent services representative: “It’s enough death. We don’t want no more mourning, my family or his family. I want a relationship with this man but it can’t happen if he dies. It can’t. I think it’s wrong that y’all, the state of Alabama, will let me see the man die but won’t let me visit him, hug his neck, tell him I love him and forgive him to his face.”
These needs also map onto the very restorative justice principles travestied by the attorney general’s statement. Restorative justice is predicated on what Howard Zehr called the 3 R’s: Respect, Responsibility, and Relationships. It insists on a survivor-centered system in which those directly impacted by violence are given the respect of having their voices heard and their needs understood. It also insists on the inherent dignity of those who cause harm and requires communities to support them in accepting accountability, understanding the root causes of their actions, and taking concrete steps toward transformation and repair.
Restorative processes maximize accountability by creating opportunities for those who have harmed and been harmed to dialogue with one another about the causes and impacts of violence. Above all, restorative justice emphasizes the power of relationships, understanding harm to be a breach in community trust that requires active participation from impacted parties and adjacent community members in order to restore peace.
Had the state of Alabama listened to Berry’s needs, the process could have unfolded in the time it required. I might have been able to work with each party to establish trust, create guidelines for engagement, and establish a space that is safe for expressing difficult feelings: shame, remorse, abandonment, anger, grief, and pain.
Berry might have had the time he needed to seek the additional support necessary for the trauma he was still experiencing. Both parties could have emotionally prepared themselves for a meeting that, while challenging, would have also provided opportunities for understanding and healing. The process itself would have been an important step toward transforming cultures of violence that are perpetuated, not adjudicated, by the death penalty.
Instead, Berry sat at home and waited for news that the man he wanted so much to meet was dead. He did not believe, as the attorney general’s office insisted, that West’s execution honored his dignity, nor did it honor that of his mother. “She would not have wanted this,” he insisted.

The state should no longer claim to speak on behalf of survivors if it only acknowledges pain that can be harnessed for vengeance. It does not know what to do with survivors like Will Berry who insist on restorative justice.

Musk’s fleet of 102 Teslas can now transport passengers between tunnels and any of the 104 proposed stations along its planned route, as well as to and from Harry Reid International Airport.
Every above-ground trip “must include the tunnel transportation system,” Tyler Fairbanks of the Boring Company told NTA commissioners. 
For instance, a passenger in a tunneled Tesla that reaches the end of a tunnel can continue the ride on surface streets for an additional price, and as long as their destination is one of the stops on Boring’s planned network of stations. Only a handful of stations are currently in operation. 
Taxi company executives, as well as taxi drivers, complained the Boring subsidiary Paradise Transportation’s per capita charges would undercut taxi fares.
“We have approximately 50% of the market here in Vegas,” Michael Bailin, general manager of Taxi Management, the largest operator in Nevada, told the NTA, adding the company’s 2,400 employees and independent contractors would be challenged to make a living competing with Musk’s venture.  
Paradise sought to charge $7 for trips up to three miles, $12 for four to six miles, and $14 for trips of more than six miles. 
“Vegas is struggling,” Bailin said. “We all know it. And to add something else that’s not needed, it doesn’t seem like the time or place.”
Bailin added Musk knew his plan to ease traffic congestion “wasn’t going to happen overnight,” adding now they want to come up from the tunnels “to stay afloat.” 
“This is a tough thing for people to swallow, because you came in under the guise of one thing, of being in the tunnels, and now you’re saying ‘we’re not going to be in the tunnels,’” NTA chairman Vaughn Hartung told the Boring Company representatives. Hartung voiced his “discomfort with approving a blanket approval knowing that the tunnels are coming,” noting “they’re not just going from the tunnel to the airport or from the airport to the tunnel.” 
Hartung proposed that Boring commit to completing 20% of its project each year, with a goal of tunneling the remaining 58 miles in five years. Boring has so far dug ten miles of tunnels.
Fairbanks, of Boring Company, said the uncertain timetable of obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies made such a commitment untenable. “We hope it expands beyond the 68 miles we’re entitled to build,” he added.  
NTA staff supported approval of the application, and noted they received  verification of market necessity for the surface street version of the Vegas Loop from Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Chief Strategy Officer Ed Finger. 
The LVCVA, “the busiest convention center in America, the owner of the Las Vegas Monorail and the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, strongly supports and encourages transportation options in the Strip resort corridor,” Finger said during public comment. “The Strip resort corridor is a long way away from being optimized transportation-wise.” 
Finger offered no tangible evidence of a need for more automobile transit in the tourism corridor.  
Steve Hill, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, has hailed going underground as a means of alleviating traffic congestion since 2019, when the LVCVA granted Musk’s Boring Company a $52.5 million contract to connect its expanding convention facility via tunnels. Hill also planted the seeds for expanding the labyrinth to run beneath Strip and downtown casinos, with Musk footing the bill and collecting the revenue.
Musk’s Tesla Corporation is reaping the benefits of more than $1.6 billion in tax breaks. Hill shepherded the initial portion of that deal in his former job as executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 
The NTA unanimously approved a motion that called for Boring, although it was not the applicant, to “make best efforts to complete the tunnels,” limit above-ground travel to no more than four miles per trip, and come back for a status check in two years.
The NTA also required that Paradise, which requested unlimited ability to add to its fleet, come before the commission for permission to do so.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/newvloc.webp,,,2025-10-10 08:57:19.716765

The venture accounted for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in Nevada in 2024. (Barrick Mining Corp. press release photo)For the first time ever the price of an ounce of gold went above $4,000 this week. The price has shot up by 50% since the start of the year. 
Bitcoin’s a cyberslacker by comparison. It’s only gone up 30% year-to-date.
Gold’s skyrocketing price has even outpaced the ballooning (some say bubbling) price of Nvidia stock, up 43% so far in 2025.
Earlier this week Goldman Sachs predicted gold’s run of good fortune will continue, projecting the price will be pushing $5,000 by the end of next year.
Given its frantic pace — it was only six months ago that gold hit $3,000 for the first time — it wouldn’t be entirely shocking if gold hit $5,000 by the end of this year.
Then again, gold momentarily slipped back under $4,000 Thursday, and it also wouldn’t be shocking if the price eventually settled in somewhere between $3,000 and $4,000 for the next, oh, several years. In January of 2014, gold was $1,269 an ounce. Five years of more or less slogging along later, in January of 2019, the price had shot all the way up to… $1,286.  Gold can be a volatile asset. It can also be a sleepy one.
Gold’s surge was initially sparked by broad and deep uncertainty and anxiety created by Donald Trump’s insistence on confusing his feelings for sound economic and fiscal policy. When things get weird, the price of gold shoots up.
Las Vegas agonizes while gold soars. That’s not just a fluke.

There currently being no indication things will stop being weird any time soon, Goldman’s $5,000 projection may indeed be an underestimate.
In any case, a loose pattern, in the current century anyway, is that when gold does spike, even after it retreats, a new, higher floor price has been established going forward. 
And even if the price did fall all the way back to $3,000 by the end of this year, it would still mark one of the best years ever for the corporations that mine gold in Nevada.
So what?
If Nevada were a country (amusing thought), it would be the world’s fifth largest producer of gold, after China, Russia, Australia, and Canada.
But while Nevada’s economy sure could use a break, it won’t get much if any of one from gold’s momentous price surge.
In 2024, $9 billion worth of gold was mined in Nevada. That’s equivalent to a respectable 3.5% of Nevada’s gross domestic product. 
Yet as of August, the Nevada industry employed less than 11,000 people, about seven-tenths of 1% of the state’s workforce. 
As mining in Nevada and everywhere has become more mechanized and automated, more minerals are produced with fewer employees. Despite increased production and new and expanding mines, the number of people employed in Nevada’s mining industry now is a couple hundred fewer than it was ten years ago.
If Barrick Mining Corp. and Newmont Corp., who together form the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture that accounts for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in the state, were to mine even more gold to take advantage of higher prices, that would likely entail the creation of relatively few additional jobs. This year’s stunning price increases notwithstanding, there were fewer people working in Nevada mines in August of this year than there were in August 2024.
The industry’s contribution to the state’s public services, programs, and infrastructure is similarly undersized relative to its revenue. 
Nevada has two mining-specific taxes — the net proceeds on minerals tax, and the gold and silver excise tax — which combined to generate almost $205 million in tax revenue last year. 
That sounds like a lot. But it’s merely about 2% of the value of gold mined in Nevada in 2024, an affectionately light tax burden. 
Nevada’s politicians, regardless of party, have further coddled the industry by coupling irresponsibly small mining tax rates with recklessly generous tax deductions. 
Thanks to the deductions, each year several gold mines pay no mining net proceeds tax at all. Last year gold production was reported at 25 mines in Nevada. Eleven of them, most but not all of them smaller mines, collectively produced $623.6 million worth of gold while paying zero under the state’s primary mining tax, the one on “net proceeds of minerals,” according to the 2024 Net Proceeds of Minerals Bulletin published by the Nevada Department of Taxation. 
Gold’s skyrocketing price almost certainly means Nevada’s mining tax revenue will be bigger this year than it was last year (though never underestimate the industry’s artistry at maximizing the aforementioned tax deductions). 
And yet even if Nevada mining tax revenue were to echo the price of gold and rise by more than 50%, it would still be almost negligible relative to the state’s overall tax revenue. For example, that $205 million in mining taxes the industry paid in 2024 is a mere one-ninth the $1.8 billion in state revenue generated by sales taxes when Nevadans buy a car, shoes, or a sandwich for lunch.
Senator assures industry Nevada will remain a mining colony

And unlike coal, oil, and natural gas, the federal government doesn’t tax the value of gold production at all. Like the late Sen. Harry Reid before her, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has proudly protected the industry from having to pay federal mineral royalties. 
Substantial portions of federal mineral royalties paid on coal, oil, and natural gas are returned to the states where the mineral is produced, and hence a windfall for those states’ services and programs. So while no one can say Cortez Masto shies away from protecting the industry, her commitment to protecting her constituents’ best interest is less obvious.
Colonialism’s staying power
As investments go, gold can be pretty lame. It doesn’t earn any interest, like a bond or even a money market account. It doesn’t pay dividends, like equities. There have been those occasional stretches when its value just doesn’t move much at all for years.
And as an industry, gold’s moment in the spotlight can be pretty inconsequential to the very jurisdictions where it operates. 
The industry is crucial to people in local communities in Nevada and the four countries that produce even more gold than Nevada does — people without whom the industry’s magnificent financial performance this year would not have been possible.
But the industry would have carried on more or less as it has this year even without its run of excellent fortune. For Nevada’s people and economy, gold’s amazing price spike is essentially a nothingburger. 
The Nevada gold mining industry remains a stubborn vestige of economic imperialism, it’s primary mission being to extract resources from its Nevada colony to enrich shareholders elsewhere.
And that’s going great. The price of gold may be up 53% so far in 2025. But as of Friday morning, year-to-date the price of Barrick and Newmont shares were up 114% and 132%, respectively.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10_gold_1600-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

The arrests of the workers at El Potro Mexican Café in February were among the first in the Kansas City area to draw widespread media attention.
The Liberty cases became part of a broader filing, challenging government tactics under the second Trump administration on behalf of 26 immigrant plaintiffs.
The case did not question the government’s right to make arrests on immigration violations. But it questioned whether it had violated the prior consent agreement by making warrantless arrests.
On Oct. 7, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, ruled in favor of the immigrant workers.
Judge Jeffrey I. Cummings ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to lift any conditions on the release of 22 immigrants, including 11 people who had been detained after the Liberty raid.
The other 11 people were detained in Chicago through warrantless arrests in their neighborhood or vehicles, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center, which helped bring the case.
The decision has far-reaching implications and is a huge win for due process, said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, a Kansas City-based immigration attorney representing the Liberty workers.
The Liberty restaurant workers now are out on bond, an option that has become nearly impossible in recent months for detainees taken into ICE custody.
“Their deportation cases, at least for the time being, would have to be dismissed because they were all arrested unlawfully,” Sharma-Crawford said.
In addition to Missouri and Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky are also under the consent decree, known for the name of one of the original plaintiffs, Margarito Castañon Nava.
Cummings also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to reissue its warrantless arrest policy nationwide and certify that any officers who violated the consent decree were retrained.
Also, ICE will need to report to the court the names and arrest documents for anyone else who had been arrested without a warrant on immigration violations since June in the Northern District of Illinois, and to continue making similar reports monthly.
In some of the cases, federal officials were accused of creating warrants after they had already arrested the individuals on the civil violations of being without lawful immigration or citizenship status.
Cummings also extended the consent decree to Feb. 2, 2026.
It had been set to expire May 12, 2025, had further violations not been found.
The date change “corresponds to the number of days between the date that ICE unequivocally ceased its compliance with the Agreement (June 11, 2025) and the date of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to provide plaintiffs with the full three-year term of the Agreement for which they bargained,” according to the judge’s ruling.
The Department of Homeland Security also was ordered to pay the plaintiffs’ attorney fees.
The case was brought by the National Immigrant Justice Center and the Roger Baldwin Foundation of the ACLU of Illinois.
“Today’s decision makes clear that DHS and ICE — like everyone else — must follow the Constitution and the law,” said ACLU of Illinois Deputy Legal Director Michelle Garcia, co-counsel, in a statement.
“The federal government’s reckless practice of stopping, harassing and detaining people — and then finding a justification for the action must end,” Garcia said. “The Trump administration’s destructive mass deportation scheme is not a reason to toss aside bedrock constitutional principles, disregard federal law or court orders.”
The ruling comes as the federal government ramps up the presence of immigration agents in Chicago, and President Donald Trump is threatening to send in the National Guard to maintain order in the face of protests in Portland.
The Department of Homeland Security has not issued a statement yet on the court’s decision.
The Liberty workers were detained after more than a dozen agents with Homeland Security Investigations entered the restaurant looking for a worker suspected of a child sex crime.
But communication problems, possibly exacerbated by language barriers, led to the federal agents entering a private office space, despite the lack of a warrant, and collecting employment documents.
Twelve workers were handcuffed and detained. One of the immigrants was later removed from the U.S.
The judgment is being noted by local immigrant rights advocates as an example of strategic legal filings designed to force the government to stay within the law.
More than 3,000 people in the Kansas City area have been trained in know-your-rights sessions by Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation, or AIRR.
During the training, an emphasis is placed on witnesses filming federal agents during a raid to document that policies and the law are being followed, rather than focusing on the immigrants.
AIRR also stresses that witnesses refrain from name-calling of federal agents, as such video might be necessary to submit in cases like the one just decided in the Illinois court.

Phil Murphy signed the state's ban on single-use plastic bags and straws in 2020. Critics say it is inconvenient and makes grocery trips more expensive. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Gubernatorial hopeful Jack Ciattarelli gets a warm reception from prospective voters when he promises to lower property taxes and fix NJ Transit. 
But the Republican hoping to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy admits there’s one topic that “brings down the house every single time” — his pledge to rescind the state’s plastic bag ban. 
“Here’s the best part of my energy master plan, you ready? At the supermarket, you’re getting back your plastic bags,” Ciattarelli said at an event in Nutley Monday, prompting a resounding ovation from the crowd. 
NJ governor hopefuls want phones out of classrooms — in different ways

Though many of Ciattarelli’s campaign trail promises are echoed by Democratic opponent Mikie Sherrill — they both say they want to make the state more affordable and tackle rising energy costs — the plastic bag ban appears to be exclusively a fixation of the Republican candidate.
Asked Wednesday whether she has a position on retaining or reversing the ban, Sherrill told reporters, “I think we shouldn’t be using plastic bags.” 
Ciattarelli posted a video of that exchange on social media with the caption, “Based on this answer, I’m not sure Mikie Sherrill knows about the plastic bag ban in NJ — but one thing is clear: if you want your bags back at the grocery store, don’t vote for Mikie.”
Murphy, a Democrat, signed the plastic bag ban in 2020 as part of an effort to reduce waste. Since the law went into effect in 2022, grocery stores, restaurants, and other businesses have largely been barred from handing out single-use plastic bags and paper bags.
New Jersey is one of 12 states that restrict the use of single-use plastic bags, including California, New York, and Vermont, according to the National Wildlife Federation, while other states like Montana and Wisconsin have laws that bar jurisdictions from enacting such bans.
Unlike some other states, New Jersey offers no option for shoppers to pay for a plastic bag. Instead, they must rely on reusable bags they bring themselves or purchase from the retailer. Critics have complained that too many extra bags have piled up in their homes.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat who challenged Sherrill for the Dem nod for governor this spring, had pledged to bring back plastic bags if elected, saying the ban raises costs for everyday New Jerseyans by making their grocery bills more expensive.
Sen. Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex) sponsored the plastic bag ban when it was introduced in 2018. There’s been opposition, but complaints have dropped since the ban went into effect, and people adapted their routines by toting around reusable bags in their cars, Greenstein said in an interview. 
She stressed the environmental benefits of the law, like fewer plastic bags washing up on the shore or caught in trees. 
“It helps our environment and it’s really not inconveniencing people that much,” she said. “Some people just want to complain about everything, so they will, but I just sense in the supermarket, people are used to it and it doesn’t seem to bother anybody.”
And while she recommends the next governor tackle other priorities when they come into office in January, Greenstein is not surprised that Ciattarelli’s crowds support bringing back plastic bags. 
“It’s the MAGA thing to not want to be told what to do, so if it’s his crowd, they’re going to give him rousing applause because they want to be told they can do whatever they want to do, but as to whether it’s a true inconvenience to them, I’m going to guess it really isn’t,” she said. 
A 2024 report from nonprofits Environment America, U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, and Frontier Group found that bans in three states, including New Jersey, and two cities have reduced the number of single-use plastic bags used annually by around 6 billion.

The lesson is clear: refugee integration is not only about jobs or English — it is about the community resilience that makes them possible.

Dr. Bose is a migration scholar and urban geographer; he is a professor of geography and geosciences, and he is the co-director of Global Studies at the University of Vermont. Dr. Huddleston is an international migration researcher and educator, and he serves as the University Partnerships Coordinator with the Ethiopian Community Development Council (ECDC) Multicultural Community Center of Southern Vermont. 


Vermont is quietly teaching the rest of America how even small rural communities can welcome refugees.
The University of Vermont and Ethiopian Community Development Council (ECDC) Multicultural Community Center, along with other local partners, just published the key findings from our Vermont Leahy Rural Resettlement Impact Initiative in Brattleboro and Bennington, two of the very few rural counties in the U.S. engaged in rural resettlement. The 500+ resettled refugees from Afghanistan, DRC Congo, Eritrea and elsewhere are successfully developing new lives, friendships and a strong sense of belonging to Vermont.
Our research is complemented by the latest Vermonter Poll by the University of Vermont, which shows that most Vermonters want to continue to welcome refugees. With decreasing federal support for refugees and immigrants, Vermonters agree that the state, non-profits and communities will have to take on more responsibilities and they see and see employment and language learning as the keys to refugees’ success in the state.  
Yet our interviews with southern Vermont’s new refugee communities tell a more nuanced story. While employment and language learning are also top priorities for the refugees we interviewed, refugees’ successes and challenges in these areas are tightly linked with “hidden barriers” that are less visible to the public.
Transportation is particularly urgent. Families often remain dependent on friends and volunteers for rides. Learning how to drive, purchase and maintain a car can open major opportunities in rural Vermont, especially for refugee women. Equally important are multilingual staff and refugee-led community spaces and services, which provide essential support for stay-at-home mothers and the elderly. 
Affordable childcare is another hidden barrier — without it, mothers in particular struggle to attend ESL classes or hold down jobs. Stable housing and healthcare access are also closely linked to progress in employment and English classes. 
Vocational training and higher education are also critical: many refugees arrive highly motivated but underemployed, especially refugee women. Over 50% of refugees in southern Vermont arrive with little to no English, and one-third without a high school education. Still, interest in English, career development, and higher education is high.
To address these challenges, Southern Vermont’s community-based organizations have been essential but stretched thin with federal funding cuts. Our research found that volunteers and refugee communities provide critical help, but they cannot fully meet the need on their own. Community partners worry that without additional funding and multilingual staff, most of Southern Vermont’s refugees will be left on their own.
The lesson is clear: refugee integration is not only about jobs or English — it is about the community resilience that makes them possible. The successes of Vermont’s rural refugee resettlement model offers hope that small towns can make refugees feel welcome.
To sustain success, we must invest in the practical supports that refugees themselves identify as essential: refugee-led services and spaces, drivers’ education, career pathways, affordable housing and childcare. The key, our research shows, is listening to refugees themselves and building up their skills and partnerships as new community leaders. As one Congolese refugee in Brattleboro put it, “Yeah, I’m a refugee, but I feel like there’s something Brattleboro can do to change that. Addressing these people like new Vermonters would be much better than addressing them like refugees.”
If Vermont listens to and resources refugee leaders and community partners, it can continue to lead.

(Illustration by Jonathan Rico/WVUE)Louisiana officials have canceled another major coastal restoration project — the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish. 
Gordon Dove, chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, confirmed to WVUE-TV Fox 8 Wednesday that the state will not continue the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion. The project would have channeled fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River near Wills Point to the dying coastal marshes of Breton Sound. 
It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov. Jeff Landry has shut down. He scrapped the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project in May even though $3 billion from the Deepwater Horizon settlement was available to complete the project and $560 million had already been spent. Construction hadn’t yet begun on the Mid-Breton project. 
Both projects served as key initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, which has been in place for nearly two decades. Although the state is currently operating other river diversions, they are smaller in scope and designed only to prevent saltwater intrusion — not restore land. 
Landry’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. He previously criticized the Mid-Barataria project for its rising costs and potential harm to oyster fisheries in that area.
Dove told WVUE the cost of Mid-Breton had ballooned from several hundred million dollars to an estimated $1.8 billion. The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects. The money came from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement.
$2 billion approved for Louisiana coastal work, despite paused major project

Coastal marshland serves as a natural storm barrier against hurricanes and soaks up rain and flood waters. It also creates habitat for fish and wildlife and absorbs air pollution. 
Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan. Scientists say the marsh is dying because it stopped receiving the nutrient-rich fresh water and sediment once levees were built to control flooding along the Mississippi River. Rising sea levels brought about by climate change have made the situation worse, the plan stated.    
Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, criticized the state’s decision in a news release Thursday, saying it goes against accepted science and the interests of Louisiana residents. 
Cancelling the project could also place other coastal restoration efforts in jeopardy. Restore spokesman Charles Sutcliffe pointed out that other initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, such as marsh building projects, rely on the sediment diversions for their long-term sustainability. 
Dredging and marsh creation projects left in the plan are going to sink and erode without a consistent source of fresh water and sediment, Sutcliffe added. He questioned the point of having a Coastal Master Plan that many stakeholders agreed on if one person can decide “behind closed doors” to cancel its biggest projects at any time.
The state’s Coastal Master Plan represents years of bipartisan work and investments from government officials, scientists, business owners, residents and engineers. The Mid-Breton project was added to the plan in 2007. 
“This cancellation disregards the decades of transparency and significant effort that went into research, permitting, community engagement and modeling for the project,” Restore said in a news release. “ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”

The spending is largely in increased per diem and mileage paid to lawmakers to attend the meetings, though there are some staff expenses as well.
I love the theory behind study committees — that sometimes the best law is not made in the heat of a fast-moving legislative session. Instead, there are complex topics that deserve a more thorough vetting.
So, legislative leaders every year pick issues that need to be studied more intensely during the summer and fall months. This year, 12 committees were assigned topics ranging from how to help Hoosiers with medical debt to barriers for licensed professions and the economic value of public recreational land.
Usually, the committees are made up only of legislators, but a few panels also have members with specialized expertise.
One good thing about the committees is that a lot of really good information is presented to them and many studies, analyses and documents are made available to the public. But that’s where the usefulness ends.
Many of the committees meet only once, though a few get in two meetings. I would say, generally, we are talking about a few hours of discussion on some pretty significant issues. And then a final report is adopted with little fanfare. And what’s in those reports?

Not much.
It’s usually a recitation of how many meetings were held and who spoke at them. And then there is the recommendation section. Here is a sample from a few committees this year that have already adopted their reports.
The Interim Study Committee on Courts and the Judiciary heard some fascinating proposals in terms of medical debt but didn’t come up with a single recommendation.
“Chair (Liz) Brown reviewed the topics considered by the Committee during the interim, as outlined in the draft final report. The Committee will not make recommendations regarding medical debt, the INjail Public Portal, or the proposal to allocate judicial resources. The Committee approved the final report by a vote of 14-0,” the minutes read.
Similarly, the Interim Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications reviewed annual reports of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and “issued no findings or recommendations.”
Sometimes the panels don’t want to wade into specifics of legislation so as not to pin lawmakers down on hot topics too early. But more often it’s that there just isn’t time in one or two meetings to do any work of depth.
I want to give some credit to the Interim Study Committee on Agriculture and Natural Resources, which met twice and adopted 13 recommendations. They included reintroducing bills from the 2025 session that didn’t quite make it to the finish line. Other suggestions were more aspirational, such as additional funding for building and maintenance at state parks, establishing a dedicated source of conservation funding and implementing a system to collect visitor fees at state fish and wildlife areas.
Occasionally, there are some interim committees that make real progress. But they are the aberration, not the norm. And it’s time — when state employees are losing jobs, child care programs are being cut and other funding is eliminated — for lawmakers to either do away with them altogether or strengthen them in a way that allows for thoughtful and realistic recommendations for specific legislation.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An often-outdated pharmacy law test is “absolutely” making Indiana lose would-be pharmacists —  and it shouldn’t be a licensing requirement, medical professionals told lawmakers Thursday.
“It can lead to confusion when pharmacists are trying to study for this exam in our state: do I look at the old laws or the new laws? Do you want your pharmacist to know the current law in the state, or what was law five years ago?” asked Veronica Vernon, a Butler University pharmacy professor.
Hoosier license applicants must pass a general practice knowledge exam — the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination — and a pharmacy law test: the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination.
Both are by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, but Indiana’s Board of Pharmacy writes state-specific questions for the second. That’s the one Vernon and others want to scrap.
The witnesses spoke before an interim study committee focused on licensing barriers.
“Is the pass-fail rate on this causing us to lose pharmacists?” Rep. Mark Genda, R-Frankfort, asked.
“Absolutely, it is,” Vernon replied. “It’s out of date; it depends on what questions get asked.”
The testimony came at a meeting of the Interim Study Committee on Commerce and Economic Development.
Sarah Trovinger, a pharmacist representing the Indiana Pharmacy Association, said the test’s questions also disadvantage pharmacists working in hospitals and other, less common settings.

“‘How many square feet does a community pharmacy have to be?’ … Those are things that you’re not even going to come in contact with while you’re there,” she said.
Trovinger explained that pharmacists are working in hospitals through nationally accredited residency programs, which require participants to be licensed for at least part of the program.
“If they don’t pass it the first time, then they get kicked out of that residency program,” she said.
Genda commented that it seems like the state’s Board of Pharmacy “is asleep” and “not doing their job” by appropriately selecting and updating the questions.
“Our Board of Pharmacy is great,” Trovinger said. “… Their main job is to make sure that our patients are safe and that our pharmacists … are doing the things they want to do. This should not be where they’re having to spend their time and energy every year because we teach pharmacy law.”
Some lawmakers were openly skeptical.
“You don’t think that there should be that initial (check) of, ‘Do you understand the law of Indiana to practice here?'” Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, asked Vernon. “Or … should that just be the approach here, is to make sure the exam is up to date, versus totally eliminating anything to do with understanding the law before you start?”
“I think we need to eliminate the law exam, and it’s because we teach it in our schools,” she said.
Vernon also argued that many other health care professionals that can write and dispense prescriptions, like physicians or nurses, don’t have have to take a law exam.
Dr. Amanda Wright, a family medicine professor at Marian University, said parity is important.
“I bet you don’t hear that a lot, physicians saying, ‘I’m here for the the pharmacists and (physician assistants), but that’s what we’re going to have to do to get our Hoosiers cared for,” Wright added.
Physician assistant rules
Jason Kolkmeier, a physician assistant representing the Indiana Association of Physician Assistants, asked lawmakers to join an interstate compact to make it easier for licensees to work across state lines. He also requested updates to “antiquated” PA laws.
“We’re the only provider in the state of Indiana that has a ratio limit,” he said. This means that only a certain number of PA’s can be assigned to one doctor.
Collaborative practice agreements are another barrier, per Kolkmeier.
“Every task that we are allowed to do has to be delegated and written out on that collaborative practice agreement. As you can see, that’s burdensome for (the) administrative side,” he said.
If some authority isn’t listed, he has to reschedule care or refer patients to another provider. If a new drug isn’t on there, it can’t be prescribed until the agreement is updated.
And, PAs are tied to one doctor.
“If that physician were to unfortunately die tonight in car accident, I could not practice and provide care for my patients tomorrow,” Kolkmeier said. “So, we want to make arrangements where we’re allowed to practice to the top of our license and our education, so that Hoosiers have access to the care, whether that’s being tied to a facility or something like that.”
Eliminate PLA?
Lawmakers also expressed appetite for ditching the Professional Licensing Agency, an umbrella body overseeing 33 profession-specific licensing entities — like the Board of Pharmacy.
“Not to sound conspiracy theorist or accusatory in any way, (and) please don’t take my questions as an indictment of the current administration’s practices or even the previous one,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “… It looks like we collect $10 million in license fees to spend $10 million on budget to do things that 104 (PLA employees) don’t have the qualifications to do, and the boards that have been appointed do have those qualifications. It seems duplicative to me.”
PLA representatives said board members — who work day jobs in their fields and mostly meet to make disciplinary decisions — don’t have the time or administrative expertise.
“If we had an extra $16 million … and we disseminated that out to these boards, would that be enough to (cover) the administrative needs to do this without a Professional Licensing Agency? I know that’s an extreme statement,” Baldwin said. 
Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, asked if the Legislative Services Agency could get information — the number of employees dedicated to licensure, their statistics, and so on — from each agency that handles its own licensing. That data could be compared against PLA’s numbers.
The committee’s chair, Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon, said he’d work with LSA staff on that.
The group has one more meeting before wrapping up its work.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)LAKE NORDEN — The names on the list included some of Dorothy Elliott’s best employees: hardworking, reliable, honest.
Most had been working at Drumgoon Dairy for years. Some worked there for nearly two decades, playing a role in the operation’s expansion and success.
But after an audit of the dairy at the end of May by the federal Department of Homeland Security, 38 of those employees are gone.
The department said they each had inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country.

Elliott co-owns the farm near Lake Norden, 5 miles from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s eastern South Dakota home. Elliott asked the affected employees for updated documentation but ultimately had to fire those who weren’t able to adequately resolve the problems with their documents. One person returned home because his visa was expiring, and another quit.
The audit decimated Elliott’s workforce, once more than 50 employees, dropping it to just 16.
Audits at dairy farms under the Trump administration’s escalated immigration enforcement efforts have “created unrest” among workers and owners, Elliott said. It’s made for a tough summer in an industry that was flourishing after decades of support from state government.
Elliott’s remaining employees have been working without breaks, she said. Without a pathway or plan to create a sustainable workforce in agriculture and by “removing everyone working in it,” she worries some agricultural operations will go out of business. She hopes Drumgoon isn’t one of them.
“Basically, we’ve turned off the tap, but we’ve done nothing to create a solution as to how we find employees for the dairy industry,” she said.
Never previously audited
Elliott is required to file I-9 forms with documentation proving her workers’ identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. It puts employers in a difficult position, said Scott VanderWal, president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau, because applicants may present fraudulent documents an employer doesn’t catch. Yet employers could also be sued for mistakenly rejecting valid documents.
“If employers are presented with documentation that looks real and legitimate, they’re obligated to accept it,” VanderWal said. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offers similar guidance, saying employers must accept documentation if it “reasonably appears to be genuine.”
Elliott could use the federal government’s web-based system, E-Verify, that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the country. But E-Verify is not mandated for new hires in South Dakota, and Elliott said she doesn’t use it because of “unreliable results.” Organizations ranging from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute to the American Civil Liberties Union have opposed the use of E-Verify, citing reasons including errors that cost people jobs because the system wrongly flagged them. 
So Elliott evaluates applicants’ documents herself. If their IDs are out of date or if they have a visa and are applying from another farm without returning home, she passes on hiring them. She’s turned people away a dozen times over the years, she said.
Lack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say

Drumgoon was never audited before. In her past dealings with the Department of Homeland Security during nearly two decades of running the dairy, Elliott said, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would merely tell her they were searching for a person and ask for a notification if the person applied for a job. 
This time was different. After an audit, employers are required to terminate unauthorized workers who can’t prove their employability, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. Audits — which are distinct from raids or other immigration enforcement operations — are meant to ensure businesses comply with federal employment laws. 
Elliott does not know where her 38 former employees went. They could be working at other dairies in the U.S. They could have left the country. They could be anywhere.
Because the dairy is near a farm owned by Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, and because Noem was in the state during the month of the audit to receive an honorary degree, South Dakota Searchlight asked the Department of Homeland Security if Noem had a direct role in the audit. The department didn’t respond to the question. 
Elliott declined to talk about Noem, saying she recognizes that federal immigration authorities “have a job to do.” 
South Dakota Farmers Union President Doug Sombke called federal dairy audits “stupid,” because they needlessly displace workers. 
“Why the heck can’t we continue to use them there as an intern or apprentice or whatever you want to call it and make it legal? Why is it so important we grab them and call them a criminal? No one wants those jobs,” Sombke said. “I don’t understand why you’d cripple or cause problems for a labor shortage when all you have to do is get them legalized.”
Immigrants hiring immigrants
Elliott’s connection to immigrants isn’t limited to her employees. She was born in the United States but married her husband, Rodney, in Northern Ireland, where they had their children. 
Eliott worked in health care and her husband operated their 140-cow dairy farm in Northern Ireland when a newspaper ad, “Wanted: Dairy farmers in South Dakota,” caught their attention. Moving to America meant fewer regulations, cheaper land, cheaper feed and the ability to grow their business, she said.

The couple used the EB-5 investment-for-visa program to secure backers for their operation, opened the dairy in 2006, paid off the investors within a few years and have been expanding ever since. They started with about 1,500 cows in 2006 and have grown to 6,500.
Elliott’s children got their citizenship shortly after moving to the U.S., and her husband became a citizen about eight years after they moved. That experience helps her empathize with her workers, many of whom are Hispanic. She said everything they’re doing is to support their families back home, even though many aren’t able to see their families for years at a time.
“All they’re guilty of is working and doing a job that isn’t currently being filled by an American,” Elliott said.
Taneeza Islam advocates for immigrants as executive director of South Dakota Voices for Peace. She’s spoken to immigrant workers in other industries who were scared and confused after being terminated due to stricter immigration enforcement. 
“We have two very separate worlds right now: the community that’s impacted and worried about getting detained and deported, and the community that doesn’t know this is happening here,” Islam said.
State recruited dairies
The Elliotts are among many new South Dakotans who’ve helped the dairy industry boom in the last two decades. Then-governor and now-U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican, focused on supporting the industry in the early 2000s, which included efforts to recruit farmers from overseas.
In 2010, South Dakota’s dairy industry had an economic impact of $1.27 billion. By 2023, that had grown to $5.67 billion.
“We’ve achieved our goals we set out for ourselves: build a dairy, milk cows and grow the dairy industry in South Dakota,” Elliott said. “Is it a sustainable goal if there’s nobody to work on these dairies? No. So all the time, money, effort, investment and hard work that has gone into it will be null and void if there isn’t a workforce.”

Sombke, the state Farmers Union president, said the state’s investment in dairy “has been a good thing,” but he isn’t surprised by the recent disruption in the industry.
South Dakota Searchlight requested the number of audits conducted in South Dakota so far in 2025, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the department “does not disclose specific data on audits or enforcement actions by state or industry.” 
Sombke said dairy audits are “way up” in the state compared to last year. He said nobody should be surprised to find workers at dairies without permission to be in the country. 
“What do you expect? The unemployment rate is less than 2% in the state,” Sombke said. “You’re going to be looking for labor anywhere you can find it.”
Aftermath of an audit
Drumgoon Dairy’s remaining employees have made mistakes because of the long hours they’ve had to cover — like reversing a payloader into a manure pond — or because they’re new to working on the farm.
“Some of them only get one or two days off in a 15-day period,” Elliott said. “But what else do you do? Do you just let cows starve or calves die because there’s no one there to take care of them?”
Some nearby farms sent workers to help at Drumgoon for a couple of days at a time this summer after the audit. Elliott and her husband have spent over $110,000 on recruiters and transportation so far to hire 22 visa workers from Mexico. But the visas come with restrictions on the types of jobs workers can do, so Elliott hired a dozen or so new employees locally, and still wants to hire another 10 to 15 people to replace terminated staff.
Elliott is struggling to find local applicants, which she is required by law to attempt before hiring visa workers. 
“If raising wages even more will bring Americans to work on the farm, we can try it,” Elliott said, “but there is a limit to how high you can raise wages when you don’t get to set the price of milk. Can I afford to pay a milker $25 an hour? At some point, you’d produce milk for more than you’re receiving for it.”
Trump could lead immigration reforms, Thune says
After a panel discussion at the annual Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell in August, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that he believes President Donald Trump is interested in legal immigration and work visa reforms.

“If we can find some willing partners in the Democrats, some sort of an immigration policy or a piece of legislation that we could pass is not outside the realm of possibility,” Thune said. “Ultimately, that’s the best long-term solution, and I’ve heard him talk about it.”
Sen. Rounds told Searchlight that as more people are deported and industries are disrupted, “we will get enough support from the administration to begin looking at a legal system again.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who is running for South Dakota governor next year, said some visa programs should be modified to meet the needs of the dairy industry. Some visas are seasonal programs that require participants to return home after a few months. The programs don’t fit the needs of dairy operations that require workers year-round.
Elliott has broached the issue for years to Thune, Johnson, Rounds and other federal officials.
“All I hear is, ‘I’ll mention that. We’ll talk about that.’ But nothing,” Elliott said. “What we hear is there is absolutely no passion for any kind of change to the status quo.”
Farmers suggest solutions
Lynn Boadwine of Boadwine Farms in Baltic has “run out of gas” trying to advocate for visa and immigration policy changes to support the dairy industry. But he was heartened to hear the congressional delegates’ comments.
“There’s rhetoric, but are you really working on it?” Boadwine said. “I hope they are, because the clock is really ticking on all of these issues and we’re going to start to run out of people.”

Boadwine shared immigration reform ideas with congressional offices but hasn’t heard back on the topic. His hope is to modernize and simplify the H-2A visa program for dairies. His proposal would remove the seasonality requirement and allow workers in the country without legal permission to transition to guest-worker status. Long-term guest workers would have a path toward permanent residency by proving they are law-abiding, hardworking employees.
VanderWal, with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, said he met this spring with Noem in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He urged Noem and the Trump administration to back off on audits in the agricultural industry in hopes that Congress would “fix the system.”
“We wanted to impress upon the administration that if they started removing illegal workers up and down the food chain, from production to processing to transportation to grocery stores to restaurants, we’d see a disaster worse than the pandemic,” VanderWal said.
The administration has since “backed off ag,” VanderWal said, but the consequences linger for producers like the Elliotts and their employees. He said that unless President Trump “gets real forceful and goes after it,” he doesn’t expect Congress to undertake legal immigration reforms.
Economic consequence predicted
At Drumgoon Dairy, Elliott has tried automating aspects of her operation. She and her husband put in 20 robots a few years ago with the expectation they could hire students from nearby Lake Area Technical College’s robotics program to maintain them.

They posted robotics maintenance positions to attract graduates, but the response was deflating.
“To date, no one,” Elliott said.
She plans to remove the robots because the cost of running and servicing them is too expensive. So far, they’ve sold three. If the cost of technology continues to be prohibitive or there aren’t reforms to workforce visa or immigration programs, she said, “I wonder how we will become a sustainable industry.”
Elliott fears there will be consequences and higher prices for milk and other consumer dairy products without action at the federal level. Boadwine agreed.
“If we keep down this road we’ll have no choice but to import more food,” Boadwine said, “and the reason we’d import more is because it’s gotten so much more expensive here because we crippled ourselves.”

CWIP lets utility companies bill customers for certain construction costs while projects are still underway, rather than waiting until they are finished and producing power. Supporters say the change will spur growth in Missouri’s energy industry and help finance capital-intensive infrastructure.
Missouri’s history with CWIP tells a cautionary story. In 1976, rising electricity rates to finance the Callaway Nuclear Power Plant sparked widespread consumer outrage. 
A grassroots group, Citizens for Reformed Electrical Rates, mobilized against Union Electric’s use of CWIP to fund the nuclear project’s construction. Through community organizing and signature collection, the group placed Proposition 1 on the November ballot to ban CWIP statewide. Missouri voters overwhelmingly supported the prohibition, passing it by a 63% to 37% margin.
Their skepticism was vindicated in the years that followed. Like many nuclear projects of the era, the Callaway Plant faced major construction challenges that proved costly and time-consuming. Originally planned as a two-unit facility, the project encountered the same difficulties that plagued nuclear construction nationwide.
Only one reactor at the Callaway Plant was ultimately completed and brought online in 1984. The second unit was left unfinished after Union Electric cited financial risk to investors, acknowledging that the costs and uncertainties had become too great to justify completing the original plan. 
Several decades later, the company, now operating as Ameren, attempted to revive the second unit by seeking regulatory approval to restart the shelved project. By 2015, Ameren again abandoned the effort, citing long-term capacity needs, declining costs of alternative generation, and Missouri’s regulatory framework. 
While lawmakers stopped short of reviving CWIP for nuclear plants, they did reintroduce the policy for natural gas power plants. That shift represents a significant transfer of risk: Ratepayers now bear construction costs and associated risks that were once carried by utility shareholders.
Critics of the bill point to substantial campaign contributions made by utility companies to Gov. Mike Kehoe and many legislators who supported the measure. This alignment between political influence and regulatory benefit raises concerns about whose interests are being served.
Yet CWIP’s appeal remains strong. In a Republican trifecta state, where energy independence and large-scale infrastructure investment are politically popular, the promise of economic growth may outweigh caution for many voters.
But CWIP carries unintended consequences well known in regulatory economics.
Guaranteed profits can lead regulated monopolies to over-invest in capital to inflate their rate base and maximize returns. By allowing utilities to earn a return during construction, CWIP amplifies this distortion. 
A utility guaranteed payment regardless of delays or overruns has every incentive to pursue larger, slower, and more expensive projects, even when cheaper, more flexible alternatives exist.
Missouri’s new law compounds this risk. First, CWIP recovery is tied to a project’s estimated cost and timeline, yet the statute requires no independent verification of those estimates. 
Utilities may submit inflated projections that become the basis for higher rates, with little oversight until years later. Second, refunds are only available if the Missouri Public Service Commission, whose commissioners are appointed by the governor, finds that costs were imprudently incurred or that a project failed to meet a reasonable timeline. Neither term is clearly defined, leaving ratepayers vulnerable to subjective interpretation and political influence.
Third, while CWIP eligibility for natural gas projects is set to expire in 2035, the Public Service Commission may extend the policy to 2045 with a single hearing and a good cause finding. This allows CWIP to continue without legislative review, insulating the policy from democratic accountability.
From the standpoint of economic efficiency, CWIP embeds perverse incentives into Missouri’s energy framework. Consumers assume the financial risk of construction, while utilities enjoy guaranteed returns. The result may be projects that are oversized, delayed, and misaligned with least-cost planning, decided not by market discipline but by an unelected commission.
A more effective reform would require utilities to commit a greater share of their own capital before recovering costs through CWIP. Rather than allowing full ratepayer financing from the outset, Missouri could mandate that utilities fund a substantial portion. This would ensure that utilities have meaningful financial exposure, aligning their incentives with cost containment and timely delivery.
Such an allocation would help distinguish viable projects from speculative ones. When utilities must risk their own capital, they are more likely to pursue investments that deliver affordable, reliable power and not just those that expand their rate base.

The Washington State Cougars are flying more than 2,000 miles across the continent to play Ole Miss Saturday for what will be the Rebels’ homecoming game. That’s a long, long way to travel for what appears to be a gross mismatch. 
Ole Miss is a 32.5-point favorite, and that’s far and away the largest point spread in college football this week. Still, it  would not surprise this writer if the Rebels were to cover that spread by halftime. This is a Washington State team that lost 59-10 to North Texas State. This is an explosive Ole Miss team, ranked No. 4 in the land, that can score points quickly.
Rick Cleveland
But that’s not the point of this column. If Washington State-Ole Miss seems like a weird matchup, well, that’s because it is. It is also a sign of the times in what has become an increasingly strange world of college athletics, which is my point.
This game was scheduled last October in an emergency situation for both schools. Ole Miss had to find a game because Wake Forest reneged on a return match with Ole Miss after the Rebels beat the Deacons 40-6 last September. (If you can’t compete with  ‘em, drop ‘em, I suppose.) Meanwhile, Washington State was in the midst of needing to almost totally rebuild its schedule after the Pac-12 Conference disintegrated. In fact, even after scheduling the Rebels, Washington State still needed five more games to complete its 12-game 2025 schedule. That’s why the Cougars are playing an eclectic schedule that includes games against such unnatural rivals and strange bedfellows as James Madison, Louisiana Tech, Toledo and Virginia – and two games in one month against Oregon State, the only other Pac-12  rival remaining after the league’s mass exodus.
Really, what happened to the once-proud Pac-12 is just nuts. Washington, Oregon, Southern Cal and UCLA left for the Big Ten, which has become, in actuality, the Big Eighteen. Arizona, Arizona State and Colorado scrambled into the Big 12 (which now has 16 teams). And Stanford, located as it has always been in Palo Alto, California, is now a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, as strange as that sounds. That really is nuts.
So, Southern Cal and UCLA now play conference games three time zones away in Piscataway, New Jersey, and College Park, Maryland. That’s not just for football, mind you. That’s all sports. College athletes will spend nearly as much time in jets  as they do in classrooms. This week, Stanford’s volleyball team will play conference games at Boston College and Syracuse, then fly back across the continent to play conference games against Miami and Florida State. Nuts, I tell you. 
Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin, who once coached in the Pac-12 at Southern Cal, laments the demise of that league.
“I think the whole thing’s sad, the whole conference alignments and especially that one,” Kiffin said at a press conference this week. “There’s so much history with UCLA and USC and that conference in the Pac-8 and then 10 and then 12, and now they’re flying all over the country and teams flying out there and these weird kickoff times, and I understand it. All these decisions made by conferences and schools are always about money. I get it. It is what it is. It’s just, I don’t think it’s good outside of the money. I think it’s bad for the kids and their travel and their school and rivalries and fans, especially that conference where everybody’s way over there and it’s just the whole thing’s sad.”
And nuts, he might have added. 
Because of his time in the Pac-12, Kiffin does have much more familiarity with Washington State than most Mississippians. His USC teams faced the Cougars twice, winning 50-16 on the road against a Washington State team coached by Paul Wulff in 2010 and losing at home 10-7 in 2013 to a Mike Leach-coached Cougars team. Kiffin’s memories of that 2013 game aren’t likely pleasant. The loss came in the Trojans’ home opener at the Los Angeles Coliseum and ended with boos raining down on Kiffin. USC fired Kiffin three weeks later.
To say Kiffin has turned his career around in the dozen years since is an understatement of immense proportions. To says Washington State’s fortunes have diminished over that same time period is a similar understatement.
To says college sports have gone haywire over that same 12 years is perhaps the biggest understatement of all. By the way, Ole Miss comes out pretty swell financially from all this. Wake Forest had to pay Ole Miss $700,000 to cancel the game. Ole Miss only had to pay Washington State $400,000 to come to Oxford. That’s a net profit of $300,000. In today’s crazy world of college sports 300K will get you, at the least, a pretty decent linebacker.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/06173834/AP_21210757215514-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-10 07:56:49.476857

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Editor’s note: The following is a response to a recent guest commentary about the sale of the parent company of Minnesota Power to a consortium that includes massive asset manager BlackRock. We’ve also included a response to the response, below. 
Across the country and around the world, the ways that we produce and use energy are rapidly evolving. 
As our energy system transitions to a cleaner future, careful oversight of our utilities and their decisions will continue to be an urgent need. Fortunately, Minnesota is home to one of the most robust utility oversight frameworks in the country, with comprehensive planning requirements, transparent regulatory processes, and a deep bench of talented advocates working in support of the public interest.
That’s why I was especially dismayed to read Alissa Jean Schafer’s recent guest commentary in the Minnesota Reformer, which was riddled with inaccuracies about Minnesota’s nation-leading approach to utility planning as it discussed the now-approved acquisition of ALLETE, Inc., by a partnership consisting of Global Infrastructure Partners, a subsidiary of BlackRock, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 
Based in Duluth, ALLETE is the parent company of Minnesota Power, an electric utility serving approximately 150,000 residents in northern and central Minnesota. Like all electric utilities, Minnesota Power is under immense public and market pressure to produce electricity from cleaner sources of generation. Clean energy has enormous economic benefits, from local job creation to avoided fuel costs. However, transitioning our entire energy system from one primarily based on the combustion of fossil fuels to one based on clean renewable sources is inherently a capital-intensive process. This is a real challenge for smaller utilities like Minnesota Power, and deeply complicated context for utility regulators to assess as they evaluate various utility proposals.  
Against this backdrop, a wide array of advocates, stakeholders, and public agencies have worked to analyze the proposed acquisition of ALLETE/Minnesota Power and assess the likely impacts on the customers and communities that the utility serves. This culminated with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approving the sale on Oct. 3, contingent on a number of conditions. 
Schafer’s published opposition to the acquisition is not my concern, and I will refrain from offering a personal position on the acquisition itself. However, I do take significant issue with many of the statements and inferences made about institutions and organizations working in Minnesota that I know to be highly credible, ethical, and fully committed to the public interest. This includes Fresh Energy, a Minnesota-based clean energy nonprofit for whom I serve as a volunteer board member. 
Recklessly undermining Minnesota’s regulatory institutions and advocacy community, as the author does throughout her article, is the opposite of looking out for the public’s interest. 
A particularly egregious example is the claim that Minnesota’s 100% by 2040 clean energy requirement would somehow be undermined because “there’s no requirement that BlackRock advance this clean energy vision.” This is factually incorrect. Minnesota’s 100% law is the same for all investor-owned utilities and enforced by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission through a rigorous process known as Integrated Resource Planning. Minnesota Power’s clean energy obligations under law will not change as a result of the acquisition.
Another example is the claim that Minnesota Power would “no longer be owned by the people it serves.” Minnesota Power is currently a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, with the vast majority of the company owned by institutional investors with no direct connection to Minnesota. In fact, BlackRock itself currently owns approximately 12% of ALLETE; already the largest shareholder. Minnesota Power is not a cooperative. It’s not a municipal utility. It is, currently, a for-profit corporation predominantly owned by institutional investors and subject to regulatory oversight by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. That will not change as a result of the acquisition.   
To play this loose with the facts is fundamentally reckless. At a time when the public’s faith in public institutions is at an all-time low, it isn’t surprising that “piling on” in this manner might be a tempting strategy from any number of perspectives — driving clicks on news sites, driving fundraising for advocacy organizations, etc. But I believe that anyone who purports to work in the public interest has an obligation to seek truth, to strive for accuracy and to hold themselves accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions. 
The proposed sale of Minnesota Power is incredibly complex, and reasonable minds can reach differing conclusions. But facts are facts, and Minnesotans are best served when hard decisions are based on careful analysis, hard data and thoughtful debate. I’m proud that Minnesota’s Public Utilities Commission continues to meet that standard. Guest editorials in the Reformer and beyond should do so as well.
Editor’s note: Alissa Jean Schafer gave the following response. 
Matt Schuerger’s defense of BlackRock’s ALLETE acquisition ignores the concerns raised by Minnesota’s own administrative law judge who recommended against the deal. 
After reviewing written and verbal testimony — including “highly confidential” materials not released to the public — the ALJ found that “the Petitioners did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that they will be unable to meet the Carbon Free Standard absent the acquisition, nor did they guarantee or present sufficient evidence showing that the standard will be met as a result of the acquisition.”
A key reason: Private equity firms often only hold companies for a few years before selling, which raises the possibility that BlackRock would do nothing to move Minnesota Power toward the 2040 obligation before another sale. The ALJ highlighted this risk: “(A)n early exit would likely be uneconomic and inefficient, and the record demonstrates that such an exit by the Partners is highly plausible.” 
Even more troubling, the ALJ noted that “the Petitioner’s agreements and private discussions do not comport with their public statements.” That finding should raise alarm for anyone who cares about transparency. Schuerger also downplays what this sale really means for Minnesotans when noting that Minnesota Power is already investor-owned. That misses the point. Private-equity ownership is not the same as being publicly traded. As the name “private” implies, firms like BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners rely on opaque structures, high debt, and short-term profit extraction. 
As the ALJ stated “The nonpublic evidence reveals the Partner’s intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2165923397.jpg,,,2025-10-10 10:56:29.079243

Sign up for their newsletter here.
This is the last of three articles about Michigan communities organizing to stop the construction of energy-intensive computing facilities. 
A log cabin building surrounded by forest in the expansive wilderness of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula houses the Lake Superior Academy, a school focused on environmental education for its K-5 students.
The Dafter Township property was an ideal setting for its programming, until March, when a bitcoin mining operation came online directly across the street. The mine’s loud, steady hum forced students indoors and disrupted their education, school officials reported. Birds the students once tracked even seemed to be driven off by the din.
“Prior to the bitcoin mine moving in, it was just a beautiful spot for learning,” the school’s director, Susie Schlehuber, told a local news outlet in June. “Our whole school philosophy, everything we were founded on, has been disrupted because of the noise.”
In July, the school sued and secured a temporary restraining order requiring the mine’s owner, Florida-based Odessa Partners, to shut down as the lawsuit was litigated. The two sides are currently in mediation. Odessa did not respond to a request for comment from Inside Climate News.
The mine has stirred up an ongoing saga that has resulted in the legal battle and drawn outrage from residents who have demanded answers from local leadership about the operation’s energy use, water use, water pollution and impacts on utility rates, among other issues. Bitcoin mines require huge amounts of electricity, and most consume high levels of water to cool their servers.
Some residents are mobilizing to push for more protections against bitcoin mines in municipalities across the Upper Peninsula. A nearby township put a moratorium in place; other municipalities are considering taking action.
The controversy has been a “wake-up call,” said Kalvin Carter, project director for Up North Advocacy, a nonprofit.
“It’s really the wild west with the mines because there are no regulations, it’s just go do it while you can,” Carter said. “A lot of these communities and boards don’t know what a bitcoin is, and it’s hard to regulate something when you don’t know what it is.”
He said he fears data centers, which bring similar problems, will come next if protections aren’t put in place.
Dafter Township, a small town of about 1,300 people just south of Sault Ste. Marie in the eastern Upper Peninsula, is among flashpoints in Michigan in which grassroots campaigns from across the political spectrum have, or may, derail plans for data centers and bitcoin mines.
The Upper Peninsula is attractive to the operations because of its cool climate and abundant access to water, and the Odessa mine is one of three operating in the region.
Carter said many residents were dismayed to learn that the Cloverland Electric Cooperative, which serves much of the Upper Peninsula, has advertised for bitcoin mines and was involved in bringing the Odessa mine to Dafter Township to generate more revenue.





Odessa’s mine is composed of six metal pods housing large computers that constantly run as they solve complex equations to earn bitcoin, which generates profits for Odessa. The pods sit on 10 acres just across the street from the school, and the project’s fans for cooling the equipment are what generates the din.
Sound readings taken on the school property soon after the mine came online exceeded 70 decibels, which is similar to the sound of a vacuum cleaner.
Michigan does not have regulations in place that specifically provide oversight for bitcoin mines, and proposed legislation aims to incentivize the industry’s growth across the state, and would bar state or local governments from banning cryptocurrency.


It is unclear if the bill has enough support to pass, but people in the Upper Peninsula are not waiting on the state to act, said Chloe Kannan, a resident who works with a small group of volunteer residents working on the issue.
“People are starting to see what this is doing to Wisconsin and other communities across the country, and we know we’re on the largest body of freshwater in the world, and we know we’re a target,” Kannan said.
 “It Was All Stripes of People”

The mine began operations as Lake Superior Academy reportedly put plans into motion for the addition of two classrooms that could accommodate 40 additional children to its current student body of about 90. For now, those plans are on hold. Despite the disruption, the school put up a Facebook post that read “Bitcoin is cool, but not near a school.”
As news of the problem spread, residents from across the region gathered for a June 5 Dafter Township Planning Commission meeting to look for answers and express opposition, Carter said. “It wasn’t tree-hugging leftists or MAGA people afraid of change—it was all stripes of people,” he said.
Odessa had told the township in planning documents that it would build a storage facility, without mentioning that the company planned to house a bitcoin mine, which Carter said generated distrust.
Residents also grew suspicious because a mine representative who was supposed to answer community questions at the meeting would not say who owned the operation, and would not provide his last name.
Meanwhile, questions and concerns have gone unaddressed, Kannan said. It is still unclear how much water is, or will be, drawn from the aquifer, and whether chemicals that could pose health risks or pollute the groundwater are used for cooling. A proliferation of electricity-guzzling mines could ultimately require more fossil fuels to be used or more infrastructure to be built to meet demands.
Lake Superior Academy’s lawsuit asked a county judge to order a preliminary injunction to shut down the mine, order the noise to be reduced and award at least $25,000 in damages. A judge issued the restraining order, and that day Odessa stacked large hay bales around the mine, which dampened the noise.
Among those at the June 5 meeting was Kristi Autore, whose husband, Shawn Merritt, is on the nearby Clark Township Planning Commission. Autore told Merritt about the problems in Dafter. Within about a month, the Clark Township Planning Commission and Board of Trustees had passed a one-year moratorium on mines while the township develops new rules around the facilities.
Autore said she had read about problems with bitcoin mines and data centers in communities across the country, and there was speculation that mine owners were already looking for parcels in Clark Township. She said she suspects they were looking at the area because “electricity is cheap and the water is free.”
“[Clark Township] put a moratorium in place to give us a cushion and some protection so that what happens and Dafter couldn’t suddenly happen to us,” Autore said. “Why invite someone into your community when it’s only going to make life more expensive?”
 Is a Bitcoin Mine Good for Ratepayers? 

In March 2023, Cloverland Electric Cooperative Data put a post on its website that got little attention until two years later when the Odessa controversy hit. It announced that the cooperative was attempting to attract energy-hungry bitcoin mines to its service territory so it could boost energy production and revenues.
The Upper Peninsula’s population is decreasing, and with it, so is energy use. The cooperative has said the mine’s steady energy use will help offset maintenance costs that otherwise would fall on residents.
“Data mining is attractive because when implemented correctly, it can grow electric use, or demand, in a positive way—it has the potential to generate additional revenue through load growth,” the co-op wrote in the 2023 post.
The cooperative’s involvement in bringing “disruptive” bitcoin mines has frustrated some residents, Carter said, and they fear that courting bitcoin mines opens the door for data centers.
A spokesperson for the cooperative did not respond to specific questions from Inside Climate News, and instead pointed to a “data center” FAQ page.
Up to 50 percent of Cloverland’s power comes from hydroelectric, which releases low levels of greenhouse gas, according to the company’s site. It buys the rest of its power from Wisconsin Electric, which uses coal and natural gas to deliver its baseloads. Cloverland has increased its solar production, Carter said, but residents don’t want more solar fields to accommodate bitcoin mines, which are capital-intensive projects that might ultimately negate the purported savings.
“We want to keep our forests and fields and keep the natural beauty, and we don’t want this place being nothing but a solar field,” Carter said.
He added that Cloverland’s rates are already low, so many residents question the need to attract energy-guzzling businesses to keep rates down. Carter said the cooperative largely has not provided clear answers to residents’ questions.
“Cloverland has not been doing a good job reaching out to people and explaining their position, and we love our co-op, so that’s why this hurts doubly,” he said.
While the future is unclear, the issue is bringing together residents in a way that other issues have not, Kannan said.
“There’s a lot of hope here in bringing together in this fight because we know this is not the investment we want,” Kannan said. “We want jobs, we want investment, doctors and lawyers, and an AI data center or bitcoin mines are not going to do that—they’re just going to make people want to leave.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Crypto-illustration-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-10 06:57:43.944872

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)I responded to former State Superintendent Ryan Walters’ announcement that he will stop statewide standardized testing with a belly laugh.
Even though I would love to get rid of testing for accountability, as opposed to diagnostic purposes, it’s not going to happen soon.
Too many politicians have bought into the claim that state standardized tests are reliable and valid measures of student learning. Too many education leaders are still not ready to explain why the use of standardized tests for accountability purposes has done more harm than good for students.
Ironically, a major study acknowledged that standardized tests are “incomplete measures of educational success” and questioned their reliability in terms of evaluating teachers and students.
And far too few teachers remember the time before the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 when we laughed at the idea that high-stakes testing wouldn’t undermine the joy of learning.
But, we should remember the progress that was being made in the 1990s before standardized testing became a requirement. 
In 1998, according to the reliable National Center for Education Statistics, Oklahoma was above average in reading scores. John Marshall High School, where I taught, was improving more than any other high school in Oklahoma City Public Schools. The autonomy of teachers was respected. We had the freedom to teach in a holistic and meaningful manner. And whenever administrators visited our class, they praised my students’ wisdom, and often offered innovative suggestions.
For instance, the head of the Curriculum Department proposed that we start our classes with the 20th century to get them even more hooked on the love of history. Sure enough, when we’d start World History with Denzel Washington, playing the role of Steve Biko in “Cry Freedom”, or we included lessons about the Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma History, the results were amazing. 
Back then, I posted on the blackboard both the curriculum standards that our class sought to master, as well as a “History in the News” story that was linked to our lessons. The students would come in early to see what our lesson plan was, discuss it, and make suggestions regarding the class discussion topics. 
Understandably, when stakes were attached to standardized tests, too many educators complied with mandates for in-one-ear-out-the-other, teach-to-the-test malpractice. OKCPS’ top administrators announced that they had no choice but to focus on No Child Left Behind tests.
My principals, however, knew that I would not comply with mandates that drove holistic instruction out of schools.  So, we agreed, in case a central office administrator walked in the door, I would keep an “aligned and paced” curriculum guide on my desk. And even though I didn’t ask them to do it, the students would recognize what was happening when a central office administrator walked in, making sure that all teachers were “on the same page.” Students would turn their textbooks’ pages to test questions, pretending to focus on test questions.
In the OKCPS, most of No Child Left Behind’s damage was inflicted on poor, neighborhood schools. Affluent schools were free to ignore the “benchmarks” that became multiple accountability metrics in our higher challenge schools.  
The reformers I knew, who sought to run schools like venture capitalist organizations, sincerely believed that their “build a better teacher” shortcut could produce simpler, cheaper, quicker solutions.
Fortunately, federal regulations no longer require stakes to be attached to standardized tests. The problem today is a culture where educators can be pressured to focus on increasing scores.
Moreover, during the last decade, some of the most fervent supporters of holding individual teachers accountable for test score gains have switched sides. The researcher who perhaps contributed the most to the hypothesis that “building a better teacher” could produce rapid transformative change, now says schools “cannot just ‘hurry up.’” And they can’t use a simple solution, like a better curriculum, to rebuild schools. On the contrary we need to acknowledge how serious schools’ challenges are. 
Another researcher, who once endorsed teacher evaluations that used test score growth, now concludes that desegregation produces the most long-term gains. He and his colleagues urged poor people in Oklahoma County to “move to opportunity” in Canadian County where they would have both better educational and economic outcomes, and longer life expectancy.    
Although the last recommendation could also prompt a belly laugh, these transformations give me hope that Oklahoma can, once again, listen to experts, educators, patrons, and students, and remove the punitive side of standardized testing. 
But, it will take time to reverse the damage that was done over the last quarter of a century.

Unusual use of the Congressional Review Act, also being deployed in some other states, disregards years of public input, critics say.
The post Wyoming congressional delegation wants to override BLM coal lease ban appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration has issued sweeping orders to federal agencies to remove regulatory hurdles and encourage more coal leasing and coal use. Now, Congress is acting to employ a little-used tool to override the Bureau of Land Management and rewrite or install new coal- and mining-friendly public land management plans throughout the West, including one in northeast Wyoming.
Wyoming’s all-Republican congressional delegation introduced a joint resolution Wednesday to employ the Congressional Review Act to essentially invalidate the BLM’s Biden-era supplemental environmental impact statement updating the Buffalo Field Office Resource Management Plan.
Published last year, the Biden-era plan included a ban on future federal coal leasing in the Powder River Basin, citing coal’s human health and climate impacts, as well as the fact that mining companies had not asked for any new major coal leases in the basin in nearly a decade. The joint resolution, if passed, “would terminate the no leasing alternative, revert to the previous plan and prohibit the BLM from issuing a substantially similar plan,” according to a joint statement by Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman.
The Powder River Basin is home to one of the world’s largest coal deposits and some of the nation’s biggest coal mines.

“Coal is the backbone of Wyoming’s economy, it supports thousands of good-paying jobs, generates the revenue that funds our communities and provides reliable, cheap electricity to Americans across our country,” Lummis said. “Biden’s BLM left us no choice but to stop this dangerous overreach via the Congressional Review Act.”
The Buffalo office oversees 780,291 acres of public lands and 4.7 million acres of mineral estate spanning Campbell, Johnson and Sheridan counties. 
The Senate this week passed other resolutions employing the Congressional Review Act to modify BLM public land management plans, including in Alaska, North Dakota and one in southeast Montana that also included the Biden-era coal leasing ban.
Congress’ move to override the BLM bypasses years of public input and local expertise, and it threatens to “upend the public lands management system as we know it,” according to the nonprofit conservation advocacy group Earthjustice.
“They’re saying, ‘We don’t like the public process. It didn’t achieve the result that we want,'” said Jenny Harbine, managing attorney for Earthjustice’s Northern Rockies Office. “It says, by partisan fiat, the BLM cannot take this substantially sane action [banning coal leasing in the Powder River Basin] in the future no matter what information might support it.”
Using the Congressional Review Act to invalidate land use plans creates a lot of “chaos and confusion,” which may end up backfiring on the fossil fuel and mining industries that President Donald Trump and GOP congressional members say they’re trying to help, according to the conservation group Center for Western Priorities.
If a plan is invalidated, “doesn’t that mean that oil and gas leases or coal leases issued under that [resource management plan] are no longer valid?” Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby told WyoFile. “What you’re guaranteed to get is uncertainty, which is not good for anyone, including industry.”

Others suggested it’s insulting to Wyoming residents to invalidate a hard-fought compromise among multiple stakeholders who rely on the Buffalo Field Office management plan to guide myriad public land activities, including grazing and recreation.
“Wyoming voices — people who participated in that exhaustive [BLM planning] process — aren’t going to be heard once that [Congressional Review Act] kicks in,” Powder River Basin Resource Council Executive Director Donna Birkholz told WyoFile.
Further, Birkholz said, Congress doesn’t have the capacity or expertise to micromanage such plans to make them work for all stakeholders. 
“People in the West, we tend to get our backs up about people from [Washington] D.C. telling us what to do,” Birkholz said. “Using the [Congressional Review Act] seems like politicians telling folks that their voices are not going to be considered.”
Gov. Mark Gordon joined the Wyoming delegation in support of overriding the BLM to remake the Buffalo Field Office plan, as did the Campbell County Board of Commissioners.
“Campbell County has always known the true value of coal — both to meet baseload demand for affordable, reliable energy and for other non-thermal uses that are emerging as important for the future,” the commissioners said in a statement. “We appreciate the unwavering support we have received from the Trump Administration and our entire congressional delegation to overturn the misguided decisions by the previous administration to eliminate future coal leasing in the Powder River Basin.”
The Wyoming BLM, under President Trump, had already initiated its own amendment process earlier this year to potentially remove the coal leasing ban from the Buffalo Field Office’s management plan. The administration also scheduled two federal coal lease sales this week in the Powder River Basin, testing the mining industry’s appetite for new reserves.
A competitive lease auction on Monday in Montana attracted one bid: $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with the Spring Creek mine — a fraction of a penny per ton compared to past coal lease sales that reaped more than $1 per ton. The low bid stunned industry watchers, and the BLM indefinitely postponed a sale in Wyoming — for 441 million tons — that was supposed to happen Wednesday.

The post 600 alpine rescuers convene in Jackson as town welcomes ‘helicopter happy hour’ appeared first on WyoFile .","The International Commission for Alpine Rescue drew more than 600 emergency responders to its annual convention in Jackson this week, an event that featured four rescue airships assembled for a “helicopter happy hour” at the base of Snow King Mountain.
Among the fleet was Teton County Search and Rescue’s H125 customized Airbus helicopter, which is hangered in town and available for emergencies year-round. A nine-month fundraising campaign raised $7.5 million for the aircraft, which arrived in 2023 and became the property of the Teton County Sheriff’s Department.
The county’s rescue organization is multi-faceted. Pilot Steve Wilson is employed by the sheriff’s office. The TCSAR Foundation, which raised money for the helicopter, has six employees. About 40 volunteers make up the heart of a rescue team that is skilled in many aspects of wilderness emergencies including swiftwater and cave rescues, lost-person searches, avalanche responses and high-angle extrications.

Possessing its own chopper enabled Teton County to dodge the hassle and uncertainty of contracting for a rescue helicopter seasonally as it did in years past. It allows the team to train regularly and launch rescue missions with little notice in and around the region.
Founded in Switzerland in 1948, ICAR has held its annual congress in the U.S. only once before. The independent, worldwide organization has 85 member organizations in 34 countries. Its main goal is to improve mountain rescue services and safety.
“It’s pretty cool to see the whole world together” said Cody Lockhart, Teton County SAR’s chief advisor, as he surveyed the helicopter display Thursday afternoon. A 15-year volunteer with the organization, he saw representatives from 25 countries converge on his hometown.
During the “helicopter happy hour” dozens of visitors, including school children, got to view the whirlybirds and even climb inside.
The convention in Jackson ran for four days and featured an array of lectures, drills and demonstrations covering everything from helicopters to drones and search dogs.

(Photo courtesy of the Institute for Justice)Several parents have renewed their fight challenging the constitutionality of New Jersey’s practice of retaining blood samples from the state’s mandatory newborn disease screening program, two months after a federal judge dismissed their first lawsuit.
The parents filed an amended complaint Monday, pushing back on U.S. District Court Judge Georgette Castner’s August ruling that they failed to prove they have a possessory interest in their children’s leftover “blood spots,” which hospitals take by pricking the heels of newborns.
Attorneys representing Erica and Jeremiah Jedynak of Boonton and Hannah Lovaglio, a longtime Cranbury resident who recently relocated to Ontario, argued that the state does not have a property interest in the blood within children’s veins.
“People’s property and privacy interests in their blood and associated genetic material do not dissipate when that blood is taken physically from inside their bodies by state action,” the attorneys wrote. “Plaintiff Children, via their parents, never voluntarily gave their blood to the state, and New Jersey never sought nor received their consent. Absent such a voluntary transfer of ownership, Plaintiff Children maintain their property and privacy interests in the blood.”
The rise of artificial intelligence has made the matter especially urgent, they noted.
“Artificial intelligence has begun transforming the interpretation of genetic data, and there is a particularly heightened need to maintain privacy and control over blood and the genetic information contained within,” they wrote.
The attorneys also renewed their bid to make the lawsuit a class-action case, given that about 100,000 babies are born a year in New Jersey and are subjected to the mandatory screening. The state retains unused samples for two years for healthy babies and 10 years for newborns who test positive for disease.
Attorneys for the state have argued that retaining the blood spots allows them to use the samples for follow-up testing and develop and validate tests for new diseases, among other things.
The practice was first challenged in 2022, after the state Office of the Public Defender learned that state police had gotten a newborn’s blood spot without a warrant and used it to charge the child’s father with a crime.
The office and the New Jersey Monitor sued after state officials refused to release records showing how often and in what cases law enforcement agencies used baby blood spots to aid in criminal investigations. A Superior Court judge ordered the state in January 2023 to release the records, which showed four police departments used blood spots in five cases.
The Institute for Justice, the Virginia-based public interest nonprofit law firm, sued in November 2023 on behalf of the parents.
The state used to secretly store the blood spots for 23 years until Attorney General Matt Platkin issued a directive in June 2024 shortening the retention time, restricting how spots could be used, and requiring clearer communication with parents.
But those changes don’t go far enough, the parents and their attorneys said. Officials still have not explained what third parties may have accessed the blood spots, and the state still does not obtain informed consent from parents to take and store their babies’ blood, they said.
“As a mother, it concerns me that I have no way of knowing what the government is doing with my child’s genetic information after the initial testing period,” Erica Jedynak said in a statement. “It makes me uncomfortable knowing this information could be used by private third parties, law enforcement, or any other government agency.”

On the heels of Banned Books Week, the Joint Judiciary Committee will consider legislation that threatens libraries' financial stability and Wyomingites' personal liberty, writes Teton County Library Board Chair Marylee White.
The post Wyoming libraries are in trouble appeared first on WyoFile .","Banned Books Week, which wraps up Saturday, has long been a time to celebrate the freedom to read and the value of open access to ideas. This year, in Wyoming, that freedom is under direct threat.

Opinion

The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee, bolstered by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, will meet at 9:30 a.m. on Monday to consider a bill that would ban “sexually explicit materials” from school libraries and from areas in public libraries accessible to individuals under 18.
Libraries would be fined $50,000 per violation. The bill would allow anyone to sue a library if they believe the policy has been violated. At the October meeting, the committee may entertain amendments to the current bill, possibly exempting materials designed for sex education purposes and sacred texts such as the Bible. Yes, the Bible would be banned under this law. They could lower the fine and may also define an appeal process for libraries. But the real problem with the bill is that it isn’t needed in Wyoming.
We already have robust obscenity laws. What’s new, and dangerous, is the attempt to impose a narrow moral standard on all Wyoming families, regardless of their own values. Parents absolutely have the right to guide their children’s reading, but they shouldn’t decide what other people’s children can or cannot read. This bill would force librarians into the role of moral gatekeepers, while threatening them and our libraries with financial ruin for doing their jobs.
Here in Wyoming, we know the value of our library. It’s not just a place to check out books; it’s a space that supports our kids’ learning, fosters community engagement and provides access to information for residents across the spectrum. 
Decisions about access should reflect local values, not political agendas. Librarians are trained professionals with the best interests of children in mind. Wyomingites should not have their access limited by the government or state legislation. Decisions about library access should come from local library boards and local school boards, with input from the community.
The American Library Association documents “an extremist campaign” to ban or restrict access to books in this display in the lobby of the Teton County Library. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
The proponents of this legislation say they aren’t banning books; they just want them to be “shelved appropriately.” But restricting access to a book is, in effect, a ban. The egregious proposed fine would not only have a chilling effect on free speech, but a freezing effect on any county budget faced with the possibility of such a fine, or even the cost of defending against such a lawsuit.
Wyoming’s proposed legislation includes a fine twenty times larger than the $2,500 fine attached to a similar bill that passed the Idaho Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. Brad Little, who deemed it fiscally irresponsible. Little stated that the penalty “will only increase the costs local libraries incur, particularly rural libraries. These costs will be forced onto property taxpayers of Idaho or cause libraries to close to minors altogether.” On the second attempt, the bill passed with a fine of $250. Even with the reduced fine, small rural libraries in Idaho have decided to restrict or eliminate access to patrons under 18 to comply with the legislation, just as small rural libraries in Wyoming may be forced to do.
Beyond the cost, the legislation is likely unconstitutional. Wyoming law already mirrors the U.S. Supreme Court’s definition of obscenity under Miller v. California, which requires that material must be patently offensive and lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The new bill makes no effort to align with that legal standard. It uses broad, undefined terms like “sexually explicit,” which could sweep in countless works of literature — including titles that have won prestigious awards and helped generations of young readers understand themselves and the world.This year, during Banned Books Week, I find myself grieving. Grieving the erosion of First Amendment protections in a state that prides itself on personal liberty. Grieving the pressure placed on local libraries, already stretched thin by funding cuts. Libraries have long been one of the most trusted civic institutions in America, places that provide enrichment and opportunity at every stage of life.
I also will be fighting. I will protest this legislation in memory of my mother, who grew up on a homestead 15 miles north of Medicine Bow, and who told me that the best day of every month was when the Albany County Library’s box of books arrived with the mailman. I will insist on the freedom to read and to encourage my children to read books that challenge, comfort and inspire. In that spirit, I just ordered the three most-banned books in the country today.
Wyoming is a place that values education, individuality and freedom. We should stand up against this unnecessary and dangerous legislation. Our libraries must remain open, inclusive and reflective of the diverse community they serve, not the political whims of a vocal few.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, speaking to CNN about her concerns about rising healthcare costs on American citizens (CNN screenshot)Late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel could barely get the words out of his mouth when he had to say: “I agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene.” 
It was his second time this month, he noted, and added “I need something to wash out my mouth.”  But in truth, the issue at hand, which is access to health care, is no laughing matter.
Greene’s latest defection from the MAGA cult of loyalty for which she has been a leading figure popped up in an exclusive interview with CNN in which she didn’t beat around the bush concerning the effect of the House-passed budget bill that, due to not reauthorizing Affordable Care Act subsidies, has caused the shutdown of the federal government.  
“Everybody is just getting destroyed” Greene told reporters.  “This cliff is coming for millions and millions of Americans where their health insurance premiums are about to skyrocket. Republicans, you have no solutions. You haven’t come up with a new plan in place, and we’re not even talking about it, and it is hurting so many people.”  
Greene’s concerns are at odds with the narrative the GOP is trying to spin on the shutdown — namely that it’s all the fault of Senate Democrats.  Instead, Greene says the healthcare crisis now facing millions of Americans, including her kids and constituents, is a direct threat to Republicans in the polls and voting booths.  
It’s worth noting Greene is also one of four Republican House members who signed the discharge petition to force the release of the Epstein files, telling The Hill:  “I think when it comes to women being raped, especially when they were 14 years old, that’s pretty black and white.”  Moreover, she said Speaker Johnson’s attempts to keep the House shut down was “wrong” and they should reconvene to take care of the vast spectrum of Congressional business.  
For his part, Johnson doesn’t want to reconvene the House due to the recent election of a Democrat who, when sworn in, will provide the final signature to force Johnson to deal with the “Epstein bomb”. 
What could this MAGA rebellion by Greene have to do with Montana?  Well, it’s not so dissimilar from a group of nine Republicans who broke with their own leadership over any number of issues.  Chief among them was health care, and support for a bill by fellow Republican Ed Buttrey to lift the pending expiration of Medicaid expansion for low income people that the Senate’s GOP President, Matt Regier, opposed.   
Like Greene, Buttrey noted that healthcare was critical and Republicans had no other plan: “We have 10 years’ worth of data that shows that the program we designed is working and working well. There’s no need to change it, it’s a savings to our budget, it is providing help for people all across the state, it’s helping save our rural health care facilities.  Why would you want to change that or come up with another plan?”
It’s fair to say the GOP tends to “keep its soldiers in line” when it comes to supporting or opposing leadership positions.  Yet, just as Greene defied Johnson on Medicare funding and Trump on the Epstein files, Buttrey and his nine “rebels” defied their own leadership and governor to support Medicaid expansion. 
None of this spells the end of MAGA, of course.  But it shows that when it comes down to the critical issues that affect the citizens of our nation and state, party affiliation is not and should not be the determining factor — especially when it comes to taking care of each other.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Majorie-Taylor-Greene-CNN--1024x531.png,,,2025-10-10 06:57:43.944872

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)In Idaho, nearly 8% of people on Medicaid expansion work in the food industry for restaurants or fast food chains, a state government report found.
The report by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare details how hundreds of employees for major companies — and even public colleges and government entities — are on the public assistance program.
Walmart, one of the biggest private businesses in Idaho, and Sam’s Club had the most employees on Medicaid expansion, with 444 employees accounting for 1.4% of the employees with known income sources. 
But more than a dozen other big businesses were on the top 25 employer list — including Amazon, McDonald’s and Albertsons. 
Todd Achilles, a former Democratic state legislator turned U.S. Senate candidate, said he requested the report because many state lawmakers were worried about Medicaid expansion’s enrollment growth.
“I’m concerned about it too. But when you peel back the layers, and you understand what’s driving the growth — it’s not a bunch of lazy people that should be able to take care of themselves,” Achilles said in an interview. “It’s people who are working. But they’re working for employers who are manipulating the system to increase their profits, and pushing those costs onto the state of Idaho.”
Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.
In January, Health and Welfare shared the report with Achilles. This week, the agency shared the report with the Idaho Capital Sun.

 Two decades ago, former Republican Idaho House speaker floated a bill on company insurance coverage

In 2018, Idaho voters approved Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative. The policy extended Medicaid coverage to a population often called the “working poor” that fell in a health care assistance gap. 
Idahoans are eligible for Medicaid expansion if they earn less than 138% of the federal poverty level, which is $21,597 annually for a single person, or $44,367 for a family of four. 
But even well before Medicaid expansion, major companies relying on Medicaid for employee health coverage was on Idaho’s radar. 
In 2005, former Idaho House Speaker Bruce Newcomb, a Republican, was exploring a state law to require Walmart to provide insurance to Idaho employees, or repay the state for its Medicaid coverage, High Country News reported. 
At the time, that idea didn’t gain steam, Newcomb told the Sun this week. But he was fired up about it.
“For a family-owned business like Walmart, to be the richest in the world, having the taxpayers of Idaho and throughout the United States subsidize their operation was just blatantly wrong,” Newcomb said. 
Achilles said many major employers intentionally keep workers in part-time jobs “so they don’t have to pick up the health care costs.”
“This is the hard look that the Legislature needs to do, which is to understand why these highly profitable companies are not taking care of their workers and forcing them to the safety net,” he told the Sun.
This year, the Idaho Legislature and Gov. Brad Little approved a new state law to require people on Medicaid to prove that they work.
In Nevada, a state report earlier this year found that Amazon had by far the most employees on Medicaid, the Nevada Current reported. 
 Report only analyzed a third of Idahoans on Medicaid expansion

The report analyzed the employers and industries that Idaho Medicaid expansion enrollees with known, recent income sources enrollees worked in.

But the analysis, using enrollment figures from November 2024, only tracked about a third of Idahoans on Medicaid expansion, or roughly 30,900 people. The report also excluded enrollees who only reported self-employment income. 
Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson Greg Stahl said the agency hadn’t done this analysis before, and cautioned that the data could have errors. 
“Individuals may have other creditable insurance in addition to Medicaid. Also, the analysis was based on a free form text field which means there could be some level of error in the data compilation,” he told the Sun in an email. “… the information provided excluded self-employment and the data does not provide any context about how many hours per week an individual may work at the listed organization, potentially impacting wages and their qualifications for employer sponsored benefit/insurance.”
In November 2024, when the report’s data is based on, the program’s enrollment was 87,500 people. Now, about 89,600 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, according to the state’s latest figures. 
Nationally, most adults on Medicaid are working, according to the health policy research group KFF. In Idaho, about 48% of able-bodied adults on Medicaid are working, according to an August report by the Department of Health and Welfare. 
 The top industries with workers on Medicaid expansion in Idaho

Here’s some of what the report found:

Restaurant and fast food industry was the top industry, with 7.7% of enrollees with known income sources, or 2,378 employees on Medicaid expansion. Three major chains were in the top 25 employer list: McDonald’s came in fourth, with 246 employees; Taco Bell came in 15th, with 100 employees; and Burger King came in 16th, with 99 employees. 
Home health care or assisted living services was the second highest industry, with 4.6% of enrollees with known income sources, or 1,420 employees.
School districts were the third largest industry, with 4% of enrollees with known income sources, or 1,238 employees. 
Supermarket or grocery stores came in fourth, with 4% of enrollees with known income sources, or 1,231 employees. Behind Walmart’s first place ranking, Albertsons came in fifth, Ridley’s came in 10th, Fred Meyer/Kroger came in 14th, Broulim’s Supermarket came in 24th, and Winco came in 25th.
Universities and colleges came in fifth on the industry ranking, with 3.1% of enrollees with known income sources, or 955 employees. Three of Idaho’s four-year universities were on the top 25 employer list: Boise State University, or BSU, came in eighth, followed by Idaho State University, or ISU, in ninth; and University of Idaho in 17th. 
Hospitals or hospital systems came in sixth place for top industries, with 2.4% of enrollees with known income sources, or 746 employees. Two major hospital systems were on the top employer list: St. Luke’s came in seventh, and Saint Alphonsus came in 21st.

City and state governments were also on the top industry list, along with a range of other fields like child care, dollar stores, churches, construction, hotels and retail stores.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A month before the Oct. 7 U.S. House primary, Nashville Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn took two of her political rivals to task for accepting donations from payday lender Advance Financial. 
“You’re not going to like me for asking this,” Behn said from the stage at First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill in Nashville, questioning why Democratic opponents Bo Mitchtell took $25,500 in campaign donations and Vincent Dixie $4,000 as members of the Tennessee state legislature. 
Behn’s attack came up during a part of the forum where the candidates could ask each other questions. She was the only one of the four to take the opportunity to challenge her opponents critically, and on Tuesday, she narrowly won the Democratic nomination for Tennessee’s 7th U.S. Congressional district.   
Behn and businessman Darden Copeland, who finished second in the Democratic primary, used the Advance donations and the issue of corporate contributions more broadly on the campaign trail to separate themselves from Dixie and Mitchell, both of whom also represent portions of Nashville in the state House.
This lender said its loans would help Tennesseans. It has sued more than 110,000 of them.

The Lookout and ProPublica previously reported that Advance Financial has sued over 110,000 Tennesseans in the past decade, trapping some of the state’s most vulnerable in a cycle of unaffordable debt. 
The lawsuits stem from the Flex Loan, a new type of payday lending product created by state lawmakers in 2014 to sidestep federal regulations. Mitchell voted in favor of it at the time.
Advance has used the profits from the new loan to give millions of dollars to mostly Republicans, but also some Democrats, in an effort to protect the company from state regulation.
The special election came as a result of the resignation of Clarksville Republican Mark Green, who represented Tennessee’s 7th district from 2019 until he resigned the seat in July. The district encompasses the northern and western third of Davidson County, portions of Williamson and Montgomery Counties and about a dozen rural counties. It was redrawn in 2022 as part of the state Republicans’ successful gerrymandering, which eliminated a U.S. House seat covering all of Nashville.
The Republican primary was not close at the end
The Democratic primary was closer than the Republican one, which featured more candidates but a last-minute consolidation by the GOP leaders around former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps.
Early in the race, the 11-person GOP field narrowed into a four-way race between Van Epps, Barrett, and state Reps. Gino Bulso and Lee Reeves. But as the race moved from summer to fall, it became clear that Van Epps enjoyed a significant advantage over his opponents because of his early head start — he announced within 48 hours of Green’s resignation — inheritance of Green’s campaign infrastructure and considerable support from dark money political action committees.

Green was an early backer of Van Epps, hosting house parties for Van Epps across the district. Barrett proved to be a powerful challenger, running on the support of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus, the Williamson County grassroots group Tennessee Stands, and his willingness to oppose some Republican donor-favored policies. 
Pro-private school voucher group, Club for Growth, spent around $700,000 running an anti-Barrett advertisement, according to Federal Election Commission filings submitted in the final days of the campaign. 
The race narrowed in the final weeks as it became clear that Bulso’s $500,000 in personal campaign funding and Reeves $300,000 loan were keeping both campaigns alive despite minimal support.
When it looked like Barrett was gaining some momentum against Van Epps, Gov. Bill Lee, who aligned with Club for Growth to pass his voucher plan earlier this year, endorsed Van Epps. 
The money and local support proved sufficient to get President Donald Trump to weigh in with a last-minute endorsement, leading to Reeves’s subsequent withdrawal from the race four days before the election. Van Epps embraced the Trump support at every opportunity, allowing him to cruise to victory..
Six state representatives go down
An overarching question in both primaries was how previous electoral experience would translate into votes.
Behn, a state House member since 2023, and first-time candidate Copeland finished ahead of Dixie and Mitchell, who combined have served 18 years in the state legislature. Copeland also raised more money than any of his Democratic challengers, despite almost no name recognition when the campaign started. 
Van Epps never served in the state House but managed to defeat three state representatives. Barrett, Bulso and Reeves all started serving in the state legislature in the last three years. 
Bulso and Reeves, in particular, struggled to gain traction. When the race narrowed in the final weeks, it became clear that Bulso’s $500,000 in personal campaign funding and Reeves’ $300,000 loan were keeping both campaigns alive.

Democrats’ sliver of hope
The 7th district is rated a solid Republican seat by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Green won the seat by 20 percentage points in the two elections since it was redrawn to include parts of Nashville.
But Democrats have hopes as their 31,000 ballots cast nearly matched the 36,000 Republican votes in the primary. In the past two primaries, Republicans turned out nearly twice as many voters as Democrats, who never turned out more than 25,000 voters.  
Since the last redistricting in 2022, there has not been a competitive primary on either side of the ballot and races have taken place on the midterm and presidential cycle, where turnout is usually higher than in a special election. 
The general election between Van Epps and Behn will take place on Dec. 2.

(Courtesy of Idaho National Laboratory)The future of nuclear power in Idaho is looking strong. The Gem State recently took two important steps demonstrating its commitment to unleashing the potential of nuclear energy. These efforts are working hard alongside other governmental and private partners to meet the need and promote Idaho as a viable state to fill the energy demand of the future.
The first step was taken on Sept. 18 as Idaho released the Advanced Nuclear Strategic Framework. This is a comprehensive plan to guide Idaho in its pursuit of nuclear energy excellence. This means nuclear energy in Idaho that is safe, reliable, affordable, sustainable and secure. The plan lays out the role that the Idaho National Laboratory can play, the importance of educational partnerships in research and workforce development, and the need for regional partnerships on a governmental and private level.
‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

Other points from the plan include creating a State Energy Fund to support nuclear development and using the state’s newly established Strategic Permitting, Efficiency, and Economic Development Council to help streamline project approvals. It also highlights the inter-governmental collaboration of the framework that was formed by the Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources and Idaho Strategic Energy Alliance.
The second step taken was on Sep. 22, when Gov. Brad Little announced the formation of the Advanced Nuclear Energy Task Force. This task force’s chief purpose is to “assess, recommend, and support strategies that advance Idaho’s leadership in nuclear energy innovation, deployment, and workforce development.” This includes making recommendations on matters such as “spent nuclear fuel, fuel creation, enhancement, and minimization, opportunities for Idaho to collaborate with other nuclear-advanced states.”
The task force will be composed of no more than 20 members appointed by the governor, including elected officials, government agencies, INL representatives, private sector stakeholders and educational representatives. This replaces and improves the existing Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission, or LINE, which was put into place by Gov. Butch Otter in 2012. A lot has changed in the industry since then, and this new group helps to prepare Idaho to lead the way.
Gov. Little commented: “As we usher in President Donald Trump’s Nuclear Renaissance, my executive order refreshes our efforts and empowers a new group of leaders dedicated to ensuring Idaho continues to lead the way in nuclear innovation, energy security, and economic growth.”
The setting for his announcement was fitting, as it occurred during the Western Governors’ Association’s first workshop of “Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West.” This meeting was a gathering of government officials, academics, and private sector stakeholders to harness the energy and momentum of the nuclear excitement into plans for tangible progress.
INL Director John Wagner stated at the workshop: “We’re seeing an intersection of multiple factors come together that I haven’t seen in my entire career. It’s been more than 50 years since we brought a new reactor online at [INL], that’s all changing. In the past three weeks alone, we’ve seen groundbreakings for three new reactors — two in Idaho and one in Utah with Valar Atomics — and there will be many more.”
The main sentiment taken from the energy summit is that our region is uniquely positioned to propel the country into a nuclear-powered future. States like Idaho have identified and worked with allies on nearly every level of government, private sector stakeholders, and educational partners to efficiently brainstorm the advancement of nuclear energy. One example is a Memorandum of Understanding signed between Wyoming, Idaho and Utah to collaborate on building out the nuclear infrastructure in the region.
These steps by Idaho come at a time when the federal government has been promoting and advancing policies that seek to facilitate a nuclear energy boom. The Trump administration is making moves to speed up nuclear permitting processes and expand funding for scientific and technological studies.
It is exciting to see that Idaho is also preparing and planning for the needed workforce, pushing resources toward groundbreaking research, and looking for ways to partner with stakeholders to build the needed infrastructure to unleash nuclear energy in America.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)ASHEVILLE — In a convention center ballroom full of elected officials, government workers and nonprofit advocates who have spent the past year rebuilding from Hurricane Helene, the exhaustion is palpable.
So is the optimism.
“I hope that 10 years from now … we’ll think about Helene as the rebirth, the new birth, of western North Carolina,” said Sharon Decker, Gov. Josh Stein’s senior advisor for long-term recovery.
Western North Carolina has begun its long road back from the worst storm in state history, one that will involve rebuilding thousands of homes, businesses and farms, as well as key regional infrastructure. Billions in state and federal dollars have flowed, and continue to flow, into the region.
During a one-year anniversary summit meant to highlight the recovery’s “partnerships and successes” — led by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Southwestern Commission and Land of Sky Regional Council — leaders made it clear they don’t want that money to merely return them to the status quo.
“There are all different sources of grants, opportunities, funding that we’re going to be employing over the next several years to build back better,” said Asheville mayor Esther Manheimer.
Key to that equation: housing and transportation. Rising housing costs, even before Helene, have forced lower-income workers out of urban areas and sometimes out of the region altogether. And a lack of transportation choices left many of those same workers with few options to commute and navigate the mountains.

Helene exacerbated both of those issues, said Tristan Winkler, a planner for the French Broad River region with Land of Sky. Now, many are “trading housing costs for transportation costs.” Future investments, he said, could alleviate some costs for locals.
“Putting housing closer to jobs, closer to a lot of our amenities, that’s a way to reduce transportation burdens on our workforce,” Winkler said.
Housing: What Helene has meant for WNC’s population centers
Since Helene, the number of permits to build single-family housing in the Asheville area have decreased. And the cost of housing as a share of income in the city continues to far exceed the national average.
Many service and retail workers, who fuel the city’s tourism economy, struggle to find homes locally.
“They are kind of continually battling growing prices and a really limited amount of housing stock,” said Sara VanLear, a project manager with the UNC School of Government.
One potential solution: more multi-family housing.
Winkler said permitting for multi-family development was increasing primarily in smaller, unincorporated regions. The large population centers in Buncombe County — Asheville and Hendersonville — are both far less dense than other North Carolina urban centers.
Still, ramping up the building is easier said than done in the mountains, particularly with landslides and flooding still fresh in mind.
“The land that is the most developable … is basically already developed,” VanLear said. “It forces a lot of creativity in thinking how to get development done. That’s already really hard to do.”
Significant public dollars will go toward rebuilding housing in the region over the coming years.
About $1.2 billion in federal grant money will pay for repairs and rebuilds of single-family, multi-family and workforce homes damaged by Helene. Asheville is also set to receive $225 million from that same federal pool of money, $31 million of which will go toward housing.
Transit: Could WNC see passenger rail under revamped infrastructure?
For the past two decades, many of the area’s lower-income workers and renters have opted to move not to Asheville but to surrounding towns and counties.
Those communities generally lack robust transportation infrastructure — little to no bicycle amenities and occasional buses.
But one option for mass transit — long thought to be pie-in-the-sky for the region — could see new life in a post-Helene western North Carolina.

“I do dream of passenger rail service to Asheville,” said Decker, a longtime western business leader and former Secretary of Commerce. “It’s worth pursuit, and I think we need to do it.”
The storm wiped out key chunks of the region’s commercial rail system, forcing rail company Norfolk Southern to begin ground-up rebuilds. That includes the Old Fort Loops, a key 16-mile stretch of rail east of Asheville.
Previously, the infrastructure of the system didn’t allow for passenger rail, said Mary Lesa Pegg, an industrial development manager for Norfolk Southern. But the new plan “does open up the main corridor … in order to get Amtrak.”
Pegg said she’d make no definitive statements or promises, but that the “conversation is alive and well.”
Industry & agriculture: WNC has to ‘get serious’ about resilient infrastructure
As western leaders discussed how the region would rebuild its critical infrastructure, they agreed on a sentiment best summarized by Decker: “We’ve got to think differently.”
“We have got to get serious about focusing on infrastructure to deal with flooding,” said Kaleb Rathbone, an assistant commissioner at the Department of Agriculture. “As a state, and as a society.”
That goes for local drinking water and sewage systems, many of which were knocked offline and are now housed in temporary locations. It goes for key roads and bridges, many of which are privately owned. And it goes for major farms, Rathbone said.
He added that state farming could also benefit from being less reliant on national and regional supply chains. Those supply networks are “part of the miracle of modern agriculture,” he said, but overreliance on them could leave the region without needed goods and materials during and after disasters.
“A focus on having local manufacturers, regional manufacturers … is incredibly important,” Rathbone said.
North Carolina lawmakers have sent money to repair roads and bridges, as well as water systems.  And more than half ($125 million) of Asheville’s $225 million in federal grant money will go toward infrastructure repairs, according to the city’s plan.
But Decker said the scale of recovery and preparedness is bigger than just the public or private sectors alone.
“There will never be enough public dollars to do all that needs to be done,” Decker said. “There will never be enough philanthropic dollars. We’ve got to do it collectively.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3824-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 06:57:43.944872

At her Denver office, DeGette sat with leaders of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3607, which represents workers at the Environmental Protection Agency, and AFGE Local 4012, which represents workers at the Social Security Administration, to hear about how federal workers fear for their job security and the future of their paychecks amid the government shutdown. 
Members in the U.S. Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, before the end of the fiscal year, meaning many major federal government operations shut down starting Oct. 1.

Denver has almost 12,000 federal employees who will be furloughed or “forced to work without pay” during the shutdown, DeGette, a Democrat, said. The Trump administration has suggested it may deny back pay to federal workers affected by the shutdown, a move DeGette said is illegal. 
“If he tries to do that, he will be sued and people will win,” DeGette said. “But that’s little comfort to these employees who … are living paycheck to paycheck and are worried about what’s going to happen.”
DeGette’s office has heard from many constituents who have tried since the shutdown started last week to contact the Social Security Administration or to get passports or veterans benefits and cannot get in touch with anyone to help them, she said.
Justin Bordoff, a legislative advocate with AFGE Local 3607, said the EPA canceled its collective bargaining agreement with the union and other unions that have agreements with the agency. He said the move is illegal and that the union does not know why the EPA canceled its agreement, and the AFGE is challenging the cancellation in court. 










It’s been hard on everyone. We're all overworked, we're all burning out, and they hollowed out all the people with experience, and now we can't backfill.


– Justin Bordoff, of AFGE Local 3607, which represents EPA workers


Neither staff nor leadership at the EPA know what’s going on during the shutdown, Bordoff said, and the agency is in limbo, shut down but maintaining some operations. He said 75% of those he works with have been there for fewer than five years. 
“We at the agency don’t know what we can or can’t do,” Bordoff said. “It’s been hard on everyone. We’re all overworked, we’re all burning out, and they hollowed out all the people with experience, and now we can’t backfill.” 
Coworkers are fearful
Missy Haniewicz is the sole Colorado-based EPA employee whom the agency fired after she was placed on administrative leave in July for signing a letter that expressed concern about the direction of the EPA under Administrator Lee Zeldin. About eight employees have been fired across the country, and she said seven of them, herself included, plan on appealing. 
“My situation is now making my coworkers even more fearful,” Haniewicz said. “I was hoping it would be sort of an example of speaking out, but now I’m fired, so it’s actually an example of don’t speak out.”
Haniewicz said she hopes she wins her appeal and that “they will be too afraid to fire me again,” but she does not expect any improvement throughout the rest of Trump’s presidency. When she was put on administrative leave, she was told it was because of “conduct unbecoming” of a federal employee, because she signed a petition. 
“I think I’m spiteful and I think I am angry, I’m incredibly angry,” Haniewicz said. “And I think that makes me willing to speak up.”
As she works through her appeal, all Haniewicz can do is wait, as the process can take about four months, if not longer during the shutdown. She said she will likely look for some contract work to get by, because while she could look for a full-time job in the private sector, she ultimately wants to go back to working for the federal government. 
Brenda Carsten, a leader with AFGE Local 4012, said many Social Security workers are already living paycheck-to-paycheck, and the elimination of remote work by the Trump administration has increased commuting costs for those workers. The shutdown has added stress, as people are unsure whether they will be paid at all or laid off. 
“We go into federal service because we want to serve and care about American people, and going into work every day and feeling like you’re failing because you’re just not able to provide the services that people desperately need is devastating to employees,” Carsten said.

(Photo courtesy of Nidec Power)An alternator manufacturing company is expanding its operations in Henderson County, investing $52.4 million and adding 200 jobs to its Lexington facility.
Once the expansion is complete, Nidec Power will employ more than 600 people in Henderson County, the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development announced Thursday. This will make the company the county’s second-largest employer, just behind the Henderson County School District.
The company designs and produces “advanced alternators” used to generate power for data centers, hospitals, and defense needs, the department stated. The expanded Lexington facility will allow Nidec to build capacity to “support the increasing electricity demand in the U.S. and abroad.”
Nidec Power is a division of Nidec Motor Corporation, a $16 billion business headquartered in Kyoto, Japan that has employees spanning more than 40 countries. Nidec Power is based in Minnesota and employs more than 2,000 people across North America.
“We have a long history of operations in Tennessee, and our global success is built on the quality and commitment of our outstanding team in Lexington,” Nidec Power President David Strohsack said in the news release. “We are honored to invest in this community that has given so much to our company and our customers.”
Lexington is home to around 8,000 residents and serves as the Henderson County seat. Manufacturing is the county’s top industry in terms of employment, with 51 establishments employing 1,670 people, according to the state’s economic development department. 
“What happens in rural Tennessee matters to all Tennesseans, and I am proud to take part in announcing hundreds of new jobs for the families across Henderson County,” Gov. Bill Lee said in the news release. “Nidec’s investment will be transformative for this community, and I am grateful to the company’s leadership and long-term dedication to creating greater opportunity for Tennesseans.”
Nidec became Henderson County’s third-largest employer in May, when the former titleholder Adient, an automotive seat manufacturer, announced it would permanently close its facilities in Henderson and Maury Counties, eliminating more than 400 jobs in West and Middle Tennessee.
Nidec currently employs around 400 people in Lexington. The company received $1.8 million in economic development grants from the state when it announced a 300-employee, $18.7 million expansion of its Henderson County footprint in 2018. 
It’s not yet clear how much the state has offered Nidec for the expansion announced Thursday.

 Monty Sullivan was appointed to the position in 2014 after previously serving as chancellor of Delgado Community College in New Orleans for two years and working in various administrative positions at multiple colleges and universities for more than 30 years. 
“While this marks my retirement from LCTCS and working in Louisiana, my work in advancing opportunities through education will continue,” Sullivan said in a news release announcing his retirement. “The mission that has guided my career does not end here. I look forward to the next chapter.”
LCTCS Board Chairman Tim Hardy praised Sullivan’s leadership in a news release. 
“He led with vision, belief and compassion,” Hardy said. “He put students first. Under his guidance, LCTCS has become a national model for how community and technical colleges can power economic growth and individual opportunity.” 
During Sullivan’s tenure, the system nearly doubled its number of graduates. Sullivan has played a key role in advocating for higher education and workforce development policy at the State Capitol, including championing the creation of the M.J. Foster Promise Program, a scholarship program for adult learners pursuing professional credentials. 
Sullivan also drew national recognition and advocated for workforce education at the U.S. Capitol. Earlier this year, members of Congress expanded the Pell Grant program to help low-income students pay for workforce credentials. 
The system has not yet announced a timeline for selecting Sullivan’s replacement.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)Bankers, public officials and an academic observer are cautiously optimistic in the wake of the Bank of North Dakota’s announcement of plans to create a new digital currency. 
The state-owned bank announced Wednesday it will create the Roughrider coin, a form of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin that will be tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. The goal is to facilitate near instant transfers of money between banks. 
Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it’s backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar.
Bank of North Dakota leaders featured the announcement during a conference focused on innovation affecting financial institutions.
“They’re taking a step forward into new technologies, and certainly the creation of the Roughrider coin as a stablecoin could offer some great opportunities for our institutions,” said Rick Clayburgh, president of the North Dakota Bankers Association.
Bank of North Dakota to launch state’s first stablecoin known as Roughrider coin

Some banks in North Dakota have been looking into the new stablecoin technology even before the Bank of North Dakota’s announcement, said Sarah Getzlaff, CEO of Security First Bank of North Dakota. 
“We’ve been looking into stablecoin, we’ve been learning about stablecoin, and so I’m interested in learning more about the Roughrider coin,” Getzlaff said. 
Alexis Baxley, president of the Independent Community Banks of North Dakota, said the Bank of North Dakota has been a great partner for community banks and she’s excited to learn more about their plans for the Roughrider coin.
“The devil is always in the details,” Baxley said. “As long as they do a good job managing the risk and managing those details, we’ll be interested to see how this works out.”
State Sen. Dale Patten, a Republican from Watford City and a retired banker, said it’s important for the industry to get a better understanding of these new concepts. 
“The concepts are challenging for people to understand,” Patten said. “I think that is probably the most critical thing, is developing that baseline knowledge and understanding of how it’s going to work.”
Ali Jaffri, an assistant professor of finance from North Dakota State University, attended the conference to gather information for a course he’s developing. Jaffri said it will be critical for financial institutions to adopt the new technology to remain competitive. 
“This is the future, so people and the institutions should adapt to it,” he said. “Otherwise, it would be very hard to compete with this fast-paced environment.”
Potential concern
One concern about stablecoin is how the new technology will affect banks’ balance sheets if the digital currency is adopted by the general population. 
The Genius Act, federal legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, requires that each stablecoin issued be matched by a U.S. dollar or equivalent asset, such as a short-term U.S. Treasury note, in reserve to ensure there is always enough liquidity for the stablecoin to be redeemed into traditional currency. 
“There’s concern as well from the banking industry that it can possibly drain deposits from an institution, not just North Dakota, but across the country, and can cause issues with banks. A bank deposit is very important to an institution, because that’s what’s used to loan money out,” Clayburgh said. 
There is an estimated $300 billion worth of stablecoins in circulation right now. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified to Congress earlier this year he wouldn’t be surprised if that grows to more than $2 trillion by 2028. 
Lise Kruse, commissioner of the North Dakota Department of Financial Institutions, which regulates state-chartered banks and credit unions, said there is concern nationally about that. 
“A stablecoin means a dollar for dollar reserve. Where is that reserve going to come from? Does that mean that $1.7 trillion is going to come out of the banking system, the community banks and regional banks?” Kruse said during Wednesday’s conference. “So if you are seeing on a national level that bankers are a little bit concerned, it’s because that money will not be available for the bank to lend.”
Clayburgh said any reduction of deposits “impacts the economy, impacts Main Street, impacts small business, impacts farmers. So we’re trying to understand these issues.”
Managing risk
The Roughrider coin’s initial rollout, planned for next year, will be a pilot program and will not limit the Bank of North Dakota’s liquidity, according to bank leaders. 
The pilot program will be intentionally limited in scope, according to Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan. The stablecoin will only be used for bank-to-bank transactions and the program will involve a handful of local banking partners.

“We’re not looking at any type of material liquidity pressure on the Bank of North Dakota or on North Dakota’s banking industry anytime in the near term,” Morgan said at a press conference after Wednesday’s announcement. 
The chief operating officer of Fiserv, the company partnering with the Bank of North Dakota to create the Roughrider coin and build out the technical framework, said the use of stablecoins in bank-to-bank money movement should be thought of as a way to increase efficiency.
“You will start moving money 24/7 with minimal impact on anything else,” said Takis Georgakopoulos, Fiserv’s COO. 
Georgakopoulos said there are ways to work around liquidity concerns if the Roughrider coin is ever made available for consumer use, and “we’re going to work with the Bank of North Dakota to find the right way to do that.”
The first “use case” of the Roughrider coin will be bank-to-bank transactions, offering nearly instant movement of money even outside of business hours and across international borders. Morgan said “we still see tremendous value in that” even if there is never a widespread use of stablecoin by consumers. 
But the Bank of North Dakota will also continue to prepare, internally and in coordination with local partners, for consumer use of stablecoins like the Roughrider coin to ensure local banks and credit unions have the option to offer it to customers down the road. 
“It really sets our banking and credit union industry up for our state to be ready for what’s coming,” Morgan said. 
Kruse is confident North Dakota’s banking industry can handle risks that come with new financial technologies like stablecoin. 
“Risk is risk,” Kruse said. “I think banks understand that and they know how to manage it.”
The Bank of North Dakota is always conscious of risks, Morgan said, because it leverages deposits from the state government to use as lending capital. 
“We are not interested in stepping into high-risk situations. We do not deem this as a high-risk evolution project here,” Morgan said. “With that first use case being bank to bank, that lowers the risk profile for us significantly.”

That money was raised over the past three years — an effort nearly totally funded by massive contributions from a mere 21 donors, nearly all of them corporations or other entities with significant lobbying presences in Washington and/or Frankfort.

A report recently filed by the Republican Party of Kentucky Building Fund with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance listed the two additional contributions and the project’s expenses between July 1 and Sept. 30. Both the whiskey giant Bean Suntory and the aircraft manufacturer Boeing had made previous contributions to the Republican Party of Kentucky’s Building Fund. (A complete list of totals given by all of the large donors is listed below.)
Kentucky Lantern first reported in early 2023 that the state Republican Party had launched the fundraising drive to expand its headquarters in Frankfort — a drive that got off to a spectacular start with a donation of $1 million from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, apparently the largest donation ever made to a Kentucky political party fund.
State and federal laws limit the amount any person can give to a state political party to $15,000 per year. And before 2017 state law banned corporations from making contributions.
But that year the Republican-controlled Kentucky General Assembly passed a law to make it easy for the GOP to raise the millions it would need to vastly expand its headquarters. That law let political parties establish separate building funds that could accept donations of unlimited amounts from corporations or people.
The Republican Party of Kentucky headquarters is in south Frankfort, about five blocks from the Capitol. It is called the Mitch McConnell Building in honor of Kentucky’s senior senator who is credited with leading the party from decades of minority status to its current dominance in Kentucky politics.

The nearly completed expansion connects the existing headquarters to a new 6,800-square-foot structure on an adjacent vacant lot. The new structure is designed to conform to the residential nature of the neighborhood. It includes a 160-seat auditorium.
Ground was broken for the project last summer.
Reports filed by the RPK Building Fund since early 2023 with the election registry show that $4,206,675 has been raised for the project since late 2022, and that through Sept. 30 the fund has spent about $3,826,000. Those reports show nearly all of that has been paid to three contractors: $3,294,000 to Branscum Construction, of Russell Springs; $261,500 to Stengel-Hill Architecture, of Louisville; and $180,000 to Haney Consulting for fundraising consulting. Haney Consulting is headed by Laura Haney, McConnell’s longtime fundraising consultant.
The Republican Party of Kentucky did not immediately respond to a phone call from Kentucky Lantern or to an email asking questions about the project and the contributions that funded it. 
The Kentucky Democratic Party has not used the 2017 law to launch any fund drive. In the recent quarter, the Democratic Party Building Fund reported just $137 in receipts, $1,681 in expenses, and a fund balance of $284,952 as of Sept. 30.

As federal law cuts off Medicaid funding to organizations that provide abortions, what’s already happened in the Natural State likely will be repeated nationwide.
For seven years, low-income Arkansans who use Medicaid have been unable to have their health care covered at either of the state’s Planned Parenthood locations in Little Rock and Rogers. That includes such services as annual physicals, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases, though Planned Parenthood’s detractors tend to focus on abortion. Arkansas’ near-total abortion ban became effective in 2022, but the U.S. government had already banned Medicaid funding for abortion in most cases.
Without state Medicaid dollars, Planned Parenthood has had to “fundraise just to keep [the] doors open,” said Emily Wales, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which oversees locations in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri.
Arkansas Medicaid patients in 2018 expressed frustration to their Planned Parenthood providers that they could no longer get care from people they knew and trusted, Wales said. She added that Medicaid reimbursements are so low in Arkansas that many providers do not participate in the program.
“Planned Parenthood, both in Arkansas and nationally, wants to support patients who have Medicaid,” Wales said. “We want every person, whatever their income status, to know that they can get the same high quality services, but because of politics, now those patients are having to find new providers if they can, and many times [they] are facing delays on their care because they can’t find another provider that they can’t get into very quickly.”
Low-income Arkansans can seek care at the state health department’s local health units or at nonprofit community health centers, but unlike Planned Parenthood, those facilities do not specialize in reproductive health care.

Appeals ruling threatens routine care access for Medicaid enrollees at Planned Parenthood

 

People who cross state lines in order to receive health care cannot expect their Medicaid coverage to include services in another state, and interstate travel might not be feasible anyway for people who struggle to obtain reliable transportation and child care, Wales said.
That problem will only be exacerbated if Medicaid patients can’t get care at Planned Parenthood anywhere, she said.
Nationally, Planned Parenthood has identified at least 200 clinics out of about 600 nationally that could close if they cannot treat Medicaid patients and receive reimbursements from the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some people with disabilities.
None of Planned Parenthood’s Great Plains locations are currently set to close, said Hanna Sumpter, regional director of marketing and communications.
Planned Parenthood filed a federal lawsuit in July aiming to block the federal budget reconciliation bill’s provision targeting the organization. A district court judge issued a preliminary injunction, but an appeals court panel overturned the ruling Sept. 11.
The Little Rock Planned Parenthood clinic is under heavy security; a reporter seeking comment for this story was denied access and had to leave contact information via an intercom. 
 Other provider options

The Arkansas Department of Health has local health units in all 75 counties. The units offer no-cost testing for sexually transmitted infection and cervical cancer screenings for uninsured patients and “likely no more than $25” for insured patients, said Ashley Whitlow, the health department’s deputy director of health communications.
Additionally, Arkansas has a network of more than 200 federally qualified health centers that operate under the umbrella of Community Health Centers of Arkansas, a nonprofit that provides health care regardless of patients’ ability to pay. The federal Health Resources and Services Administration designates and funds these centers.

How well the community health centers are filling the gap in women’s health care left by the absence of publicly funded reproductive health care is uncertain, as Community Health Centers of Arkansas CEO Lanita White did not make herself available for an interview.
At a roundtable maternal health discussion last year, White said not enough Arkansans are aware of community health centers.
The current federal government shutdown has created “significant financial challenges” for these centers, according to KFF Health News.
The centers don’t focus on women’s health, but that’s changing as a new Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health has begun working with providers to increase pregnant and postpartum Arkansans’ access to care. 
Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement, a nonpartisan, independent health policy center.
Lawmakers and health care providers have expressed concern that the state has trouble recruiting and retaining obstetrician-gynecologists. More broadly, Arkansas had only 9.2 primary care physicians per 10,000 residents as of 2022, according to ACHI.

Arkansas maternal health care landscape needs more coordination and teamwork, physicians say


 Avoiding silos

Krista Langston, CEO of the Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health, previously helped launch Arkansas’ community health worker training program at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ Institute for Community Health Innovation. 
“A lot of the FQHCs have decided that they’re going to take on prenatal care because they see that need in their community of being able to enhance access,” Langston said. “At the center, we’re willing to partner with them in order to help them feel prepared to do so.”
Additionally, Arkansas’ Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act of 2025 allows Medicaid reimbursements for community health workers who provide pregnancy-related health services. It’s one of many Medicaid policy changes in the new law that its supporters, including Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said will improve low-income Arkansans’ access to maternal health care.
Langston’s previous job helped lay the groundwork for implementing this new Medicaid policy, she said. It was among the recommendations of a maternal health task force Sanders convened last year.
“It was the first time that we were able to see so many organizations — hospitals, clinics, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations — were working on maternal health initiatives, but it was being done in a silo,” Langston said.
One of the goals of the Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health is to help family medicine providers, midwives and advanced practice registered nurses fill gaps in maternal health care left by the state’s shortage of OB-GYNs, Langston said.
The center is also working on a perinatal care curriculum for community health workers “so we can ensure that women are getting the best support needed while pregnant,” she said. She expects the curriculum to be complete by spring 2026.










We want every person, whatever their income status, to know that they can get the same high quality services, but because of politics, now those patients are having to find new providers if they can.


– Emily Wales, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains


 Referrals and partnerships

In western Arkansas, the 12 facilities under the River Valley Primary Care Services community health centers organization have one women’s health provider who provides pregnancy care up to 32 weeks’ gestation, nursing director Laura Little said. After 32 weeks, patients are referred to local hospitals in and around Fort Smith or as far east as the Johnson Regional Medical Center in Clarksville, she said.
“We have a mutual understanding with these bigger hospitals that once [pregnant patients] get to a certain degree, we refer them out, and then we pick them back up postpartum,” Little said.
Two of Arkansas’ community health center networks — Mainline Health in South Arkansas and Community Clinic in Northwest Arkansas — work with hospitals to ensure the centers’ pregnant patients are a priority for delivery, Langston said.
However, patients referred from community health centers to regular clinics can have difficulty obtaining non-emergent or non-pregnancy-related women’s health care, such as routine STI testing or pap smears, Little said.
“We are seeing that there is a longer wait time just for those routine visits, [but] if you’re pregnant, you can get right in with specialty gynecologists,” she said.
Arkansas Planned Parenthood staff did their best to refer Medicaid recipients to other providers in 2018, Wales said.
If an uninsured patient came to Planned Parenthood before the 2018 policy change, the organization could use its privately raised funds to support the patients in the most need, Wales said. Since the change, those funds have to go toward serving Medicaid clients whose care can’t be reimbursed, she said.
Patients’ ability to see providers of their choice is one of the casualties of cutting off Medicaid clients’ access to Planned Parenthood, Wales said.
“Because the Medicaid defunding attempts are political, the piece that’s lost is the human impact,” she said. “Politicians aren’t often thinking about the individuals who make appointments, know and trust individual providers after seeing them repeatedly, and then show up and find out there’s a disruption in care.”

After 20 years of organizing in rural Colorado, I’ve learned that lasting results come from supporting rather than opposing, from building bridges not tearing them down, from identifying shared solutions, not only pointing at problems. 
This is the Ditch Principle: Your ditch neighbor may disagree with you about everything except keeping the water running —  so you start there. The neighbor who might pull you out of a snowbank doesn’t stop being your neighbor when you disagree about politics. Rural communities practice interdependence because isolation kills.

Friedrich Nietzsche’s warning about monsters isn’t just stale philosophy — it’s practical advice that seems freshly relevant. As authoritarianism rises in America, we face a choice: resist by becoming what we oppose, or demonstrate something better. 
As a longtime climate activist, the current anti-science stance is infuriating and deeply disappointing. But wildfire preparedness is critical right now, and community-wide planning helps everyone regardless of how they understand climate science. 
Instead of doom-scrolling at the edge of the abyss, we should respond by restoring what matters most in the spaces and relationships we maintain, leading forward from the ground up. 
This is a necessity, not idealism. When fire ignites or search and rescue is called, people put down their projects and differences to pull together. We have to get along or nothing gets done. People who honor these expectations are accepted, our contrary politics notwithstanding. 
The damage to both our planet and our institutions is real, extreme and unabated. Two-thirds of Americans recognize we’ve become too polarized and no longer believe partisan politics is capable of solving our problems, according to a recent New York Times poll. Here in western Colorado, the largest voting bloc isn’t Republican or Democratic — it’s unaffiliated voters who want problem-solvers, not partisans. 
Anti-science is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. The erasure of climate data and the dismissal of inconvenient facts to protect powerful interests is a current case in point. But rural communities include practical people. Farmers experience drought, higher temperatures, and climate weirding. Homeowners fear wildfire and feel the risk.
History shows proven strategies to oppose authoritarianism. And rural communities are naturally situated to lead these approaches and reclaim our democratic foundations. 

Build alternatives, don’t just oppose. No one asks who voted for whom when the irrigation ditch needs cleaning. They show up with shovels. This is constructive organizing — demonstrating how things work when people focus on shared needs rather than manufactured divisions. Cooperation is a bulwark against authoritarianism. 
Include everyone, abandon no one. We don’t start with politics when defending vulnerable community assets. Everyone depends on reliable water supply and safe evacuation routes, regardless of where they land on climate policy. We protect those needs notwithstanding the connections between climate, wildfire and drought. 
Navigating diverse perspectives, complicated relationships, and competing interests are not only challenges but tactics in resistance. Authoritarianism wins when we sacrifice groups one by one, including those we find disagreeable. Democracy wins when we expand the circle of concern. 
Practice the democracy you want to see. It’s not only about fighting monsters, it’s about listening and working authentically even when it challenges us. Fair decisions, transparent communication, everyone gets heard — unlike cable politics, we don’t need leaders playing gotcha for narrow advantage. We change minds by creating shared experiences of things working better, solving problems that help everyone prosper. 

The power of rural communities lies in quietly building resilience through relationships spanning decades. With steady focus on what we can control, these relationships outlast any political cycle. The infrastructure that serves everyone endures. 
Authoritarianism requires division to survive and cannot withstand this approach. It needs us to see neighbors as threats, demands we choose ideology over community, that we abandon democratic norms in the name of winning. 
When we refuse that bargain — when we bridge differences rather than divide, include rather than exclude, practice democracy and not just preach it — we make authoritarianism irrelevant. 
The work to restore will outlive us. The best way not to become monsters is to stay neighbors. The ditch still needs clearing. A wildfire needs containing. When someone falls or is lost, it takes teamwork and a broad set of skills to get people out of rugged backcountry and back home to their families. So start there. Build from there. 
E pluribus unum. In shared purpose we remember: The strongest defense against those who would divide us is simply refusing to be divided.

Stubblefield died Sept. 2. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)I knew it had to happen. I figured a lawsuit might be the only chance residents of Senate District 26 would have to choose a new senator before April.
And, so, a Franklin County resident named Colt Shelby filed a complaint Monday against Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester over the date Sanders set for the special election to replace the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died Sept. 2.
The lawsuit reiterates what others have been saying: the special election date chosen by the governor leaves the people of District 26 — which encompasses parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties — without a voice in the state Senate for the better part of a year, especially during the legislative fiscal session that starts in April.
Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest and others, including Stubblefield’s daughter, have said delaying the District 26 election until after the April fiscal session is a cynical political ploy meant to deprive the district’s voters of a voice in important decisions. 
Those decisions include a likely vote on funding for a 3,000-bed prison proposed for Franklin County. A $750-million prison appropriation bill failed five times during the regular session this spring before its sponsor pulled it down. Stubblefield and King were among the legislators who helped kill it.
Is Sanders so calculating and vindictive that she’d deprive nearly 86,000 District 26 residents, many of whom are strong supporters, of legitimate representation in the Senate? Hard to say, but I don’t think a special election will occur before the Legislature convenes absent a court order.
“The Governor has no constitutional or statutory authority to deny them that representation,” the lawsuit argues.
The petition asks the court to order the general election to be held Dec. 9, rather than June 9, the date set by the governor.
Getting a court to order an earlier election is no sure thing, but it seems a gamble worth taking since I don’t expect the governor to change her mind — again. 
You see, she originally set the primary and general special election to coincide with next year’s March primaries and November’s general elections. Sanders said the timing would save taxpayer money, streamline the electoral process and maximize voter turnout.
She reset the general special election to June “after receiving feedback from the community and getting confirmation from election officials that a change, while difficult, is doable,” she said in a press release announcing the revised date. The primary would still be in March.
Even with the rescheduling, the special election will fall well beyond the 150-day maximum called for by state law. The law allows special election dates beyond that window if the governor determines that doing so would be “impracticable or unduly burdensome.” Sanders used that catch-all phrase to justify both the November and June dates.
What remains evident, absent an affirmative ruling in the lawsuit, is that replacing Stubblefield will take far longer than filling any other vacant legislative seat since 2011, according to an unpublished memo from the Senate legal counsel’s office. King sought an analysis of past legislative vacancies and how many fell within the 150-day window and how many outside of it.
“None of the other special elections called since 2011 were modified after the original call was issued,” the letter says.
Eyebrows raised in astonishment when Sanders changed the election date once. There’s little evidence she would voluntarily reverse course a second time. She’s never been someone who’d publicly bend to pressure, not even from her own party.

(Photo by Jocelyn Jackson/Rhode Island Current)Ric Thornton aims to reduce the $6.2 million dollars worth of outstanding fines for missing or overdue state campaign finance reports by 25% by the end of the year.
The state campaign finance director doesn’t expect to convince former candidates and officeholders to make good on their six-figure debts.
Instead, Thornton is invoking a new state regulation he helped create, which lets the Rhode Island Board of Elections cap fines on campaign finance violations and suspend the old accounts to stop late fees from accruing.
“More than 99 percent of the debt owed is aged over 120 days, so we’re on top of the current debt level very well,” Thornton said in an interview Thursday. “The new regulation is extremely helpful in getting the others down to a collectible level.”
While the election agency has made significant strides in tracking and collecting money on campaign finance violations in recent years, a few dozen offenders — who owe most of the debt — remained unreachable. 
And the $2 daily late fee on any missing or overdue campaign finance reports quickly escalates a manageable fine — $25 for a single missing campaign report, for example — into hundreds of thousands owed.
Recognizing people are unlikely or unable to ever pay that large a bill — and the constitutional problems posed by “excessive” fines — the state elections board approved new regulations last year that cap fines and offer leeway to determine lower amounts. But it wasn’t until September that the panel first exercised its new authority, slashing fines for three of the top debtors on the list. Another six former candidates and office holders’ fines were reduced at the Board of Elections meeting Wednesday. More will be up for consideration next month, Thornton said.
“I am just trying to get them in the queue before we get into the 2026 election cycle,” Thornton explained.










More than 99 percent of the debt owed is aged over 120 days, so we’re on top of the current debt level very well. The new regulation is extremely helpful in getting the others down to a collectible level.


– Ric Thornton, state campaign finance director


He also wanted to wait until the regulatory change was posted on the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website. While the state elections board approved the change in April 2024, it didn’t file the rule with the Department of State until May 2025. 
Christopher Hunter, a spokesperson for the Board of Elections, said in an email that elections staff had technical problems submitting the regulation through the state’s administrative records office. The elections board also needed to prioritize work related to the 2024 presidential primary before resubmitting the rule change, Hunter said.
Despite the wait, Thornton was optimistic of meeting his year-end deadline. The nine candidates whose cases have come before the election board thus far originally owed nearly $2.2 million combined in fines and late fees. Thornton’s recommendations, all of which were approved by the elections board under separate, unanimous votes, slash their combined debt nearly 96% to $90,612. 
“I anticipate that once we get through this inventory, we won’t really need to use this regulation again,” Thornton said. “We are very on top of our current debt level.”
Even if the longstanding debtors don’t pay, it’s no longer  Thornton’s problem. The reduced fines also come with a referral to the Rhode Island Department of Revenue’s Central Collections Unit. If the reduced fines aren’t paid within the specified time frame — usually 90 days — state debt collectors will crack down, with the ability to garnish wages and place liens on assets.
“A big part of this has been just trying to track these people down,” Thornton said, noting that many people who owe money for campaign finance violations have moved out of state and changed phone numbers.
 As part of his presentation to the elections board, Thornton was asked to estimate the labor and postage costs for his team’s continued outreach to candidates and officeholders; under state law, the elections board sends two mailed notices each quarter for campaign finance reports, along with phone calls, house visits and in some cases, subpoenas. These efforts have proven largely fruitless — nearly all of the candidates with six-digit debt never responded to attempts to contact them, Thornton told the elections board.

Taking accountability…or not
Former candidates and officeholders were also given an opportunity to explain their plights directly to the elections board at its September and October hearings. Three came Wednesday, offering a mix of chagrin, indifference and defiance.
The latter came from Jonathan Joseph Keith, who ran for Cranston School Committee in 2014, followed by three unsuccessful state Senate runs in 2016, 2018 and 2020. Keith filed regular reports with the elections board during his first three candidacies, then closed his account. When he ran for a final time in 2020, he opened an account, but never filed any of the required reports on fundraising and spending during or after his campaign. Now, he owes more than $43,500 based on 22 missing reports and late fees on five other submissions, Thornton said.
Keith, however, insisted that because he did not raise or spend any money during his 2020 campaign, he did not have to file any reports on his activity.
“This has all been a waste of my time,” Keith said Wednesday. 
The board postponed a vote on his debt, asking for a written request from Keith for its legal counsel to review.
Five other candidates had their fines reduced under a series of unanimous votes at the same meeting. All but one were given the standard 90 days to pay the lower fine to the state.
However, the board agreed to give former Central Falls mayoral hopeful Hipolito Fontes more time to pay the $5,109 he owed from missing campaign finance reports dating back to 2010. Fontes, who also came to the board’s Cranston office Wednesday, explained the series of unfortunate events that led to his original, $233,000 fine: a heated mayoral race that included personal threats, the closure of the Central Falls credit union where he opened his campaign account, and a divorce.
“I want to take accountability,” Fontes told the board. “After hitting brick wall after brick wall, I gave up at some point.” 
Fontes lost his job at Oak Street Health this summer, which he told the elections board would make it hard to repay even a reduced fine in 90 days. Based on Fontes’ explanation, the board agreed to double the time he has to pay to 180 days. 
Little solace to Fontes.
“I’ve been honestly just freaking out about it,” he said in an interview Thursday. “I have a mortgage to try to figure out. I get unemployment so I am trying to stitch things together but I am trying to figure out how I am going to come up with $900 a month extra.”
Fontes also questioned the fairness of the process. His new fine is still more than double the $2,500 that Thornton estimated was spent on postage and labor over the last 25 years.
“I wanted to make things whole based on the postage they spent,” Fontes said. “But it feels like a little bit of a sham. This is more than a mortgage payment.”
A case-by-case basis
But, it’s 75% less than the $20,000 that Daryl Gould, a former candidate for state representative and Bristol School Committee, will have to pay. Gould did not appear at the meeting Wednesday and did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. However, Gould’s relationship with the elections panel has been fraught for several years. 
In 2022, he was held in contempt by the elections board, and issued $3,000 in fines, for failing to submit his missing reports. His case was referred to the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office later that same year, but the state’s top prosecutor declined to take action, Thornton said. His fines and late fees topped $134,000 before the board agreed to the lesser, $20,000 balance Wednesday.
The new regulations governing campaign finance fines rely partly on formulas based on the type of offense, but also offer discretion. Contentious cases like Gould’s offer grounds for a larger fine in Thornton’s eyes. So too did the cases in which candidates raised or spent significant amounts of money, and for those who actually won elected office.
Take, for example, former state Sen. Patrick T. McDonald, who served eight years on Smith Hill, from 1996 to 2002. 
“He was an officeholder in the past, so he knew what the campaign finance requirements are,” Thornton said.
The Narragansett Democrat filed the reports on fundraising and spending through his time in office, but he never closed his campaign finance account. His $737,900 worth of  fines and late fees was the most of any candidate or campaign. 
But now, McDonald owes just under $19,000, approved by the elections board at its Sept. 9 meeting. He has not paid as of Thursday, and has not responded to any attempts at contact over the last 23 years, Thornton said.
McDonald also served a 4.5-year prison sentence after he was convicted in 2014 of embezzling money from his law practice. McDonald did not return a call for comment Thursday. 
Other former candidates whose fines have been reduced are:

Robert Rainville, a 2010 attorney general candidate, whose fine was reduced from more than $310,000 to $17,800 on Sept. 9. A phone number for Rainville was not available, but he did not return a message sent on LinkedIn Thursday.
James Black Jr., a 2010 North Providence Town Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from $310,000 to $9,500 on Sept. 9. Black did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Emily Trott, a West Warwick Town Council candidate in 2008, 2010 and 2012, whose fine was reduced from $235,600 to $8,500 on Oct. 8. Trott attended the elections board’s Oct. 9 meeting and accepted responsibility for the missing reports, blaming it on procrastination.
John McMahon, a 2016 Portsmouth Town Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from over $140,000 to $6,000 on Oct. 8.
Jeffrey Appiah, a 2018 Pawtucket City Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from more than $72,700 to $3,000 on Oct. 8.
David Santilli Jr., a 2018 Johnston Town Council candidate, whose fine was reduced from $21,500 to $1,7500 on Oct. 8.

(Photos courtesy campaigns)The race to represent House District 73, which comprises much of Chesterfield County, represents a litmus test for shifting demographics and partisan tides, and may show which issues motivate Virginia voters beyond party affiliation. 
Incumbent Republican Mark Earley Jr. is a lawyer and a first-term delegate who will defend his seat against Democratic challenger Leslie Mehta, who is hoping to make her debut in the House. Neither are strangers to politics, however.  
Earley, a lawyer, is the son of former Republican state Attorney General Mark Earley Sr. The younger Earley was first elected in 2023 and previously served in former Gov. Bob McDonnell’s administration. 
Mehta, a lawyer who was the former legal director for Virginia’s American Civil Liberties Union chapter, was appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to serve on the Rare Disease Council and previously posed an unsuccessful challenge to U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, for the 1st Congressional District. 
This means it’s also not Mehta’s first time taking on a Republican in a district that could be a challenge to flip. She’s feeling confident, she told The Mercury in a recent interview, as she plans to be “part of the conversation” in addressing federal funding fallout if elected. And there’s one aspect that might give her an edge: House District 73 is a little more favorable to Democrats than the 1st Congressional District was. 
The district leans Republican but an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project shows Democrat Kamala Harris beat Republican President Donald Trump by .6% of a point there last November. Republican margins for statewide or national elections in the district have shrunk in recent years, in part from redistricting. The locality has also evolved over the years as it has expanded in population growth and partisan demographics.

 Leslie Mehta

Mehta’s campaign came out of the gate with an endorsement from Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger.  Spanberger was one of the most bipartisan members of Congress before her gubernatorial bid, and Mehta  said she also plans to legislate in that fashion. 
Describing herself as a “pragmatist” who will work across the aisle to get things done, she emphasized that if elected, her Democratic colleagues will count on her to help advance three in-progress constitutional amendments. The Democrat-led proposals would protect reproductive health care access in the state’s constitution, automatically restore voting rights to people who complete felony sentences and remove a prohibition on same-sex marriage.
Amid passionate debate, civil rights resolutions clear Virginia legislature

As Mehta has struggled with fertility issues and chronic pain due to endometriosis, in vitro fertilization is how she was able to conceive and she has since had a hysterectomy. She emphasized how the amendment applies to multiple reproductive health decisions, including abortions. 
“There’s so much shame sometimes that’s centered around not only the things that happen to our bodies, but the decisions that we make,” she said.
Some of Mehta’s key priorities include exploring tax reform so that higher-income earners pay “their fair share,” and finding ways to ease burdens on middle-class or working families. Her ideas include reforming property and car taxes; eliminating the car tax is a goal of both Spanberger and Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, though it has failed in past governors’ terms. 
Like many Democrats, Mehta aims to invest more state money in public education. Bolstering funding also appears to be a goal of Earley’s, though The Mercury was unable to ask for more details as he did not respond to multiple interview requests. 
Mehta also believes her passion for health care policy can help appeal to voters. 
When campaigning for Congress last year, she said health care affordability and access were  concerns she heard repeatedly while door-knocking. The issues have remained salient as Congress’ reconciliation bill that passed this summer will alter hospital funding mechanisms and likely cause thousands of Virginians and millions of Americans to lose Medicaid coverage. 
A chorus of Democratic lawmakers, hospital officials, and health care advocates have warned that the forthcoming changes from the reconciliation bill will likely cause hospitals to trim services — with some vulnerable to closures — while those without insurance who put off care can face more dire outcomes and higher costs others will absorb. 
“We just cannot put these kinds of constraints on Virginians or health care professionals,” Mehta said. “We’re going to have to figure out ways to make it better. So I want to be part of that conversation.” 
Medicaid is personal to her, as it helped improve the life of her oldest daughter Brooke, who suffered a rare, debilitating genetic disorder before her death. Brooke needed a specialized stroller for mobility and eventually an eye-gaze device allowed her to communicate words without speaking. 
“As a first time mom, I got to hear the words ‘I love you, Mommy’ because of Medicaid,” Mehta explained. 
Though she and her husband have private insurance, Brooke’s status as someone with a disability helped them offset a variety of her living expenses and gave the two-time Democratic candidate deeper insight into how critical the program is to many Virginians. 
 Mark Earley, Jr. 

Health care is also a priority for Earley, though it’s unclear what his exact plans are because he could not be reached to share more details. 
His campaign website states that “easier access, better quality and far more transparency” can be “achieved through a market driven approach that drives down cost.”
He added that “mental health and addiction must also be top priorities.”
The state legislature and Gov. Glenn Youngkin have  been tackling those issues by bolstering crisis response, creating online resource hubs and promoting crisis hotlines. 
Earley’s passion for those issues also stem from his experience as a foster parent and work as an attorney, he’s said. 
A member of the minority party during his tenure in the legislature so far, Earley has not passed any legislation, nor did any  of his 15 bills filed this year make it  out of the House. 
Though he hasn’t been able to advance his ideas, his party has depended on him to help vote down key Democratic-led proposals.
Of the three in-progress constitutional amendments that need to pass a second time before voters can weigh in next year, two cleared on a bipartisan basis, while one — the reproductive rights measure — now hinges on Democrats retaining their majority in the House. 
While every Republican in the state legislature voted against the proposal to enshrine reproductive rights into Virginia’s constitution, Earley also strongly opposed it when he spoke out on the House floor in January. 
There, he alleged the amendment “obliterates” parental rights and called it “among the most extreme and ideologically-driven amendments that have been proposed in the nation.”
Democrats countered that state law already outlines parental consent for minors to have surgeries, like abortions. Still, the matter has remained a concern for Republicans. 
Like many in his party, Earley’s other priorities include “empowering parents” and allowing them more say in  K-12 public education. He also supports excluding transgender students from “girl’s and women’s sports and spaces,” a goal Virginia has moved towards achieving this year.  
Earley said he has prioritized supporting families overall as a delegate and will continue to do so if reelected. As a parent of two who fostered six children,  he’s also passionate about supporting foster families.
Speaking to the camera in a video he posted to his website, he threaded various action items together including boosting parents’ rights, lowering the cost of health care and lowering taxes among others. 
“This is where my mind is, and it’s where my effort will be: to support and protect the Virginia family,” he said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) Rhode Island’s Medicaid program is contemplating an end to coverage for GLP-1 drugs prescribed for weight loss.
The proposal appears in the Rhode Island’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services’ 270-page operating budget submission for fiscal year 2027. The coverage change could take effect as early as July 1, 2026, but would more likely happen by October 2026 or January 2027, according to the budget request document — one of the many documents state agencies send to the governor’s office each fall with details on their monetary needs and challenges predicted in the upcoming fiscal year.
“While quite efficacious, these medications are quite expensive, with list prices ranging from $12,000 annually to roughly $16,000 annually as of March 2025,” the budget proposal reads.
The department’s proposal would only affect prescriptions for weight loss, and it would still cover prescriptions for diabetes, which the GLP-1 drugs were first used to treat. GLP-1 drugs work on type-2 diabetes by suppressing glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar. The same mechanism plays a role in how the body feels hunger, which is why the drugs are valuable in weight loss. 
The drugs are nearly chemically identical regardless of the condition they treat, and some drugs contain the same active ingredients but are marketed under different names. Novo Nordisk, for instance, markets two versions: Ozempic for diabetes, and Wegovy for weight loss. Other branded drugs in the GLP-1 family include Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound. 
Regardless of branding, the drugs share a high price point as well, and are expected to get even pricier. The department estimates it could save $6.3 million in general revenue, and $20.3 million across all funding sources, including federal ones. 
The savings would be procured by tweaking contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs), the insurers who deliver most of the state’s Medicaid coverage.
“GLP-1 weight loss costs are expected to increase again between approximately 130 percent (low estimate) and nearly 200 percent (high estimate),” by the end of the second quarter in fiscal year 2027, according to the department’s budget request.
Between the start of fiscal year 2024 and the end of fiscal year 2025, GLP-1 costs roughly quadrupled in Rhode Island Medicaid’s per-member monthly payments to its managed care plans, according to the department.
That data aligns with what the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner reported in May about the drugs’ impact on the commercial insurance market. A record 7.8% in spending growth in 2023 across Rhode Island’s health system was partially driven by a surging amount of GLP-1 prescriptions, which doubled from 2022 to 2023. Total commercial health plan spending on the drug class more than tripled from 2021 to 2023. 
Health and Human Service’s budget note does, however, provide a caveat about its analysis of fiscal impact, which is based on a short-term calculation tied directly to changes in managed care rates. 
“Ending coverage for GLP-1 obesity drugs would be in line with current financial trends in both public and private insurance companies but could result in health inequities and less comprehensive coverage for a large segment of Rhode Island’s population,” the budget note reads.
Obesity is more prevalent among low-income Rhode Islanders and communities of color. Among adults, 38.5% of Black residents have obesity, compared with 33.9% of Hispanic residents and 29.5% of white residents, according to Health in Rhode Island. 
Income disparities are similar, with 44.6% of adults in households earning under $15,000 diagnosed as obese. Obesity is found in 35.5% of adults in households earning $15,000–$25,000.
Nationally, state Medicaid outfits are restricting GLP-1 coverage as list prices consistently climb alongside increasing demand. The EOHHS note adds that 14 states cover GLP-1s, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire. 
But even these states may soon change their minds. Connecticut wants to roll back coverage, and Massachusetts’ MassHealth now limits weight-loss coverage to Zepbound with prior authorization. Patients must also take a trial of phentermine, an older drug chemically related to amphetamines and still widely used for weight loss, before they can be approved for GLP-1s.
The Health and Human Services budget document notes that the GLP-1 coverage chaos comes after the outgoing Biden administration left the specifics of the drugs’ eligibility under Medicare and Medicaid up to the Trump administration. In April 2025, President Donald Trump’s administration declined to expand Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to cover GLP-1s for weight-loss.

This is happening to all of us: […]","Maine People's Alliance volunteers with signs at the B Street Health Center in Lewiston, including Jim Lysen, the former executive director Community Clinical Services, which operates the clinic. (Photo courtesy of Maine People's Alliance.)As the federal government shutdown entered its ninth day with no end in sight, advocacy groups and the Maine Democratic Party are criticizing Republican U.S. Sen Susan Collins while raising concerns about what they see as an urgent need to address rising health care costs.
“This is real. This is happening to all of us: middle income, working class individuals,” said Maine Rep. Anne Graham (D-North Yarmouth), a retired pediatric nurse practitioner who spoke at a press conference Thursday alongside other party leaders who warned that tens of thousands of Mainers will face skyrocketing insurance premiums if Congress does not take immediate action. 
“This is going to hurt us all, and Susan Collins has let us down consistently,” Graham said.
That issue is at the heart of the shutdown, with congressional Democrats asking for a short-term funding plan that also extends tax credits that lower the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans, including Collins, are refusing to include that subsidy in the stopgap bill needed to reopen government. 
Sen. Collins said Democrats’ health care demands will ‘prolong shutdown’

Collins said on Monday that she supports extending the expiring tax credits, with some reforms, but doesn’t think that should be part of the “clean stopgap funding” that she prefers.
Collins, as well as independent U.S. Sen. Angus King, have voted repeatedly since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 in favor of the Republican bill that would fund the government for seven weeks without any of the health care provisions requested by Democrats. King has also supported a Democratic proposal that includes the health care provisions. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Maine 2nd District Rep. Jared Golden was the only Democrat to back the Republican plan. 
Devon Murphy-Anderson, executive director of the Maine Democratic Party, highlighted the financial strain that Mainers are already facing and accused Collins and her Republican colleagues of exacerbating the crisis by failing to extend the tax credits. 
Of the 61,000 Mainers who enroll through CoverME.gov, the state’s online marketplace, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs. If they expire, some families could see their premiums increase by as much as 117%, with some paying over $900 more per month, the administration of Gov. Janet Mills has warned.
Maine Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), who chairs the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, echoed these concerns, emphasizing that the loss of tax credits would disproportionately impact working families, small businesses, and rural communities. People in Aroostook and Washington counties are facing premiums increases over 70%, he said. Across the board, Mainers will need to come up with $88 million a year to absorb these costs, Gattine added.
During the event, Graham shared examples of Maine families who would be devastated by the loss of tax credits, including a Fort Kent couple in their 60s whose premiums would jump from $7,200 to $25,000 a year. 
She said she has reached out to Collins directly about the pressing need to act on these health care issues. Graham said the senator “appears to be responsive, but then votes against all the things that we really care about in the state of Maine.”

A bipartisan issue
Megan Smith, a community organizer for Maine People’s Alliance, a statewide progressive community action organization, joined volunteers outside the Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor on Wednesday to speak with patients about concerns they have with the impending cost increases. 
In rural Maine, where hospitals are struggling, Smith said she heard from several people who are already waiting up to six months for appointments with specialists.  
“If these offices close, these hospitals close, that means these people are going to have to drive hours for health care,” she said. “Losing the subsidies for the ACA is really scary to a lot of people, and even people who have insurance through their employers are scared that their rates are going to go up, as well.”
When Smith was a small business owner, she relied on marketplace health insurance herself, she said. 
“Those subsidies helped me for many, many years. And it just breaks my heart to even consider people not having access to that.”
Jim Lysen, the former executive director of Community Clinical Services, which operates the B-Street Health Center in Lewiston, canvassed outside its entrance on Wednesday, trying to learn how patients may be impacted by the expiring tax credits as well as pending cuts to MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program.
“The system that I helped create is undone by MaineCare cuts,” he said. “You’re wiping out a lot of people’s access to health care who won’t be able to afford it.”
He said in his decades-long career, he had never seen such an acute attack on health care, especially impacting low and middle income people.
“It’s unprecedented,” he said. “I’ve never seen it this bad.”
Lysen, who volunteers for Maine People’s Alliance, said health care should be a bipartisan issue because hospitals serve people across the political spectrum.
“Hospitals closing in rural areas is a bipartisan issue, it’s not just a progressive issue,” he said. “Because these hospitals in Maine serve lots of Republicans. So this is really a problem for all Mainers.”

(Photo courtesy Bryan Watts)Conservationists have been sounding the alarm for years over the lackluster breeding seasons for osprey along the Chesapeake Bay, and debate continues about why. A new study from the Center for Conservation Biology at the College of William & Mary shows  broods that nest in areas of the Bay that rely mostly on Atlantic menhaden are more likely to starve to death just weeks after hatching.
Researchers point to populations of  menhaden, a small forage fish, not being large enough to feed the chicks and the fish entering the Bay later in the breeding season as possible reasons for the starving birds There have been signs of osprey populations struggling to breed for years, and challenges for other species that rely on the menhaden. A study about menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay specifically has been unable to get off the ground in the state legislature.
Virginia fishermen call on President Trump to protect menhaden in Chesapeake Bay

The William & Mary study examined salinity levels in certain areas of the Chesapeake Bay and how they relate to the kind of fish the osprey are preying on to survive. Researcher Bryan Watts used that data to categorize the osprey populations  by where they nest and what fish they will likely depend on.
“Once you get to the lower salinity water, for example, the upper James (River), you wouldn’t expect menhaden to be there,” Watts said. “The ospreys in that part of the river depend primarily on catfish and gizzard chad, so they don’t feed on menhaden there.”
The 2025 breeding season, which stretches from March to August, experienced major weather events that impacted the nesting. 
The research shows that in low salinity areas, such as near the upper James, Potomac, and Rappahannock Rivers, there were more successful osprey broods that were closer to the targets  needed to sustain the population. Conversely, the osprey that nested in the higher salinity areas, which would largely rely on menhaden for food, saw more chicks dying of starvation.
Watts and his team expanded their research area for the 2025 study to include more than 1000 nests over 23 locations. None of the nests in the 18 high-salinity areas produced enough chicks to sustain the osprey population in their part of the Bay. Nests in the low- salinity areas performed better, but still faced challenges.

“I think there’s a general agreement that there’s not enough menhaden currently in the Bay to support a stable osprey population. The real question at this point and the real controversy is why are there not enough fish? You know, what’s caused the change?” Watts said.
Osprey are not the only species impacted by the menhaden availability. There are other birds, larger fish, and marine mammals that need the fish to survive. But ospreys have been the more visible canary in the coal mine, showing the need to address food scarcity in the Chesapeake Bay.
It’s unclear why the menhaden populations may not be enough to feed other animals, as there has not been a state-funded study to specifically look at the menhaden in the bay, despite multiple efforts in the General Assembly to do so. 
Virginia’s menhaden population and management remains a heated topic, and the new William & Mary study does not directly blame the lack of menhaden on over-fishing. Omega Protein, the only reduction fishery allowed in the Chesapeake Bay off the shores of Virginia, has been blamed for the reportedly declining menhaden populations. Omega Protein contracts through Ocean Harvesters. Groups including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association say the company’s operations have decimated the presence of the forage fish in the Bay. 
Ocean Harvesters stated that they did not enter the Chesapeake Bay in 2025 to start their fishing of the menhaden until late May, which is later than usual. They claim that period of activity does not line up with when the chicks were hatching.
“Center for Conservation Biology’s 2025 advisory shows food stress signals in higher-salinity waters, but the timing and the text do not support (the Chesapeake Bay Foundation)’s misleading narrative that the regulated menhaden fishery caused this year’s early nest failures and first-weeks chick mortalities,” Ocean Harvesters said in a release. “Those events occurred before the season opened and menhaden boats were still at the dock.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation said a group of organizations will release a stock assessment on the menhaden populations later this month to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, but it will be for the entire East Coast rather than just inside the Chesapeake Bay. The group continues to push for funding on that kind of study, which is projected to take three years to conduct.
“We keep being delayed by the industry who says there’s no problem, but, harvest, you know, millions and millions of pounds of these fish. So that is obviously something that I think is frustrating to everyone,” said Chris Moore, the Virginia Executive Director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
Both groups agree that all factors, including climate impacts, need to be considered when determining what is happening to the menhaden populations thus affecting the osprey and other species. 
There have been recent efforts to curb the reduction fishery’s activities in the Bay, with some Virginia fishermen calling on President Donald Trump to sign an executive order halting Omega’s fishing. While no such order has come down, state lawmakers are mulling over possible legislation to propose in the next General Assembly session to fund a study or other measures. 
The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has also considered recommendations to spread out menhaden fishing caps throughout the year to help the fish move through the Bay at critical times, but has not taken steps to make those changes.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Key federal funding for New Hampshire schools has not been affected by the shutdown in Washington, Department of Education Commissioner Caitlin Davis said Thursday — at least the money that flows through the state Department of Education. 
That’s because the federal money for the coming school year was “forward-funded,” meaning it was given to the state department in July in advance of the current school year, Davis said. 
“We have the majority of our federal education programming funds for the full year,” Davis told members of the State Board of Education at its monthly meeting Thursday. “So we’re lucky that doesn’t impact us that much.”
The pre-allocated money includes $50 million in Title I-A grants, which pass through the state agency and on to public schools with significant populations of low-income students. 
It also includes funds for Title II-A, which supports efforts to train teachers and improve their effectiveness to raise student academic achievement, as well as Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds, which cover a portion of public schools’ special education expenses.  
In total, about $200 million in annual allocations from the U.S. Department of Education will not be affected by the shutdown, Davis said.
But assistance programs run by other agencies may be in more jeopardy. For instance, money for free and reduced-price meals from the U.S. Department of Agriculture has not been granted to New Hampshire in one lump sum, Davis said, and thus could run out. “We do have some advanced money,” Davis said, speaking on the meals program. 
And other funding programs that affect public schools but are not run through the Department of Education, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, could also be hurt by the shutdown, she said.
SNAP has not yet been affected by the shutdown because benefits for the state are covered through October; Medicaid also has sufficient funds to continue operating through the first quarter of the 2026 federal fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
The shutdown, which began after U.S. Senate Democrats refused to vote with Republicans to continue government funding in order to obtain assurances that health care subsidies will continue, entered its 10th day Friday. It has led to widespread furloughs of federal workers, including some at the Portsmouth Naval shipyard, and has forced some federal employees, such as air traffic controllers, to continue work without pay. 
In a Sept. 30 press release shortly before the expected shutdown, Gov. Kelly Ayotte asserted that most state operations would not be affected and predicted “minimal impact,” at least for the first 30 days.
Davis echoed that point Thursday, noting that the front-loaded money means that all 275 positions at the state education department will continue to be paid, even though some rely on federal funds.
“We are continuing to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis and provide updates to both schools and department employees, because it can provide some unrest, as you can imagine,” Davis said.
“People hear the federal employees are not working in this time, and (ask) how does that impact our work?”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7294186-Caitlin-Davis-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

Even as the federal government attempts to prop up the waning coal industry, New England’s last coal-fired power plant has ceased operations three years ahead of its planned retirement date. The closure of the New Hampshire facility paves the way for its owner to press ahead with an initiative to transform the site into a clean energy complex including solar panels and battery storage systems.











“The end of coal is real, and it is here,” said Catherine Corkery, chapter director for Sierra Club New Hampshire. ​“We’re really excited about the next chapter.”


News of the closure came on the same day the Trump administration announced plans to resuscitate the coal sector by opening millions of acres of federal land to mining operations and investing $625 million in life-extending upgrades for coal plants. The administration had already released a blueprint for rolling back coal-related environmental regulations.


The announcement was the latest offensive in the administration’s pro-coal agenda. The federal government has twice extended the scheduled closure date of the coal-burning J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan, and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared it a mission of the administration to keep coal plants open, saying the facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability and lower prices.


However, the closure in New Hampshire — so far undisputed by the federal government — demonstrates that prolonging operations at some facilities just doesn’t make economic sense for their owners.


“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.


Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades. Gradually, though, natural gas — which is cheaper and more efficient — took over the regional market. In 2000, gas-fired plants generated less than 15% of the region’s electricity; last year, they produced more than half.







Additionally, solar power production accelerated from 2010 on, lowering demand on the grid during the day and creating more evening peaks. Coal plants take longer to ramp up production than other sources, and are therefore less economical for these shorter bursts of demand, Dolan said.














In recent years, Merrimack operated only a few weeks annually. In 2024, the plant generated just 0.22% of the region’s electricity. It wasn’t making enough money to justify continued operations, observers said.


The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said. ​“The combination of all those factors has meant that coal facilities are no longer economic in this market.”


Granite Shore Power, the plant’s owner, first announced its intention to shutter Merrimack in March 2024, following years of protests and legal wrangling by environmental advocates. The company pledged to cease coal-fired operations by 2028 to settle a lawsuit claiming that the facility was in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.


At the time, the company outlined a proposal to repurpose the 400-acre Merrimack site, just outside Concord, for clean energy projects, taking advantage of existing electric infrastructure to connect a 120-megawatt combined solar and battery storage system to the grid.


It is not yet clear whether changes in federal renewable energy policies will affect this vision. In a statement announcing the Merrimack closure, Granite Shore Power was less specific about its plans than it had been, saying, ​“We continue to consider all opportunities for redevelopment” of the site, but declining to follow up with more detail.


Still, advocates are looking ahead with optimism.
“This is progress — there’s no doubt the math is there,” Corkery said. ​“It is never over until it is over, but I am very hopeful.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bowmerrimack-1024x778.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio House lawmakers approved a pair of property tax measures Wednesday. The bills would give little known county boards greater oversight powers and get into the weeds of Ohio’s byzantine system for classifying taxes and calculating reductions.
At a moment when many Ohioans are frustrated enough to put property tax abolition to a vote, the proposals offer a series of changes likely to bring down property taxes in the short term and rein in future increases.
But the question is whether voters will recognize improvements if they happen. All the changes happen under the hood, indirect tweaks to processes that most taxpayers struggle to understand.

After the measures passed committee, the bills’ sponsor, state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said it was “probably the most impactful committee in several decades on property tax reform.” Still, he admitted lawmakers are still in a difficult spot.
“We are definitely behind what’s happened with taxpayers,” he said. “And we’re just trying to show them give us more time, which is a horrible thing to say to those that are struggling, but that’s really where we’re kind of at.”
“We’re passing these bills — most consequential in decades — and we’re trying to show that things will change, things will get better, and we’re not walking away from this,” he added.
House Speaker Matt Huffman acknowledged that property taxes are obscure to many Ohioans, but lawmakers are trying to simplify the system.
“Part of what we are doing today is to open the black box and shine a light on it,” he said.
As for the proposed amendment abolishing property taxes, the speaker thinks about 40% of voters are a hard ‘yes’ and another 40% are a hard ‘no.’
“As in many elections, it’s the last 10 or 15% who actually make the decision,” he said. “I think that group of voters is going to make their decision based on the things that we do over the next six or seven weeks here.”
County budget commissions
State law gives the treasurer, auditor and prosecutor in each of Ohio’s counties significant oversight for local levies. In the most recent state budget, lawmakers gave these County Budget Commissions the authority to rollback “unnecessary” or “excessive” levies. Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the provision — zeroing in on the possibility of commissions undoing levies approved just months before by the voters.
In committee, Rep. Thomas proposed an amendment to House Bill 309 adopting suggestions from the governor’s property tax working group. The changes included a five-year safe harbor for new levies and explicit definitions for “unnecessary” and “excessive.”
“The goal of these three were to help give some of the, I guess, guardrails that were requested by local entities and by members for the budget commissions,” Thomas explained.
State Rep. Daniel Troy, D-Willowick, complained the governor’s working group also recommended a two-year safe harbor for renewal levies, but that provision didn’t make it into the amendment. Still, he supported the measure.
Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan, who served on the governor’s working group, praised the committee for adopting the changes. He argued the county budget commission is an important check on rising levies, and because they’re all elected officials there’s accountability for its actions.
“If we make the wrong decision, if we defund a popular entity like (developmental disabilities boards) to the point that they lose money (and) that hurts services, we’re up for election — they are not. And so, we have to make the right decisions, or our voters will tell us,” he said.
On the House floor, though, state Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, argued that’s not good enough.
“Politicians should not override the will of voters,” she insisted, adding, “I think that we should allow the voters to have the final say.”
When he got a chance to speak, Rep. Thomas argued when voters approve a levy they’re approving a service — not a number.
“If the government can actually do that service for less, and doesn’t need that full tax amount, it’s in everyone’s interest to decrease those rates,” he said.
In several counties, Thomas said, local officials are reducing levies voluntarily, but the bill makes it clear all counties can do so. state can’t rely on voluntary action.
“It takes off the handcuffs,” he said. “Will this be used in every county? No, I can’t tell you that your budget commission in all 88 counties will be as aggressive for the taxpayer, as what I believe they should be.”
But we are recertifying, in black and white stone, that the budget commission has this ability.”
House Bill 309 passed 75-19.
What counts toward the 20-mill floor?
For decades, Ohio has given homeowners a property tax reduction to hold their bills steady as property values rise.
The idea is to block so-called “unvoted” property tax increases. Voters approved a given amount of money at the ballot, the argument goes, and so the taxing authority shouldn’t get more money just because property values have gone up.
To avoid increases, counties regularly reduce property tax rates so that more valuable property yields the same tax revenue.
The problem is school districts can’t reduce millage below 20 mills (or 2%). If property values rise high enough, those reductions stop working because they run into that hard stop at 20 mills. Two income sources, fixed sum levies and income taxes, aren’t calculated toward that 20-mill floor, though.
Ohio House Bill 129 would include them. Thomas explained 237 school districts, or roughly 1/3 of those in the state, voted for levies that aren’t currently counted toward the floor.
“And so, what we’re saying is, moving forward, those 237 schools will not be at the 20-mill floor,” he said, “and therefore will not spike as our values continue to increase.”
Reclassifying levies creates slack in the system — effectively lifting those districts off the 20-mill floor and making room for additional reductions.
Lawmakers recently overrode the governor’s budget veto to eliminate emergency and substitute levies. But in doing so they undid a set of state credits that go along with them. Democrats have warned those credits amount to almost $100 million around the state.
State Rep. Chris Glassburn, D-North Olmstead, thanked Republicans for delaying the impact of that change through a last minute amendment, but insisted “that 100-million-dollar mistake is being punted to five years from now.”
“This is not the property tax relief that our residents are asking for,” he said. “This is one of several technical changes that we’re trying to do to make the system right in the future, but this is not going to change the vast majority of Ohioans’ bills, and to the extent that it helps people, it is to prevent damage we caused in that override.”
Thomas acknowledged the measure is not the “be all, end all” of property tax reform, but said “for 237 of our school districts, for 1/3 of Ohioans, this bill gets us to a much better place.”
The bill passed easily, 81-16.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAs the government shutdown drags into its second week, Georgia’s congressional delegation is locked in a partisan struggle over who is to blame, with one of the state’s most high-profile Republicans, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, seemingly charting her own political path by challenging both parties on the issue of rising health care costs.
Greene, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, broke with her party’s leadership and declared, “I’m carving my own lane” in an online post this week. She said she would go “against everyone on this issue” because the premium hikes would impact “my own adult children” and her constituents in northwest Georgia.
She criticized the Republican-controlled Congress for prioritizing “foreign countries and foreign wars” over domestic health care affordability concerns.
At the core of the dispute in Washington is the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which would significantly increase health insurance costs for Georgians if allowed to expire at the end of the year. According to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis, a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 per year would see their monthly premium more than triple.
While Greene provided a rare moment of agreement with Democrats — “I never thought I’d say this, but Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is right,” Sen. Raphael Warnock posted online Tuesday — she offered no clear legislative solution, maintaining a deep ideological opposition to the program itself. Greene called the ACA a “disaster” and the insurance industry a “scam.”
Greene said she was “absolutely disgusted” by the lack of a Republican plan to prevent the doubling of health insurance premiums for Americans.

Natalie Crawford, executive director of Georgia First, a nonprofit think tank and policy advocacy group, said in an interview that she is hopeful more members of Georgia’s congressional delegation will come to understand how “uniquely bad the situation is for Georgia.” 
The loss of these credits, she said, would result in the collapse of the state-based marketplace, an “explosion” of the already “very large uninsured rate,” and an expansion of the coverage gap for residents who earn too much for Medicaid but too little to afford market policies.
“Those are populations that are going to be greatly affected. It’s going to have very real fiscal impact for the state of Georgia,” Crawford said. “And I think that the more our delegation understands that and is able to speak to that, there potentially is some hope for negotiation.” 
Crawford said the lack of a viable alternative means the state of Georgia would be left to consider its own tax credits or to “revisit expansion” to cover those expected to lose coverage if the federal tax credits expire. Georgia is one of 10 states that have not fully expanded Medicaid. 
“This is not a partisan issue. It should not be a partisan issue, and I understand policy differences, but at the end of the day, healthy Georgians are productive Georgians, and if we continue making policy choices that favor a lack of coverage or don’t do anything to improve coverage, and accessibility and affordability, then what we understand is going to happen is that we have a less healthy workforce, and ultimately that will lead to a less healthy Georgia economy,” Crawford said.
‘This is not a health care fight’
Greene stands out for her willingness to talk about the expiring health care subsidies. Her Georgia Republican colleagues have instead focused on ramping up pressure on Democrats to support the GOP spending plan. 
Georgia Republicans sent a letter to Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff this week demanding they “set aside partisan politics” and “join us in reopening the government.” They accused Senate Democrats of refusing to pass a “clean, continuing resolution” that the House has already approved and of holding Georgia families and farmers hostage.
Congressman Mike Collins. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Rep. Mike Collins, a U.S. Senate candidate speaking Tuesday at a Georgia Republican event in Cumming, insisted that the debate is “not about a health care fight” but solely about passing a “clean CR” to fund the government, arguing that if Democrats want to argue about health care, they can “bring that up on its own.”
“This is not a health care fight. That’s not where you have this fight. Right now, this is a funding bill. Simple,” he said.
Rep. Austin Scott said in a statement Thursday that “the Democrat argument to shut the government down over ACA subsidies is nothing more than an excuse,” and pointed to funding bills House Republicans passed in September that he argued would keep the government open until November while negotiations continue.
“They knew well over a month ago they were going to shut the government down to try and teach President Trump a lesson. The bottom line is they hate Trump more than they care about the American people,” Scott said.
‘We’re not bending the knee’
Democrats, meanwhile, are unified in blaming the Republican leadership for creating the crisis. Rep. Hank Johnson, led the Georgia Democratic delegation in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, urging him to call the House back to Washington “to engage in good-faith bipartisan efforts to address these issues.”
“Our constituents get up each morning and come to work. With Georgians’ health care on the line and government funding expired, they expect the same from the Members of Congress who represent them,” he wrote to Johnson.

Rep. Lucy McBath, speaking at a press conference in Atlanta Thursday, insisted the shutdown is “not a government shutdown of our making,” but because Republicans refuse to negotiate.
“We have wanted a bipartisan funding bill. We’ve been waiting, trying to get the Republicans to come to the table to negotiate, but they refuse. What they have given us is a take it or leave it,” McBath said.
McBath rejected the view that health care is a secondary issue in the government funding debate, a position some of her Republican colleagues, like Collins, have taken. She added that the issue is central to the nation’s economy, arguing that if people are not healthy, they cannot work, and “if they can’t work, they’re not a vital part of this economy.” 
She said Democrats are ready to “stand (their) ground.”
“I cannot predict how long this will last, but we have to stand our ground to make sure that we are doing everything that we can to give as much information and prepare people as to what is about to happen with the expiration of these tax credits. We’re not bending the knee, and we’re not kissing the ring,” she said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC0946-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

(Photo courtesy of OSF Healthcare) The federal government shutdown is forcing a reckoning for two remote health care programs because they automatically expired Oct. 1.
The telehealth and in-home hospital care programs were both temporary — but increasingly popular — options for Medicare recipients. They allowed doctors and hospitals to bill Medicare for telehealth appointments and in-home visits from nurses to provide care that is generally only available in hospitals.
The shutdown has prevented Congress from extending them.
More than 4 million Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth services in the first half of the year, according to Brown University’s Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research.
As of last fall, 366 hospitals had participated in the hospital-at-home program, serving 31,000 patients, according to a federal report. The program, officially called Acute Hospital Care at Home, allows patients who would otherwise be hospitalized to get inpatient care at home with a combination of nurse visits, monitoring equipment and remote doctor visits.
The programs have their roots in the pandemic, when doctors and hospitals wanted to keep patients safe from the risks of travel and hospital stays. Both are for Medicare recipients, generally people over 65 or who are disabled. But since many private insurers follow federal guidelines, some physicians have stopped booking telemedicine appointments for non-Medicare patients, rather than risk a change in insurance coverage.
Alexis Wynn, who is in her mid-30s and covered by private insurance through her employer, tried to switch an in-person doctor appointment in Pennsylvania to a video visit last week. The office told her that “all telemedicine is uncovered by insurance as of Oct. 1” — so she had to cancel the routine appointment.
“It was just a follow-up appointment  to make sure the dosing of my medication was still accurate, nothing that was pertinent to being face-to-face,” Wynn said. Her health insurance company later told her it still covered telehealth visits.
There have been other reports of insurers turning down non-Medicare telehealth appointments, said Alexis Apple, director of federal affairs for the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group.
“It’s a misunderstanding,” Apple said. “I’m not really sure what’s happening, but it’s unfortunate and very scary. There’s so much uncertainty out there now, and we see insurance payers start to pull back.”

Both telehealth and home hospital services can be a lifeline for older people, especially in rural areas, where residents may struggle to travel long distances for health care in person.
“In rural America, it’s often telemedicine or no medicine at all,” said Dr. David Newman, chief medical officer of virtual care at Sanford Health in South Dakota, in a September statement supporting congressional action to make Medicare telehealth permanent. Bipartisan bills that would have allowed telehealth to continue stalled in committee earlier this year in the Senate and House.
There’s an exception for telehealth rural residents — but only if they travel to a brick-and-mortar health care facility to get the remote health care service.
“The patients have to go to a clinic to receive that telehealth visit from a provider in a different location,” Apple said. “It kind of defeats the purpose.”
According to the Brown University report, California had the highest rate of Medicare telehealth usage in the first six months of this year, with 26% of beneficiaries using at least one telehealth appointment, followed by 23% in Massachusetts and 21% in Hawaii.
There’s no reason for non-Medicare insurers to stop covering any telehealth visits during the shutdown, and even most Medicare Advantage programs will continue to cover telehealth, according to Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, a health industry trade association.
Nevertheless, at least some health care centers are refusing to take new telehealth appointments or are converting existing ones to office visits.
“This is causing a lot of confusion. We are still working with our members who are insurers and providers to get a gauge on what folks are doing — because at this point reports we’ve seen seem to suggest it is company by company, provider by provider,” said Sean Brown, a spokesperson for the Health Leadership Council, representing CEOs of health care firms and insurers.
The hospital-at-home program serves a smaller number of patients but its pause has caused more disruption: The federal government required patients to be discharged from the program or transferred to a brick-and-mortar hospital by Oct.1.
The Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic had 30 patients in the program in Arizona, Florida and Wisconsin — all of whom either had to be released from the program or sent to brick-and-mortar hospitals. One of Mayo’s hospitals in Florida was already over capacity and had no room for transfers, according to reporting by Becker’s Hospital Review.
In Massachusetts, which requires commercial insurers to follow Medicare guidelines, all insured patients had to leave the program. Mass General Brigham, which operates many hospitals in the state, has rejiggered its plans to create more home care without relying on the hospital-at-home program, according to the Becker’s report.
Congress was unable to avert a shutdown by late September, and some individual providers and patients were caught unawares.
Nurses on social media discussed losing home-care jobs or being reassigned overnight when the hospital-at-home program closed Oct. 1. They worried about patients being taken away from children at home, or placed in hallway beds at overcrowded emergency rooms because of the abrupt change.
“Management scheduled a random call this morning with a super vague title. Then drop the bomb on us,” wrote one poster in Texas. “So no job. Perfect!”
In a direct message, the poster, who didn’t want their name used for fear of getting in trouble at their hospital, told Stateline, “This obviously wasn’t ideal for the patients. One of them had four children and now could no longer be home with them. Some didn’t even get to have a bed in the hospital because there were none available and had to stay in the ER in a hallway bed.”
Parkland Health System in Dallas started tapering off its hospital-at-home program in September because of the impending shutdown, and the last patients were discharged from the program by Sept. 30 without returning to the hospital, spokesperson Wendi Hawthorne said.
“We are hopeful that Congress will renew this innovative model of care in the future,” Hawthorne said.
Likewise, OSF Healthcare in Peoria, Illinois, had started to wind down its hospital-at-home program “to avoid needing to return multiple patients to a very crowded facility,” said Jennifer Junis, president of OSF OnCall, which handles home hospital care.
There were only three patients in the program Sept. 30, all of whom were ready to be discharged without returning to the hospital, Junis said. Since the program’s start in 2020, it has helped 980 patients with home care through OSF’s Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria.
“It is unfortunate that we will not be able to benefit by treating qualifying patients at home, where they are most comfortable and recover faster,” Junis said. “Our digital hospital program has allowed us to free up beds for our sickest patients who need them most.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-10 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Board of Ed: Lawmakers say which charter schools get funded,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/charter-schools-ct-danbury-middletown-state-board-of-education-legislature/,"Years ago, a charter school only needed approval from the CT Board of Education to begin operating. But in 2015, the legislature stepped in.","Members of the state Board of Education voted Wednesday to approve a ruling clarifying that they are not responsible for determining which charter schools are permitted to receive state funding. That responsibility falls to lawmakers.
The ruling counters a claim from supporters of two proposed charter schools — one in Middletown and one in Danbury — that, while the legislature appropriates money for charter schools, it should be up to the state board to select the schools that receive those funds. 
“The state board did its job [to approve the initial certification], and now to become a full-fledged charter school … it’s in the hands of the legislature,” said Mike McKeon, the attorney for the state Department of Education.
The decision followed two hours of public testimony during which community members from Danbury and Middletown, charter school leaders and students at Capital Preparatory Harbor School in Bridgeport pleaded with the board to allow Capital Prep Middletown and Danbury charter schools to open. 
In March 2023, the state Board of Education voted to grant an initial certificate of approval for Capital Preparatory Schools to open a charter school in Middletown, overriding the recommendations of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker, who wanted to give community members more time to submit comments to the board. But that June, the legislature decided abruptly to remove funding that it had allocated in the budget for the new charter school, leaving it without the necessary resources to open. The state has not provided any funding for the charter school since. 
Years ago, a charter school only needed approval from the state Board of Education to begin the process of opening. But in 2015, the legislature changed the law to require lawmakers to approve the school’s funding. 
Earlier this year, Capital Preparatory Schools submitted a “Petition for Declaratory Ruling,” asking the state Board of Education to outline clearly which body is responsible for allocating funding to specific charter schools. The Board of Education in May agreed to have the Department of Education look at the charter school funding process and issue a ruling. 
In the petition, Capital Preparatory Schools argued that while the state legislature is responsible for allocating funding to new charter schools in the budget, it should be up to the Board of Education to decide which charter schools receive the money. The organization argued that because Capital Prep Middletown’s application for an initial certificate of approval received the highest score of any charter school the board approved that year, the school deserved to be funded first with the money granted to any new charter schools.
But the Board of Education and the Department of Education disagreed with that argument. In a draft ruling, McKeon wrote that Capital Prep was “misreading” the law and ignoring past application of the law. The ruling noted that lawmakers had clearly chosen not to fund Capital Prep Middletown and that the Board of Education did not have the authority to grant the school funds. 
“Given the legislature’s clear rejection of Capital Prep’s application for charter-school status, and its unambiguous appropriation of funds to two different charter schools, it would have been patently illegal for the State Board or the CSDE to ignore the purpose for which the General Assembly appropriated these funds and apply them elsewhere,” the ruling reads. 
In April, the Danbury Charter School Planning Team and Elevate Charter Schools filed a petition for “party status” in the petition case. The Danbury Charter School for Excellence received an initial certificate of approval in 2018, but has never been funded. 
At the board meeting this Wednesday, Mark Sommaruga, an attorney with Pullman & Comley who is representing Capital Prep, said he believed the declaratory ruling may have been “prejudged,” based upon a January letter from Natalie Braswell, an attorney for Gov. Ned Lamont. In her letter, Braswell said the claim that the state Board of Education acted illegally by not appropriating funding for Capital Prep Middletown was “both baseless and concerning.” 
“In this instance, no funds were appropriated by the legislature for the Capital Preparatory Charter School Middletown. Therefore, any claim [that the Department of Education] is withholding funds unlawfully is categorically false. The law is unequivocal: without a legislative appropriation, SDE cannot and will not disburse funds,” Braswell wrote. 
Anita Ford Saunders, co-chair of the Capital Prep Middletown Planning Committee, said at this week’s meeting that students of color lagged behind white students in academic scores and college and career readiness across the state of Connecticut. 
“ When folks are saying that Middletown doesn’t need Capital Prep — what are you looking at? You’re not looking at the statistics,” she said. “ Give students of color the choice they deserve. Middletown is very different — we are not Bridgeport or Waterbury or Hartford where we have a lot of options. We have the neighborhood public schools.”
Saunders praised Capital Preparatory Schools, saying an overwhelming majority of Capital Prep Harbor School students are considered college or career ready, compared to a much lower proportion statewide. 
Laura Dunkley, a Middletown resident, said she wished that Capital Prep existed when her children were in school. 
“ There are teachers who look at students, in Middletown in particular, where they think [the students] can’t be what they want to be, they can’t succeed because of their color of their skin, whether they’re Hispanic or they’re Black, and that is not fair,” she told members of the board. 
Multiple students from Capital Preparatory Harbor School in Bridgeport, dressed in their school uniforms, lent support to the proposed school in Middletown. They talked about their academic successes, their pride in their school and the help they’d received in planning for the future.
Not everyone spoke in favor of the charter schools. Lisa Loomis-Davern, a former member of the Middletown Board of Education and current assistant principal at Kinsella Magnet School of Performing Arts in Hartford, told the Connecticut Mirror that she didn’t believe Capital Prep was the right fit for Middletown. She said that unlike in Bridgeport, where Capital Prep Harbor School enrolls only a small percentage of the total students in the district, a charter school in the much smaller district of Middletown would take a significant number of students out of the public schools — enough to force a school closure. 
According to their charter application, Capital Prep Middletown would gradually build up enrollment to a maximum of 910 students after 5 years in operation. The current Middletown Public Schools enrollment is about 4,400 students. 
Loomis-Davern, who previously taught at Capital Prep Magnet School in Hartford, said she was concerned that a charter school in Middletown would also draw teachers away from the small city’s public schools when the district is already short-staffed. She also questioned Capital Prep Harbor School’s enrollment practices, noting that it enrolls a lower percentage of students with disabilities and English-language learners than the rest of Bridgeport.
“ Definitely Middletown needs to do better by Black and brown students. Like every district, our public schools were not built to serve Black and brown students well. So I agree 100% that that is an issue. I just don’t think that a Capital Prep charter school is the answer,” she said.
In a statement, Scott Roberts, a spokesperson for Middletown Public Schools, said that the district’s “core mission” is “an unyielding commitment to cultivating the brilliance in each student.” He said school leaders strive to make sure that students feel that they belong. 
“Our community is dedicated to fostering a culture of respect so that every student is empowered to grow and achieve their fullest potential, inside and outside of the classroom,” Roberts said. 
Roberta Downer, president of the Middletown Federation of Teachers, which represents teachers in the district, said in written testimony to the board that the charter schools’ petition was aiming to “circumvent the democratic process.” 
“Middletown’s public schools serve every child who walks through our doors — regardless of background, ability, or circumstance. Our educators are stretched thin, our budgets are tight, and our students’ needs are growing. We cannot afford to divert public money to privately managed schools that serve only a fraction of our community,” Downer said. 
Ford Saunders, of the Capital Prep Middletown Planning Committee, took issue with Downer’s and Loomis-Davern’s claims. She said because of the way Connecticut funds school districts, state support for charter schools would not take money away from the public schools, which receive funding for pupils who attend “choice” schools like charter and magnet schools. She said Capital Prep students are chosen through a lottery system, which gives no indication of whether a student is an English-language learner or has a disability. She also said that charter schools are subject to stricter scrutiny than public schools, including a regular review of their operations and finances by the state Department of Education. In response to concerns about teachers leaving, she said that teachers would have the choice to work wherever they felt was best. 
Danbury 
Many people at Wednesday’s state Board of Education meeting also spoke in support of funding Danbury’s charter school.
Stephen Tracy, chair of the Danbury Charter School Planning Committee, said the proposed school had committed to paying teachers equal or better than those in the Danbury Public Schools, that it had a fully equipped facility and an International Baccalaureate curriculum. He said school leaders had asked the Danbury Public Schools to run the lottery that would pick their students. 
“What we’re facing here is the ideological stubbornness of a handful of politicians who can’t imagine families being able to go outside the established system to find the best school for their kids. That’s it,” said Tracy. 
Tomas Reyes, an Oxford resident and former member of the New Haven Board of Alders, questioned why Danbury was not allowed to open the charter school. 
“Danbury has been waiting seven years. Children don’t get those years back. Those years are gone. Their families don’t get them back, either,” he said.

Other Danbury residents complained that overcrowding in the local public schools was making it difficult for children to receive individual attention and support. Some said not having the charter school was particularly hard on immigrant families. 
Lucas Pimentel, chief executive of Latinos for Educational Advocacy and Diversity — which has been advocating for the charter school — said his own experience coming to Danbury as an immigrant at age 12 made clear what was lacking in the community. 
“I was in a high school of almost 4,000 students. Nobody knew who I was. I barely survived. I’m here by the grace of God,” he said. 
Pimentel said he worked as a teacher for 23 years in a charter school in Bridgeport, where he said he learned the value of teaching children in a small environment. He urged the board to take responsibility for getting the charter school funded. 
“These are your schools. Nobody else is approving the schools, managing the schools. This is your community,” he said. 
One Board of Education member, Seth Zimmerman, voted against the ruling, saying he felt there was “real ambiguity” in the law around what it meant to approve a charter school and who had that authority. According to a Department of Education estimate, five or six charter schools have been granted initial approval by the board but have not been funded. 
McKeon said that while he felt some of the concerns speakers raised at the meeting were strong, there was nothing that the state Board of Education could legally do beyond issuing the initial certificate of approval.
“They should be addressing the General Assembly. They should be addressing the legislature that they have elected, because it is only the legislature that can turn a charter school applicant into a charter school,” said McKeon.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1008_SR_MiddletownCharter_023-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-10 05:56:16.556752

(Getty Images)Every time an infectious disease makes the news, public trust in health systems is tested. But sometimes the threat isn’t the disease itself — it’s how we talk about it. That’s why publicizing “two positive tuberculosis tests” in a state of 1.4 million people is not just misleading; it’s irresponsible from a public health perspective.
Context matters
Tuberculosis (TB) is a well-understood, treatable, and closely monitored infection. In New Hampshire — as in every state — public health professionals conduct routine screening among certain populations, such as health-care workers, correctional staff, and people immigrating from regions where TB is more common. A small number of positive tests every year is normal, expected, and reflects the vigilance of the system — not a sign of an outbreak.
Announcing two positive tests without explaining that context distorts risk perception. It invites unnecessary fear and stigmatization of individuals and communities who may already face barriers to care. In a population of 1.4 million, two positive tests represent a rate of roughly one case per 700,000 people — statistically insignificant and far below national averages. Yet when stripped of that denominator, “two cases” can sound ominous.
The cost of alarmism
Public health communication relies on precision and proportion. Sensationalized reporting can have real-world consequences: it can erode confidence in health authorities, discourage people from seeking testing or treatment, and stigmatize those affected. Fear-based headlines don’t make people safer; they make people skeptical.
When media or officials highlight tiny numbers without context, they inadvertently suggest that surveillance systems are failing, when in fact those systems are functioning exactly as intended — detecting, treating, and preventing spread quietly and effectively.
What responsible communication looks like
A responsible public health message would emphasize that:

TB screening is routine and helps protect communities.
A few positive tests each year are expected and manageable.
No evidence suggests community transmission or elevated risk.
Prevention and treatment remain highly effective and accessible.

Clear, measured communication builds confidence that public health systems are doing their job. It reassures the public that experts are tracking the situation with vigilance, not panic.
The bottom line
The role of both journalism and public communication in health crises is to inform, not inflame. Announcing “two TB cases” as though it’s breaking news in a population of 1.4 million is like reporting a drizzle as a flood. It distracts from genuine threats, undermines trust, and sows confusion about what real public health risks look like.

Ohio […]","The use of telehealth for abortion care has continued to grow in the U.S., according to the latest #WeCount report, particularly since five states passed laws legally shielding providers who work with patients living in states with bans. (Warodom Changyencham/Getty Images)Two Ohio bills that may have effects on abortion medication and access were considered in separate Ohio House committees this week.
Opponents of a bill to further regulate medication that could include abortion drugs deeply criticized a study used by supporters of the measure, and argued about the unintended consequences held in the legislation.
Ohio State University epidemiology professor Dr. Alison Norris said a study on the safety of abortion drug mifepristone cited by supporters of the bill to prove the dangers of the drug was “deeply flawed,” causing concern about the types of evidence sources the bill would allow the Ohio Department of Health to use in determining drug risks.
The study counted the number of emergency room visits for any reason as part of the “adverse effects” of mifepristone, Norris said, leading to a conclusion that stands in contrast to “more than 100 peer-reviewed studies from over 25 years …that create a strong scientific evidence base to show mifepristone is safe.”
Citing other studies and data from the CDC, Norris said the risk of giving birth was 14 times more likely to result in death than having an abortion.
“The example of mifepristone regulation that proponent testimony offers shows how H.B. 324 could tie Ohioans’ medical care to misleading and poorly analyzed data,” Norris told the House Health Committee on Wednesday. “It could lead to a change in standard medical care that would harm Ohioans.”
The bill in question, House Bill 324, seeks to identify medications that have “severe adverse effects” in more than 5% of users. Data from the FDA, insurance claims and patient reports would be used by the state health department to determine the risk level of a prescription and over-the-counter drugs, particularly the risk of death, hospitalization from infection or hemorrhage, organ failure or sepsis, according to the bill.
Categorization of a drug as having severe adverse effects in more than 5% of users would require the drug to be given out only after an in-person exam and also would require a follow-up appointment be scheduled. This would limit the ability for Ohioans to use telehealth for certain medications.
Mifepristone is only one of many drugs that could be affected by the legislation, and not being able to prescribe drugs through telehealth could impact rural communities and older Ohioans as well as those looking for reproductive care, advocates at the committee hearing said.
“The bill’s extremely broad definitions could impact access to drugs such as Plavix, Wellbutrin, metformin, atorvastatin, amoxicillin and ibuprofen, to name a few,” said Lora Miller, director of governmental affairs and public relations for the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXPlavix is a medication used to prevent blood clots, Wellbutrin is an antidepressant, metformin is used in diabetes treatment, atorvastatin treats high cholesterol, amoxicillin is an antibiotic, and ibuprofen is a common over-the-counter pain reliever.
“Patients managing common conditions could face unnecessary costs and delays, especially those with limited insurance coverage,” Miller said.
Republicans on the committee sought to clarify the regulations in the bill, emphasizing that any medication under the 5% risk threshold wouldn’t be impacted. State Rep. Angela King, R-Celina, listed the specific adverse effects included in the bill after Miller named effects from drugs like amoxicillin and Wellbutrin, from vaginal hemorrhage to urinary tract infections. King made a point to note the bill mentioned hospitalization for infection, not just the infections themselves.
“Urinary tract infection can definitely put someone in the hospital,” Miller responded. “I can tell you that because it put me in the hospital.”
Miller said low-income patients will be particularly hard hit by the bill as written “by added visits, costs and travel requirements.”
“The bill unintentionally widens health disparities across Ohio communities,” she said. “The absence of any exceptions virtually ensures that existing barriers to care and medication access will be exacerbated.”
The legislation may be duplicative as well, according to opponents. Miller and Norris both said federal law and the FDA already dictate the risks of various drugs, and “very robust systems” of medical training, ethics codes and laws already in place exist to ensure “health care providers balance the risks versus the benefits of the medicines that they prescribe,” according to Norris.
“This law seems not necessary to me because it’s inviting an extra level of scrutiny, and because it has methodological problems deeply embedded in it,” Norris said.
 Medicaid funding
In another committee, supporters praised a bill that would eliminate state Medicaid funding to reproductive health clinics who provide abortions. Federal law already prohibits Medicaid funding from being used for abortion services, but religious and anti-abortion groups indicated that doesn’t go far enough in barring the indirect funding of abortion services.
Ohio Right to Life legislative director Katie DeLand began her testimony for House Bill 410 in the Ohio House Medicaid Committee by thanking the General Assembly for allocating $20 million to pregnancy resource centers in the most recent state operating budget. Pregnancy resource centers are largely religiously based centers who provide services such as ultrasounds and post-birth supplies like diapers.
Grants through the state that have gone to pregnancy resource centers specifically bar any funding from going to facilities who promote or conduct abortion services, and the centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, have been criticized for providing medically debunked information to discourage abortion to clients.
“House Bill 410 builds directly on this work, drawing a clear line: while Ohio will invest in prenatal and family resources, we will not finance abortion services that end a child’s life,” DeLand said.
The bill DeLand and others stood in support of this week seeks to keep state Medicaid funding from going to any facility that includes abortion services as part of their operations, even funding for things like “administrative overhead” or “referral activities.”
“Redirecting these funds away from abortion providers ensures that Ohio’s resources are invested in true health care and life-affirming services, like the pregnancy resource centers that received funding earlier this summer,” DeLand told the committee.
The Catholic Conference of Ohio also spoke in support of the bill, calling abortion “among the most, if not the most, contentious subjects of our times.”
“While the majority of Ohioans voted in a measure which amended the constitution to allow abortion, it is also essential to consider the consciences of the 1.6 million Ohioans who did not,” said Marsha Forshon, associate director of the CCO.
The pieces of legislation are two of several currently active in the Ohio General Assembly that cause pro-abortion rights advocates to once again question whether the legislature is respecting the 57% vote in 2023 that enshrined reproductive rights including abortion into the Ohio Constitution.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Much of the federal government has been closed for business since last week. 
A poll released last week indicates that many Americans are just tuning into a big part of what the fight’s about. But as they are, a huge majority believe insurance subsidies should be extended — including for 427,000 Ohioans.
The government shut down on Oct. 1 as the Republican majority in Congress couldn’t get enough votes to fund the government for another seven weeks. Senate Democrats are demanding several concessions on health care before they’ll support it.
An important one is making permanent tax credits for health insurance purchased on the individual markets created by the Affordable Care Act. Created in 2021, last year they provided an average annual subsidy of $705.
As part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Republicans this summer extended massive 2017 tax cuts that are heavily skewed in favor of the richest Americans.
But so far, they’ve been unwilling to consider extending the ACA tax credits, which are set to expire Dec. 31. Open enrollment begins Nov. 1, and health care experts are predicting that premiums will more than double for most of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance in the marketplaces. 
Already in Ohio, companies that offer products on the exchanges are requesting rate hikes as high as 40%.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Two days after the government shutdown, the health-analysis nonprofit KFF conducted a tracking poll regarding the insurance subsidies.
It found that most Americans were new to the issue, with 61% saying they knew only a little or nothing at all about it. 
But their preferences were clear when they were told what the fight was about: “As you may know, in 2021 Congress increased the financial help provided through tax credits available to some people with low and moderate incomes who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace to help them afford their premiums.”
Asked if they thought Congress should extend the credits or let them expire, a whopping 78% said they wanted to see them extended. That includes 82% of independents, 59% of Republicans and 57% of self-identified MAGA supporters.
Bipartisan majorities also said they would be “very concerned” to learn that expiration of the subsidies might make insurance unaffordable, or cause 4 million people to lose coverage altogether, or would harm small-business employees and self-employed Americans. If the number of uninsured Americans increases, so will the burden of uncompensated care on already-stressed rural and safety-net hospitals.
As often happens, there can be a disconnect between the policies Americans want and whether they want to pay for them. 
Asked, “If Congress extends these enhanced tax credits, how concerned would you be if you heard that it would require significant federal spending that would be largely paid for by taxpayers?”
Sixty three percent said they would be very or somewhat concerned at that prospect.

The question is how news media organizations and journalists respond. (Illustration by Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)During office hours last week, one of my University of Kansas journalism students asked a great question.
I am paraphrasing: “What do we do with all of these journalism companies bending to the Trump administration? It seems like it’s time to discard them and move on to something different.”
I understand his point. 
Over the past year, some news companies appear increasingly willing to obey President Donald Trump’s demands about reporting. 
Since Trump’s election, CBS News (Paramount) and ABC News (Disney) both settled lawsuits, not with the federal government, but with the president personally. These were defamation claims that many legal experts believed that the news outlets easily could have defended in court. Other lawsuits are in progress.
Caving to Trump felt like an unnecessary admission of guilt — if not supplication to his demands. 
Similarly, during the runup to the 2024 presidential election, the Washington Post backed away from its tradition of endorsing presidential candidates, an endorsement that was poised to go to Trump’s rival, Kamala Harris. Angry readers canceled their subscriptions and pilloried owner Jeff Bezos.
This perceived obedience creates tension for liberal readers. Stick with the relatively neutral legacy media that has recently wilted before Trump? Or spend your time with media that shares your defiant politics?
The answer is vital because Democratic readers are the most stable segment of the audience for journalism.
Polling by Gallup from 2001 to 2024 tracked the public’s distrust in the mass media, asking whether the news gets reported fully. During that time, the line of increasing distrust among Republicans has been steep.
Meanwhile, Democrats maintained high levels of trust in the media. For more than two decades, starting in 2001, Democratic distrust inched up and down between 5% and a high of 16% in 2015. 
With my students’ question serving as a canary in the coal mine, I worry that liberal frustrations with journalists will also soon rise. 
Most recently, publications quaked in their responses to the assassination of Charlie Kirk. I have spoken to journalists in Kansas, students and professionals, who worried about how coverage would be received. In some cases, those concerns nudged them to delay or hold off reporting stories. 
The audience for news — our readers and viewers — has noticed. 
Last week, a friend, sensing that the news feels different these days, asked me how journalists are processing all of this — and when they would find their courage again. This friend knows journalism, both as a loyal reader and the child of a longtime journalist. She pointed to legal firms that stood firm against demands from the Trump administration. 
In other words, readers sense journalistic fear. 
Since my first high school byline, I have worked in journalism for more than 30 years. No crisis — the Bush v. Gore coverage in 2000, the runup to the invasion of Iraq in 2004, the search for a cause for COVID-19 — measures up to the vertigo of this moment. 
The atmosphere about free expression among journalists has never felt so fraught. 
However, the instability has been a long time coming — not just for journalism, but for many American institutions. 
During his two administrations and two campaigns, Trump has been relentlessly effective at chipping away at institutions. 
Government agencies, from the EPA to the FBI, stagger forward, emaciated and maligned. Trump has also gutted cultural institutions and stuffed them full of his personal taste and henchmen. University life has been set on a knife edge. 
In the midst of these other major Trump-mandated changes, I understand that my focus on journalism looks like navel-gazing: yet another journalist fussing about the future of news. 
Yet, consider how Gallup’s polling gives urgency to this. Since 2015, when Trump entered the political arena, a wide swath of American institutions have suffered declining trust, but only by a few percentage points. Government institutions only slid 2 points (24% to 22%) and a combination of nine other institutions lost 4 points (37% to 33%). 
Television news and newspapers fell 8 percentage points, ending at an embarrassing 15% in 2024.  
I find this trend in journalism especially newsworthy because of the specific way that it has played out: as an attack from the right that, I predict, will soon trigger a backlash from the left.
Since his first presidential campaign, Trump has criticized journalists for being too liberal and for opposing him, a right-flank attack that convinced many conservative Americans that reporters cannot be trusted. 
In August, the Pew Research Center released polling that showed the depth of that mistrust among Republicans. When asked if most journalists are “biased,” 74% of respondents who identify as Republican or lean Republican said yes. A majority of those conservatives also see the media as “elitist” and “dishonest.”
Meanwhile, people who identify as Democrats or lean Democratic felt at least 26 percentage points more favorable in each of those categories. A slight majority of liberal respondents say most journalists are “intelligent,” “well-intentioned” and “relatable.” 
As Trump eroded conservative trust by painting journalists as too liberal, he has eroded trust among liberals by making journalists supplicant. 
The twin messages from the White House — journalists peddle fake news and we will make them too scared to be effective — are not just being heard by journalists. Both messages are being heard by our audience, from one political extreme to the other. 
Our conservative audience was first to downgrade their image of us, but I worry that independents and liberals will soon follow in greater numbers. 
In the media, commentators and columnists tsk-tsked Trump for years, worried about him burning down institutions and washing away norms. I admit that I was complacent, imagining the loss of a nameless ivory tower, rather than the profession that I love, the one where I essentially live. 
Ten years into Trump’s attack on journalism, journalists find ourselves dismissed by people at one end of the political extreme and at risk of losing the trust from the other.
Before the questioning student left my office, I asked him to consider if we can afford to discard robust journalism right now, at a time when other institutions are threatened. 
He paused and looked down. And then, he answered with a shrug, saying, “I guess, I don’t know.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.)Never forget that the Ohioan who is a heartbeat away from the presidency — and chomping at the bit to replace the aging, increasingly incoherent incumbent — said he makes things up to get attention. 
JD Vance, the former first-term Ohio senator who wheedled his way into the good graces of a convicted felon (he once called an “idiot”) to become vice-president, flat out declared his willingness “to create stories” last year while defending his false, racist rumors of Haitian immigrants abducting and eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. 
It was a remarkable confession from a craven opportunist who scarcely hid his power lust. 
Today Vance salivates over sitting behind the Resolute Desk and proves time and again that he will do and say whatever it takes to get there. 
Ohioans saw his politically expedient metamorphosis from anti-Trumper to bearded MAGA poser in his rocky U.S. Senate campaign. They watched Vance prostrate himself before a disgraced ex-president to snag an endorsement and pull off an improbable win.
His brief stint in the U.S. Senate was largely spent auditioning to be Trump’s presidential running mate with performative, made-for-Fox News theatrics and bookings. Vance won the part and the vice-presidency. 
That politicians lie is hardly news. But Vance does it pathologically, like his boss. Except the veep isn’t Trump. The Ohio politician doesn’t get a pass on lying or acting like a jerk. That’s reserved for the twice-impeached adjudicated fraudster and sexual abuser who famously bragged he could get away with anything and not lose any voters. 
Vance gets no such reprieve. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When he fumbles and fabricates with obvious untruths, the veep gets worldwide ridicule and even worse favorability ratings. 
Yet driven by ambition, Vance persists in repeating disproven claims, believing it will benefit his 2028 prospects rather than harm them. 
He may be right. 
Vance catapulted to the White House as Trump’s understudy despite the dehumanizing story he invented to terrorize lawful immigrant workers in his home state. 
He amplified all sorts of lies in the 2024 campaign, including false claims about a stolen election that wasn’t and Trump saving Obamacare which he tried to kill.  
Nevertheless, some in the MAGA camp still look askance at Vance’s transformation from Never-Trumper to Biggest-Trump-Fan-Ever. 
Authentic doesn’t describe the Silicon Valley venture capitalist-turned-MAGA grievance peddler. 
Little wonder Vance was tanking in the Republican primary race for the Ohio U.S. Senate seat until his billionaire pals came to the rescue with Trump’s blessing.
But the 41-year-old from Middletown, Ohio is a climber on his way to the top. 
He is a restless vice president who covets his boss’ job. 
Problem is Vance has neither Trump’s charisma nor entertainment chops — let alone his cult of personality. To be fair, it’s doubtful any red-tie wearing sycophant does. 
Yet from the moment Vance boarded Air Force Two, he began sharpening his skills set as a front man for the Trump regime who could effortlessly dispense spin on the daily with scant connection to reality. 
His list of whoppers have effectively erased any pretense that the prospective president-in-waiting is a straight shooter who can be trusted to tell the truth. 
But frankly, Vance forfeited the mantle of credibility when he confessed a penchant for inventing fairy tales as a means to an end. He admitted he was willing to manufacture stories that weren’t true to generate headlines that paid off politically.   
Everything Vance says must be weighed in the context of that admission.  He essentially copped to lying as a partisan ploy for publicity. 
 Last week the veep super-charged a lie so big and so brazen about the Republican government shutdown it was almost not worth addressing — save for the people who might be misled by the ploy to juice up media attention. 
It was a story created out of whole cloth that falsely tied the shutdown to Democrats’ alleged drive to give all immigrants health care. Pure fabrication. But Vance ran with it.
As the U.S. headed for a shutdown a week ago, the shameless Ohioan repeated what he must have known had no basis in fact: “Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens.”  
Vance and other Republicans continued to parrot the made-up claim even after it was factually refuted as fantasy. 
Nowhere in the Democrats’ proposal, which Republicans refused to negotiate, is there any demand to fund health care for people in the U.S. unlawfully — who have never been eligible federally funded Medicaid, Medicare, or Affordable Care Act tax credits. 
Democrats want Republicans to extend a temporary Biden-era program that lowered health insurance costs for more than 20 million Americans buying coverage through the ACA. 
They also want Republicans, who control the White House and Congress, to undo at least some of the dramatic Medicaid cuts the GOP enacted over the summer in Trump’s godawful bill. 
But Vance isn’t focused on the dire financial stakes facing low-to middle-income Ohioans or citizens across the country. He has stories to create and appearances to book.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)Death row inmate Roy Lee Ward was executed by lethal injection early Friday morning at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, marking the state’s second execution of 2025 and the third since resuming the death penalty after more than a decade-long hiatus.
Indiana Department of Correction officials said in a statement that “the execution process started shortly after” 12 a.m. Central Time and Ward, 53, was pronounced dead at 12:33 a.m. CT.
He was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County.
It remains unclear, however, when exactly the execution drug was administered, the amount of pentobarbital used, or who witnessed the execution.

“Early this morning, the execution of Roy Lee Ward was carried out, delivering accountability for the brutal rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne on April 16, 2001,” said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in an an early Friday statement. “Following his 2007 conviction and death sentence, Ward’s case was thoroughly reviewed, culminating in the Indiana Supreme Court setting his execution date and Governor Mike Braun rejecting his request for clemency.”
“Today, we honor Stacy Payne’s memory and bring long-awaited closure to her family and loved ones,” Rokita continued. “I extend my heartfelt thanks to our office’s appeals team, who dedicated thousands of hours and exceptional talent to upholding the jury’s verdict and ensuring the law was enforced. The Indiana Department of Correction carried out this sentence with utmost professionalism, reinforcing the state’s commitment to protecting our communities from violent predators. Let this stand as a resolute warning: those who commit such heinous crimes will face the full weight of justice.”
The Indiana Capital Chronicle was not invited to witness Ward’s execution. Ward’s defense team declined to provide specifics about the inmate’s witness list but said no media were present in the witness room.
“ … for years Roy has told me that if his execution would make Stacy’s family feel any better, that that is what he wants,”  Laura Volk, one of Ward’s lawyers, said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. 
“Initially, I saw a sad, broken man. I assume that was how he felt because of him coming to terms with what he had done to Stacy, her family and his family and friends,” she added. “Throughout the years, I have witnessed a transformation. He has become a person who is kind and generous to the people around him. Clearly in prison, a person’s ability to help others is severely limited. They have little and little is given to them. Through the years, Roy has taken what he has and given it to others. I have witnessed him help others in the small ways he can. It is a transformation that our society hopes to happen while one is incarcerated.  In the 25 years I have been doing this work, I can say Roy is a different person than when he went in.”
Ward’s execution came after years of legal appeals and recent, increased scrutiny over the state’s secrecy surrounding lethal injection drugs.
Gov. Mike Braun’s office has refused to disclose how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months, however.
At least one of those sets of pentobarbital was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. Any unused drugs will expire at the end of the month, according to new court documents.
The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
“Roy Lee Ward’s case has been heard and reviewed numerous times by both state and federal courts, including the Indiana Supreme Court, since his conviction in 2002. These reviews have never resulted in an overturned sentence,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “The State Parole Board issued a unanimous recommendation to deny Ward’s final appeal for clemency and that his execution proceed as scheduled. Today, Ward’s sentence has been carried out as ordered by the court.”
Ward’s final hours
Outside the prison Thursday night, a small group of anti-death penalty advocates gathered to read scriptures and pray. Among them were members of the Indiana Abolition Coalition and the Diocese of Gary.
Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, loaned to protestors the “Delaware Bell,” which the group has rung outside more than a dozen other executions.
The small, quiet protests have become a ritual at the Indiana State Prison, where clergy and activists have gathered before each of the past three executions to call for an end to capital punishment.
“Roy Ward can be held accountable and severely punished without executing him,” said Abraham Bonowitz, executive director of Death Penalty Action.

DOC officials said Ward’s last meal was from Texas Corral and consisted of: one hamburger, one steak melt, one order of French fries, one baked potato with butter, one order of twelve fried shrimp, one sweet potato, one order of chicken alfredo, and one order of breadsticks.
His last words were, “Brian is going to read them.”
The inmate’s lawyers withdrew the final two federal lawsuits that sought to delay his execution after reaching an agreement with DOC that “ensures compliance” with the state prison’s written execution protocol. The cases were officially dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on Thursday.
Ward did not pursue a last-ditch reprieve from the U.S. Supreme Court like previous Indiana death row inmates. The nation’s high court justices denied such efforts ahead of the state’s previous two executions.
Ward clemency hearing: Victim’s family asks for ‘no mercy,’ defense cites autism diagnosis, remorse

The Indiana Parole Board recommended against clemency last month, citing the “heinous” nature of Ward’s crime. Ward declined to be interviewed by the board, but his defense team’s testimony emphasized a recent autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and Ward’s expressions of remorse. 
Braun subsequently allowed the execution to proceed.
State law does not provide access for journalists to witness executions unless invited by the condemned person. A federal lawsuit challenging that restriction is still pending. The Indiana Capital Chronicle is a plaintiff in the case.
In December, the Capital Chronicle was the only news organization present when the state executed Joseph Corcoran, the first person put to death in Indiana in nearly 15 years. The Capital Chronicle was not invited for Benjamin Ritchie’s execution in May.
Witnesses at Ritchie’s execution reported seeing the inmate lurch violently against his restraints after the injection began. DOC officials denied those reports, however, and maintained that “the execution was completed according to protocol.” No members of the media were permitted to witness Ritchie’s execution.
The witness accounts were at the heart of multiple legal challenges and grievances filed by Ward in recent months. His legal team raised concerns about the state’s drug-handling procedures, including storage temperatures, the source and quality of pentobarbital, and whether the DOC followed its own internal directives during Ritchie’s execution.
A ‘heinous’ crime
First responders and relatives recounted the details of Payne’s final moments in emotional testimony before the Indiana Parole Board last month.
Deputy Attorney General Tyler Banks called Ward “a murderer, a rapist, a predator and a manipulator,” emphasizing that two separate juries had reached the same conclusion that his crime warranted death.

Witnesses told the board Ward entered the teenager’s home before her shift at Jenk’s Pizza. Ward proceeded to rape Payne and attack her with a dumbbell and knife. She was left with 18 blunt-force injuries, her throat and abdomen cut open.
Dale Town Marshal Matt Keller, the first officer on the scene, said he found Ward standing in the doorway with a knife in his hand and tried to reassure the wounded girl that help was coming. 
Paramedic Jane Stout testified she had “never seen anything this brutal,” recalling that Payne was conscious but unable to speak because of her injuries, tears in her eyes as she struggled to breathe.
Payne’s mother, Julie Wininger, told the parole board her family had endured “8,839 days of emotional devastation,” and that granting clemency “would tell the world that Stacy’s life didn’t matter.”
Her daughter — a highschooler on summer break — was an honor student, cheerleader, member of student council and active in her school’s band.
Ward’s attorneys countered that he had long struggled with mental illness and was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. They argued that his disability had affected how jurors perceived his remorse, noting that he once wrote he avoided saying “sorry” only because “it would sound fake and not be believed.”
Indiana’s execution process
Indiana resumed executions in 2024 after a nearly 15-year pause, following years of difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs after pharmaceutical companies — under growing scrutiny — refused to sell their products for use in executions.
But state officials have refused to reveal where the state obtains its pentobarbital, citing a 2017 secrecy statute that shields the identity of suppliers.
Lethal injection is the only method permitted by state law. Indiana’s current single-drug protocol calls for an intravenous dose of pentobarbital, a fast-acting barbiturate.
It’s unlikely that any additional executions will be carried out at the state prison this year.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four have been deemed competent to be executed. In order for a capital punishment to be carried out, the state must request and be granted an execution date from the state supreme court — a process that can take weeks or months.

(Photo courtesy Charm City Care ConnectionBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) on Thursday announced an upcoming grant program for opioid reduction efforts, an announcement that came on the heels of the city’s third mass overdose event in recent months.
Scott said he hopes the new grants, funded with money from the settlements of lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, can help prevent future mass overdose events and provide individuals struggling with addiction easier access to resources.
“This is not the first overdose incident we’ve seen at Penn North in recent months and we continue to do everything that we can to support our residents.” Scott said Thursday during a virtual briefing of the grant program.
“We know we have work to do, but we have never been in a better position to end this crisis,” he said. “We have the will. We have the people. And most importantly now, we have the funding.”
Scott’s comments came as he was announcing an upcoming opportunity for community organizations and support services to receive grants to help combat drug overdoses in the city. Through community grants under the Opioid Restitution Fund, organizations can compete for up to $500,000 in funding, depending on their project proposals.
The total grant funding allocated for fiscal 2026 is $2 million, a fraction of the $579.9 million that Baltimore has received through court settlements.
Baltimore lays out plan to distribute millions in settlement funding from opioid lawsuits

In 2018, the city opted out of national legal challenges of pharmaceutical companies for their role in the opioid epidemic, choosing to pursue its own lawsuit instead. It was a risky move but it paid off: The more than half a billion the city has raked in in settlements is far above what it would have received as part of a larger group.
Last year, Scott issued an executive order creating the Opioid Restitution Fund, which helps direct the settlement payments to combat opioid and overdoses in the city over the next 15 years. The $2 million offered in the upcoming grant program is just one part of a larger system of opioid reduction efforts that the city will be taking through those settlement funds.
“While there is no simple solution to solve this crisis overnight, we will continue to push to save every life that we can,” Scott said.
The city will launch a grant application portal Oct. 23, with information for organizations interested in applying for a grant, which would not be distributed until the next calendar year.
The grant program will focus on three areas for overdose response:

Programs aiming to increase access to mobile overdose treatment services could receive up to $500,000 in grant funds.
Organizations focused on harm-reduction could get up to $250,000. Such efforts include increased distribution of the opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone, clean-syringe services and wound care, among others.
The grant program will also apply to more general social support services. Organizations focused on providing access to housing, food assistance, education and employment could get up to $50,000 in grant funding from the program.

The request for proposals officially opens Oct. 23. “This RFP is about investing back into the neighborhoods that have been the hardest-hit by the opioid crisis and keeping the priorities and needs of Baltimore City residents front and center,” Scott said Thursday.
He added that investigations on the Wednesday overdose incident are ongoing. In that incident, 11 nonfatal overdoses occurred near the Penn North neighborhood, with seven people hospitalized and four people declined transport, according to news reports.
Baltimore crime, homicide drops overshadowed by fear of federal actions hindering gains

Wednesday’s incident followed dozens more overdoses that occurred this summer. On July 10, a mass overdose sent 27 people to the hospital for treatment. A week later, five more people were hospitalized after an overdose.
Sara Whaley, executive director of overdose response for the city, said that she hopes the grants from the opioid settlement fund support programs that help prevent more mass overdoses.
“In light of the overdoses yesterday and the mass overdose events in July, we know just how critical this work is to saving lives,” she said.
“Mobile services can go where they are needed because they are not tied to brick and mortar,” she said. “Having more of these types of programs that can go throughout the city and go to areas or be responsive to things like a mass overdose event, to bring services directly where they are needed – I think that allows us a lot of flexibility.”
She stressed that the mobile services will also help smaller or individual overdoses. She said that city officials focused on opioid reduction were already interested in boosting mobile services before the mass overdose incidents this year.
“Mobile services are one option,” Whaley said. “That in addition to naloxone distribution. Other things, like drug-checking programs, drug-testing supplies, would care and things like that … can also help facilitate connections to treatment or other supportive services.”

(Courtesy of Omaha Public Power District)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers sued the Omaha Public Power District on Thursday, seeking to stop a plan to retire three of five power-producing units at the utility’s North Omaha Station and switch the other two coal-fired units to natural gas. 
The 46-page lawsuit, filed in Douglas County District Court, seeks to stop the changes planned for the North Omaha Station, as well as prevent OPPD from pursuing any policy that prioritizes considerations other than price or reliability, including “environmental justice.” Residents had fought to get OPPD to modify the plant, citing health concerns. 
Hilgers said data doesn’t support the assertion that the plant harms neighbors’ health. 
In a midday announcement, he said he wants to focus the publicly owned utility on what he says state law requires: reliability and affordability. He said OPPD’s plan for the North Omaha plant would retire 240 megawatts of electricity production as OPPD sees skyrocketing increases in demand. Though the local power district’s plan says moving forward is contingent on opening new power-generation facilities this year, Hilgers said the changes wouldn’t add power capacity and would only help OPPD “tread water.”
“We should not be taking one electron off the grid,” Hilgers said.

OPPD declined to comment because of pending litigation. Multiple board members could not be reached for comment.
Targeted in the lawsuit are OPPD, its CEO and president and six of eight elected OPPD directors. It was not immediately clear why board members John Hudson and Michael Cavanaugh are not named in the lawsuit. One of the elected members, Sara Howard, served with Hilgers in the Legislature, where she chaired the  Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee.
North Omaha State Sens. Ashlei Spivey and Terrell McKinney said they adamantly disagree with Hilgers’ decision. Both said energy rates might rise, partly due to unregulated data centers requiring more power or other power demands, but not because of the North Omaha Station plan.
Spivey, a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, called the lawsuit a “witch hunt” she said is meant to “strong-arm” OPPD into following state leaders’ political whims.
“We have seen the AG’s Office do that a number of times on a number of divisive political issues,” Spivey said. “It’s a waste of taxpayer dollars.”
‘Delays are at an end’
In 2014 and 2016, OPPD directors agreed to a plan that, by 2023, OPPD would retire the three North Omaha units in operation since the 1950s and switch the other two in operation since the 1960s from coal to natural gas. The oldest three units switched to natural gas in 2016.

The plan was delayed in 2022 and then made contingent upon the construction of two new power-producing stations: Standing Bear Lake and Turtle Creek. Combined, OPPD has said those facilities would produce 600 megawatts, more than all of the units operating now in North Omaha.
The timing could be tied to OPPD, which appears ready to move forward with the North Omaha Station plan during a “procedural” meeting next week, Spivey said.
Hilgers, too, said he feels “the delays are at an end” and that’s part of why the lawsuit came now. He said it takes a lot of work to decommission power plants, a process he said is also hard to unwind.
Supply and demand
Part of the AG’s concern comes as OPPD hopes to achieve a greener-energy goal of “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, a plan the utility board approved in 2019. OPPD leaders are balancing the desire to meet that goal, which was set when demand for electricity was fairly flat, with rapid recent increases in consumer demand for power. 
“Ultimately, it is a supply and demand issue,” Hilgers said. “It would defy reality and economics to suggest that taking 200-plus megawatts offline, given this demand environment we’re in, will do anything other than increase the cost to [OPPD] ratepayers.”
On health concerns, Hilgers said he checked the air quality in North Omaha on his phone just hours before his afternoon event. The quality was at 29, he said, on a metric that considers any number under 50 “great.” He said he’s not dismissing air quality as a concern, nor is he saying local control doesn’t matter.

However, Hilgers argued that taking energy production offline would undermine the utility’s key legal guideposts of affordability and reliability. He argued OPPD directors elevated “environmental justice” as equally or more important in violation of a 1963 Nebraska law that the state “provide for dependable electric service at the lowest practical cost.”
Nebraska is the only state with exclusively publicly owned utilities providing power.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen was among those praising Hilgers on Thursday, calling it “foolish” for any power district to avoid coal, a resource he called “the single most affordable means of energy production known to mankind.” He pointed to coal reserves in neighboring Wyoming as a plus and said coal production is cleaner today than before, with “science is on our side.”
“Foreign adversaries have sped up their own coal production, most notably China and Russia,” Pillen said in a statement. “It is unfathomable why we would take any action that would slow or stop our own expansion of coal-driven energy.”
OPPD serves about 1 million Nebraskans, Hilgers said, in a service area that spans 13 eastern Nebraska counties, including much of the Omaha area.
‘Stop acting like a dictator’
The two North Omaha state senators said they see a different health reality on the ground, including on Wednesday, when they hosted a town hall with OPPD Director Eric Williams, whose district includes North Omaha. Most questions were for Williams and sought more information about the North Omaha plant transition, Spivey said.

McKinney said his constituents have faced respiratory problems, with Spivey noting her oldest son has asthma and that the concerns impact whether her constituents can achieve the “good life.” McKinney said a daycare owner close to the power plant annually cleans residue left behind, and McKinney argued state leaders “only care about dollars and cents.”
“It’s time for Hilgers to stop acting like a dictator and let our public power utilities do their job: providing affordable, reliable and clean energy for the people who actually own it,” McKinney said.
McKinney said that to say coal isn’t harmful is “ignorant, to say the least.” McKinney said that if Hilgers is focused on affordability and reliability, “he should build a coal plant in his backyard and let it burn on his property and see how he feels.”
Hilgers said there are “plenty of avenues” for the public to work with OPPD and find solutions without shutting down an “enormous amount of power.” Spivey said the community has already worked with OPPD for the solution at hand.
‘True cost’ of ‘net-zero?’
Part of Hilgers’ lawsuit relies upon and cites information gathered this summer and fall as part of Legislative Resolution 234, an interim study from freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City and 19 other lawmakers into the “true cost” of “net-zero” carbon emissions plans.
Storm could not be reached for comment Thursday.

The Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee hosted a Sept. 5 hearing on Storm’s LR 234, in which State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln accused Storm and his cosponsors — including five of Conrad’s fellow committee members — of each being a “climate denier or a climate skeptic.”
Storm told Conrad he knows the climate is constantly changing and that his resolution was about keeping power affordable and maintaining jobs and the community. He wanted an “off-ramp” for consumers. His resolution could hint at legislation for the 2026 legislative session.
“I’m all for green energy, if it can stay affordable, reliable and doesn’t sacrifice Nebraska jobs,” Storm told Conrad.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, the Natural Resources Committee chair who was among those signing onto Storm’s resolution, reached out to OPPD and three other utilities in July in preparation for LR 234. Brandt specifically asked OPPD about its North Omaha plans.

OPPD CEO and President Javier Fernandez told Brandt that while OPPD’s system is forecasted to be reliable under federal and regional regulations, “it is reasonable to say the system would have more margin and better reliability/resiliency had the assets [at North Omaha Station] remained in service with applicable maintenance and life extension work.”
One of the tables Fernandez provided Brandt suggests, based on current OPPD plans, that the agency could hit a wall by 2028 and have consumer demand outpace supply. This includes plans by 2029 to bring on 900 new megawatts in natural gas production. Fernandez indicated OPPD is looking to address the “unprecedented load growth” but faces execution and timing challenges with permitting, supply chains, workforce availability and regulatory approvals.
Hilgers, echoing those challenges, said there is a “world of difference” between planning and what actually will happen with any additional new plants or contracted power coming online.
‘Not in the best interests’
The lawsuit posits that maintaining the status quo in North Omaha could reduce or stabilize OPPD consumer rates for power even as demand increases.
In response to another Brandt question as part of the interim study, Fernandez said delaying the plans by five years could net savings of $36 million with potential revenue growth, or $439 million if delayed by 15 years. He testified in September that keeping the status quo would make for better affordability and enable economic growth for consumers, though “slower progress” toward “net-zero.”

In an Oct. 1 email on additional questions from Storm, Fernandez said the North Omaha Station plan was “primarily based on environmental considerations.”
Brandt repeated that he is unaware of any study or data showing health concerns because of the North Omaha energy production. Fernandez told Storm he had no scientific evidence to the same and that emissions are strictly regulated at the state and federal levels.
While Pillen defended coal production, Hilgers said he might be more open to an alternative, such as moving all of the North Omaha units to natural gas but keeping all five operational. Hilgers said he hopes OPPD comes to the table and that he is open to ideas and a possible settlement.
Brandt, reached Thursday, said: “In a time when the state needs all the generation it can possibly get, it is not in the best interests of the utilities and the state to shut down generation.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST. PETERSBURG — Last Saturday morning in South St. Petersburg’s Wildwood Park, 16 members of a group calling itself “Dump Duke” gathered to share strategy before pairing up to canvass in nearby neighborhoods.
They were there to inform residents and ratepayers frustrated about the prices and services provided by Duke Energy that they could do something about it by signing a petition.
The signature drive was part of a grassroots effort to demonstrate to the City of St. Petersburg legitimate interest within the community to seriously explore jettisoning Duke — their longtime energy provider — when the 30-year franchise agreement between the two parties expires next summer.
“It’s one of the easiest things to canvas for,” said Dump Duke organizer Marley Price, comparing it to her experience knocking on doors last year for an unsuccessful candidate for St. Pete City Council.
“With Duke, everyone knows them. Most people have had a bad experience with them, so it’s really to relate that back and tell them something new — that it doesn’t have to be that way.”
Those and earlier efforts have spurred several members of the City Council to take up the idea. The board voted, 5-3, in August to call on Mayor Ken Welch to seek bids for a feasibility study evaluating the pros and cons of leaving Duke and forming a municipal utility, something that 33 other communities now operate in Florida.
Consultant study
That early vote came as Pinellas County’s next largest city — Clearwater — has received its own, long-anticipated feasibility study prepared by NewGen Strategies & Solutions about what would happen if that city ended its relationship with Duke Energy, whose franchise agreement expires at the end of this year.
Projecting a 30-year period beginning in 2026, the report concluded that if the city dropped Duke Energy, its effective rates over the next five years would end up approximately 7% lower on average than the Duke rate on an annualized basis. After that, the effective rate would run approximately 18% lower on average than the Duke rate for the remainder of the 30-year period.
The study values the cost of acquiring Duke property at $572 million but also notes that the real cost of Duke’s assets could run between 50% lower or 100% higher than its estimate — meaning around $1 billion. That was the estimate offered by an outside energy consultant hired by Duke Energy of Clearwater’s costs.
In Florida, 54 utilities provide electricity to residents. They include the big four investor-owned providers — Duke Energy Florida, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities, and Tampa Electric Co. (TECO). Those four serve approximately 75% of the state’s population, with the remaining 25% provided by 33 municipal electric utilities and 16 rural electric cooperatives, according to the Florida Municipal Electric Association.
While it would be convenient if an investor-owned utility sold its private assets to a public entity, it never works that way. If Clearwater municipalizes its electric utility, it would have to go the eminent domain route — by far the most expensive option, as Duke officials have been explicit in stressing that they have no intention of selling their system.
“We know it’s going to be a fight and it’s going to take time,” said Clearwater City Council member David Albritton after the board approved the study. “It’s a risk. We all know that. But it could be a lower rate.”
The NextGen study is loaded with caveats, however, including an explicit statement that “there can be no guarantee that Clearwater … will achieve cost savings.”
Winter Park’s success
Some of Florida’s largest communities, such as Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, have run their own municipal utilities for decades, but not a single one has launched since Winter Park, a northern suburb of Orlando, did so in 2005. That took place following a referendum approved by 69% of the electorate in 2003.
Randy Knight, city manager for Winter Park, described recently on the Florida City and County Management Association podcast how its municipal utility has buried 80% of its power lines underground over the past 20 years, which “has been just huge in reliability … and not having storm outages at all has been fantastic.”
“In this last storm, we had 271 customers out of power after the hurricane came through, and had all of that restored in 12 hours,” he said (the Winter Park municipality serves approximately 15,000 customers). “None of those outages were in the underground part of the system … . It was a testament to what we were doing was the right thing and, you know, the community loves that.”
“As of May, our rates were 32% lower than Duke Energy’s and 2% lower than the statewide average for municipal utilities,” Knight added to WKMG television in August.
Nationally, the last local community to form its own electric utility was the Jefferson County Public Utility District in Washington state in 2013.
Boulder’s decade-long experiment 
There is no greater example of how hard it can be to break away from an investor-owned utility than what happened in Boulder, Colorado, which spent nearly a decade trying to break away from Xcel Energy. That effort ended in 2020 when voters approved a settlement with Xcel to trigger the reinstatement of a franchise agreement abandoned a decade earlier.

“Be rational,” suggests former Boulder City Council member Bob Yates, when asked what words of advice he would give Clearwater and St. Petersburg council members who support municipalization efforts. “Be objective and clear-eyed about your evaluation, not only of your goals and objectives, but also how long it will take and how much it will cost.”
In the case of Boulder, taxpayers approved $29 million for the losing effort. Yates says that when investor-owned utilities decide to fight, they won’t give up easily.
Boulder residents pushed the local government to separate from Xcel because of frustration with the lack of urgency the power company expended in pursuing electricity from green power sources like wind and solar.
Yates, who served on the Boulder City Council from 2015 to 2023, said that while he personally never supported the effort, he wishes Pinellas County lawmakers the best of luck. “I don’t think it was a good use of time or money, but the situation may be very different in Florida, so I wouldn’t want to presume to tell the good folks of Florida how to handle their affairs,” he said.
Ursula Schryver is senior vice president for education, training, and events for the American Public Power Association, a D.C. trade group representing the nation’s 2,000 public power utilities. While there is a sense of urgency with the impending end of the franchise agreements in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, it’s generally “a long process and requires a lot of commitment on the part of the community and leadership and so forth,” she said.

The end of a franchise agreement doesn’t mean the end of service
St. Petersburg Mayor Welch, who at one point in his career worked as an accountant with the old Florida Power Corp., has suggested establishing a new 10-year agreement with Duke next year to ensure that residents could rely on “stable and dependable services” as the future of energy in the city is debated. But Schryver says that rather than signing a shorter franchise agreement, “now’s the time” for the city to begin negotiating its wants and needs.
“They have to continue serving the community — Duke or whomever the incumbent is has to continue to serve the community, even without a franchise agreement,” she said. “I would suggest negotiating and continuing to look at the option of forming a public power utility without signing that franchise agreement vs. signing a five-year one and then you’re going to be in the same place that you’re in now, five years down the line.”
That’s what the city of Tampa did during the aughts. After its 20-year franchise agreement with TECO expired in 2006, the city spent two years negotiating with the utility before signing a new 25-year agreement in 2008.
St. Petersburg City Council member Richie Floyd says the fact that the city’s franchise agreement is scheduled to end next year gives the city “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to look into the city’s options.”
“It’s not a radical idea or anything, although I think it’s an important one,” he said.
St. Petersburg City Council member Brandi Gabbard is also enthusiastic about pursuing municipal power.
“What the residents are asking of us is for us to really be able to control costs and to be able to give them a level of service that they are demanding, and so I think that we need to listen to our residents,” she said. “We need to explore it. I’ve been very honest with residents that I don’t have a crystal ball. I don’t know what the future holds.”
Gabbard expressed dissatisfaction that the city hadn’t as of early October even set a timeline for sending out the request for proposals for a consultant study. “There’s no guarantees that this is actually going to come to fruition, but for us to drag our feet and not respond the way that residents are asking us to, I think is doing a disservice.”
Orlando Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani argues that having a local utility through which residents can exercise direct influence “is always preferable to relying on the Public Service Commission as your advocate.”
“Most constituents don’t even know the Public Service Commission exists, but having a local utility board that you can present to, engage with, and really influence leads to better consumer experiences,” she said.
After the Clearwater City Council voted to begin a formal reappraisal of Duke’s distribution system, Duke said in a written statement that creating a city-owned electric utility would be “enormously expensive, risky, and take years to complete.”
“As we have said before, our system is not for sale. That position has not changed. Duke Energy remains committed to serving our Clearwater and St. Petersburg customers, and we look forward to working with both cities on the best path forward — which we believe is renewing the franchise agreement.”
Facebook ad from the Edison Institute
Pinellas County residents are also being hit by social media ads from “We Stand for Energy,” a campaign created by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), calling on them to “Tell the Council: Don’t Waste Taxpayer Money” by pursuing municipalizing.
“As feasibility studies consistently show, municipalization efforts threaten to increase customer costs by billions of dollars without improving service,” said an EEI spokesperson when asked about the campaign. He declined to respond to a question about how much EEI was investing in the effort.
Meanwhile, Dump Duke advocates say they’re not relenting, although Price concedes it’s discouraging that Mayor Welch has declined to meet with the group.
“Hopefully, there will still be enough public pressure still that they have to do something,” she said.
Saturday, as Dump Duke advocate Jason Scott began knocking on doors in South St. Petersburg, he met a man who said that he used to work for Duke as a lineman but now works across the bay for Tampa Electric.
“What’s your opinion of Duke?” Scott asked him.
“It’s a good company to work for, but I understand that a lot of residents were complaining about high bills and stuff,” the man, who did not want to be identified, responded. “I do understand why.”
When Scott asked him about the cost of his monthly bill, the man quickly jumped in.
“Of course I want cheaper bills, but at the same time that Duke kind of monopolizes everything. I don’t see a way to get out of the situation without it being more expensive.”
Nevertheless, he ended up signing Scott’s petition.

FTC data shows that our state is on pace to exceed last year’s numbers—both in terms of the number of cases and total losses.
Here at the Southern Connecticut Black Chamber of Commerce, some of our business members have been affected by these scams. Whether it is fake invoices, imposter scams from utility companies, phishing scams, or more, the number and type of scams are only growing. Recent reports have even shown that scammers may be targeting elected officials across Washington, D.C., using artificial intelligence to impersonate famous voices.
These scams start on various platforms, including emails, phone calls, or text messages. And the scammers will use any medium possible to steal funds, whether it be cash, retirement accounts, or untraceable cryptocurrency.
Complicating matters further is the fact that most of these scams are not originating stateside. Many are being run by criminal organizations operating beyond our borders, predominantly from Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar. The kicker? Sometimes the scammers are victims themselves, having been trafficked and forced to scam unassuming Americans.

FTC data showing more than $30 million in cyber fraud losses to Connecticut consumers in 2024. 
In the wake of this rise in cyberfraud and scams, warnings from the FBI and State Attorney General William Tong have all made clear that if a number or email you don’t recognize is attempting to contact you, don’t engage.
Education can help give individuals and businesses the tools they need to protect themselves, but unfortunately, it is not enough to keep Americans safe.
Focusing only on technology is also not enough. Last year, some in Washington proposed new regulations on peer-to-peer payment platforms as a way to stop scams. While well-intentioned, these new regulations would have placed new burdens on users of the platforms and let crooks off the hook.
Truly protecting Americans will require a more comprehensive approach.
Fortunately, it appears that Congress recognizes this and is exploring ways to better protect Americans.
In the Senate, a bipartisan bill called the TRAPS Act was recently introduced. The measure, which would create a cross-departmental task force to study the fraud landscape and recommend legislative and regulatory changes, is a step in the right direction. By bringing together public and private stakeholders that are working on these issues daily, the measure recognizes the complexity of fraud and scams and the need to evolve our thinking on how to approach them.
But there are still more steps that Connecticut’s leaders in Washington can take to help protect residents.
Congress can support increased resources for all levels of law enforcement to find and remove scammers from the ecosystem. Leaders can also look abroad at solutions that have worked elsewhere, like the National Anti-Scam Center in Australia or Canada’s anti-spam legislation.
And lastly, our leaders must increase international pressure to shut down foreign scam centers. So long as these centers continue to operate, Americans will be at risk. The only way to eliminate this threat is to root it out at the source, and that begins with criminals.
Education is good, but there is more to do. Our Congressional leaders in Washington must lead the way in stopping this growing threat. The TRAPS Act, better resources for law enforcement, and more international cooperation are all part of a comprehensive strategy that will protect Americans online.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-10 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Teens are talking to AI. It’s time for us to learn,Farrell Lindemann,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/10/teens-are-talking-to-ai-its-time-for-us-to-learn/,"If a chatbot is the first place a teen feels heard, let’s make sure it’s not the last.","“I’m going to tell you something I’ve only ever told AI.”
This summer, as I met one-on-one with girls at Camp LiveGirl, I heard this phrase again and again. Concerned and curious, I immediately began to research this phenomenon.
Here’s what I found: 70% of teens are using generative AI, and about one in three teenshave used AI companions for social interaction and companionship.
These numbers come from a report recently published by Common Sense Media, and while the teens’ use of AI might feel alarming, panic or shame are not the answer. It’s clear that teens will explore these spaces, with or without us. There’s insight here if we pause to listen. This piece unpacks the trend, and ends with concrete guidance for parents who want to support their kids. We need to approach the phenomenon of the AI chatbot with curiosity, education, and connection.
Why AI?
As adults, we recognize developmental milestones for children like rolling over, walking, or talking. But for adolescents, milestones look more like independence, identity, and connecting with peers. Learning new social skills and going through puberty requires some trial and error, and a lot of awkwardness. It’s their job!
For an adolescent, AI can feel like a cheat code for working through the feelings that come with these development tasks. An AI chatbot becomes a low-stakes space to confess, have easy conversation, or ask for advice. The numbers back this up- 14% say they turn to AI chatbots because they “don’t judge.”
But while technology can be helpful in the moment, it cannot replace the human connection that drives real emotional development. Only about 39% of teens report applying skills they practice with AI to real-life situations. While a chatbot can listen instantly, it cannot teach social skills and provide the warmth of human empathy.
Feedback requiredWith AI, there is no real feedback. AI chatbots are sycophants. They are designed to validate, not to challenge. This is a point that many of my savvy students had already picked up on in their AI chats. In human conversation, body language and verbal communication provide dynamic feedback. This helps adolescents learn social skills and create a good decision-making system. In a conversation with AI, where there are only affirmations and validation, advice can go in a dangerous direction.
Privacy risksTeens also need to understand the privacy risks of treating AI like a therapist. Unlike a private journal, conversations with chatbots are stored by the companies that own them and, in some cases, may be reviewed by staff, or disclosed through legal processes. “Confessions” typed late at night don’t disappear into the void —they live on servers owned by corporations. That means when teens pour their hearts into AI, they’re handing over their most vulnerable thoughts to a system that was never designed to protect them the way a trusted human adult can.
The human superpower teens still needParents, teachers, and mentors can use this moment not just to educate teens about AI, but to open the door to deeper conversations. However, 49% of parents say they have not talked to their teens about generative AI. We should teach AI literacy the same way we teach media literacy. In order to create a safe human environment for our teens’ emotions, we must create a place where they can talk about their AI use, and learn about the impact, without shame.
After talking about AI, a parent could ask, “When you’re feeling down, who do you feel safe talking to?” “What helps you feel safe to share with me or your friends?” The goal is to create a space with trusted adults in their life where they can share the same confessions, questions, and bids for connection they felt safe sharing with AI.
When your teen comes to you with a big topic or asks a taboo question, respond with curiosity instead of judgment. The love you have for your child is the human superpower no chatbot can ever replace.
If AI is the first step, let humans be the nextTeens will keep experimenting with AI. The question isn’t whether to ban it, it’s whether we can respond by providing them with trusted adults in their life who can educate and support them. As they grow through all the changes of adolescence, let us surround them with human feedback, privacy, and loving connection.
What can you do? In addition to starting conversations with your teens around AI, you can introduce your daughter to a program like SHE CARES, where she can connect to a personal mentor. Through LiveGirl’s SHE CARES mentoring program, girls in middle school through college are paired with trained adults who listen without judgment and provide steady, supportive guidance. The program is entirely virtual and free, ensuring that every young woman has access to a safe human connection when she needs it most.
And here’s the good news: when young people have a trusted adult in their corner, the impact is profound. Let’s continue to provide them with nonjudgmental adults in schools, at home, and in our communities.
If a chatbot is the first place a teen feels heard, let’s make sure it’s not the last.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A Prince George’s County Council committee advanced the nomination Thursday of Samuel Moki to be lead the county’s Department of the Environment, largely brushing aside concerns that he had been terminated from a job at the agency about a decade ago.
The 3-1 vote, with one abstention, by the council’s Transportation, Infrastructure, Energy and Environment Committee, came after about three hours of passionate testimony from supporters, including a host of current department employees who said Moki has been a capable and personable leader in several months as acting director.
While a number of community and environmental advocates testified against the nomination, citing Moki’s checkered past as a former associate director at the department, the majority of committee members did not appear convinced that his past termination should disqualify him.
A few expressed concern that Moki might have taken the fall for larger problems with stormwater management at the agency during the 2010s when he was let go.
“The way I see it, there was some scapegoating that happened 10 years ago,” said District 6 Councilmember Wala Blegay.
District 3 Councilmember Eric Olson voted no Thursday and District 1 Councilmember Tom Dernoga abstained. The nomination now goes to the full 11-member council, which is expected to take it up later this month.

Moki was nominated in June by County Executive Aisha Braveboy, who has remained a vocal supporter after it was revealed that he had been terminated from the county government for cause in 2014. That firing — which was upheld by the county personnel board, a county circuit court and the state’s intermediate appeals court — claimed that Moki mismanaged the county’s stormwater management program, and failed to ensure projects were completed in accordance with federal mandates. The county paid thousands of dollars in stormwater fines during the period around his tenure.
Olson had pointed questions for Moki Thursday. In the court rulings over his termination, “there was no evidence presented by you that any supervisors prevented you from administering the program. I’d like to hear your response to that.”
Moki defended himself in part by denying allegations from the court record — namely that he had access to a stormwater fund that never dipped below $40 million, but failed to use it to complete projects to reduce harmful runoff.
“That’s patently false,” Moki said. “The associate director of the Department of Environment does not have unfettered access to the stormwater fund. Even the director does not.”
He added that the fund had to be split between his department and others, including the Department of Public Works, and that it was not large enough for the county to do all the work needed to remain in compliance with the federal Clean Water Act.
“Even if the county spent all that $40 million on stormwater, it would still not have brought the program into compliance,” Moki said. “The issue that people don’t want to face is: The county underfunded this program. So it’s not on me.”
Moki said that since his appointment in June, he has found a way to trim $31 million from the county’s stormwater budget over the next four years, arguing that the previous budget was not “sustainable.”
At the hearing, Moki also spoke to his detractors directly, saying that he doesn’t shy away from confrontation.
“I make a commitment — irrespective of whether or not you disagree with me — if I’m honored to be given this position, my offices are open for you to come in and discuss,” Moki said. “This is not going to be a war. It is partnership for the interest of the environment.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A parade of current Department of the Environment workers — from Moki’s two deputy directors to administrative assistants — came to testify in support of him Thursday. Several described his affable nature, saying he makes a point of greeting staff and fostering a positive environment, while also making visits to county facilities. Some said they had known him for several years, including during his past stint at the department.
“I believe his heart is special,” said Rodney Taylor, a department associate director. “In my 42 years, he’s the first one I’ve seen that spent this kind of time with his staff.”
David Fisher, an associate director of the department’s animal services division, said Moki made a great impression during two visits to the county animal shelter, including when he came to commend the staff recently after a record monthly “save rate.”
“He says, ‘I came to the facility today so I can congratulate the staff on the work that they did in person, because sending an email didn’t seem like enough to me,’” Fisher said. “I cannot say enough that his leadership is welcome at DoE.”
But some opponents cast doubt on remarks from Moki’s subordinates.
“Most people that got up here have talked about how they’ve interacted with Samuel Moki just over the past few months, and that’s what alarmed me,” said Taylor Frazier McCollum, a community advocate from Landover. “Do you really know him? In my opinion, it’s unethical to have subordinates testify — period.”
Lily Fountain, chair of the executive committee of the Prince George’s County Sierra Club chapters, said her organization is requesting “a new candidate with requisite background and integrity to lead this vital department in these changing times.”
Environmental advocate Staci Hartwell, who currently serves as a strategic adviser for the South County Environmental Justice Coalition, expressed frustration that Moki did not work in environmental fields after his dismissal. He testified that he completed a master’s degree in environmental management in 2016, and later taught policy courses at local institutions.

“We need a candidate with a clear record of professional excellence — not controversy — and competitive, relevant experience, not a decade-long industry-related leadership gap,” Hartwell said.
Others expressed concern that Moki’s appointment could cause county environmental gains to backslide,. Cheverly resident Dan Smith argued that stormwater failures in Moki’s earlier tenure were damaging.
“We lost ground because of what occurred at that period,” Smith said. “We cannot afford to lose any more ground.”
Sherman Hardy, representing Citizens for Accountability in Governance, argued that the Moki nomination damages public trust in the county’s government.
“Today, I have the painful task of asking whether my government has lost its moral footing or its mind,” Hardy said. “What we are witnessing with this nomination is not just wrong-headed, it’s malpractice.”
But Moki defender Joe Gaskins, representing the Maryland Business-Clergy Partnership and the Prince George’s Contractors and Business Association, said Moki’s “resume is envious.”
“I’m hoping that the individuals in this room will get over this, what I see as racism, discrimination on this guy,” Gaskins said.
That was echoed by Council Vice Chair Krystal Oriadha, who is not a member of the committee but attended part of Thursday’s hearing. She applauded Braveboy for appointing Moki and refusing to be “bullied or manipulated” by opponents, specifically those “behind the scenes that don’t look like me or you.”
“I just see a lot of things that I’m really sad about, in this case, as a Black woman, as a woman of an immigrant father from Africa,” Oriadha said.
Moki spoke briefly about his own experience as an immigrant and naturalized citizen, an experience he said left him with a “with a strong desire to enter public service.”
Oriadha argued that stormwater fines against the county “continued to increase” after Moki’s dismissal.
“A lot of times, blame is left at the feet of people that are not the ones making the decision,” she said. “And we have to be mindful of that. And I find it kind of hypocritical that the person that was in charge of the agency wasn’t made responsible.”

Blegay credited Moki for jumping in to help with stormwater problems in her district, which includes Largo and Upper Marlboro, after she struggled to get assistance from the previous administration.
“He brought his whole team to my office, and they started talking about possible goals,” Blegay said. “We have resolution now, because of Dr. Moki.”
District 2 Councilmember Wanika Fisher, who is also an attorney, implied that politics may have been at play in Moki’s 2014 dismissal.
“There are two sides of the truth,” Fisher said. “That’s one thing I know for sure, being in courtrooms in this county for the last 10 years — and there are politics in every aspect of our judicial system.”
Dernoga, who abstained Thursday, said he had asked for particular documents from Moki and received them Thursday morning. He said he planned to review the documents and come to a “more solid position” by the time the full council votes, but he called the concerns about Moki’s past “valid.”
District 9 Councilmember Sydney Harrison also appeared ready to abstain, saying he wanted to “reserve any thought that I have to learn more and to understand more.” But he ultimately voted for the nomination.
“I do not know how I’m going to vote when you come before the entire council, but it’s going to give me more opportunities to learn,” Harrison said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC07068-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-09 23:56:42.481706

U.S. District Judge April Perry noted the ongoing protests outside a local immigration processing center have never exceeded 200 demonstrators. She said the demonstrations fall far short of the high legal bar needed to be characterized as a “rebellion” that would allow the administration to take control of the Illinois National Guard and deploy troops from Texas and California to Chicago.
“I have seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said as she issued her oral ruling late Thursday afternoon.
While Perry acknowledged protesters have assaulted immigration agents and damaged federal property — namely vehicles belonging to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol — the judge said there was far more evidence that the feds actually escalated or even caused clashes with activists.
More than a dozen protestors have been arrested in recent weeks outside an ICE processing center in the suburb of Broadview, approximately 13 miles directly west of Thursday’s hearing in Chicago’s Dirksen Federal Courthouse.
The ICE facility has been the epicenter of protests against the Trump administration’s ramped-up immigration enforcement actions in the last month. The Department of Homeland Security claims “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago and its suburbs has resulted in the arrests of more than 1,000 people.

 National Guard would add ‘fuel to the fire’

DHS claims the federal troop deployment is necessary to protect the facility, along with federal immigration agents working in and around it.
But the judge agreed with arguments put forth by the state and city of Chicago in its lawsuit that deploying the National Guard was more likely to lead to civil unrest than be a force for peacekeeping, as guardsmen are “not trained in de-escalation.” Throughout nearly three hours of arguments in her courtroom, she continually pushed back on U.S. Department of Justice lawyers’ claims that Chicago-area immigration protests had grown out of control due to violent agitators.
Perry noted that for 19 years, weekly prayer vigils outside the Broadview facility occurred without incident. But she said most of the evidence pointed to federal agents — not protesters — as the catalysts for violence. She recounted recent incidents in which agents used chemical agents and nonlethal rounds against crowds “as small as 10 people.”
Deploying the guard “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started,” she said.
The judge will publish a written decision on Friday. But after giving her a verbal ruling Thursday, she agreed to use the widest possible wording to prevent the Trump administration from deploying troops from other states while her 14-day temporary restraining order remains in place.
For now, the feds won’t be able to order troops to perform their “federal protective missions” anywhere in Illinois.
That includes members of the Texas National Guard, who made their first appearance Thursday morning at the Broadview facility.
 Texas Guard is already here

The Trump administration dispatched National Guard troops to Illinois from Texas earlier this week, even after the judge on Monday urged them to wait for Thursday’s hearing. Fourteen members of California’s National Guard were also sent to the Chicago area in order to train Illinois troops. Eric Wells, a top lawyer for Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, argued the move was a harbinger of “wanton tyranny.”
“I can only say that what I think what we heard from the United States Department of Justice was startling, unbounded, limitless and not in accord with our system of ordered liberty of federalism, of a constitutional structure that has protected this nation and allowed it to prosper for hundreds of years,” Wells said as he began his final arguments.
Raoul sat front-row throughout Thursday’s arguments in the courtroom and grew emotional while answering reporter questions after Perry’s ruling. He called the attorneys who worked on the case “true American heroes.”
“This is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois but for the entire country,” he said. “The question of state sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the president of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today.”

 Trump administration to appeal

The Trump administration is poised to appeal Perry’s decision, just as it challenged a decision from Trump-appointed federal judge in Oregon who also blocked the National Guard’s deployment to Portland over the weekend. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday heard the case, during which two other Trump-appointed judges appeared amenable to arguments that a president should be given deference in matters of national security, according to reporting from POLITICO.
DOJ lawyer Eric Hamilton also pushed for deference in his arguments to Perry Thursday. He said it wasn’t up to the judge to decide whether there was a risk of rebellion or even whether Trump was “relying on completely invalid evidence,” as Perry put it.
Hamilton painted a much darker picture of the protests in Broadview and Chicago, claiming that “sustained violence” in recent weeks was preventing DHS from “executing federal law.”
“They are not protesters,” he said. “They are the violent resistance of duly enacted immigration laws.”
Hamilton said dozens of agents have been “injured, hit, punched” — one even had his beard ripped off by a protester, he alleged.
“How — how did that happen?” Perry asked at one point. “Like an entire … not pieces of hair? His whole beard?”
“I believe that’s what the declaration says,” Hamilton said, referring to a filing in the case.
 ‘DHS’ version of events are unreliable’ 

In delivering her ruling, Perry said the DOJ’s arguments in the National Guard case seemed to add to “a growing body of evidence that DHS’ version of events are unreliable.” She said the administration’s characterization of immigration protests “cannot be aligned” with the accounts of local and state law enforcement submitted in legal filings.
For example, Hamilton referenced recent arrests of protesters, including a couple who were arrested for allegedly assaulting officers and happened to be carrying their licensed concealed weapons. But a federal grand jury this week declined to indict the couple, along with a third person, all of whom had already been released on bond.
Over the weekend, a Customs and Border Protection agent shot a woman in Brighton Park on Chicago’s Southwest Side during an altercation with agents. DHS officials allege the woman was one of 10 drivers who were following federal agents’ vehicles Saturday morning and eventually boxed them in.
But her attorney told a federal judge this week that body-camera footage contradicts that narrative and shows an officer shouting “do something b—-,” according to reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times. She and another driver were arrested over the weekend but the judge ordered them released.
Hamilton also referred to the incident several times, claiming drivers were “ramming” into immigration vehicles.
None of the other protesters arrested by either federal or local authorities in recent weeks remain in detention, with most arrestees handcuffed and immediately released after receiving a citation.
Federal prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against one of the arrested protesters, one day after a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order against ICE barring agents from arresting peaceful protesters or journalists covering immigration demonstrations. It also bars federal agents from using harsh crowd control methods such as tear gas and other non-lethal weapons and ammunition.
The judge pointed out the Trump administration activated the National Guard the same weekend a federal immigration official stationed in Broadview described as a “great weekend” in an internal email late Sunday night. The official said the relative calm was due to the Illinois State Police, which last week formalized cooperation with Broadview Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office into a “unified command” and put up fencing around the building.
Perry cited the dropped charges for protesters this week, the First Amendment restraining order won by journalism groups, and another federal judge’s ruling Tuesday that ICE violated a consent decree restricting warrantless arrests.
“So to summarize, in the last 48 hours, in four separate unrelated legal decisions from four different neutral parties, they all cast doubt on DHS’ version of events,” the judge said.

The data follow National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores released earlier this year in which the Commonwealth’s students scored at a 20-year low. 
Compare these results to the years following passage of a 1993 education reform law that ushered unprecedented improvements in student achievement and came to be known as the “Massachusetts Miracle.” By 2007, the Commonwealth’s eighth graders tied for best in the world on international science testing. 
Now, nearly 15 years into a precipitous decline in educational outcomes, it’s hard not to wonder whether Massachusetts leaders will wait for all the gains from education reform to be wiped out before they do something about it. 
The Education Reform Act combined a significant investment in public education – particularly in less affluent school districts – with high academic standards and accountability for everyone in the system. 
Money is important, but it isn’t the problem here. The Commonwealth’s 2019 Student Opportunity Act adds over $875 million to annual education appropriations, again focused on promoting equity by providing increased funding for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to what was already one of the nation’s best-funded public-school systems. Massachusetts schools also received nearly $2.3 billion in federal pandemic relief money.  
This year, K-12 public education will receive nearly $500 million in receipts from the tax increase on high earners that state voters approved in 2022. All told, state and local taxpayers are spending about $18 billion on public schools. 
The money is still flowing, but standards and accountability haven’t fared so well. In 2010, Massachusetts jettisoned the nation’s best English language arts and math standards, replacing them with national academic standards known as Common Core that dramatically cut the amount of literature students read and slowed their progression to higher mathematics study. 
On accountability, the Commonwealth eliminated an independent agency that performed comprehensive audits of state school districts in 2008, replacing it with… not much. Last year voters eliminated the requirement that students pass MCAS English, math and science tests to graduate from high school. 
Perhaps education reform’s single biggest success was the Commonwealth’s charter public schools.  Stanford University’s Center for Research on Education Outcomes found that Boston charters performed the best of 41 urban charter sectors it studied.  The Brookings Institution found that Boston’s charter schools achieved some of the largest academic gains ever documented. But charters have been stalled since a bid to increase their number failed at the ballot box in 2016. 
Some charter schools need to get their own houses in order. Performance at too many of them has declined since their embrace of “social justice education.” Such equity-centric programs aren’t, by definition, harmful, but in some charters they have taken the place of delivering the rich liberal arts curriculum that is the surest path to justice.    
Now another education reform success, the Commonwealth’s outstanding vocational-technical schools, are in the crosshairs of reform opponents because they’re drawing more and more students from traditional public high schools.  
The deterioration in performance became clear after the Commonwealth adopted Common Core in 2011. By 2019, Massachusetts NAEP scores fell by more than all but 17 states in math and all but 14 in reading. Then the Commonwealth’s students had among the nation’s largest declines during the pandemic. Rather than recovering at least some of that ground post-pandemic, the decline continues. 
MCAS results reveal that the overall portion of students meeting expectations fell from half before the pandemic to 42 percent now. The portion of students who failed rose from 11 percent to 18 percent.  
Only 39 percent met or exceeded expectations on the just-unveiled 8th-grade civics test.  In these tumultuous political times, the civics results give chilling new meaning to the story of the woman outside the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, who asked Benjamin Franklin, “What have we got, a republic or a monarchy?”  “A republic,” Franklin replied, “if you can keep it.” 
After nearly 15 years of decline, the question is whether things have finally gotten bad enough for state leaders to return to the high standards, accountability, and strategic access to high quality choices that were pillars of the most successful education reform in modern American history.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (left) and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger faced off Thursday in the only debate of Virginia’s 2025 gubernatorial race. (Photos by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)After months of deeply polarized campaigning, the tone of political speech and the fallout from the recent controversy over Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones dominated Virginia’s only gubernatorial debate Thursday night at Norfolk State University, where Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears clashed sharply over violence, abortion, taxes, and immigration in an often heated exchange.
Moderators Deanna Albritton of WRIC and Tom Schaad of WAVY frequently had to rein in Earle-Sears, who interrupted Spanberger repeatedly as the two traded barbs before a crowd of  students and invited guests at the historically Black university.
The 60-minute debate, which was televised statewide, was the only face-to-face encounter of the 2025 race for governor — a contest that polls show leaning toward Spanberger. An Emerson College Polling survey released last week found the Democrat leading Earle-Sears by 10 points, 52% to 42%, buoyed by strong support among independents and younger voters.
 Jay Jones controversy and political rhetoric

The debate’s opening segment focused on the scandal engulfing Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones, who admitted sending text messages referencing former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert in language that both parties have condemned as violent and unacceptable.
Asked whether she knew about the messages before their release — and whether she still endorsed Jones — Spanberger sidestepped direct answers despite repeated follow-ups from the moderators.
“The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,” Spanberger said. “I denounced them when I learned of them, and I will denounce them every opportunity I get as a mother, as a public servant, as a candidate for governor.”
“My opponent, unfortunately, only denounces violence when her side is the target,” she added, directly addressing Earle-Sears. “You routinely referred to me as your enemy. I’m not your enemy. We are political opponents.”
Pressed again on whether she still endorsed Jones, Spanberger said she learned of the texts only when they became public and added, “It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information.”
‘Beyond disqualifying’: Jay Jones controversy jolts Virginia’s pivotal 2025 elections

Earle-Sears seized on the moment, accusing Spanberger of lacking “political courage.”
“Jay Jones advocated the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children,” Earle-Sears said. “What if he said it about your three children?” she asked Spanberger directly. “I’m asking my opponent to please ask Jay Jones to get out of the race.”
She invoked her upbringing in Jamaica, saying she had witnessed political violence as a child and did not want to “see that in America.”
When moderators turned to President Donald Trump’s remarks at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, where Trump said, “I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them,” Earle-Sears said she would not use such language but pivoted again to the Jones case.
“As everybody knows, I’m a Christian before I’m a Republican,” she said. “I’m required to forgive people. … But I would not say that.”
Spanberger countered that Earle-Sears herself refused to condemn violent rhetoric from her own party.
“The statement you read from President Donald Trump was violent rhetoric that she refuses to denounce,” Spanberger said, addressing the moderators.
The exchanges underscored how the controversy over Jones has reshaped the final stretch of Virginia’s election season. As The Mercury reported earlier this week, Democratic leaders have struggled to contain fallout from the texts, which Republicans have used to portray the party as divided and hypocritical on civility and accountability.
Political analyst David Richards, a professor at the University of Lynchburg, said the issue dominated the night to Earle-Sears’ detriment.
“Earle-Sears was not doing herself any favors tonight,” Richards said afterward. “Her constant interruptions seemed desperate and frankly unbecoming. She played the Jay Jones card over and over, which got old.”
 Clash on reproductive rights

The sharpest policy divide of the evening came over abortion.
Earle-Sears reiterated her support for new limits, saying she would sign legislation banning abortion after 15 weeks, possibly earlier, depending on what “the majority of Virginians decide.” 
“It’s not going to be my view,” she said. “My opponent, on the other hand, has the extremist view, which is abortion up until the very hour that the baby could be born.”
Earle-Sears ‘morally opposed’ to Virginia’s reproductive rights amendment, note shows

Spanberger pushed back, accusing her opponent of mischaracterizing her position.
“When the Dobbs decision was made, it was very quickly clear that state after state would move to restrict abortion access,” she said. “In states where they further restricted abortion access, women have died. I support the constitutional amendment codifying the Roe v. Wade standard.”
The amendment, which would enshrine abortion rights in Virginia’s constitution and which Earle-Sears wrote that she is “morally opposed” to, is expected to appear on the ballot in 2026 after the next General Assembly cycle if lawmakers approve it a second time — an issue both candidates said will define the next governor’s term.
 Taxes and affordability

Earle-Sears leaned heavily on fiscal themes, promising to eliminate Virginia’s car tax in her first year and claiming the state has “run budget surpluses every year” under Republican leadership.
“We could have gotten rid of that this year, because Governor Youngkin put it in his budget,” she said. “We had the money. We can do it.”
Earle-Sears did not answer directly when moderators asked how she would replace the $2 billion the car tax generates for the state each year. 
Spanberger agreed the car tax is unpopular but said her opponent’s record doesn’t match her rhetoric.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

“My opponent went in the legislature and had the opportunity to lower the car tax by 10% and voted against it,” she said, referring to the Republican’s tenure in the House of Delegates from 2002 to 2004. “Now, in the four years that she has been lieutenant governor, she hasn’t made the effort to get rid of this tax.”
Spanberger added that any repeal must protect funding for public schools and local services — an argument echoing Democratic criticism of tax-cut proposals advanced by Youngkin that critics said would strain local budgets.
 Education and parental involvement

Education policy, long a centerpiece of Virginia politics, drew another spirited exchange.
Earle-Sears repeated her campaign line that “parents are their child’s first teachers” and that she does not “co-parent with the government.”
Spanberger, a mother of three daughters in public schools, struck a similar tone on parental engagement but defended educators’ role in shaping curricula.
“Parents’ engagement is extraordinarily important,” she said. “And I support the strength of our public schools because they provide opportunities for students everywhere.”
The candidates’ agreement ended when the topic turned to transgender students’ rights. Spanberger declined to take a definitive position on whether transgender girls should use girls’ bathrooms or play on girls’ teams, saying localities should decide.
Earle-Sears said she would uphold Youngkin’s 2022 policy requiring students to use bathrooms aligned with their assigned sex at birth.
“I’m not for discriminating against anyone,” she said. “Girls want to have privacy. It’s really that simple.”
 Immigration and law enforcement

The debate later shifted to immigration and public safety, a frequent flashpoint during Earle-Sears’ tenure as lieutenant governor. 
She backed Youngkin’s directive for Virginia State Police to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in removing undocumented immigrants, saying violent offenders must be prioritized.
Spanberger vows to scrap Youngkin’s immigration order if elected governor

“We have found cartel members here, communist Chinese gangs here,” Earle-Sears said. “They’re here because my opponent did not vote to shut down our borders.”
Spanberger, a former CIA officer and former member of Congress, rejected Earle-Sears’ claim and emphasized that she supports law enforcement cooperation when a valid warrant or criminal charge exists.
“Anytime there is someone wanted for a criminal offense, absolutely that cooperation shouldn’t just occur — it must,” she said.
Her law-and-order framing aligned with her broader effort to position herself as a pragmatic Democrat focused on safety and stability, in contrast to what she called “partisan chaos” in Washington.
 Contrasting biographies and tones

The debate also showcased the stark personal contrasts between the two women.
Spanberger, 46, served three terms in Congress representing Virginia’s 7th District before announcing last year she would run for governor. 
A former CIA operations officer, she built a reputation as a centrist focused on bipartisanship and pragmatic problem-solving. Her campaign has emphasized lowering costs, protecting abortion rights and investing in workforce training.
Earle-Sears, 61, made history in 2021 as Virginia’s first Black woman elected statewide. 
A U.S. Marine Corps veteran, she previously served one term in the House of Delegates and on the State Board of Education. She launched her gubernatorial bid in 2024 pledging to continue Youngkin’s conservative policies on taxes, education and social issues.
Richards, the Lynchburg political scientist, said their temperaments reflected those records.
“Spanberger held her own and came off as much more polished and capable, if not a little cold,” he said. “Earle-Sears often came across as slightly unhinged.”
He added that both candidates dodged tough questions.
“Neither candidate wanted to answer questions directly,” Richards said. “The hosts tried to keep them on target, but were ineffective. This debate probably didn’t change too many people’s minds.”
 Moments of civility

In one of the few lighter moments, both candidates were asked what they admired about the other. Spanberger praised Earle-Sears’ faith and her service in prison ministry.
“I admire her service to our country, particularly as someone who chose to be an American and chose to serve,” the Democrat said.
Earle-Sears responded by calling Spanberger “a devoted mom” and “a daughter who loves her parents very much,” before crossing the stage to shake her opponent’s hand — a rare gesture in a campaign marked by mutual distrust.
 Closing messages

In her closing statement, Earle-Sears returned to her biography.
“I ran a men’s prison ministry. I’ve mopped the floors of a homeless shelter. I’ve given my life to service,” she said. “I’m a United States Marine. I know how to defend and deliver for Virginia.”
On the record: Winsome Earle-Sears

Spanberger’s closing remarks emphasized steadiness and bipartisanship.
“I served as a federal agent at CIA and then in Congress, I always endeavored to put Virginians first,” she said. “My opponent has not done the same, putting her allegiance to Donald Trump first, no matter the cost.”
With less than four weeks until Election Day, analysts say Spanberger enters the final stretch with momentum but faces an energized conservative base. Early voting is already underway across Virginia.
Whether the Norfolk debate swayed undecided voters remains unclear. 
“Earle-Sears’ attempts to drag Spanberger into the Jay Jones scandal were unsuccessful. Overall, I’d give Spanberger a small edge because she seemed calmer and more professional,” Richards said.

(Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Three days after President Donald Trump signed an order approving federal permits for a proposed mining road through the Brooks Range, the U.S. Congress put the finishing touch on a resolution intended to further aid the Ambler Road project.
In a 50-46 vote on Thursday, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution that overturns the Biden administration’s decision to enact a land management plan for Interior Alaska that would have limited development in order to encourage the growth of declining caribou herds, salmon, dall sheep and other wildlife.
That vote followed one in early September by the U.S. House of Representatives. The resolution now goes to Trump’s desk, and the president is expected to sign it.
The Central Yukon Resource Management Plan was the result of a 10-year project to determine how 13.3 million acres of federal land in Interior Alaska should be used, including public access for subsistence and recreation, as well as opportunities for development. But the final result dissatisfied members of Alaska’s congressional delegation and Alaskans who favor mining and resource development, including Doyon Ltd., the regional Alaska Native corporation for Interior Alaska.
Those opponents worried that the plan would hamper projects like the 211-mile Ambler Road, which is intended to connect the Dalton Highway with potential mine sites in the Brooks Range. They also expressed concern that the plan could derail construction of the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
Environmental groups praised the plan, noting that local residents and Alaska Native tribes participated in shaping the result.
Opponents urged the delegation to seek the repeal of the plan, and Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, introduced a resolution to do so. Begich guided it through the House and on to the Senate, where it was supported by Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska.
“The Biden administration’s Central Yukon Resource Management Plan was an egregious case of federal overreach and just one of the administration’s 70 executive orders and actions singularly focused on harming Alaska, our economy, and our working families,” Sullivan said in a written statement. “This particular scheme effectively locked up millions of acres of Alaska’s land, ignored Alaska Native voices, undermined long-standing federal law, and blocked access to critical mineral, energy, gravel, and material resources that our local communities, state and nation need.”
Murkowski said that reopening the plan for additional changes will allow the Bureau of Land Management “to develop a more balanced plan.”
“I expect a new final plan to address long-standing access issues, provide greater opportunity for economic development, including key energy and mineral resources, and ensure Alaska Native landowners in the region can maximize the use of their own lands while still protecting subsistence and conserving where truly necessary,” she said in a statement.
Begich said he is “proud to see this legislation head to the President’s desk and grateful for the work of Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan to get this across the finish line as we continue to unlock Alaska’s resource potential.”
Environmental groups denounced the decision, with the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society saying that the delegation acted incorrectly.
“The existing plan was vital for both the people in the region and the salmon, caribou and Dall sheep that will suffer if migration routes are cut off and habitat isn’t protected,” said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director of the Center for Biological Diversity. “Our Alaska delegation should stop selling out our communities and public lands to out-of-state corporations that just want to plunder our state for profit.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Mike Dunleavy in a case that could decide the limits of executive power in Alaska.
In a complaint filed Friday and a motion for summary judgment on Monday, the Legislature’s contracted attorney asks a Juneau Superior Court judge to decide whether or not a governor may issue an executive order during a special legislative session.
The lawsuit had been expected for months.
In August, Dunleavy issued an order seeking to create an Alaska Department of Agriculture, shortly before lawmakers convened for a special session called by the governor. Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, rejected the validity of the order.
Representatives for the governor’s office said they believed the order was valid and that it would take effect unless lawmakers voted it down. 
The leaders of the House and Senate said they did not want to take up the order, because doing so risked setting a precedent, effectively declaring that executive orders could be issued during a special session.
The question that could be decided in court is whether issuing an order in a special session is legal. And does it matter if the order is identical to one that’s already been issued and voted upon?
Legislators rejected a similarly written executive order in March, saying they wanted to create a new Department of Agriculture via legislation instead, during the regular legislative session.
Alaska is one of two states without a cabinet-level Department of Agriculture, and creating one is seen as a key first step for boosting food production in Alaska.
“The parties require the court’s prompt assistance to resolve this legal dispute before January 1, 2026,” wrote attorney Kevin Cuddy. “Otherwise, there is a risk that the state will move forward with a Department of Agriculture that may have been unconstitutionally created, and thus without legal authority to act.”
The Alaska Department of Law, which will represent the governor in the case, has been served with the lawsuit but has not yet filed its reply. 
Patty Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Law, said by email, “We are working on a briefing schedule with the counsel for the Legislature and the court. Our goal is to expedite the case and ensure that a decision is made before the legislative session begins.”
Alaska’s constitution forbids lawsuits by the executive branch against the legislative branch; the inverse is not true. Lawmakers have now sued Dunleavy four times since he took office in 2018.
The Alaska Supreme Court decided two of those cases — dealing with funding education in advance and voting on a governor’s appointees — in Dunleavy’s favor. A third case, dealing with the handling of oil and gas tax settlements, has yet to be decided.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/240128-State-of-the-State3-copy-e1760057961391-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-09 21:56:52.251477

Last week, state officials said the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, had just one to two weeks’ worth of funding to keep feeding low-income Washingtonians. The Department of Health encouraged enrollees to continue using their benefits as usual. 
The newfound money is coming from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, not the state, the Department of Health said. But it was not immediately clear how much money the federal government was providing, or where it was being funneled from.
The Trump administration has said in recent days that it would use revenue from tariffs to keep the program running while the government is shut down. The White House and the U.S. Department of Agriculture didn’t respond to requests for comment late Thursday, with email autoreplies from spokespeople saying that the shutdown was disrupting reply times.   
Even with the additional funding, Washington has seen the temporary closure of a WIC clinic, at Tri-Cities Community Health, said Nicole Flateboe, executive director of Nutrition First, the state’s WIC association. Two other clinics temporarily closed and then reopened. Another could close in a couple weeks. Yet another furloughed staff and stopped taking new clients.
Money for the program flows from the federal government to the state and then some of it to the clinics, which provide WIC services and help to get people enrolled in the program. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds the program, while the state Department of Health administers it in Washington. WIC participants can purchase food using electronic benefit transfer cards, which work like debit cards.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pledged to make back payments once the shutdown ends. But the state has not, Flateboe said. And the expenses are too big for some of the clinics to take on without a guarantee they’ll be made whole. 
Other states are guaranteeing the payments.
“This is only Washington. This is incredibly embarrassing,” Flateboe said Thursday. “We’re the outlier.”
Nutrition First is pushing Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson to allow the state Department of Health to adjust the state’s contracts with the clinics to ensure reimbursement. A spokesperson for the governor didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In Washington, over 200 clinics serve more than 212,000 women and their children under 5 years old annually under the WIC program, according to the state. WIC helps nearly one-third of all newborn babies. Nationally, the program serves nearly 7 million Americans.
WIC helps mothers with access to healthy food, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and health screenings. Research has shown participation in the program helps limit low birth weights and reduce maternal mortality. 
The extra money announced Thursday only covers food benefits, not WIC’s other services.
The federal government shutdown began Oct. 1, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether to extend tax credits as part of stopgap funding legislation.  
A shutdown at the start of the federal fiscal year, like this one, is particularly challenging for WIC, as states have little funding left over and haven’t received funding for the new year.

The nearly 30,000 people who use the program in King County already have a safety net. The local health department said this week it would issue one-time vouchers for food and baby formula to current clients through a partnership with Safeway if funding runs out. 
The county also said it would temporarily cover grant costs for its WIC staff. 
About 50 employees at the state health department were temporarily laid off or had their hours reduced starting Monday due to the shutdown.

June 10, 2025. (Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) OMAHA — The Douglas County sheriff announced Thursday that he wants to contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold migrant detainees at Omaha’s largest local jail, offering reasons including that it would bring in funds to boost his department’s trimmed budget.
The overture was rebuffed by the head of the County Board, which also oversees the jail as the Board of Corrections. Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of ICE tactics, responded in a brief statement that the board had not been involved in related conversations with Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

Garcia said he does not anticipate the board entertaining an ICE contract “any time in the foreseeable future.”
The authority to bring forth an agenda item to the Board of Commissioners or Corrections of the state’s most populated county lies with the board chair (Garcia) or a four-commissioner majority.
 Money source

Hanson, in his statement, said he has urged the County Board to reconsider entering into a detention agreement with ICE. Attached was an Oct. 7 memorandum addressed to Garcia and Vice Chair Mike Friend, which noted in part that nearly 80 workers detained in a June 10 Omaha immigration raid were transported to the Lincoln County jail in North Platte, which is more than four hours away.
Hanson said that, for those individuals, a Douglas County-ICE detention contract could have meant staying nearer to loved ones, with “real, in-person access to legal representation” and access to Omaha’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.”
Furthermore, Hanson said, an ICE detention contract would result in “millions of dollars of much-needed revenue.” He said his department’s proposed budget was trimmed by nearly a half-million dollars and said the safety of county residents will suffer.
Hanson’s proposal comes as the State of Nebraska is transforming a McCook-based state prison facility into a nearly 300-bed Midwest hub for ICE detainees. That proposal, backed by Gov. Jim Pillen and several state legislators, has sparked controversy and opposition from various organizations and some lawmakers.
“Ultimately we cannot control what the federal government does,” Hanson wrote to county commissioners. “What we can control is retaining our neighbors and shared constituents within our community as they navigate their due process.”
He contends the county jail is operating at “historic low capacity” and that space exists to “keep our neighbors in our community.”
 LULAC’s role

Hanson’s statement also announced that his office and the LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) Nebraska, had started discussions on “humane and accountable detention practices.”

The sheriff said that while his office and LULAC Nebraska hold different perspectives on whether the county should enter into a detention agreement with ICE, their dialogue “reflects a commitment to transparency and community input.”
Elsa Aranda, LULAC Nebraska state director, said she has offered to help develop independent oversight structures and detainee support frameworks to ensure fairness.
However, national LULAC spokesman David Cruz told the Nebraska Examiner that the sheriff’s statement was “premature” and that “any inference that LULAC is either supporting or endorsing or approving such a project would be inaccurate.”
He said the civil rights organization’s national leadership did not approve “a public statement using the name of LULAC in such a context.” LULAC describes itself as the largest and oldest Hispanic and Latin-American civil rights organization in the U.S.

Cruz said LULAC’s national president Ramon Palomares and advisor Hector Flores did speak with Hanson and his chief deputy at a conference they all attended in Dallas — as the sheriff wrote in his memo to the County Board.
But he said that the LULAC representatives did not know beforehand the topic to be discussed. “They went and listened,” he said, and said they’d take it back to the organization’s attorneys. 
Aranda, in remarks included in the sheriff’s statement, said her role as Nebraska state director was “to ensure that if detention occurs, it happens under humane, fair and transparent conditions – and that the rights and dignity of every person are protected, just as the sheriff is proposing.”
Cruz, however, said the national network’s stance is “staunch” opposition to detention centers for “detainees who are being held on immigration-related issues.” He added, “Any use of the name LULAC or the appearance lending weight to this decision would be inaccurate.”

Ford/Maryland Matters)Early childhood education operators Michelle Lloyd and Cindi Webb appreciated that Maryland State Department of Education officials provided updates on various initiatives Thursday, but they still didn’t get an answer to their question.
When will the enrollment freeze on the state’s child care scholarships program be lifted?
The state stopped accepting new families in May, when demand threatened to bust the budget for the program that provides financial assistance to working, income-limited families for child care. When they paused the program, state officials said they expected it to be reopened by the start of the school year, but that has not happened.
“The freeze is affecting children and learning. It’s affecting families being able to go to work,” said Lloyd, president of the Baltimore County Family Child Care Association.
She and Webb joined about 213 other participants — about 40 of whom were logged online — Thursday at the Maryland State Child Care Association’s leadership symposium in Columbia.
The child care scholarship was top of mind because owners, directors and administrators are worried that without it being available for new families, it could force some child care centers to restructure their operations.
Or worse: shut their doors.

But Sarah Neville-Morgan, assistant superintendent in the state Department of Education’s Division of Early Childhood, tried to calm the nerves of attendees. She said the number of children enrolled decreased to 43,000 last month, down from more than 45,000 in June.
“We still haven’t got down below the 40,000 that we need to get to, to stay within the budget,” Neville-Morgan said. “We would love to have more [money], increase us. We’d all be happy, but we know Maryland has other needs.”
She also noted the uncertainty surrounding the federal government, especially in terms of funding and the ongoing government shutdown.
Concerns about the impact of changes at the federal level were echoed by several of the state delegates who showed up for the symposium.
“We are waiting on pins and needles to see what daily calamities befall us from Washington,” said Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), one of eight delegates who came to Columbia to be part of a panel at the event.
“I do not see a huge appetite this year, certainly from our partners across the street in the Senate, to make any additional, sort of radical budget changes,” he said. “I think this is probably a status quo year [in the 2026 legislature].”
Despite likely fiscal challenges, lawmakers said they will still try to reopen enrollment on child care scholarships. A joint virtual briefing on the program is scheduled for Oct. 30 with the House Ways and Means Committee and Appropriations’ Education and Economic Development Subcommittee.
House Ways and Means chair Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard) said that finding “a structured end to the freeze” would be one of the main focuses in the 2026 session.
One statistic highlighted: An estimated 245,000 children are eligible for the scholarship, but only 14% are currently being served.
“We have a ways go to,” said Shavon Williams, customer service coordinator for the scholarship program.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The scholarship program was not the only early childhood topic mentioned. Atterbeary said the mixed-delivery system that aims to expand prekindergarten in both public schools and for private providers, as part of the state’s Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan, is “still not working.”
Lawmakers this year passed House Bill 1475, sponsored by Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard). The law established a 12-member prekindergarten system analysis work group tasked with assessing the mixed-delivery system. The group is scheduled to hold its second meeting Oct. 16.
“For that to work, private providers have to want to participate. It has to be worthwhile for them to participate. We have to make it desirable for them to participate, and we have not done so,” Feldmark said.
Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who serves as vice chair of Ways and Means, offered some advice, especially with the House “prioritizing the child care industry next legislative session.”
“We need your voices,” she said. “We need your child care providers to speak to the legislators that represent them. Clearly, no senators are up here, so make sure you meet with the senator to say, ‘This is what’s happening.’ I think that would make a tremendous impact next legislative session.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/State-officials-10-9-2025-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-10-09 20:57:05.459016

(Photo courtesy of the Auditor of State's Office)Three Republican Iowa state senators called on state Auditor Rob Sand, a Democratic candidate for governor, to perform an audit of Des Moines Public Schools in the wake of the arrest of former Superintendent Ian Roberts. Sand replied Thursday that he does not have the authority to perform an audit without the district’s request.
Sens. Jesse Green, R-Boone, Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott and Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, sent a letter to Sand Wednesday calling for the state auditor to investigate the spending and practices of DMPS following the Sept. 26 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest of Roberts.
Since the arrest, multiple reports have found that Roberts, a citizen of Guyana according to court documents, had falsified parts of his credentials and resume in addition to not disclosing his immigration status or previous criminal charges. Roberts had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024.

The letter from the three GOP senators said they were “becoming more and more alarmed” by reports of false information disseminated by Roberts about his background, and called for Sand to “take the time to do the job and help both lawmakers and Iowans as we continue to deal with the consequences of Roberts’ deceptions.”
“As senators with duties to pass budgets, implement policy, and hold government accountable, our job includes evaluating the process of retaining individuals to lead public schools and the accountability required to ensure the almost $4 billion of taxpayer funds are managed by people Iowans can trust,” the letter stated.
In a statement responding to the letter, Sand said he agrees with the “descriptions of Ian Roberts’ deceptions and agree that DMPS needs to be more transparent around what happened here.” But he said lawmakers should know the auditor’s office does not have the authority to conduct an audit of DMPS outside of a request for reaudit from a DMPS employee or school board official.
The GOP senators also brought up Sand’s efforts to audit the state’s Education Savings Account program providing public funds for private school tuition and associated costs in the letter. While the ESA program is expected to cost the state roughly $314 million, DMPS, which employed Roberts, received $460 million in fiscal year 2025, according to the release.
“You, as the state’s auditor, who claims to be the taxpayer watchdog while politicizing your office and spending more time campaigning for governor than actually focusing on your job, have a duty to that office and to Iowans to focus more of your time on your current job than trying to get the next one,” the senators wrote in the letter. “Iowa needs the state auditor to take the time to do the job and help both lawmakers and Iowans as we continue to deal with the consequences of Roberts’ deceptions.”
Sand responded that the senators “supported the vouchers law they chose to bring into this, which provides for no audits whatsoever of private schools spending public money, despite the fact that every public school district, including DMPS, is audited every year.”
The auditor’s office released an independent report in February about the ESA program and Odyssey, the company the state contracts with to administer the program, which stated the Iowa departments of Education and Revenue did not provide their office requested documents about whether students receiving ESA funds met the income eligibility requirements. Gov. Kim Reynolds and state department leaders responded by saying the office had not followed the correct procedures for obtaining this information, and that Sand was launching a political attack against the ESA program.
Sand also criticized Republicans, who hold a trifecta of control at the Iowa Statehouse, for passing legislation he said could allow officials to legally hide documents during an audit.
“They all have my number,” Sand said in a statement. “Had they just called me, I could have saved them the embarrassment of the public learning these lawmakers don’t know, or don’t care about, the law. I will still take their calls to save them further embarrassment.”
On Wednesday, Reynolds signed an executive order requiring state government departments use the federal E-Verify and SAVE systems to confirm immigration and citizenship status when granting occupational and professional licenses and confirming state employees’ work eligibility. The Des Moines School Board is also pursuing a lawsuit against JG Consulting, the firm contracted during the search to hire Roberts, for not disclosing information on his immigration, criminal and educational background that should have been flagged during the background check process.

U.S. District Judge Brian Buescher sentenced David Franklin[...],"Shown is the StratCom Gate at Offutt Air Force Base. (Courtesy of Offutt Air Force Base)LINCOLN — A federal judge sentenced a former civilian employee of the U.S. Air Force on Wednesday to nearly six years in federal prison on one felony count of conspiring to transmit classified national defense information via a foreign online dating platform in 2022 regarding the Russia-Ukraine war.
U.S. District Judge Brian Buescher sentenced David Franklin Slater of Auburn to 70 months in prison and a year of supervised release. Slater pleaded guilty in July; he was 64 at that time. As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors dismissed two other charges against Slater of willful transmission of national defense information. Buescher also assessed a $25,000 fine, with interest, against Slater. Slater faced up to 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine on the top charge.
According to court records, Slater worked at U.S. Strategic Command in Sarpy County between August 2021 and April 2022. StratCom is essentially the nation’s command and control center for nuclear and conventional strategic deterrence against attacks on the nation and its allies. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Prosecutors said Slater, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, attended classified StratCom briefings on the Russia-led war between February and April 2022. Slater had “top secret” security clearance. Prosecutors accused him of sharing information up to “secret,” a level below top secret.
Slater shared some of the information with an alleged co-conspirator who told Slater she was a woman living in Ukraine. Court documents indicate the woman sought info about NATO plans to help Ukraine, and Slater shared info about military targets and Russian military capabilities.
“You were the first to tell me that NATO members are traveling by train and only now (already evening) this was announced on our news,” the co-conspirator wrote in one March 2022 message, according to Slater’s indictment. “You are my secret informant love!”
In another March 2022 message, she called Slater “my secret agent.” Around April 14, 2022, she thanked Slater for telling her “valuable information” about two U.S. officials going to Ukraine — the same time that then-U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, and U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Indiana, became the first known U.S. officials to visit the country since Russia’s invasion.
The co-conspirator later asked Slater that month whether NATO would have an “unpleasant ‘surprise’” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In his July plea agreement, Slater wrote: “I conspired to willfully communicate national defense information to an unauthorized person.”
Prosecutors could not comment due to the ongoing federal shutdown. Slater’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nebraska U.S. Attorney Lesley A. Woods in July said that access to classified material “comes with great responsibility.”
Said Woods: “David Slater failed in his duty to protect this information by willingly sharing national defense information with an unknown online personality despite having years of military experience that should have caused him to be suspicious of that person’s motives.”
