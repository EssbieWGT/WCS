A legislative panel will mull statutory changes to protect TerraPower's Natrium security force from civil liability, including when using lethal force.
The post Wyoming nuclear developer wants legal protections for private, armed security force appeared first on WyoFile .","Don’t mess around at a nuclear power plant facility. If you have no business there but insert yourself anyway, you will be met with armed guards who are directed to “detect, assess, interdict and neutralize” all threats — including with lethal force.
Use of force in securing such facilities, including TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer, is required by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to agency officials. So are a litany of other security measures to ensure the sensitive operations don’t fall prey to “nuclear sabotage” — among the highest threats to U.S. national security, they say.
Trained security guards must assume that “adversaries would be dedicated and willing to exhibit lethal force and, quite frankly, receive lethal force in return,” NRC Regional State Liaison Officer Ryan Alexander told members of the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee on Thursday in Casper. 
TerraPower officials, who will use a highly enriched uranium fuel to power an “advanced” nuclear reactor, presented a draft bill, “Wyoming Security,” to the committee. They’re asking lawmakers to extend protections against civil lawsuits to a private security force, which the company will be required to install when it begins handling nuclear materials. In addition to describing potential statutory changes to accommodate lawful “use of force” by private security guards and related civil protections, the measure refers to standard NRC security requirements and what would be considered criminal trespass.

“Wyoming law currently lacks clear legal authority for trained security personnel performing these duties without such [legal] protection,” TerraPower Nuclear Security Manager Melissa Darlington testified. Without expressed legal protection, TerraPower would still be held to federal NRC standards of security enforcement, she added, which “may result in hesitancy [upon private security personnel] in implementing their duties.”
The committee directed the Legislative Service Office to work up draft legislation based on TerraPower’s proposed language, and agreed to continue discussion at its next hearing in July.
Though most committee members spoke in support of rigorous security — among the primary concerns they’ve heard from constituents regarding Natrium and other potential nuclear facilities — they want to avoid unintended consequences. Such civil liability protections, for example, should not extend to private security guards while not on duty at the nuclear plant, Laramie Democratic Sen. Chris Rothfuss suggested.
“TerraPower will have more security guards than there is law enforcement officers in Lincoln County.”Shane Johnson, Lincoln County Sheriff
“We have to explore, a little bit, how Wyoming statute [currently applies to] use of lethal force if you are not law enforcement,” he said. “We don’t typically grant civilians the right to lethal force, and particularly when they’re not representing the state or the community, [but] they’re representing a corporation.”
NRC officials admitted it’s a “delicate situation” for each state that hosts nuclear facilities.
“These protections are not unlimited,” said Darlington, who noted she will move to Kemmerer this summer to help oversee security at the Natrium plant. “They only apply to security personnel at commercial nuclear facility sites who are acting with reasonable belief and within the scope of their employment.”
Though some communities opt to train local law enforcement to qualify in on-site security efforts, that’s not likely to be the case in Lincoln County, according to TerraPower and local officials. Law enforcement will work closely with the company and NRC to coordinate emergency responses, said Lincoln County Sheriff Shane Johnson. But local agencies simply don’t have the resources or expertise to take on federal nuclear security.
“TerraPower will have more security guards than there is law enforcement officers in Lincoln County,” Johnson told the panel.
Several committee members expressed anxiety over providing civil liability protections to a private, corporate security force. Rothfuss suggested the committee should consider forming a special task force to explore the issue.
“When we’re writing statute, we don’t want to provide somebody who’s an armed-nuclear-security guard the authority to use deadly force on the other side of town,” he said.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.

It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”

Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Two Montana men foraging for mushrooms in the north-central part of the state shot and killed a grizzly bear on May 21, after it reportedly charged them at close range.
According to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the two men were not harmed during the encounter.
The two local landowners were picking mushrooms about a mile north of Choteau on Wednesday evening when they came across the adult female grizzly bear, which charged them. The men shot and killed the bear at close range.
“I spoke to John and Justin shortly after the incident and they were both still shook up,” Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks Director Christy Clark said in a press release. “They told me their story and it was clear it was very traumatic. What’s important here is they’re OK.”
FWP officials said the female grizzly killed had a cub of the year with her at the time of the encounter, and the agency is attempting to capture the cub.
This is the fourth known grizzly bear mortality in 2025, according to FWP’s grizzly mortality dashboard, and the second grizzly death in Teton County this spring. The other mortality in Teton County is listed as under investigation, but FWP at the time described it as self defense.
The dashboard was launched last year to help the agency increase transparency and educate Montanans on why grizzlies are killed or die when they are currently federally protected. Earlier this year, the federal government rejected petitions from Montana and Wyoming officials seeking to delist the species and return them to state management, a proposal that is likely to gain traction under the Trump administration.
Bears are active along the Rocky Mountain Front and in areas around towns like Choteau, Ulm and Cascade. If you are experiencing conflicts with bears, please call your local FWP bear specialist. You can locate their contact information here.

Jim Pillen posing with President Donald Trump in the White House Oval Office. April 30, 2025. (Courtesy of Jim Pillen)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump this week approved a federal disaster declaration for mid-March winter storms in Nebraska with damage estimates exceeding $64 million.
Gov. Jim Pillen announced that Trump had signed the April 11 request this week. The federal declaration, the first request from Pillen in 2025 and his first under Trump, opens federal funding to cover damage costs in 27 counties. Much of the damage resulted from downed electrical lines and damaged utility poles — more than 1,700 poles were downed or destroyed. 
Major roadways closed due to the storm — producing thunderstorms, sleet, high winds and blizzard conditions — including a 160-mile stretch of Interstate 80.

An estimated 200,000 customers were left without power at the height of the storm, and some communities established emergency shelters to help those without electricity for a prolonged time.
Pillen had written to Trump that it was “one of the most destructive winter weather events to impact Nebraska in recent history” and that “emergency services were pushed to their limits.” 
“I appreciate President Trump’s attention to Nebraska and his approval of this disaster request,” Pillen said in a statement. “Federal funding will help cover the tremendous costs that were incurred as a result of this weather event.”
It’s not uncommon for some disaster declarations to be denied, but with some calls to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether, including from Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, some national and state leaders had expressed concern. 
A spokesman for the National Security Council previously said states had to take on a more extensive role in emergency preparedness, including “an appetite to own the problem.”
Some local officials have told the Nebraska Examiner that if Trump had denied the Nebraska request, the costs could have fallen back on local property taxes.

Trump approved the request for 27 counties: Boone, Burt, Butler, Cass, Clay, Colfax, Cuming, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Hamilton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lancaster, Nuckolls, Otoe, Platte, Polk, Saline, Sarpy, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Thurston, Washington, Webster and York.
Pillen’s office said the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency has begun working with local emergency managers and public entities now eligible for assistance, including public utilities.
In 2024, under President Joe Biden, Pillen requested and was granted five federal disasters as he expressed a greater willingness to seek federal funding than his predecessors. Those declarations opened up $120 million in estimated preliminary damage costs for Nebraska.
Pillen this year also signed a state-level disaster declaration in February for wildfires in Custer and Dawes County and in April for a prescribed burn that got out of control in north-central Nebraska. He did not file a corresponding federal disaster request for either.

SPRINGFIELD – A bill unanimously passed by the Senate on Thursday and on its way to Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk will increase the age that senior drivers in Illinois are required to take an annual driver’s test.

Currently, if a driver renews their driver’s license between the ages of 79 and 80, they are required to take a driving test. Drivers between 81 and 86 are required to take a driving test every two years, and drivers 87 and older have to take the test annually.

If Pritzker signs House Bill 1226, sponsored by Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, only drivers 87 and older will have to take an annual driver’s test. Illinois drivers between 79 and 86 won’t be required to take a driver’s test to renew their license; instead, they’ll only have to take a vision test, and if they have a driving violation, a written test.

The bill would also allow a spouse, parent, grandparent, sibling or child of any Illinois driver to submit medical information about the driver to the secretary of state if they think the person’s medical condition interferes with their driving abilities. Currently, only medical officials, police officers and state’s attorneys can submit such information.

HB 1226, also called the Road Safety and Fairness Act, has garnered bipartisan support. Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias announced his support for the bill in January alongside lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. The bill was conceived by a constituent of Rep. Jeff Keicher, R-Sycamore, last year.

The bill has 86 cosponsors in the House and 35 in the Senate.

Illinois is the only state that requires seniors to pass a driving test solely due to their age. But state data indicates that older drivers tend to have lower crash rates.

In 2023, the crash rate for drivers aged 75 and older was 24.61 per 1,000 drivers, which was lower than any other age group, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation. The low crash rate has been consistent since at least 2018, according to the Secretary of State’s Office’s 2023 Study on Age-Related Driving Abilities.

The crash rate is more than double for many of the other age groups.

Tate Reeves a proposed budget for approval. 
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said separately that they have reached a handshake deal on a $7 billion state budget, which was supposed to have been passed earlier this year in regular session. 
Still, Reeves will ultimately have to give sign-off on it and order a special legislative session before all 174 lawmakers can consider it. 
Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, told Mississippi Today in a statement that: “The House and Senate have come to an agreement on the budget. We have notified the Governor and are awaiting the call for special session.”
White gave a similar account on SuperTalk radio station this week and predicted lawmakers will vote on the budget to fund government services “within the next couple of weeks.” 
Mississippi lawmakers control the purse strings and the budget process. But they adjourned their 2025 regular session earlier this year without passing a budget because of political infighting. Now, legislators must return to the Capitol to pass a budget in a special session before the new budget year begins July 1.
The state Constitution gives the governor the sole power to call a special session, and Reeves alone sets the parameters for what lawmakers can consider in a special session. 
Reeves’ office did not respond to a request for comment on what his criteria will be for approving the budget before he calls the special session. But he told reporters earlier this year at a press conference that he wants legislative leaders to send him a fiscally responsible budget. 
White and Rep. Karl Oliver, a Republican from Winona who serves as a House appropriations chairman, previously said that most state agency budgets will have level funding, with only increases for the public pension system and insurance costs. 
One of the significant points of contention between the two chambers has been how to spend cash not allocated to government operations. Lawmakers typically spend this money on capital projects across the state — including many lawmakers’ pet projects in their districts. 
The Senate wanted to spend only on projects for state agencies, universities and colleges. The House believed there is enough money to fund projects in counties and municipalities around the state, in addition to the state projects. 
The political reality is that legislative leadership tightly controls the bulk of the local projects in what’s often referred to as the “Christmas Tree bill.” Leadership can use these projects to reward people who buy into their agenda and punish members who buck the leadership. 
Such special projects for back home are often a key focus of rank-and-file lawmakers who don’t have prominent leadership roles at the Capitol.

The Mississippi Department of Archives and History helps manage the exhibits of the park, and state money typically flows through the agency. Because the state agency helps manage the area, this was part of the Senate’s justification for the project.
However, the House leadership has apparently balked at the request and views the Senate’s attempt to secure money for the park as an attempt to steer dollars to its favorite project while preventing spending on any pet projects for the House.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06061413/3X0A2107-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-23 13:12:41.665246

Although Huston’s second term officially ended April 1, he has remained in the role temporarily — and will continue to do so until a successor is appointed. He was originally named to the commission by Gov. Mike Pence in 2014 and reappointed as chairman by Gov. Eric Holcomb in 2018.
The IURC Nominating Committee is now seeking Huston’s replacement, the commission said in a news release.
“It is with a grateful heart that I announce my intent to retire,” Huston said in a written statement. “It is a blessing to work alongside our incredibly talented professional staff every day, and I am proud of the work we accomplish on behalf of Hoosier families.”

The powerful five-member commission oversees more than 600 electric, natural gas, steam, water and wastewater utilities operating in Indiana, according to its website. It regulates rates, financing, bonding, environmental compliance plans and service territories, with final say over changes to the utility bills millions of Hoosiers pay.
During his tenure, Huston worked to streamline agency processes and reinstituted semi-annual “Reliability Forums,” where utility stakeholders assess seasonal preparedness for energy demand.
In 2024, he testified before the U.S. Congress on state-level challenges facing electric service reliability.
Huston currently serves as co-chair of the Federal-State Issues Collaborative, and holds roles with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and GTI Energy.
“I want to thank Chairman Jim Huston for his service with the IURC over the past decade. He is a lifelong public servant and is leaving the agency in much better shape than when he arrived,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “I wish Chairman Huston the best in retirement.”
Prior to his IURC appointment, Huston served as chief of staff at the Indiana State Department of Health. During Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration, he separately served as executive director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. The office has since been absorbed by Indiana’s Department of Workforce Development as the agency’s “Serve Indiana” division.
Huston also worked for four members of Congress and former Gov. Robert Orr. He has twice received the Sagamore of the Wabash, one of Indiana’s highest honors.
Huston said he looks looks forward to “the next chapter” of his life, which will include “spending a little more time” with his family and grandchildren.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 16:11:50+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Schools missed learning disabilities of students who were later incarcerated,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/schools-incarcerated-students-report/,A report found CT schools fail to recognize the learning difficulties and traumatic experiences of young people who became incarcerated.,"For most of his life, Anthony struggled in school. In first grade, he was held back a year. By middle school, he’d been placed in an alternative school for children with problem behaviors. Then, at age 16, he was incarcerated after being charged with larceny and attempted assault. 
It wasn’t until roughly two years into his stint at Manson Youth Institute in Cheshire that Anthony, whose real name is being withheld for privacy reasons, was identified as having a language and speech impairment.
And he isn’t the only one. 
A report from the Center for Children’s Advocacy, slated to be released this October, found that local school districts repeatedly failed to recognize the learning difficulties and traumatic experiences of young people at an early age. That left them vulnerable to disengagement from school, ongoing discipline problems and eventual involvement with the criminal justice system, the report found. 
CCA reviewed the special education records of 10 young men incarcerated at Manson — including Anthony — and found that most of them had experienced learning difficulties in elementary school. Yet it sometimes took years for them to be evaluated for special education services.
And while six of the 10 young people were eventually referred for special education services, most of them were already incarcerated by the time that happened. 
“What jumps out so much from these stories … is how much could have been done for these kids at a much earlier age. Because we are losing them by sixth grade, if not earlier,” Sarah Eagan, CCA’s executive director, told the state General Assembly’s Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee during a presentation about the report last week.
Andrius Banevicius, public information officer for the Department of Correction, said in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror that most young people who come into a DOC facility have already been identified as special needs, and that there are “well established protocols and procedures to refer students to the special education process.”
“The dedicated educational professionals of the department’s Unified School District (USD) #1 are committed to providing a supportive and effective learning environment for all of their students, especially those with special education needs,” said Banevicius.
According to the report, all 10 of the young people whose records the agency reviewed were reading below grade level. Four of them were held back a grade. One was held back three times. 
Andrea Spencer, an education consultant for CCA, said traumatic events “have a significant effect” on a child’s brain development. All of the young people were in some way affected by violence — ranging from experiencing child abuse to witnessing domestic violence or violence in the community. One was the victim of a gunshot. 
Yet in eight of the 10 cases, there was no documentation in their education records about the difficulties they experienced. Eight of the 10 students also had notes in their records indicating that they had difficulties paying attention. 
“It seems that nobody really made the connection between the backgrounds of trauma of these young men and the hypervigilance that comes with that,” Spencer said at the meeting. 
She added that the behaviors children exhibited after experiencing trauma sometimes resemble ADHD. Language difficulties were also a common thread among the young men, which Spencer said was linked to “problem behavior.” 
Other researchers have come to similar conclusions. A 2020 study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that young people with developmental language disorder were more than twice as likely to reoffend.
Spencer said that difficulties with reading reinforced a belief that these students couldn’t function in school settings. As they entered higher grades, where learning relies more on reading texts, they experience heightened stress. 
Being expelled or suspended multiple times and being sent to an alternative school for children with behavioral problems were common stories for the young people whose records the agency reviewed. 
Eight out of 10 were arrested before the start of high school. Four were incarcerated before ninth grade. 
Leo, another of the young men at Manson whose name was changed to protect his privacy, was expelled in seventh grade after getting into a fight with another student in the cafeteria. He didn’t go to school at all for a year. After that, he repeated seventh grade, then stopped going to school until he landed in juvenile detention, according to the report. 
“He had a very significant reading disability, and when he was actually given some instruction, he was identified as diligent, engaged, respectful, by all of his teachers,” Marisa Halm, an attorney with Brown and Patterson LLP who formerly worked with CCA — and directly with some of the young men in the report — said at the meeting.
Falling ‘through the cracks‘
Even when special education needs were identified, the young men weren’t assured of getting the help they needed. According to the report, the special education services they received at Manson were minimal.
Spencer noted that the youths at the facility already had “significant educational deficits” in reading and other areas that were important in order for them to thrive in the community. 
Last August, the federal Department of Justice reached a settlement with the Connecticut Department of Correction after a 2021 federal investigation found, among other things, that Manson Youth Institute was failing to adequately educate children with special education needs. Part of the settlement required the department to screen young men entering the facility for special education needs, create policies around reviewing and revising special education plans and document the services that the youths were receiving. 
Halm told CT Mirror that while DOC was evidently working to improve special education services in response to the settlement, she questioned whether they had enough time to give young people a full school day and the necessary number of staff to provide adequate services.
Spencer added that the youth typically received only about one hour per month in “transition services” — assistance for young people who are preparing to leave the education system and either attend college or enter the workforce. Halm noted that transition services were doubly important for these youth because they were not only leaving the school system, they were also preparing to exit prison and return to their communities. 
DOC’s Banevicius said transition services were offered to every special education student, “which aligns with state and federal mandates.”
Eagan, of CCA, said at the JJPOC meeting that it’s crucial to identify students with learning disabilities at a young age, particularly in schools that she called “feeder districts,” referring to the high proportion of students that end up involved with the criminal justice system. She said those schools — which are primarily in the state’s urban districts — needed resources to give students the support they needed.
The Center for Children’s Advocacy recommended that school districts conduct trauma screenings for students and that the Connecticut Department of Education increase oversight of alternative schools and private special education schools. 
“If we’re not looking under the hood at the programs in a systematic way, these are the kids who are going to fall through the cracks,” Eagan said.
Matt Cerrone, director of communications for the Department of Education, said in a statement that the department would consider the findings of the report, but added that there needed to be a broader response to address the challenges students face outside of school.
“As the report states, many of the challenges students face begin well before they enter school and are linked to early childhood adversity that can significantly affect long-term outcomes,” the statement read.
“Addressing these complex issues requires a coordinated, cross-sector response that begins early and extends beyond the school setting,” Cerrone continued. “That said, the Department will continue to examine how these findings may inform its role within the broader system of support for children and families.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Manson-Exterior-e1625765290544.jpg,,,2025-05-23 12:19:42.852937

Nevada Gaming Commissioner Rosa Solis Rainey asked Fontainebleau president Maurice Wooden about the investigation Thursday, catching the executive off guard as he sought licensing as a key employee. 
“With respect to AML (anti-money laundering), tell me about the issues that are currently going on at the Fontainebleau with respect to credit issuance,” Solis-Rainey said to Wooden. “Are you aware of those?”
“I’m not sure of any investigation as it relates to anything with AML. Is there something specific? I’m not sure,” Wooden responded. 
“I think that is something that staff is currently further investigating, prior to any further action,” Gaming Control Board member Chandeni Sendall chimed in. 
“It’s not listed in our materials as confidential, by the way,” noted a visibly irked Gaming Commission Chairwoman Jennifer Togliatti. 
“Is it confidential or not confidential?” Solis-Rainey inquired. “We have in our materials that there’s an investigation ongoing with respect to the credit practices not being followed.”  
The issue, she said, involved ownership approving credit without proper approval from compliance executives. Fontainebleau is owned by Jeffrey Soffer. The $3.7 billion property opened in December 2023.
“If those processes happened, they were certainly before my time. I was, you know, not on property for what I believe some of the questions you’re asking,” Wooden responded, adding he believes “at least one or two of those issues did happen, almost like the opening week.” 
Wooden is likely referring to a $2 million marker issued to gambler and illegal bookmaker Damien LeForbes, shortly after the resort’s opening in December 2023, according to Robert Cipriani, a professional gambler who provided information to the federal government about money laundering at MGM Grand and Resorts World. 
LeForbes and illegal sports bookie Mathew Bowyer have pleaded guilty to operating unlawful gambling businesses and to money laundering. 
MGM Resorts entered into a non-prosection agreement with the government in early 2024 and paid a $7.45 million fine. Its former president, Scott Sibella, agreed to a plea deal for failing to comply with AML regulations. The feds have yet to take any action against Resorts World, where Sibella also served as president until his termination in September of 2023, and where Bowyer and LeForbes were permitted to gamble without known sources of funds.    
The Gaming Commission fined Resorts World $10.5 million in March and imposed an $8.5 million fine against MGM in April. 
Cipriani contends the investigation has expanded to a handful of other resorts, including Fontainebleau.
In early January 2024, weeks after Fontainebleau’s opening, Cipriani tweeted the casino granted a $2 million marker to LeForbes, who eventually “blew thru it all,” according to Cipriani. 
“All the casinos that took DJ Leforbes’ and Matt Bowyer’s action are being investigated by GCB,” Cipriani said Friday.
No efforts have been made by Fontainebleau or Venetian, where the two also gambled, to recover the funds via the District Attorney’s Office, according to court records. 
Gaming Control Board Chairman Kirk Hendrick told Togliatti the information about the investigation, which was included in the Commission’s back up documents, should have been marked confidential.
“I don’t want to go any deeper into this matter until the board has an opportunity to review it and, of course, speak with the licensee,” he said.
Stacy Michaels, a Fontainebleau executive, said the GCB audited five player accounts and had concerns with three. Michaels added that agents were eventually satisfied the company had followed proper protocol.

Vasquez's office)The Republican reconciliation bill that cleared the United States House of Representatives by a narrow margin this week no longer authorizes the sale of thousands acres of public land in Utah and Nevada.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM), who co-founded the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus earlier this year, said the removal of that provision represents a “huge victory” for all Americans concerned about public lands being sold to the highest bidder. Vasquez said in a statement he started the caucus with U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Montana Republican, to beat back these attacks on public lands. 
“We committed to working across party lines to sit down and ensure the integrity of our land management system. We’ve worked together across the aisle to prevent this unprecedented public lands sell-off,” Vasquez said. “We will continue to work together to ensure our lands are public, accessible and well managed.”

The provision would have gutted protections for 500,000 acres of land near Zion National Park, along with critical habitat for threatened desert tortoises and other areas designated by Congress for conservation, according to New Mexico Wild, a conservation advocacy group. That could have meant the lands were turned into “golf courses, luxury resorts or strip malls,” the group said in a statement Thursday. 
Environmental groups nationally have applauded the removal of the provision, which Reps. Celeste Maloy (R-Utah) and Mark Amodei (R-Nevada) sponsored. New Mexico Wild’s executive director Mark Allison said the bipartisan pushback was a factor in maintaining the land’s protections, but he warned that this is the first of many fights in coming days to stave off efforts to privatize public lands.
“The fact that House Republicans were forced to retreat shows that when we unite to defend our birthright, politicians listen,” he said in a statement. “But make no mistake — this fight is far from over. The same forces that tried to sneak this land grab through would love nothing more than to come after New Mexico’s public lands next time.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A bill that would eliminate certain transgender protections established by a 2018 anti-discrimination law in New Hampshire was approved by the state Senate Thursday and now heads to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
​​If it becomes law, House Bill 148, which was sponsored by Wilton Republican Rep. Jim Kofalt, will allow businesses and organizations in New Hampshire to classify certain services, such as locker rooms and restrooms, by biological sex. It would also permit schools and organized sports teams in the state to keep transgender athletes off teams that are consistent with their gender identity. It would allow prisons, mental health facilities, and juvenile detention centers to place transgender people with members of their at-birth sex even if they ask to be placed according to the gender they identify with. The bill doesn’t require any of these things, but it allows whoever owns the restrooms, administers the sports teams, or runs the prison to do so without facing discrimination charges. This reverses parts of 2018’s Law Against Discrimination, which was enacted to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, or national origin.”
The Senate passed the bill, 16-8, along party lines Thursday, with all Republicans voting yes and all Democrats voting no. The House passed the legislation, 201-166, in March. Only two Democratic House members, Reps. Jonah Wheeler and Peter Leishman, both of Peterborough, voted in favor.
Ayotte will now have the option to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature. Her predecessor, former Gov. Chris Sununu, was given the same options in 2024 when the House and Senate approved House Bill 396. This year’s bill, HB 148, is a word-for-word copy of last year’s HB 396. Sununu ultimately vetoed the bill, calling it “unacceptable,” and saying it “runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit” and “seeks to solve problems that have not presented themselves,” per his veto message.

The merits of the state tax cuts and Republicans’ budget decisions have become partisan talking points in the early days of the 2026 campaign, as candidates begin to position themselves to run for governor and other offices.
Here’s a look at some of the key budget decisions lawmakers made this year:
The $9.425 billion budget came in above the $8.5 billion in projected revenue for FY 2026. To finance the difference, lawmakers approved taking an estimated $917 million in funding from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and budget surplus from previous years to fully fund state priorities. In later negotiations, legislators also agreed to use $26 million from the Iowa’s Sports Wagering Fund to provide money for priorities like paraeducator pay and the public safety equipment fund.
The FY 2026 budget will fund the state beginning July 1, 2025. It’s contains $478.1 million more — or 5.34% — than the FY 2025 budget of $8.947 billion.

House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said Iowans should be aware that this year’s budget reflects an unsustainable spending model for the state, as the funds being used to make up for the revenue shortfall are one-time money.
“It’s important that Iowans know that we’re spending on ongoing expenses out of the state savings account, and that that’s not a sustainable way to govern,” Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, told reporters at the end of the 2025 legislative session. “And the reason for that is because Republicans, who have been in charge for 10 years, have been unable to manage this budget in a way that’s truly going to be responsible and actually be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”
The state’s budget — and the factors that led to decreased revenue — are likely to be a major talking point for Democrats heading into the 2026 election season. One of the largest reasons why Iowa’s revenue fell was because of recent cuts to individual and corporate income taxes.
In 2024, Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a measure speeding up previous income tax cuts, which reduced the individual income tax rate from 5.7% in 2024 to a single 3.8% rate beginning in 2025.
House Speaker Pat Grassley said Friday on an episode of “Iowa Press” that Republicans chose to make this cut — knowing that the move would cause a loss in state financial returns — because Iowans had “overpaid” through income taxes in previous years, money that went into the Taxpayer Relief Fund. The Taxpayer Relief Fund holds $4 billion, and that’s just one of the state’s pots of unspent money. There’s also a $2 billion general fund surplus and $961 million in Iowa’s reserve accounts.
“The reason we felt confident in being able to do (tax cuts) is we felt we had an overcollection from Iowans, we needed to get that back into their pockets,” Grassley said. “I think what we’ve done as we approached this, we expected that there may be less revenue coming in, but typically when you cut taxes that is what comes with it. Thankfully, we have those backstops there that were in place for that reason. And, like I said, in a $9.4 billion budget, the state of Iowa is sitting on roughly $7 billion between those accounts that I just touched on. I think that puts us in a very strong position and why we felt confident and still feel confident moving forward.”
He said this funding is being used to “offset any of those bumps in the road” in the implementation of tax cuts, but said Republicans believe the state’s revenue will increase again because the tax cuts will stimulate the Iowa’s economy.
But Democrats said while these savings can be used to make up for current budget shortages, these should not be relied on to meet the state’s spending obligations. Following the March Revenue Estimating Conference, Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, released information from the Iowa Department of Management’s five-year budget projections, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, that found the Reynolds administration’s budget plan for the next five years would continue to draw money from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and Economic Emergency Fund.
“Republicans are breaking their own rule of using one-time funds for ongoing expenses, and Iowa taxpayers are footing the bill,” Petersen said in a statement.
During floor debates on appropriations bills, Democrats repeatedly emphasized the larger problems with the FY 2026 budget, saying the Legislature should not be drawing money from savings and reserves to fund annual expenses. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, criticized Republicans during floor debate on the health and human services budget bill for both irresponsible budgeting practices and for ot providing enough funding to meet Iowans’ needs in their proposal.
“One of the biggest pieces that we have to talk about here is how the majority party’s failed economic policies mean that we don’t have enough revenue to cover this inadequate budget,” Trone Garriott said. “… We could do a lot better for a lot of people, and I’m sorry that we’re not making that effort in this budget.”
Trone Garriott, as well as Konfrst, are running as Democratic candidates in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District in 2026, and have been critical of both state and federal GOP budget practices. Discussions on Iowa’s budget could also play a role in statewide elected races, like in the gubernatorial race. As Reynolds announced that she will not seek reelection, multiple Republicans — including Speaker Grassley — have said they are considering running to become the GOP nominee in 2026.
Though the budget has been approved by lawmakers, the governor still must sign off on the appropriations bills. She has the ability to line-item veto specific funding provisions within these budgets, meaning funding for some of the provisions approved by the legislature could be cut by the governor.
As it stands, here are some of the ways state money is appropriated in the upcoming year’s budget:
Education
An expense that Democratic legislators have repeatedly criticized and pointed to as a place for cuts is the Education Savings Account (ESA) program. It provides state dollars for K-12 students’ private school tuition and associated costs. The program, approved in 2023, has limited Iowans’ eligibility based on income for the first two years of implementation. Beginning the the 2025-2026 school year, families of any income level can receive the public funding for private school costs through the program.
The most recent estimates put ESA spending at $314 million for the upcoming year, a roughly $96 million increase from the current fiscal year.
There is not an appropriations limit for the state program, meaning the estimate could differ from how much is actually spent. The money in ESA accounts is tied to the state’s state supplemental aid (SSA) rate for per-pupil spending for public K-12 schools — $7,988 per student for the upcoming school year.
Lawmakers passed a 2% SSA rate for the FY 2026 budget as part of a total $3.9 billion in spending for the state’s public K-12 school system.
This is not the only money going toward Iowa education in this year’s budget. Senate File 647, the education appropriations bill — separate budget from SSA — allocated more than $1.033 billion. Much of that funding went to Iowa’s higher education institutions, which included a $7.5 million funding increase for the Iowa community colleges and a $5.5 million increase for the Iowa Board of Regents governing the state’s public universities.
Additionally, lawmakers passed Senate File 660, a measure providing $14 million to fund a pay supplement for paraeducators and other educational support staff through the Sports Wagering Fund. This money, one of the hold-ups in budget negotiations between House and Senate Republicans, was a funding component approved in 2024 as part of the law making changes to Iowa’s Area Education Agencies (AEAs) but was not included in the budget proposal agreed upon between Senate Republicans and Reynolds.
The state’s standing appropriations bill, which contains SSA funding as well as other state spending obligations, also contained a $25 million reduction in funding for AEAs.
Health and human services
Another large piece of state spending was allocated through House File 1049, the state’s health and human services budget. The $2.469 billion appropriations bill funds the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Veterans Affairs.
A majority — $1.903 billion — of the spending goes to Medicaid and related state programs, including the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP, providing expanded Medicaid health coverage, and the Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa (Hawki) program for uninsured children of low-income families. This year’s budget included a $230.4 million increase to make up for expected funding shortfalls for Medicaid and Hawki.
Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, said during floor debate the state was “fully funding Medicaid” through the bill, but Democrats questioned whether state funding will be sufficient considering Medicaid cuts currently being considered by Congress.
The appropriations measure includes $20 million for nursing facility providers’ Medicaid rate rebasing, higher reimbursements for maternal health providers, and an increase from $50 to $55 in personal needs allowances given to individuals on Medicaid in care facilities each month.
It also includes a restriction on Medicaid coverage, banning payments through the health plan for transgender Iowans seeking physical medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria, such as sex reassignment surgery and hormone treatment therapy. The bill was amended from an earlier version that included language to stop Medicaid coverage for all forms of gender dysphoria treatment, including mental health care.
Democrats still argued the provision was unjust, as it prevented Iowans from receiving lifesaving medical treatment. Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, argued the measure violated the Equal Protections Clause in the U.S. and Iowa constitution, as it would deny a group of people medical treatment that remains accessible to others. Cisgender people could still receive hormone therapy if deemed medically necessary, Donahue said as an example, while transgender people could not.
Medicaid coverage for transition-related treatments was brought up as one of the motivators to remove gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act earlier in the 2025 legislative session. Previous attempts by Republican lawmakers to ban Medicaid coverage for transgender Iowans were struck down because of the protections provided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act, and the Iowa Supreme Court has not weighed in on the constitutionality of such a ban.
Another component of health-related spending passed this year was allocation of money from the Opioid Settlement Fund. Lawmakers have failed in previous legislative sessions to pass a bill distributing money from the fund, which currently contains more than $56 million, but were able to get House File 1038 to the governor’s desk in 2025.
The bill appropriates $29 million from the fund to HHS for disbursement to several specific organizations and programs working on addiction prevention, treatment and recovery programs in FY 2026. In future years, money will be allotted from the fund to state agencies, with HHS receiving 75% and the Iowa Attorney General’s office receiving 25%, with these entities then choosing where the money will go. Iowa is expected to receive more than $325 million in the fund between fiscal years 2021 through 2039, according to the AG’s office, with settlement funds split between local governments and the state.
House lawmakers including Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, said he was disappointed with some aspects of the measure, but that the compromise was needed or else “we would have gone a third year without using these funds to address opioid abuse in Iowa.” The Opioid Settlement Fund, created in 2022, is money collected by Iowa through lawsuits brought by states against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies for their roles in the opioid epidemic. A majority of this money, 85%, is obligated through the cases to be spent on opioid addiction treatment and prevention.
Democratic lawmakers said they were frustrated that the Opioid Settlement Fund money will be distributed through HHS and the AG’s office under the agreement, arguing this structure will provide less oversight and input from communities in need, but supported the bill as a means to distribute money.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Justice and judiciary
The combined spending for Iowa’s law enforcement and courts systems came to a total of $924.9 million for FY 2026.
The judicial branch’s budget, Senate File 648, came to $221.83 million. It included $1.27 million more in funding for judicial officer salaries, amounting to a 2.5% pay raise for justices and judges — an increase Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen called for in January to help Iowa be more competitive and help current issues with filling judicial vacancies across the state.
Senate File 644, the budget funding state law enforcement entities including the departments of Justice, Corrections, Public Safety and Homeland Security and Emergency Management, appropriated $703.1 million from the general fund, $20.6 from other funds and several standing appropriations. The budget included a $7.6 million increase for the state Department of Corrections, allocated to several state facilities and department efforts.
It also had a a $2.1 million increase for the Office of the State Public Defender — including a $1.95 million transfer from the Indigent Defense Fund and $100,000 from the College Student Aid Commission designated for the Rural Attorney Recruitment Assistance Program. Rep. Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant, said the bill includes a total increase of $1.07 million for indigent defense, raising the pay for attorneys who represent people who cannot hire a lawyer themselves by approximately $2 per hour.
Lawmakers also approved adding $150,000 in new money for the victims assistance grant fund, run through the state Attorney General’s office, to provide services for human trafficking victims.
Agriculture and natural resources
The upcoming fiscal year’s funding for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Iowa Department of Natural Resources and related state programs totaled $46.6 million from the general fund, in addition $99.4 million coming from other funds.
Senate File 646 shifts $2.5 million from the existing Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Fund and provides $1.05 million in new funding to create the Iowa Animal Disease Prevention fund, focused on efforts to research vaccines, track outbreaks and provide equipment to treat and prevent animal diseases. This was a change requested by Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig following the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza.
The measure also makes changes to the Choose Iowa program focused on producers that sell food and goods grown in Iowa. It ends the Choose Iowa pilot purchasing program and creates the Choose Iowa Food Purchasing Program with a $200,000 appropriation going to food banks for the purchase of locally produced food. Democrats criticized the shift from the pilot program, that provided assistance to both food banks and Iowa schools, as the new food purchasing program did not provide funding for schools to be able to purchase locally grown foods.
The Resources Enhancement and Protection (REAP) program, funding local projects related to natural resources conservation and public spaces, received a $12 million appropriation from the Environment First Fund — a lower amount than the $20 million standing appropriation in Iowa Code given to REAP.
Other spending
Administration and regulation: House File 1044 provides funding for several of Iowa’s statewide elected offices as well as state agencies like the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing (DIAL) and Department of Management and Department of Revenue. It also gives money for state entities like the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS) and the state Utilities Board.
This year, the Legislature allocated $73.7 million from the general fund and $134.2 million from other funds through this budget. This year, lawmakers approved a $1.2 million increase for IPERS to hire new staff, and $600,000 for the state’s Insurance Division to increase oversight and regulation enforcement for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the businesses that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, health insurance providers and pharmacies.
Economic development: The budget for economic development initiatives, Senate File 645, includes $74.7 million in total spending from the general fund and other state resources. The money from this appropriations pool goes largely to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa Finance Authority and the Iowa Department of Workforce Development.
This year’s budget reduced funding for the World Food Prize and state tourism office, as well as money for several grant programs. But it also includes a $322,000 bump in funding for the Iowa Arts Council and $350,000 for the Council of Governments (COGS), money which can be leveraged with federal and local dollars to provide $3 million in funding for housing renewal projects across the state according to Rep. Shannon Latham, R-Sheffield. Latham said these projects can be taken on through the continuation of the Housing Renewal Pilot Program, which was extended for three years through the bill.
Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund (RIIF): House File 1039 appropriates $163.8 million from the Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund and the Technology Infrastructure Fund. Though House GOP lawmakers said during debate they could not reach an agreement for several RIIF funding priorities in budget negotiations with the Senate this year, there were still several projects that received funding through the fund this year. The Iowa Law Enforcement Academy received $15 million for the creation of a new driver training facility, and the state historical building received $5 million to buy new storage units for preserving historical artifacts.
Transportation: The state’s transportation budget, $502.8 million for FY 2026, does not come from the general fund, but from the Road Use Tax Fund and Primary Road Fund. Senate File 628, providing funding for the Iowa Department of Transportation, included a $20 million increase in Road Use Tax Fund money to modernize the state’s drivers and vehicles record system, as well as $18.9 million to renovate the DOT’s Waterloo maintenance garage.

Like many first-time buyers with moderate incomes, they found they had to take on extra work, compromise on size and wait patiently for a house they could afford in today’s market (Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall).Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Judge Richard Mark Gergel, of the U.S. District Court of South Carolina, Charleston Division, handed down that order Tuesday in the ongoing federal court case The Sustainability Institute et al. v. Donald J. Trump.
Gergel’s order calls for the Trump administration to reinstate roughly three dozen grants that had been awarded to the City of New Haven, the City of Baltimore, and a handful of other municipalities and nonprofits through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
According to a press release sent out by Mayor Justin Elicker on Wednesday, this order applies to three federal grants the city has been awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): a $20 million Community Change grant, designed to promote energy-efficient homes and green transportation; a $9.5 million Climate Pollution Reduction grant to build out geothermal heat pumps for Union Station; and a $1 million Environmental Justice Government-to-Government grant, designed to help New Haveners transition their homes from oil to heat pumps.
[RELATED: New Haven takes big hit as CT climate grants remain in limbo]
New Haven had joined with fellow plaintiffs — like Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Madison, Wisconsin; and San Diego, California — in suing the federal government in March, alleging that the Trump administration had illegally frozen or terminated the congressionally appropriated funds underlying these grants.
Federal lawyers did not contest the plaintiffs’ claims that the Trump administration had acted in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) in regards to 32 of the 38 relevant grants. However, they sought to get the district court from holding off on issuing ​“injunctive relief” for the plaintiffs while the Trump administration appealed the court’s jurisdiction under the APA.
Ultimately, Gergel decided to grant ​“permanent injunctive relief” for these 32 grants — including the three awarded to New Haven.
“Plaintiffs have produced substantial, highly persuasive evidence to support their claims that their grant funds were frozen and/or terminated because Defendants disfavored previously authorized congressional appropriations and that such actions were outside of the legal authority of the agency Defendants and in violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers,” Gergel wrote.
In response to the Trump administration’s request for the district court to hold off on granting injunctive relief, he wrote, ​“the public interest lies in upholding the rule of law and providing an effective remedy for those injured by the unlawful actions of government officials. For these reasons, Defendants motion to stay is denied.”
Click here to read Gergel’s order in full.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
“Contrary to President Trump’s executive orders and actions, the way we ​‘Unleash American Energy’ is by leveraging our country’s own renewable resources, including solar, wind and geothermal,” Elicker is quoted as saying in Wednesday’s celebratory press release. ​“It’s better for our pocketbooks, our environment and our national security, and we are encouraged that this ruling will allow New Haven and other cities and nonprofits across the nation to do exactly that.”
City climate czar Steve Winter was also quoted in Wednesday’s press release, stating, ​“I’m thrilled that the court has blocked the Trump administration’s illegal and unjustified freeze of funding for important climate change and clean energy projects in New Haven. The work that our team does every day in partnership with City agencies and community partners helps improve air quality, lower energy bills, and address our climate crisis.”
This marks the second time in two months that a federal judge has sided with New Haven in one of a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration. In late April, a federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration can’t withhold funds from New Haven, San Francisco, and a dozen other cities just because they are​ “sanctuary jurisdictions” that limit local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
New Haven has been represented in both of these federal cases by Public Rights Project.

The case was dismissed on Thursday. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge cleared the way Thursday for CoreCivic to reopen its Leavenworth prison as an immigration detention center, saying he lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.
The city has not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver. 
“We need to confer with our attorneys,” said Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager. “We will probably discuss it with the city commission sometime next week.”
Peterson said he didn’t know whether further court action could occur before June 1, when CoreCivic officials had indicated they may begin receiving detainees.
“We may have further negotiations with CoreCivic themselves about this,” Peterson said. 
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse dismissed the case, saying the city failed to establish subject-matter jurisdiction. During a Tuesday hearing, Crouse repeatedly questioned whether he had any basis to act, saying the city had not adequately outlined that issue.
Crouse, appointed to the bench in 2020 by President Donald Trump, highlighted two pending motions before him, including Leavenworth’s request for an injunction that would have stopped CoreCivic from reopening until it could be determined whether the company had to go through the city’s development process. CoreCivic had asked for a dismissal of the case.
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said in court Tuesday that CoreCivic had agreed not to take detainees until June 1 while the case was decided.
After the hearing, Hatley said in an interview there were concerns that if detainees were housed in the prison before the legal disputes were resolved, the federal government could refuse to move the detainees regardless of the outcome of the case.
“The City asserts that Core Civic should be enjoined from operating its detention facility without the proper permit,” Crouse wrote in his ruling Thursday. “But it has not pled facts to establish that subject-matter jurisdiction exists in federal court to consider that claim. Accordingly, this action is dismissed, and the parties’ motions are denied as moot.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin said the company was pleased with the decision. 
“We remain focused on ensuring the Midwest Regional Reception Center is prepared to meet the needs of our federal partner,” he said.
Gustin did not answer questions about whether CoreCivic intended to begin housing ICE detainees in June. 
 
Move forward
Activists who have spoken out against reopening the facility are hopeful the city will appeal. 
“We hope the city will explore all of its options as the concerns of the lawsuit since its filing in February — CoreCivic’s disregard for the city’s governance and its rush to fill the facility without accountability — have only grown more urgent,” Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said in an email.
Tseng also said the judge’s decision held hope with regard to whether CoreCivic would have to follow Leavenworth development codes requiring the company to apply for a special use permit. 
“It’s also worth noting that in the dismissal, the court agreed that when CoreCivic ceased operation for 12 months, it lost its non-conforming status and that its initial application for the special use permit appeared to be a recognition of this fact,” she said.  
CoreCivic was grandfathered into the city’s development codes when it was open and operating as the Leavenworth Detention Facility from 1992 to 2021. The codes were passed in 2012. 
City officials, as laid out in the lawsuit, have told CoreCivic it must apply for a special use permit.
 
‘Great start’
CoreCivic’s reopening of the Leavenworth facility, which closed in 2021 at the end of its federal contract and under numerous accusations of inhuman treatment at the facility, is part of the company’s plan to reopen nine idle facilities.
In its May earnings report, CoreCivic announced total revenue of $488.6 million, with net income of $25.1 million.
“2025 is off to a strong start for CoreCivic. First quarter occupancy in CoreCivic facilities reached 77% of available capacity, an increase from 75.2% in the first quarter of last year,” said CEO Damon T. Hininger in a press release. “Based on cost management and increased bed utilization, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), we exceeded our internal expectations for the first quarter. Additionally, we have begun to re-activate three previously idle facilities under multiple agreements with ICE.”
In Security and Exchange Commission filings, CoreCivic said it had nine idle facilities, including the Leavenworth facility, renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“CoreCivic anticipates additional contracting activity as 2025 progresses,” Hininger said. “In addition to the facilities we are currently activating, we are making preparatory investments in many of our other idle facilities so that they will be available quickly, as our partners’ needs require and as their budgets allow.”
 
Leavenworth contract
CoreCivic SEC filings and a press release said they signed a letter of agreement with ICE at the beginning of March to reopen the Leavenworth facility, which would house 1,033 detainees. As a result, ICE paid CoreCivic $5 million with a maximum of $22.6 million set over a six-month period to cover start-up expenses while the two hash out a long-term contract. 
In its quarterly report, filed May 8 with the SEC, CoreCivic noted that Leavenworth filed a lawsuit.
“CoreCivic plans to vigorously defend this matter on the basis that the (special use permit) is not applicable under existing statute,” the filing said. “CoreCivic has agreed with the City of Leavenworth to not accept detainees prior to June 1, 2025 while this matter is deliberated. The Company can provide no assurance that it will obtain a favorable ruling in this matter or that ICE and the Company will ultimately enter into a long-term contract for the utilization of the Company’s Midwest Regional Reception Center.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200641-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A late spring nor’easter dumped 2 inches of rain on Newport Thursday. Not exactly the best weather for an outdoor display of over 7,000 combat boots.
“They’ve been out there for nine years, and they’re beginning to show their wear and tear and weather like this does not help,” Erik Wallin, executive director of Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, said Thursday afternoon as rain and heavy winds swept through the state.
But then combat boots are designed for rough terrain, extreme weather, and heavy-duty use. And the boots on display in the Boots on the Ground for Heroes Memorial are holding up thanks to the TLC from Operation Stand Down staff and hundreds of volunteers. The memorial opened Friday morning under cloudy skies at Fort Adams State Park in Newport. 
Each boot in the memorial organized by Operation Stand Down has a U.S. flag and a tag with the name and photo of a fallen service member killed in action since 9/11 in the Global War on Terror.
The memorial remains open to the public for viewing 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. through Sunday and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Monday. Admission is free.


The boots are organized alphabetically and by state and U.S. territories. Visitors often leave coins on the boots, some are symbolic of a personal connection to the soldier, sailor, Marine or Coast Guard personnel who died. A quarter could mean you were with the service member when they died; a dime that you served with the deceased; a nickel that you were at basic training together; and a penny that you visited and paid your respects and thanked the veteran for their service.
With the exception of the possibility of a passing late afternoon shower Friday and a lesser chance on Saturday, Wallin is thankful the National Weather Service forecasts calls for a dry Sunday and Memorial Day.
The memorial has been installed each year at Fort Adams since 2019. One year, it rained throughout the holiday weekend and into the following days so the boots could not dry out. Wallin said the boots had to be hauled to the Rhode Island Army National Guard Armory in Warwick to dry out.
The boots spend most of the year stored in a trailer. But this past Monday, Operation Stand Down staff drew the grid on the field inside Fort Adams. Over 200 volunteers helped place the boots and flags over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday. 
“There was a little bit of mold on them,” Wallin said.
Not anymore though. Among the volunteers who came to help set up the memorial this week, the East Providence High School football team helped clean boots.
“We’re tremendously blessed, all of us at Operation Stand Down,” Wallin said. “It’s very moving to see a hundred volunteers show up on any one day, both as a tribute to those who have fallen and it’s a tremendous recognition of people appreciating the sacrifice and service of our U.S. military.
This year there are exactly 7,326 boots, the same number on display last year, Wallin said. More boots are added each year if additional U.S. service members are killed in action in war operations under the specific criteria of the Department of Defense.
Each fallen hero is represented by a single boot except for the 29 Rhode Island service members killed who are each honored with a pair of boots. A separate circle with pairs of desert tan boots pays tribute to the fallen veterans from Rhode Island.
The rest of the boots are black, acquired through military surplus a decade ago. Since then, the Defense Department has switched over to desert tan boots.
“Unfortunately these have been part of the memorial now for over nine years, and they do begin to show their age,” Wallin said. “We’re kind of at that vector point of having to make a decision about going out and investing in an entirely new set.”

Every day is a job interview. Don’t be limited by your current goals.
Those were a few of the messages former U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona gave to Southern Connecticut State University graduate students at their commencement ceremony on Thursday night.
Cardona was born and raised in Meriden, Connecticut. He graduated from Central Connecticut State University, taught 4th grade in his hometown, and was later the state education secretary. In 2021, he joined former President Joe Biden’s (D) cabinet, where he served all four years.
While speaking to SCSU graduates at Total Morgage Arena in Bridgeport on Thursday night, Cardona also made a handful of references to the hit Broadway show Hamilton (Governor Ned Lamont (D) was also once fond of referencing the play).
Cardona reflected on his job interview to join the Lamont administration — where the two found common ground as Hamilton fans.
“After we got all the serious stuff out of the way, I got up to leave, and I remembered what he said about Hamilton, so I got up all serious. I looked him in the eyes, and I said, ‘Governor, just like my country, I’m young, scrappy and hungry, and I’m not throwing away my shot.’”
“I’m not saying that’s why I got the job, but it didn’t hurt,” Cardona said. “It did not hurt.”
Cardona has been floated as a possible replacement for Connecticut State Colleges and Universities Chancellor Terrence Cheng. When recently asked about that possibility, Lamont said he wasn’t ready to comment.
During Thursday’s ceremony, multiple speakers referenced the value of Southern’s diverse class. The name Donald Trump was not mentioned — but the messages were clear: diversity was and is a vital part of education.
“Our nation is constantly made better by our beautifully diverse people, no matter what people are saying these days,” Cardona said.
Diversity, Dean of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies Dr. Rabia Hos said, was also a cornerstone of academic research at the university.
Hos rattled off a few of the projects students participated in while obtaining their degrees: the effects of systemic racism affect mental health care in African Ameican commnuities, how to break down language barriers for immigrant families, and the development of role playing therapy models for neurodiverse kids.
“I have spent my career researching and writing about multilingual learners and immigrant students, those whose identities and experiences are often pushed to the margins in classroom and policies,” Hos said. “I continue to write, publish and speak because I believe scholarship should live beyond the page. It must challenge inequity, elevate silent voices and create space for all students to thrive.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
Why teachers leave: 2 educators share their experiences

“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”
Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
North Dakota teachers leaving profession earlier

States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
Task force seeks to get new teachers past the 5-year mark

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Connecticut has the second-highest rate of active registrations in the National Do Not Call Registry and has filed the second-most complaints, per capita, to the Federal Communications Commission about unwanted calls. 
In 2024, there were 2,253 complaints about unwanted calls to the Consumer Help Center in Connecticut. The topics of the calls include solar panel services, IRS services, mortgage services and political campaigns, among others. 
That’s about 61.3 unwanted calls per 100,000 residents, a rate that trails only Washington.
So far in 2025, there have been 648 complaints, according to data from the Federal Communications Commission’s Consumer Inquiries and Complaints Division. 
Consumers can also file complaints about spam calls to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission. In the 2024 fiscal year, there were more than 2 million complaints about unwanted spam calls. In Connecticut, there were 23,048 complaints, which is about 639 per 100,000 residents.
Consumers can tell companies that they do not want telemarketing sales calls through the Federal Trade Commission’s Do Not Call registry, According to its website, “companies that make unwanted calls to consumers may be violating the Do Not Call rules.”
Connecticut ranks second in most the active registrations per population, behind only New Hampshire.

Lawmakers agree to double unemployment for miners
Some 630 idled workers at two northern Minnesota mines will be eligible for a full year of unemployment benefits under a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate announced on Thursday.
Workers are typically only eligible for 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, which cover about half their earnings while they look for new jobs. But six-figure mining jobs won’t be easy to find in the area until Cleveland Cliffs restarts operations at Minorca Mine in Virginia and Hibbing Taconite, raising the prospect that workers would have to move out-of-state.
“We have to make sure that the steelworkers that are laid off at our mines stay in our communities on the Iron Range … for when our mines are ready to get back up and operational,” bill author Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, said on the Senate floor last month.
Doubling unemployment benefits for miners was never in doubt even as Republicans looked to repeal all unemployment benefits for bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other hourly school workers. Republicans championed their own bill extending benefits to laid off miners, and the Democratic version passed off the House floor on Monday 132-0.
That underscores the importance of miners as much to the local Iron Range economy as the state’s identity as the country’s largest producer of iron ore and taconite. It also reflects the rightward shift of the Iron Range, which now sends mostly Republicans to St. Paul to represent its interests.
The number of mining jobs have been steadily eroded by automation, but those that remain are some of the highest paid in the region and support numerous adjacent industries.
Mining giant Cleveland Cliffs announced in March that it would temporarily layoff about 630 workers, who are unionized with the United Steelworkers, as demand for steel in the auto industry cratered under worsening consumer sentiment, high interest rates and tariffs from the Trump administration.
Trump’s trade war has not seemed to dent enthusiasm for tariffs among the laid off steelworkers or Cleveland Cliffs CEO Lourenco Gonclaves.
The Department of Employment and Economic Development estimates the additional benefits will cost the state about $15 million, assuming 630 workers receive $914 a week on average.
Unemployment benefits for hourly school workers cost around $57 million in 2024, helping workers who earn around $17 an hour on average make ends meet through the summer. The state Legislature passed a bill this year that would give school districts an additional $100 million to pay for the benefits, while a Republican effort to repeal the benefits in 2029 failed.
Democrats also hope to extend unemployment benefits to federal employees who are laid off as part of the Trump administration’s assault on the federal workforce. There were only about 200 federal jobs lost in Minnesota last month — many of Trump’s layoffs have been reversed or paused — but state officials said they expect to see a large drop at some point.
Legislators reach impasse over noncompetes 
Lawmakers deadlocked, again, on Thursday over a Republican push to roll back the state’s 2023 ban on noncompete agreements.
Repealing the ban for white collar workers is a top priority for the Minnesota Business Partnership, which includes more than 100 executives of the state’s largest companies. They argue the ban undermines companies’ right to protect valuable trade secrets, even though proprietary information is already protected under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.
The ban’s author Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, said large companies are pushing to restore noncompetes to stifle competition and push down wages.
“It gives them power to restrict their employees from leaving, from going to a competitor, from starting a small business … Trade secrets are actually very well protected,” Greenman said during a meeting between House and Senate members of the jobs “working group” on Thursday.
About one in five American workers — in jobs ranging from medicine to child care — are bound by a noncompete agreement, which costs workers more than $250 billion per year by decreasing competition, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC proposed a national ban on noncompetes under the Biden administration.
Workers in California have famously been able to hop from employer to employer because the state doesn’t enforce noncompete agreements, which Berkeley political scientist AnnaLee Saxenian and other experts have cited as a key factor that fueled the immense, wealth-creating innovation of Silicon Valley.
Rep. Dave Baker, R-Willmar, proposed the working group insert a provision in their larger jobs and labor agreement that would allow companies to enforce noncompete agreements for employees making more than $120,000 and whose primary duties include “research and development or the creation, analysis, or modification of confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information.”
Greenman said the proposal’s vague language was “trojan horse” that would effectively allow companies to require any worker earning more than $120,000 a year to sign a non-compete agreement.
She asked Baker if he could define “confidential” and “proprietary.” Baker said it was “extremely technical,” and then called for a recess, during which he conferred with a lobbyist from the Minnesota Business Partnership in the hallway.
The proposal failed to get enough support to be adopted, as did a Democratic proposal that would have raised the income threshold for the noncompete ban and required companies to pay the full salary of employees during the enforcement period of the noncompete.
Without a deal, the issue will likely be sent to legislative leaders and the governor to find a compromise; lawmakers are already working past Monday’s adjournment to pass a two-year budget. Without a budget by July 1, swathes of the government shutter.
Nurses union accuses hospitals of skimping on charity care

The largest hospital systems in the Twin Cities and Duluth areas receive tens of millions more in tax exemptions than they give back through charity care, according to a report released this week by the Minnesota Nurses Association.
The union estimates seven hospital systems — Allina, Children’s, Essentia, Fairview, HealthPartners, North Memorial and St. Luke’s — received $3.9 billion in federal, state and local tax exemptions between 2018 and 2022 but only spent $607 million in free or reduced cost care for poor patients. The union also estimates hospitals’ spending on charity care relative to their overall budgets has fallen by nearly half on average over the past decade, from .78% in 2013 to .41% in 2022.
“The nation’s earliest hospitals were founded principally by religious and charitable organizations to tend to the sick and poor. Today’s not-for-profit hospitals and systems, often monumentally wealthy and glittering institutions, are their distant cousins,” the report says.
The union is currently negotiating new labor contracts on behalf of some 15,000 nurses with the seven large hospital systems scrutinized in the report. The nurses are seeking higher pay and staffing levels ,and the report serves as a response to health leader’s assertions that their demands are unaffordable. As during the last round of negotiations, the union also takes aim at sky-high hospital executive compensation.
Hospitals will point out that charity care represents just a small fraction of the community benefits they provide, including research, education, contributions to community groups, and losing money on Medicaid patients.
Earlier this year, the state Office of the Legislative Auditor released a report finding that Minnesota’s 104 nonprofit general hospitals appear to give back more to their communities than they receive in tax breaks, although it depends on what is counted as a community benefit, and with the caveat that tax benefits are difficult to estimate.
The OLA report looked at individual hospitals’ finances, whereas MNA analyzed health systems as a whole, which include many hospitals in addition to clinics, pharmacies, assisted living facilities and more. Unlike the MNA report, the OLA report does not account for indirect benefits of hospitals’ tax exempt statuses like being able to issue bonds and receive charitable gifts.
The health care reform think tank Lown Institute used a more limited definition of community benefit when it estimated that 90% of Minnesota’s hospitals receive more in tax breaks than they give back to the community, adding up to a $1.1 billion loss for the state.
Nonprofit hospitals are exempt from taxes on income, property and sales with the expectation that they reinvest those savings back into the community. Minnesota and the federal government require hospitals to report this spending, at least in vague terms, but don’t require a minimum amount of spending in exchange for their tax-exempt status.
The nurses union has sought legislation requiring greater disclosure and more restrictions on community benefits from hospitals.
Colorado governor vetoes pro-union bill
Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bill this month that would have repealed the state’s unique anti-union law that effectively makes it a right-to-work state.
Under Colorado’s 80-year-old Labor Peace Act, unions must win a second election with 75% support in order to collect dues from all represented workers. The law was passed before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which enabled states to pass right-to-work laws banning unions from collecting mandatory dues from all workers represented by their collective bargaining agreements.
Repealing the requirement was a key priority for unions in Colorado, and it passed with wide margins along party lines in the state Legislature. Polis said he wanted unions and businesses to find common ground, and that there should be a “high threshold of worker participation” for mandatory dues.
The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute noted that Colorado’s union density of 7.7% is closer to the 6.2% average for right-to-work states than the 15.8% in non-right-to-work states. In Minnesota, which does not have a right-to-work law, 14.2% of workers are union members.
Minnesota state lawmakers have made it easier in recent years for public sector workers to join a union. Under a 2023 law, a public union may be certified once a majority of workers sign cards in support of unionizing without the need for an election as required in the private sector.
Resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare and the University of Minnesota were able to quickly unionize using this “card check” process. Those workers may not be required to pay union dues, however, because of a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that bars public-sector unions from collecting mandatory fees from workers they represent.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/HibTac-Mine-view.webp,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

High-profile boards, such as those overseeing the port or state-owned utility company, have a long line of hopefuls seeking a position.
But vacancies can linger for lesser-known but not necessarily less important groups.
The Palmetto State has just shy of 300 such boards and advisory groups with about 5,000 politically appointed positions, equivalent to the population of a small South Carolina town, said Brandon Charochak, spokesman for Gov. Henry McMaster.
They make decisions for South Carolinians on a host of issues, including public colleges, historic districts, disease prevention and professional licensing.
There are boards dedicated to the management of aquatic plants and waterfowl habitats, those that oversee operations at specialized K-12 boarding schools, and a group that makes maintenance decisions at the Governor’s Mansion.
Some have less responsibility, rarely meet or simply remain on the books despite being unfunded or out of existence for years.
A long list of vacancies
A list published by the Secretary of State’s office advertises some 425 vacancies, though how many seats are truly open is unclear. The office depends on the boards to keep the list current. Many don’t. At least a third of them don’t actually exist anymore.


How to apply
To be considered for appointment to one of South Carolina’s hundreds of citizen boards and commissions, you can fill out an online interest form to the Governor’s Office here.
A list of vacancies is maintained by the Secretary of State’s Office, though don’t rely on it to be accurate.
Qualifications for each board are listed in the Legislative Manual.
Most appointment decisions are left up to the governor and require confirmation by the Senate.


But for others, lingering openings on boards can have an oversized impact on the lives of South Carolinians.
A seat held for someone with a disabled family member living in a state institution remains unfilled on the Adult Protection Coordinating Council, which is tasked with improving the system of care for people with disabilities.
A doctor and a pathologist are needed for a panel that reviews death investigations for the elderly and disabled living in state-contracted facilities. The Vulnerable Adults Fatalities Review Committee aims to identify trends and prevent future deaths.
Spots for four business people remain unfilled on the Coordinating Council for Workforce Development, a board that comes up with the strategies for training workers needed to fill the many job openings in the state.
A prosecutor, a youth recreation organization, and a special education expert are missing from the Governor’s Juvenile Justice Advisory Council, which is tasked with plans for keeping children out of the juvenile justice system.
The board governing the Conservation Bank, which doles out grants to preserve land from development, has several openings. So does the board that oversees billions in bond financing for hospitals, schools and colleges.
There are also openings on the commission that reviews foster care placements to ensure children have a safe and stable home.
The list goes on.
SC woman sues over ‘racial quota’ for minority affairs board

A call for change
How active a board is depends greatly on how much its members are willing to work, said Seckinger.
Like many who sit on boards, she’s politically connected. Beasley was a family friend even before she and her sister worked on his 1994 campaign for governor. Her brother is state Sen. Chip Campsen, who was first elected to the state House in 1996.
Being known in political circles, combined with a willingness to devote her time, explains why she keeps getting those calls.
“I tend to find myself in the fox hole,” she said.
It’s up to the agency heads to keep things running day to day. A good board, according to Seckinger, does not micromanage but rather comes up with new ideas and thinks about government in terms of what could be.
“Members of the public bring a different perspective to agencies,” she said. “I think there’s wisdom in that different set of eyes.”
For Seckinger, that led to a successful push for public charter schools in the state after she spent time serving on the State Board of Education. And during her time on the Commission for Higher Education, she argued unsuccessfully for changing to a centralized Board of Regents rather than individual college boards, saying it would lead to better scrutiny of college tuition costs and spending.
“Looking with a business mindset, you see things in agencies that don’t make sense or ways to spend less,” Seckinger said. “Because it’s our tax dollars.”
Eliminate them?

The issue of board vacancies even led Gov. Henry McMaster to use his State of the State address this year to call for the review and potential elimination of the state’s more than 40 professional licensing boards. They regulate cosmetologists, construction contractors, chiropractors, real estate agents, nurses, doctors, dentists and more.
If the boards were eliminated, oversight would instead be handled directly by the state’s licensing agency, rather than board appointees.
But the General Assembly ultimately did not oblige that request.
Legislators did, however, combine a trio of health-related state agencies into a single, Cabinet-level agency, eliminating their separate governing and advisory boards.
“We have way too many boards and commissions,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey previously told the SC Daily Gazette. “It’s difficult for the governor to find qualified, interested people to serve. Not because we haven’t tried or think it’s not important.”
The Edgefield Republican was among supporters of consolidating the health agencies to one department overseen by a single director who answers to the governor.
“My position for years has been if you’re going to have a governor, let him be governor,” Massey said.
Beyond that, Massey said, those people who would best serve in these positions are often already too busy.
He recalls long-standing vacancies on the committee that oversees the state’s clay, gold, stone and sand mines. Vacancies have also resulted in boards lacking a quorum, meaning they can’t meet.
‘Not a simple process’
Some lawmakers call SC Arts Commission funding a ‘waste.’ Supporters say it’s essential.

Even boards without vacancies are stacked with people serving well beyond their prescribed term. They’re left in what’s known as holdover status, often for years — some for more than a decade.
Henry Horowitz of Greenville served on the South Carolina Arts Commission for 20 years, six of those as chairman, since being appointed by former Gov. Mark Sanford. While not an artist himself, Horowitz has been heavily involved in the arts, serving on half a dozen boards and founding the Artisphere festival in Greenville.
This year, he said, he told McMaster it was time to find someone new for the small but influential state board that last year distributed $18.4 million to support the arts, from emerging artists to Charleston’s long-running Spoleto festival.
His replacement is among five new members of the nine-member arts commission confirmed by the Senate earlier this month. All five are replacing people who had been serving six years or more past the expiration of their terms.
In all, the Senate made about 75 confirmations and reconfirmations to boards and commissions this year. More than a dozen other nominees went unconfirmed before the 2025 legislative session officially ended May 8.
Horowitz, like Seckinger, only knew of the opening in 2005 because the governor called him.
People can apply online, but those without political connections may not know the vacancies — or the boards themselves — exist.
“It’s hard to get on a board when you’re not aware of them,” he said. “Therefore, people don’t get invited.”
Many of these board members are not paid for their time beyond covering travel expenses. The screening involves a financial and criminal history check and hearings before Senate committees. Horowitz also recalls having to submit five letters of recommendation when he applied.
“It’s not a simple process,” he said.
Charochak, the governor’s spokesman, said it’s common for applicants to drop out once they find out about the six-month to year-long procedure.
“That’s truly the main issue we have,” he said.
The impact of vacancies
SC woman who killed her abuser again denied parole after nearly 5 years in prison

A state parole board decision last fall — when those supporting a woman’s release included her local legislator, police chief and solicitor — serves as an example of how vacancies and absences on a board can make a real difference in people’s lives.
If one more board member had been present, the Greenwood mother of five imprisoned for killing her abuser may have been released after nearly five years behind bars.
One parole board seat remains unfilled some eight months later.
McMaster pointed to another case in making his argument for doing away with independent governing boards at the state’s mental health and disabilities agencies. A lawsuit filed in December by the U.S. Department of Justice accuses the state of keeping adults with serious mental illnesses in institutions longer than necessary. It was filed 17 months after federal authorities warned a lawsuit was imminent if nothing changed.
McMaster said putting the governor’s office in charge would allow whoever’s governor to respond and hold people more accountable when things go wrong.
But advocates for these populations are less certain.
Bill Lindsey, who heads South Carolina’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said having mental health commissioners from each congressional district gave families direct access to decision makers when issues arose. While agency employees set policy, commissioners can serve as advocates.
Margie Williamson agreed. She’s spent the last 15 years leading a nonprofit advocacy group in Columbia for people with developmental disabilities, called The Arc of South Carolina.
“Speaking as a parent, I had somebody who represented my child,” she said. “Otherwise, in the agency, (those with disabilities) can get lost, being seen as just a number and not a person.”
DOJ sues SC over claims of warehousing people with mental illness

With more than 20,000 people with disabilities on a waiting list for state services, Williamson is worried more people will slip through the cracks. Coupled with a multitude of proposed cuts to federal aid programs and possibly Medicaid, she said the lack of certainty has become overwhelming.
Lindsey said he’s hopeful, even as the Department of Mental Health is folded into a larger Cabinet agency, that the commission will remain intact in an advisory capacity, keeping family members informed of what’s going on as the agency restructures.
Lindsey also said he was surprised by the legal action taken by the U.S. Department of Justice. While there was still more work to be done to improve the quality of housing for those transitioning out of mental health hospitals, he had felt the state had made great strides.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2074-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-23 14:23:58+00:00,Mississippi Today,78-year-old death row inmate pins hope of reprieve on timing and PTSD,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/23/78-year-old-death-row-inmate-pins-hope-of-reprieve-on-timing-and-ptsd/,Vietnam War vet Richard Jordan's crime and sentence came after the U.S. Supreme Court said capital punishment was unconstitutional.,"In the remaining weeks before his scheduled execution, Richard Jordan, Mississippi’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, is looking for ways to fight his death sentence. 
Jordan was sentenced to death for the kidnap and murder of Gulfport resident Edwina Marter in January 1976. Marter’s sons, who were 3 and 9 at the time of her death, and her husband are still alive, according to public records. About a decade ago, her family told The Advocate they were hoping to receive closure from the execution after years of its delay. 
The decision to let the execution proceed rests in the hands of the Mississippi Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court and a federal district court judge – two courts that have rejected his previous requests and a judge who has allowed another execution to be carried out while a challenge to the state’s execution protocol continues. 
Attorneys filed two motions asking the Mississippi Supreme Court to rehear its denial of the 78-year-old’s petition for post conviction relief and to rehear its order setting his execution. 
They wrote that when the court denied his post-conviction relief petition, it “misapprehended the facts and the law.” To fix it, Jordan asked the court to vacate his death sentence or at a minimum return it to the trial court for another look. 
His attorneys argue Jordan’s death sentence is not valid because in 1976, when the murder was committed and Jordan was sentenced, Mississippi and all other states had ceased executions based on a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia that capital punishment was unconstitutional. 
On July 2, 1976, four months after Jordan was sentenced, the Supreme Court overturned this ruling in Gregg v. Georgia. Mississippi passed a statute allowing discretionary death penalty sentences in 1977.
“Here, because there was no constitutional provision for the death penalty at the time of Jordan’s offense, his death sentence is unconstitutional,” the May 15 filing states. 
Jordan went to trial multiple times and his sentences were overturned. His death sentence did not stick until decades later in 1998. Since his first trial, Jordan has been incarcerated for nearly 50 years. 
In another recent court filing, Jordan’s attorneys argue the state’s motion to set Jordan’s execution didn’t follow state law because he has not exhausted all state and federal remedies. 
Jordan asked the U.S. Supreme Court in March to hear his case. As of May, that petition for writ of certiorari is awaiting a decision. The state opposes and has asked the high court not to take up Jordan’s petition, saying the Mississippi Supreme Court was correct in its ruling. 
That petition centers around his access to a mental health expert separate from the prosecution to develop and present sentencing mitigation as an indigent defendant, which was established as a constitutional right through the U.S. Supreme Court’s Ake v. Oklahoma decision. The other issue is how the Mississippi Supreme Court handled Jordan’s Ake claims in his appeal and post-conviction. 
At trial, Jordan was evaluated by a state psychiatrist whose report was also given to the prosecution, which his attorneys argue undermined his mitigation case since the Ake decision specified the evaluation was to be used on the indigent defendant’s behalf.
The petition states he was not diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his combat service in Vietnam, but instead incorrectly as having antisocial personality disorder. 
“Review of that decision is manifestly warranted to ensure appropriate respect for this Court’s decisions, vindicate the supremacy of federal law, and ensure that those defendants in Mississippi whose mental health will be an issue at trial receive the right to the expert assistance to which the Due Process Clause entitles them,” the March court filing states. 
Additionally, Jordan and fellow death row inmate Ricky Chase are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the drugs used for lethal injection. 
Since 2022, the state has since added alternative execution methods if lethal injection drugs aren’t available: execution by gas chamber, electrocution or firing squad. To date, a handful of states have used these other methods, including the use of nitrogen gas in Alabama and firing squad in South Carolina. 
The Mississippi lawsuit did not stop the December 2022 execution of Thomas Loden, another inmate who was part of the legal challenge. 
The same day Jordan’s attorneys filed motions with the Mississippi Supreme Court, Jordan and Chase filed a motion with U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate, asking for him to order the state to provide essential documents to the plaintiffs about the state’s possession and planned use of execution drugs as well as documents related to the most recent executions of David Cox in 2021 and Loden. 
Plaintiffs wrote that access to this information would help them seek an injunction to stay Jordan’s execution and help with discovery, which is the process of obtaining evidence from other parties before trial. Trial for the lawsuit has been scheduled for Dec. 1, 2025. 
“It is unconscionable for Defendants to seek the execution of Richard Jordan while continuing to stonewall Plaintiffs’ repeated demands for supplementation of discovery in this case,” a May 14 court filing states.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/22091856/Mina-RichardJordan-FeatImage-04.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)Amid ongoing raids in Florida immigrant communities, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signed a bill Thursday creating an avenue for relief against people unlawfully providing immigration legal services.
HB 915, one of 17 bills DeSantis signed Thursday, prohibits notaries public from advertising their services using language that implies they possess professional legal skills in immigration law. Notaries public are authorized to serve as witnesses and verify signatures on documents such as powers of attorney, deeds, and estates.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst with Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a phone interview that the group sought help from lawmakers in addressing the problem of notaries public providing immigration legal services, which he described as an epidemic in Central and South Florida. He called the signing of the new law good news.
“This is happening all over the place. People are very, very desperate for some sort of solution or adjustment of status that leaves them vulnerable for people that are preying on them,” Kennedy said, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in Florida at risk of deportation after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this week allowing the Trump administration to strip the immigrants of temporary protections and work permits.
A series of special sessions at the beginning of the year yielded hundreds of millions for local law enforcement to engage in immigration enforcement, plus new laws heightening penalties for immigrants living in the country without authorization. However, during the regular legislative session, lawmakers didn’t pass other proposals cracking down on legal aid for immigrant children and companies hiring people unauthorized to work in the country.
But nearly all lawmakers agreed to pass the bill from Orlando Democratic Rep. Johanna López, allowing people to recover damages in civil lawsuits from notaries public providing representation in immigration law matters.
Further, notaries public won’t be able to refer to themselves as “notario público,” the term in Spanish, because in some Latin American countries “notarios” can file legal documents, give legal advice, and represent people in court, according to the final legislative analysis of the bill.
Still, Kennedy said passing a pro-immigrant law in this climate was no easy feat.
“I guess common sense prevailed in this matter,” he said.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge David Joseph in the Western District of Louisiana, Lake Charles division, ordered the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to rewrite employer guidelines in a pregnant workers protection law, according to court documents.
The statute requires employers with 15 or more staff to provide reasonable accommodations — think time off for appointments, additional rest breaks, a stool to sit on while working — for pregnancy, childbirth or related conditions, as long as the requests don’t place “undue hardship” on the company or organization.
Joseph, who Republican President Donald Trump appointed during his first term. He ruled that former Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration exceeded its authority by including abortion in rules finalized last year.
“This court’s decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women’s rights and reproductive freedom,” said Inimai Chettiar, the president of paid leave advocacy group A Better Balance, in a statement.

The ruling is a victory for state officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and a group of Catholic Church organizations.Plaintiffs sued the EEOC over the inclusion of abortion in the guidelines, which the agency released in April 2024 following a lengthy public comment process, Illuminator reported.
Roughly 54,000 Americans said abortion should be excluded from the definition of “pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,” while some 40,000 said pregnancy termination should be included.
Lawyers for the states — both have near-total abortion bans — argued the rule doesn’t align with the Dobbs v. Women’s Health Organization decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, while Catholic groups said the abortion provision violates freedom of religion.
“This is a win for Louisiana and for life,” Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media.
Several other lawsuits against the law are in play. A federal judge ruled in April that a separate group of Catholic employers do not have to protect their employees’ access to abortion and fertility treatments, North Dakota Monitor reported.
In February, another judge ruled that a lawsuit filed by 17 GOP attorneys general against the EEOC over abortion accommodations in the workplace can move forward, according to The Associated Press.
And the Texas government and its agencies don’t have to comply with any part of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. A judge temporarily blocked the law’s enforcement in February 2024 after the attorney general argued it was unconstitutionally passed in December 2022 by proxy vote, The Texas Tribune reported.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/abortionpills.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current))Lawmakers are looking to pass a law that would require utilities to fully refund energy customers who are overcharged, closing loopholes that have allowed utilities to withhold full refunds from wronged customers.
Assembly Bill 452, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May, would ensure customers receive full refunds with interest for overcharges, address high utility bills by shifting some cost volatility back to utilities, and extending regulatory timelines for rate case reviews.
The bill comes after years of customer complaints detailing partial refunds by NV Energy which is only required to reimburse customers up to six months prior to the data the error is discovered in certain cases. 
Last week the bill became more relevant than ever after state utility regulators disclosed that over several years NV Energy overcharged more than 80,000 customers over $17 million, with only 20,000 receiving partial six-month refunds that amount to a fraction of what customers overpaid.
Following the disclosure, NV Energy’s president and CEO stepped down amid a call from regulatory staff at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission for an investigation into whether NV Energy used an inapplicable rule to cap refunds at six months.
Several advocacy groups said the disclosure that the statewide electric utility overcharged tens of thousands of customers for years only highlighted the need for the bill’s passage. 
“It is outrageous that NV Energy would harm so many customers like this and not report it or fully repay them,” said Audrey Peral, program director of Chispa Nevada in a statement. “Nevada lawmakers must pass Assembly Bill 452 quickly to protect utility customers from these kinds of abuses. Hard-working families can’t keep paying the price for NV Energy’s wrongdoing.”
Under the bill, “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any applicable rate or tariff allows, the utility shall refund to the customer,  with interest, the full amount of any overcharge.”
The bill passed the Assembly on a 35-7 vote in April, with some bipartisan support. Under legislative deadlines, the bill would need to pass the Senate Friday.
The bill is also supported by the Nevada Bureau of Consumer Protection, which said in a letter to lawmakers the bill would ensure “a full and equitable refund to ratepayers who are unfairly overcharged.”
However, the bill has been strongly opposed by NV Energy, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. 
Ryan Bellows, the vice president of government and external relations at NV energy, told lawmakers last week that the statewide electric utility complies with Nevada Public Utilities Commission approved rules on customer refunds.
“The rule is that it’s a six month payment back to the customer. We are currently communicating with the commission on this issue, on how to address and improve and correct this rule going forward,” Bellows said, adding that any changes to the rule is best left to utility regulators.
The Nevada Public Utilities Commission disputes NV Energy’s interpretation of the rules on customer refunds, telling lawmakers the issue is currently being examined by the Commission’s consumer complaint resolution division.
Garrett Weir, general counsel for the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said the bill and “the proposed change to statute would certainly clarify” the rules on customer refunds.
 Price spikes and cost sharing

NV Energy also opposes other aspects of the bill, especially language that would direct utility regulators to potentially adopt a fuel cost-sharing structure so ratepayers are not left covering the full cost of fuel price spikes caused by global events or weather disasters.
“It’s our position that the adoption of fuel cost sharing would lead to increased costs for customers,” Bellows said.
The bill would ask utility regulators to investigate how to best navigate energy price spikes and to study if fuel cost sharing is in the best interest of Nevadans and the utility. State energy regulators would submit a report on their investigation to the Interim Committee on Growth and Infrastructure by July 1, 2026.
Nevada law prohibits utilities from profiting from fuel and purchased power costs, however in Nevada every dollar NV Energy spends to purchase fuel is passed fully through to customers. Fuel accounts for about one-third of NV Energy customer costs.
Bellows argued revisions to price spike policies are unnecessary because NV Energy does not mark up purchases and the Public Utilities Commission has the authority to deny cost recovery for any purchases deemed imprudent.
“I would tell you that the purpose of this bill is really to prevent us from utilizing natural gas to serve our customers and to build out Nevada’s energy infrastructure for economic development,” Bellows said. 
NV Energy is heavily reliant on out-of-state natural gas sources, which have seen sporadic but sharp price fluctuations in recent years.  In 2022, the price it paid for natural gas — which accounts for more than half of Nevada’s power supply —  spiked by 70% in January 2023, according to NV Energy.
Several unions and trades groups echoed concerns about the bill’s potential negative impact on economic development and job opportunities, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Building and Construction Trades Council of Northern Nevada, and the National Electrical Contractors Association.
Nevada residents who spoke in favor of the bill’s language to investigate a potential cost-sharing structure highlighted the financial strain on families and seniors due to rising energy costs.
“I hear from families and seniors who are stretched to their breaking point by high energy bills. They’re cutting back on life saving air conditioning, skipping meals, rationing medicine, and they’re still falling behind. For those living on low income and fixed income, the cycle of high bills is relentless and dangerous,” said Mary House, co-founder of a local faith-based nonprofit community organization called Caring, Helping & Restoring Lives.
Conservation groups and energy advocates emphasized the bill’s potential to reduce high utility bills, promote clean energy, and ensure consumer protection. 
The bill is supported by Advanced Energy United, Western Resource Advocates, the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, and the Sierra Club.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NVEnergy_RC_004.JPG-ronda-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 10:01:09.334746

The Supreme Judicial Court decided against adopting a rule that would allow an employer to retaliate for union activity just because they met the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
The post Pay increase doesn’t undercut union retaliation claim in Newton, SJC rules appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MONEY CAN’T BUY LOVE, according to the saying. It also can’t buy an employer the right to take action against a worker that, on its own, would qualify as illegal retaliation.  That is the essence of a Supreme Judicial Court ruling issued Thursday in a dispute between the City of Newton and a sergeant on the city’s police force. A state board correctly concluded that transferring a Newton police sergeant, who also serves as a union leader, to night and weekend shifts was illegal retaliation for his union activities, the state’s high court ruled. It can be retaliation, the SJC said, even though the officer had a blemished work history and the new position came with a pay raise. John Babcock was transferred from his six-year position as a specialty sergeant working regular daytime hours with weekends and holidays off to a sergeant position working irregular nighttime hours, weekends, and holidays.   This transfer, in 2018, came after union-related activities lead to some disputes with city’s chief of police, David MacDonald. The city argued, and a lower court agreed, that the shift change came with a “significant” pay raise in line with the union’s collective bargaining agreement, so it doesn’t count as an adverse employment action – or something an employer does that negatively impacts terms or conditions of employment.  In its opinion and during arguments in March, the SJC skewered that logic. It was a shift from a “more humane schedule” for a man with a family, as Justice Serge Georges put, to a “crazy schedule with half days” according to Justice Frank Gaziano. “We decline to adopt a rule that would allow an employer that takes such materially disadvantageous action against an employee in retaliation for union activity to evade the protections [of state law], because the employer also complies with the terms bargained for as part of a collective bargaining agreement,” wrote Justice Dalila Wendlandt for a unanimous SJC on Thursday. Babcock’s history with department leadership was messy, as laid out by the court’s decision.  He was promoted up through the traffic division over the decades while serving in leadership positions with local police unions, finally receiving promotion to sergeant specialist in the traffic bureau in 2012. Babcock became union negotiator for city contracts and then president of the superior officers union, while MacDonald was an executive officer and later chief of police for the city. Over the years, the court noted, the two had “several disputes.” On the union side, contract negotiations got heated, the two clashed over a proposed change to special leave policy, and Babcock challenged MacDonald’s authority to place a bargaining unit member on paid administrative leave and immediately order the member to take a psychological test. The city failed to properly bargain over the fitness requirements that could have involved an on-the-spot psychological test, an appeals court declared in 2021 when reviewing the case. While the union’s challenge to the psychological test continued, Babcock was running into issues with his role overseeing paid details, where off-duty police officers are hired for vendors in the city.  Citing overstaffing problems, MacDonald removed Babcock from detail staffing, but Babcock continued to “cause confusion in the detail system and to overstaff police details” according to the city’s brief, and continued offering opinions on detail staffing even when told expressly to refrain from doing so. The city provided no evidence that Babcock continued to be involved in traffic details after the order, the SJC wrote. Babcock also got into a verbal altercation with a subordinate, according to the court, yelling at a parking control officer and bringing her to tears. MacDonald issued a letter of reprimand in late March 2018, warning that “further misconduct by you may result in additional discipline.” A month later, MacDonald informed Babcock he would be transferred to the patrol bureau working night shifts with an 8 percent pay raise. The police union filed a charge arguing that the transfer was retaliatory and barred by law. While a hearing officer agreed that Babcock had made a case for retaliation, the officer dismissed the claim because the city had produced evidence of Babcock’s insubordination and misconduct as a reason for the transfer.  But the Commonwealth Employment Relations Board (CERB) disagreed on appeal, deciding that the city had not provided enough evidence to support a reasonable conclusion that Babcock was transferred because of the poor conduct. The board concluded the union proved its case, and ordered Babcock reinstated to his day shift position.  The Appeals Court, reviewing the board’s decision, considered whether the union had to prove that Babcock had a generally good work record, whether the pay increase defeated the claim of an adverse employment action, and whether the city proved that the motive for Babcock’s transfer was because of work performance and not union activity. A unanimous Appeals Court decision written by Justice Gabrielle Wolohojian – now a justice of the SJC who did not participate in Thursday’s opinion – concluded that the good work record showing was not necessary, but the board should not have allowed the claim to go forward because the transfer came with the pay raise negotiated under the union’s collective bargaining agreement. Further, she wrote, the city offered “circumstantial evidence” to prove that the transfer was for lawful reasons. A lateral transfer can be considered an adverse employment action if it results in material differences in “any term or condition of employment.” Since the night shift move came with the pay raise laid out under the union’s collective bargaining agreement, the union did not prove that the transfer was a significant departure from the terms of the agreement. “We, of course, do not minimize the importance of family life or the effect that a change in work schedule may have on it,” Wolohojian wrote. “But that is not the question here, which instead turns on whether the union established an objective material change in the terms and conditions of Babcock’s employment.” She said it is also important to consider “the inherent authority of police chiefs to assign officers to duties and schedules as they see fit to preserve public safety.”  Other police unions balked. “If the Appeals Court’s decision is permitted to stand,” the Boston police officers union wrote to the high court in support of the transferred officer, “it will grant public employers with license to retaliate against employees who engage in concerted, protected activity by transferring them to undesirable assignments involving non-traditional hours of work and effectively eviscerate the ability of public employees and/or their exclusive bargaining representatives to prove that the employer’s actions were unlawfully motivated.” The SJC disagreed with Wolohojian’s logic. The collective bargaining agreement may have made the day-to-night transfer “more palatable,” Wendlandt wrote, but there is still clearly a material disadvantage to being forced to work nights and weekends when previously working day shifts with weekends off. A transfer that complies with the collective bargaining agreement, she wrote, can still cause legal harm. The difference between these shifts is underlined, she noted, because transferring a sergeant or lieutenant from a specialty assignment had never been done before in the Newton Police Department.  That there was misconduct is only relevant if it is concretely tied to the decision to transfer the officer, Wendlandt noted. Nothing in the court’s history, she wrote, shows “that an employer is free to retaliate against an employee for union activities because the employee’s employment record is blemished.” The city did show that there was a history of insubordination by Babcock, the SJC agreed, but it offered no evidence that the incidents factored into the decision to transfer him, even after the incident with the parking control officer.  “The city produced no evidence of any misconduct by Babcock following the letter of reprimand,” Wendlandt wrote. “The only evidence in the record related to MacDonald’s transfer decision was that when Babcock asked MacDonald for an explanation, Babcock did not receive one.” The post Pay increase doesn’t undercut union retaliation claim in Newton, SJC rules appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5F65B303-7231-4027-9244-80F95C116CD9-scaled-e1715032375383.jpeg?fit=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 10:01:09.334746

(AJ Dome for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Drought-stricken governments in west-central Kansas have escalated their fight for water rights from state to federal court, which could impact how cities across the state handle future disputes.
The cities of Hays and Russell, located in neighboring counties just off of Interstate 70 near the middle of the state, sued the nearby Edwards County in 2024 for blocking a planned water transfer. The cities do not have enough water to supply future residents. They concocted a plan beginning in 1995 with the purchase of the 7,000-acre R9 Ranch in Edwards County. The ranch contains 32 water rights the cities wanted to use for their public water supply.
The cities say the county has been opposed to the project since before the property was purchased, but county officials have cited concerns over a large amount of water being transferred out of a prominent agricultural community.
In district court filings, the cities said Edwards County deliberately thwarted their plans through zoning regulations, a rigged planning committee and other hurdles. After years of fighting, a decision from the district court was delayed, and a case record filled with a 30-year history of newspaper clippings, meeting minutes and government documents turned into a constitutional debate.
Attorneys for Edwards County moved the case to federal court in late March after the cities modified their petition for relief to include claims under federal law. Hays and Russell want it moved back to district court, attorneys said in a May 15 filing. County attorneys want the case thrown out entirely.
“Despite holding this land for thirty-years and a stated desperate and urgent need for additional water supplies, Plaintiffs have only just now brought suit seeking to declare a set of ordinances and regulations enacted by the Board of County Commissioners of Edwards County, Kansas as unconstitutional and unenforceable against Plaintiff,” county attorneys wrote in a February district court filing that was transferred in April to federal court.
The cities evaluated other options for municipal water supply for years before beginning the process in 2014 to transfer the R9 Ranch’s water. They have rooted their case in a 1918 Kansas Supreme Court decision that said “city authorities may go wherever it is practicable and necessary to obtain the supply of water for the people of the city.”
Sending the case back to state court is appropriate, the cities’ attorneys argued, “because Kansas State law claims significantly predominate over federal claims in this proceeding, and judicial economy and fairness support litigating this matter in Kansas State district and appellate courts.”
Plus, they said, the cities have two related cases already navigating their ways through the state court system — one before the Kansas Supreme Court and another before the state Water Transfer Panel, which determines whether certain large-scale water transfers can take place.
Roughly 10 years ago, officials in Hays and Russell were ready to begin bringing their plan for the R9 Ranch into fruition, so they requested to change the ranch’s water use permissions from irrigation to municipal use. Local irrigators responded in kind, fearing the cities would take up too much of the area’s water reserves. And Edwards County, too, responded with concerns, which the cities saw as blockades. County officials expressed worry over transferring a large amount of water away from their agricultural community.
In 2024, the county established new zoning regulations, which the cities’ lawyers called “unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, draconian, highly subjective, and blatantly protectionist permitting requirements.”
The cities’ plan isn’t a one-off. As jurisdictions across Kansas and the western U.S. confront dwindling water supplies because of climate change, overconsumption and aging or inadequate infrastructure, litigators and water officials view the case as having the potential to set the stage, depending on the outcome.
Drought outlooks in the three counties range from moderate to abnormally dry, the lowest drought classification, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor map published Thursday. Ellis County, home to Hays, is entirely in the abnormally dry category, while Russell and Edwards counties contain both abnormally dry and moderate drought predictions.
Hays and Russell get their water from the Dakota Aquifer, the Smoky Hill River and Big Creek, which branches off of the Smoky Hill River, according to public water source data from the Kansas Water Office.
Even as the population has fluctuated in Hays, leading to a slight overall increase in residents, daily water usage has decreased. In 2024, the city’s 21,000 residents used an estimated 86 gallons of water per day. In 2010, the city’s 20,500 residents used about 91 gallons per day. At its highest, residents used 101 gallons daily in 2012, and at its lowest, they used 76 gallons daily in 2020 and 2021.
At every Russell City Council meeting, council members hear updated drought predictions, precipitation outlooks and temperature estimates. In January, the city of Russell found that water conditions had improved, which led to Mayor Jim Cross reducing the town’s water watch severity from stage two to stage one. Stage one includes forbidding the waste of water and a prohibition on public and residential outdoor watering during the daytime.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican leadership created a water task force during the 2025 legislative session to shape state water policy and establish a reliable funding source for water conservation efforts.
Hays, Russell and Edwards County are awaiting a decision from a federal judge on where the case continues.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/smoky-river-salina-photo-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 10:01:09.334746

With the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season expected to bring more frequent and intense storms, Delaware officials are urging residents to prepare now, as Governor Matt Meyer has declared May 26–30 as Hurricane Preparedness Week in coordination with DEMA and local agencies.
The warning comes amid record-breaking global temperatures. The World Meteorological Organization confirmed 2024 as the hottest year on record, extending a decade-long trend of rising land, ocean, and sea surface temperatures. These changes, along with increasing sea levels, pose heightened risks for low-lying states like Delaware.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s hurricane season, which officially runs from June 1 to November 30, is expected to be more active than usual, with an above-average chance of major hurricanes making landfall along the Eastern Seaboard. Forecasts from Colorado State University anticipate 17 named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes, surpassing the 30-year average.
“The time to mitigate against storm-related damage is before Hurricane season begins,” said A.J. Schall, Director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. 
“PrepareDe.org empowers everyone to plan for all potentialities by being informed and storm ready. While the fallout from extreme weather can be unpredictable, there are simple ways everyone can plan for the unexpected,” said Schall. “Have a meetup plan for families that kids understand; shore up your home, windows, and landscaped environments; review, print and back up insurance documents, and make a go bag with basic necessities. Always follow evacuation orders and check in with your neighbors and the elderly who may need assistance in emergency situations.”
Officials stress that water remains the deadliest element in hurricanes, with storm surge and inland flooding accounting for most fatalities. As the frequency and strength of storms increase, Delaware residents are encouraged to make emergency plans, assemble supply kits, and stay informed.
DEMA’s preparedness website, PrepareDE.org, provides resources for developing evacuation plans, building emergency kits, and accessing real-time alerts. Residents are also encouraged to check their flood risk, review insurance policies, and plan for pets, seniors, and individuals with special needs.
For emergency alerts, residents can sign up for the Delaware Emergency Notification System (DENS) and download the FEMA app for weather updates. Local officials advise monitoring television, radio, and social media for evacuation notices and storm tracking information.
Hurricane Preparedness Week is part of a broader effort to ensure Delawareans are equipped to face increasingly volatile weather. The state’s emergency management infrastructure, led by DEMA within the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, coordinates response and recovery efforts to minimize damage and safeguard lives.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hurricane-DE-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-05-23 10:01:09.334746

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Before adjourning their regular session for the year, Alaska legislators passed 33 bills through both the House and Senate. Two were vetoed before lawmakers left the Capitol. One of those became the subject of the first successful veto override since 2009.
Here’s a look at what’s passed and is headed to Gov. Mike Dunleavy for final approval or rejection.
Education took top billing
Except for the budget, no subject took more of the Legislature’s attention than education. In April, lawmakers passed House Bill 69, which would have increased the base student allocation — core of the state’s per-student funding formula for public schools — by $1,000 per student. 
Dunleavy vetoed that bill days later, which caused legislators to switch their attention to House Bill 57, an alternative proposal that had a $700 BSA increase and some policy measures proposed by the governor. The House and Senate passed that in late April, but Dunleavy vetoed that bill, too. On Monday, legislators overrode that veto by six votes, marking the first time since 2009 that the Legislature has overridden a governor’s veto and the first time since 2002 that it did so to a sitting governor.
Legislators also passed Senate Bill 95 and Senate Bill 96, which would create a tax credit program that rewards companies that invest in child care programs for their workers. It also offers a new grant program for child care and expands the number of families eligible for child care assistance from the state.
The Legislature passed both of those bills last year but had to redo them this year because of a legal challenge. These new versions have yet to be considered by the governor.
Budget and finances on the table
The veto override for HB 57 likely won’t be the last word on education. The new education formula in HB 57 is subject to funding through the state operating budget, House Bill 53. Dunleavy has the ability to veto line items from the budget, and overriding his decisions on that document would take 45 votes, not the 40 it took to override him on HB 57.
In addition, a part of the education bill is contingent upon the enactment of Senate Bill 113, which changes the way the state handles corporate income taxes assessed on internet businesses. It doesn’t increase taxes, but it does divert revenue from other states to Alaska’s treasury, and Dunleavy implied on Monday that he would veto that bill because he doesn’t view it as a stable way to pay for part of the education bill.
In addition to HB 53, the operating budget, lawmakers also passed House Bill 55, the state’s comprehensive mental health budget, and Senate Bill 57, the state’s capital budget, which is used to pay for construction and renovation projects across the state.
Because of low oil prices and the Legislature’s reluctance to pass new revenue measures, all three budget bills were smaller this year than last year.
Few services will see budget increases, and this year’s Permanent Fund dividend is $1,000, down from $1,403 last year. Alaskans received another $298 last year as a one-time bonus atop the regular dividend.
Help for tourism
Early in the legislative session, lawmakers approved a bill that allows the state-owned Alaska Railroad to borrow money for a new cruise ship dock in Seward. The Legislature passed an identical bill last year, but it was one of five that Dunleavy vetoed, citing the fact that the House voted on it after the legal end of the legislative session. This time around, the governor had no problem signing the bill into law.
The governor also signed SB 15, another after-midnight bill that was redone by the Legislature. That law allows teens as young as 18 to serve alcohol in restaurants, breweries and distilleries, but not package stores or bars. Teens as young as 16 may work in those places but not serve alcohol. The measure was intended to increase the labor force during the summer tourism season.
Legislators also cleared up a long-running tax dispute involving the car-sharing company Turo by passing a bill that requires Turo to collect and remit the state’s car rental tax. Turo rentals are a common feature of the summer tourist season.
Previously, individual car owners who rented out their cars through Turo were required to independently account for and send in their taxes. State records show few people followed that procedure.
The Legislature passed a different version of the bill last year, and Dunleavy vetoed it. The new version cuts the state’s car rental tax and institutes an even lower tax for Turo users.
This version has not yet been examined by the governor.
Changes for commercial fishers
Following some of the recommendations of the state’s seafood task force, legislators passed three bills dealing with commercial fishing.
Commercial fishers who form cooperatives to collectively pay liability and damage claims would see these payments be exempted from being regulated as insurance if House Bill 116 becomes law. At least three co-ops are already operating in the state, but under Washington state law.
House Bill 31 would exempt many commercial fishing boats from the requirement that they register with the state Division of Motor Vehicles. The exemption applies only to Coast Guard-documented boats with a current license from the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.
Alaska’s Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank would receive a small grant from a defunct state loan fund, allowing the bank to issue low-interest loans to fishers. The Legislature passed the change, recommended by the seafood task force, in Senate Bill 156.
All three bills have yet to cross the governor’s desk for final review.
Tablet computers in prisons
Alaska is one of the last states to forbid prison inmates from regularly using tablet computers. House Bill 35, passed by the Legislature, would change that by instituting rules for tablet use. The bill was encouraged as a means of rehabilitation and education for people in Alaska’s prisons but the 33rd Legislature failed to pass it. Reintroduced this year, the idea moved quickly.
Ban on payday loans
After failing to pass a ban on high-interest, short-term loans during the 33rd Legislature, lawmakers in the first year of the 34th Legislature rapidly passed and advanced Senate Bill 39, which eliminates an exemption from the state’s normal lending laws.
If enacted, SB 39 would restrict loans to a maximum 36% annual percentage rate. Many payday loans have annual interest rates that amount to several hundred percent.
The bill has not yet been sent to the governor.
Insurance and accounting updates
Alaska’s insurance laws are in line to receive significant updates under two bills that the House and Senate passed this year. Senate Bill 133 regulates the prior authorization process used by doctors and other medical specialists when getting permission from an insurance company before undertaking a procedure on a patient. If enacted, it’s designed to speed up the medical treatment process, and the state’s division of insurance is required to keep statistics on how well the changes are working.
The House and Senate also passed a broader insurance bill, Senate Bill 132, that includes a series of minor changes to the state’s insurance laws. It was amended late in the process to include components of a separate bill regulating pharmacy benefit managers.
Accountants also got some attention from the Legislature this year with the passage of House Bill 121, which eases the work requirements for new accountants to become certified to work in Alaska.
None of the three bills have yet been considered by the governor.
Encouraging local housing growth
The Legislature voted to encourage local governments to make long-term housing plans by passing Senate Bill 50, which amends state law to say that boroughs’ comprehensive plans may include housing development. Comprehensive plans are long-term planning documents that set expectations for a borough’s growth and future.
The bill hasn’t yet reached the governor’s desk.
Changes for big-game guides
After more than a decade of work, the Alaska Legislature passed Senate Bill 97, which changes the way the state regulates big game hunting guides. If enacted, SB 97 would permit the state to limit the number of hunting guides in a specific area by selling hunting concessions, much like the federal government already does on federal land in Alaska.
SB 97 was the result of a yearlong process in 2023 by the state’s Big Game Commercial Services Board, which formed a task force to make recommendations and conclusions.
The bill has not yet been sent to the governor for final approval.
Stricter audit procedures by the Legislature
Amid a long-running dispute with the executive branch, the Alaska Legislature passed Senate Bill 183, which would require state officials to turn over data in the format requested by the legislative auditor.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXLegislators say that since 2019, they have been unable to properly audit the part of the Alaska Department of Revenue that audits tax payments by oil and gas companies.
The executive branch, legislators and audit officials say, has refused to compile reports that it previously provided without difficulty.
As a result, legislators don’t know whether the Department of Revenue is cheaply settling tax disputes with oil companies.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, each sent a letter to Dunleavy, asking him to not veto the bill because of its importance.
The governor has yet to take final action.
No inflation-adjusted raises for state executives
Early in the session, the Legislature voted unanimously to reject a recommendation that the pay of legislators and other top state officials be automatically adjusted for inflation each year.
Dunleavy signed that bill into law on March 6. 
Small changes to state laws
The House and Senate passed a handful of bills that make relatively small changes to state laws. In each case, these changes were requested by Alaskans who ran into trouble and asked for help from their legislators.
House Bill 70, for example, would allow ambulance crews to help some police and rescue dogs who are injured on the job and need to be taken to a veterinarian. Existing law allows bystanders to help, but not certified medical technicians.
Some laws pertaining to the Permanent Fund dividend division, which handles the annual distribution of PFDs, would be updated if House Bill 75 becomes law.
The state’s rural school fund would be able to pay for teacher housing and Mount Edgecumbe High School in Sitka if House Bill 174 becomes law. Currently, MEHS isn’t eligible for grants from the rural school fund under the process used by other rural schools.
Senate Bill 47 clears the way for the Municipality of Anchorage to use local money to pay for pothole repairs on Canyon Road, within Chugach State Park. Those repairs are currently blocked by state law.
All four bills have yet to receive consideration by Dunleavy, who may veto them, allow them to become law without his signature, or sign them into law.
Boards and commissions extended
Alaska has dozens of boards and commissions that regulate various professions and industries, and each of those boards needs to be regularly reauthorized by the Legislature. This year, because of a lawsuit filed by a former legislator, the House and Senate had to redo a boards bill that passed through the Capitol last year, as well as pass their regular bill.
In addition to those two bills, legislators passed a bill that would allow the regulation of some interior designers, affecting the Board of Architects, Engineers and Land Surveyors. 
All three bills have yet to be considered by the governor.
Ceremonial bills
Every year the Capitol sees at least one bill ceremonially renaming a state-owned landmark or establishing a ceremonial holiday. This year was no different.
Legislators voted to rename the airport in Ruby after Harold Esmailka, a well-known Interior pilot who operated air services, including medevac service, for decades. 
They also added two ceremonial marks on the calendar, passing bills that made May 12 the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Day of Recognition and March as Women’s History Month. 
Dunleavy signed Women’s History Month into law in April; he has not considered the other two bills yet.
Letters of protest and praise
In addition to the bills they passed, the House and Senate also approved 15 resolutions — official letters from the House and Senate that stated their positions on specific issues. Among the approved resolutions were ones opposing cuts to Medicaid, praising the sovereignty of Canada and Taiwan, asking for more international immigration for teachers and Afghans, and celebrating the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th birthday.
In addition to those 15 joint resolutions, the Alaska Senate passed a unilateral resolution asking Congress to allow people from American Samoa to vote in federal elections and serve as officers in the U.S. military.

Mark Alford from Missouri said the bill “strengthens and restores the integrity” of SNAP in order to “ensure it is a temporary life vest for the needy — not a lifestyle”(Getty Images).Missouri could lose around $400 million in federal funding for food assistance under a plan approved by Congressional Republicans Thursday — which would strain the state budget and likely strip thousands of low-income families of food aid across the state.
Those cost-shifts could put pressure on the legislature to slash the state’s SNAP program or fill in the federal funding gaps by cutting other state services.
Roughly one-tenth of Missouri’s population, or over 650,000 people, receive SNAP benefits.
“This is about parents not eating so their kids can, or children going to school hungry,” said Amy Blouin, president and CEO of the progressive think tank Missouri Budget Project.
Another provision in the bill that cleared the U.S. House would create stricter work reporting requirements for SNAP, which could cut or reduce benefits for 150,000 Missourians, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates. 
“This bill would raise costs on families and make it harder for Missourians of all ages to meet their basic needs,” said Blouin. 
The legislation aims to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, a move the Congressional Budget Office projected would decrease resources for low-income families while increasing resources for top earners. The  package passed in the House early Thursday could cut $267 billion from SNAP over 10 years, according to the CBO’s preliminary analysis earlier this week. It would also cut over $600 billion from Medicaid. 
Under the proposal passed by the House, SNAP costs would be shifted to the states starting in 2028.
The federal government currently covers 100% of SNAP benefits and 50% of the administrative costs. Under the proposal, states would need to cover between 5% and 25% of benefits and 75% of administration.
The share of costs the federal government shifts to states would hinge on states’ error rates, meaning the rate at which states over or underpay benefits recipients. States would need to pay a greater portion of the benefits depending on how high their error rate is.
In 2023, the most recent data available, Missouri’s error rate was 10%, which would mean the highest cost share. Missouri would need to cover 25% of the cost of benefits. 
A Department of Social Services spokesperson said more recent data isn’t available.
Missouri’s Republican House delegation voted for the bill and Democrats voted against it.
Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Alford said the bill “strengthens and restores the integrity” of SNAP in order to “ensure it is a temporary life vest for the needy — not a lifestyle.”
Democratic U.S. Rep Emanuel Cleaver said the bill amounts to “ ripping health care and food assistance away from vulnerable families, to give another tax break that lines the pockets of billionaires.”
Several parts of the package are expected to change in the Senate and come back to the House for a final vote in the coming months.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Memorial Day off and will return to your inboxes on Tuesday.
California officials moved quickly to start another legal battle against President Donald Trump’s administration after the U.S. Senate voted Thursday to revoke federal waivers that allowed the state to phase-out gas powered cars and combat air pollution.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta said they plan to file a lawsuit on the grounds that Congress’ use of the Congressional Review Act to rescind the waivers is illegal. The law allows Congress to overturn actions of federal agencies, under specific circumstances, without a supermajority vote. California secured the waivers last year from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden. 

Bonta: “California has received approximately 100 waivers since waivers have been given and the CRA has never been applied to any of those waivers before. … This is a workaround for Trump to punish California for defying his efforts to bring us backward.”

While Bonta emphasized that Trump’s actions aimed to obstruct California’s authority to enforce its own state laws, Newsom focused on how revoking the waivers threatened California’s public health and the country’s electric vehicle industry. Saying that the administration was “doubling down on stupid,” the governor argued that this would further enable China’s dominance over the electric vehicle market.

Newsom: “Big day for Big Oil. … Big day for China. Terrible day for your kids, terrible day for air quality, terrible day for innovation and entrepreneurship.” 

As the state readies itself for its 23rd lawsuit against Trump since his second term, more California laws may be under threat from the administration and GOP members in Congress, including dozens of existing and proposed laws regulating artificial intelligence and laws that benefit immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

Can a 36-word warning about making a false complaint against a police officer be a violation of free speech? The city of Los Angeles argues that it does, as its case against the union representing Los Angeles Police Department officers lands before the state’s Supreme Court.
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, when filing a complaint against an LAPD officer, complainants are shown this warning on the form, in bold and in all caps:
 “IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO MAKE A COMPLAINT THAT YOU KNOW TO BE FALSE. IF YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER KNOWING THAT IT IS FALSE, YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED ON A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE.”
The city of L.A. wants to strike that language, arguing that the warning discourages people from filing complaints and curbs their rights protected under the First Amendment. But the Los Angeles Police Protective League union says the warning is constitutionally sound, and it’s necessary to prevent false complaints that could disrupt an officer’s career.
The California high court is expected to issue a ruling sometime this year.

Google shrinks pledge to help news organizations

A week after Gov. Newsom revealed his plans to reduce the amount of money the state is expected to provide to help fund local news outlets, Google said it too will cut some of the support it had previously agreed to pay, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
The tech giant said it will now pay $10 million in its first year contributing to California’s local news fund, rather than the $15 million it initially pledged less than a year ago. The company agreed to only put money into the fund as a match to state dollars, and it got the green light to do so after Newsom proposed to reduce the state’s first-year contribution from $30 million to $10 million. 
Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has a market cap of more than $2 trillion. Ten million dollars is 0.0005% of $2 trillion. There are three bench players on the Los Angeles Lakers who earned more than $10 million last season. 
Together, California and Google have shrunk their commitment to assist the state’s struggling news industry from $45 million to $20 million. So far, no newsroom has received money from the fund.
The money is part of a compromise lawmakers made with Google last year: In exchange for the Legislature pulling bills that would have forced tech companies to pay outlets for their content, Google and the state would put millions of dollars into a fund over five years to support California journalism.

Some campuses are stepping up with innovative free meal programs.,"In summary
A majority of California’s college students experience food insecurity. Some campuses are stepping up with innovative free meal programs.


Since 2022, California has been offering free lunches to all students in elementary through high school. But once they reach college, more than two-thirds of students experience food insecurity.
The federally funded CalFresh program feeds some college students, but the complicated application process and eligibility rules prevent many from accessing funds. More than 70% of eligible students don’t receive CalFresh, according to a 2024 California Policy Lab report.
To improve CalFresh outreach and enrollment, California started setting aside annual funds in 2021 for public colleges and universities to establish and operate basic needs centers with food pantries, where students obtain free food staples. The California State University and University of California systems each receive $15 million and California Community Colleges receives $30 million annually. As of 2023, every public higher education campus in the state has a basic needs center and food pantry.
However, for many campuses, these solutions still aren’t enough. To fill the gaps, some have created their own innovative solutions. From free meals to food lockers, staff and students at five campuses around California offer creative alternatives.
Humboldt students level up their food pantry
At Cal Poly Humboldt, through the full-service food program “Oh SNAP!,”  students stock the shelves, fill pantry orders and offer CalFresh application support. They also greet their peers as they enter, offering them tea or coffee.
To reduce food waste, students negotiated in 2016 with the campus dining services department to collect unused food to offer at the pantry at no cost to students. The department notifies the basic needs center when leftovers are available; students bring their own containers to package up what they need.
Oh SNAP! has hired a local organic farmer to provide produce and give classes on cooking and gardening. The program also offers pop-up thrift stores where students can fill a bag with clothes and housewares for $5; proceeds go back into the program.
Oh SNAP! “provides peace of mind,” said Anna Martinez, a student studying political science, law and policy at Cal Poly Humboldt. “I don’t have to really worry too heavy on whether or not I can afford food, because if I can’t, there’s always Oh SNAP! I can go to.” 
As the social justice, equity and inclusion officer for Cal Poly’s student government, Martinez successfully advocated for the student board to increase funding for cultural foods. She values the sense of community Oh SNAP! provides.
“They’re very welcoming when it comes to different needs,” she said.
The program, vital for the 6,000 students at Cal Poly Humboldt, clocked 30,000 visits to Oh SNAP! last year, according to Mira Friedman, health education and clinic support services lead.
Compton College serves free meals to all
Sara Goldrick-Rab, a Philadelphia sociologist and advocate for college student basic needs,  thinks a free meal every day is “exactly what is needed” on college campuses. She conducted a study giving students free, daily meals for three semesters at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston.
“It allowed students to eat in a regular way in the school cafeteria, just like they would in the National School Lunch Program. And lo-and-behold, it increased graduation rates,”  Goldrick-Rab said.
Compton College President Keith Curry read about the Bunker Hill pilot program and decided to implement a similar program at Compton. Now, every Compton student  — and employee  — receives a daily meal. Students also get $20 each week to spend at the campus farmer’s market. Students enrolled in CalFresh receive $50 each week for the farmer’s market and can use their EBT card at campus dining services. The college uses a mix of grants and various campus funds to cover the costs of the meal program.
“We’re doing more than any other community college in the state of California and also nationally,” Curry said. “How many schools can say that students receive one meal per day on their campus from their cafeteria?”

Some California colleges offer a limited number of free meals, such as UC Davis, where a food truck serves between 300 and 400 meals per day and students pay what they want. In fall 2025, West Valley-Mission District in Santa Clara County will begin offering free meals. 
Student Corinthia Mims said the first time she entered Compton’s cafeteria, “it was joy, always buzzing,” she said. Her twin, Cynthia Mims, said the free meals bring everyone together like family. 
“[Students] feel embraced and they feel important. It’s a feast,” she said.
Feeding students keeps them in school. According to data the college gathered last year, students who received free meals and money for the farmers’ market were more likely to stay in their classes for the entire semester with a completion rate of 1% or 2% higher than the general population.
Curry visits the cafeteria to get feedback from the students. “They’re proud to tell me what they like and what they got today. Because there’s no negative stigma around it, because everyone is treated equally,” he said.
Goldrick-Rab highlights the program at Compton College as an example of what a college student universal meal plan could look like. “It’s a very nice modern version. … It’s not really a cafeteria in the classic sense. It is refrigerators full of prepared meals, the way that adults would go into a Whole Foods and get a grab-and-go,” she said. 
In 2019, U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, introduced the Food for Thought bill, which proposes universal meal pilot programs on college campuses. The bill failed and was reintroduced in 2022 and 2023 but never enacted.
Contra Costa College fills food lockers with free meals 
At Contra Costa College, students who work full time have difficulty accessing the food pantry during open hours. In April, the college unveiled 20 refrigerated lockers in the campus cafeteria where students can pick up their pre-ordered, free groceries between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. Students order online and student staff fill the orders.
The campus basic needs center, called the Compass Center, also offers free meal vouchers to students three days a week, giving out 50 for breakfast, 75 for lunch and 15 for dinner. 
Teddy Thollaug, a first-year student studying art and journalism at Contra Costa College, says they appreciate the hot meals and food lockers, especially on days when their disability makes it too hard to stand and cook. Because Thollaug’s classes are all online, they are not on campus regularly.

A typical order includes fresh fruit and vegetables, butter and cheese, and a “mystery package,” which contains grains, sauces and canned food. “Honestly, I feel like a kid on Christmas every time I open a mystery package,” Thollaug said.
In 2024, the center served 5,008 students and 14,785 families of students, according to Hope Dixon, the basic needs center coordinator.
Antelope Valley College students earn points for food
To encourage and support students to take full course loads, Antelope Valley College initiated Fresh Success, a CalFresh program that “pays” enrolled students in points for enrolled units. 
Full-time students get more points, “because that’s our goal. We want you to get your degree, and [if you’re a full-time student,] you’re less likely to be able to run around and get all the other community resources,” said Jill Zimmerman, dean of the Antelope Valley College student health and wellness center. 
Fresh Success is part of CalFresh’s Employment and Training program, and is overseen by the Foundation for California Community Colleges. Currently 20 colleges across 18 counties participate in the program, which partially reimburses schools with federal dollars for workforce development services such as job training and job search assistance for low-income students.
Fresh Success allocates points for each unit enrolled, up to 40 points per week. Students use their points at the on-campus pantry to purchase food, toiletries and laundry soap.
For Alliza Wade, having access to Fresh Success means being able to put more time toward school rather than working more hours. Wade, a STEM major at Antelope Valley College, is enrolled in CalFresh but it doesn’t cover all of her food expenses. 
“[Fresh Success] has a very, very significant impact on how I’m able to live and eat, and how I’m going to be able to pursue my future, because [it helps with] saving and being able to eat healthy,” Wade said.
Since the college is reimbursed 45 cents for every dollar spent, the Fresh Success program benefits the college as well by providing funds to put towards employment and training support like job-specific clothing and gear, cooking classes and car tune-ups through the campus automotive program. 
Cerro Coso feeds students who aren’t eligible for CalFresh
When Lorena Moreno started as the basic needs coordinator in early 2024 at Cerro Coso Community College in the southeastern Sierra region of the state, she noticed that students without permanent legal status were in dire need of assistance. Non-citizens are not eligible for CalFresh. 
Moreno tackled the need by creating an on-campus food program called WileyFresh — modeled on Aggie Fresh at UC Davis, which serves students who meet CalFresh requirements but lack citizenship. Eligible students receive a monthly Albertson’s gift card valued at $291, comparable to the amount an eligible single student receives on a monthly CalFresh EBT card.
Like the Aggie Fresh program, students who qualify for WileyFresh are required to participate in workshops that support academic and personal growth. Moreno offers the workshops as a webinar to protect student identities.

Last fall, Moreno increased outreach efforts. Her team of part-time student employees passed out flyers at events to raise awareness. They saw visits to the Wiley Food Pantry grow from about 350 per month in the spring semester to about 500 per week in the fall. 
This summer, Moreno intends to expand the program to include more students who can’t enroll in CalFresh. “Because at the end of the day, that’s what it’s intended for — this population who is missing out.”
Research shows students can’t rely on each other’s charity
Many colleges now offer a way for students to donate unused card swipes from their campus meal plans to each other. However, research shows that these donations only reach a tiny fraction of students.
Before 2017, college dining services did not allow students to share their meal plans with other students. This didn’t sit well with students at Morehouse and Spelman colleges in Atlanta. They began a hunger strike to challenge meal plan policies that forbid sharing meal swipes. Their activism convinced their colleges to change the policies and led to a nationwide program, Swipe Out Hunger. 
Meal-swipe programs, as they’re called at the approximately 850 colleges nationwide that offer them, allow students to donate unused meal swipes to fellow students who need them. In California, 17 colleges participate in Swipe Out Hunger. 
But they are not effective, Goldrick-Rab said. She evaluated Swipe Out Hunger and found that the active programs see just 300 swipes a year.
“At the bottom line, I would rather give people money than food, but I still think the National School Lunch Program is important. I just want all of it. I want the guaranteed basic income. I want a higher minimum wage. Because all of it is scientifically working,” Goldrick-Rab said.

“Until there is more data to demonstrate that this concept will increase access to food for our most vulnerable neighbors, we are concerned that this approach could disrupt an established, high-performing food rescue system,” Beth Martino, the CEO of Three Square wrote in a March 27 letter opposing the proposal. 
Assembly Bill 476, which is scheduled to be heard by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee Saturday morning, would require the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services to create a “Smart Surplus Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” 
The program would seek to reduce food waste via technology by directing SNAP recipients to areas with a surplus of food where they can also get discounted rates. 
The legislation would allocate $5 million to administer the program. 
Between potential for major federal cuts and the state’s shaky economic outlook, the fate of many bills that require new or additional spending remains uncertain.
A Connecticut company founded by Priceline, r4 Technologies, has been used to develop the program elsewhere. 
The legislation “proposes allocation for the development of AI to help grocers better assess needs,” said Jason Frierson, a former Speaker of the Nevada State Assembly and Nevada U.S. Attorney who is now a lobbyist with Cornerstone Government Affairs, which represents r4 Technologies. 
“It allows the grocers to sell more food and helps to decrease waste so there is less food going to places that aren’t being purchased. It also helps SNAP recipients get a better bang for their buck,” Frierson said. 
The company’s program was launched for the first time last year in Delaware, funded by $1.5 million from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Three Square Food Bank, which provides assistance in Clark, Esmeralda, Lincoln, and Nye counties, as well as the Food Bank of Northern Nevada opposed the legislation.
Shane Piccinini, the government relations director for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, wrote in his opposition testimony in March that he didn’t understand how the legislation would improve access. 
“Many Nevadans facing food insecurity, particularly seniors, struggle to reach grocery stores—even when food is offered at discounted prices,” he wrote. “Our research shows that transportation is a major obstacle to accessing food, which is why many of our neighbors rely on local food pantries or direct delivery services provided by nonprofit organizations like the Food Bank of Northern Nevada.”
AB 476 was first heard by the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee in March and hasn’t received a vote yet. It is exempt from all deadlines. 
Since that March hearing, U.S. House Republicans passed a massive budget reconciliation bill that is now headed for the U.S. Senate — Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — that slashes Medicaid, food assistance and other programs.
Also since the bill’s hearing in March, the body charged with making state revenue estimates that legislative budgeting can’t exceed revised those estimates downward, citing projected negative impacts on Nevada’s economy largely as a result of Trump’s trade war. 
Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown May in the March hearing raised concern that deep cuts to federal assistance programs – only proposed at the time – would limit the availability of the service described in the bill. 
The legislation is sponsored by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who chairs the committee, said those currently eligible for SNAP benefits would be eligible to use the r4 Technologies application, but acknowledged that could change with shifts in federal policy.
“I wish I had a crystal ball and could say that any changes would not impact this program,” said Monroe-Moreno, who also chairs the Nevada State Democratic Party. “I can’t sit here and say that at this moment.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/formula-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 09:04:01.300257

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Misconduct complaints against educators in Utah public schools have been on the rise during the first months of 2025, representatives of the Utah State Board of Education told legislators on Wednesday. But, requests for funding to hire more attorneys to review the cases have failed since 2023.  
The Utah Professional Practices Advisory Commission (UPPAC), a panel that reviews and investigates complaints on educators to determine whether they get to keep their licenses, usually takes about 11 months until making a final decision.
There are various reasons why a case may take a long time, Ben Rasmussen, executive secretary of UPPAC told the Education Interim Committee — it may be the time it takes to investigate it or reach an agreement with the educator’s attorneys. The commission’s staff capacity can also delay the process, and sometimes, whenever there are criminal charges involved, the panel waits for courts’ decisions before taking disciplinary action.

Since Rasmussen started his role in 2015, the number of cases his office investigates has almost tripled, going from 63 to 173 in 2024. This year alone, the panel has already received 93 complaints.
“Leading up to the last couple of years, it was typical that UPPAC would review maybe 10 to 15 cases on a monthly basis,” Rasmussen said. “Given changes in board rules that have increased requirements for (schools’) reports and given increases in hotline complaints, you can see that it’s not uncommon for us to be reviewing closer to 50 cases a month now.”
During the discussion of the delays, committee chair Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, said she was already planning to submit a funding request to help clear out the backlog. 
Since 2015, the most frequent cases centered around “boundary violations,” accounting for 222 allegations. That’s followed by “violence and discipline” with 150 cases, and “miscellaneous ethical violations” with 118.
“The trend that I’ve seen increasing the most is getting cases in the ‘violence and discipline category,’ which is teachers that are generally getting hands on, to some extent, in their discipline of students or losing temper with students,” Rasmussen said. 
There were also 75 alleged sexual misconduct cases, 48 pornography allegations and 29 investigations of sexual harassment since 2015. Those were the ones that prompted lawmakers to study how schools address issues of child abuse and misconduct during this year’s interim. 



Let us know what you think...


 


According to the description in the committee’s study list, legislators intend to review local and state discipline procedures, the process for background checks, and seek solutions to the cases backlog accumulated at UPPAC. 
Additionally, now that HB497, a bill the Legislature passed this year, is effective, the state requires the commission to create a system to address complaints “in a timely and expedient manner.”
That includes changing the way the commission prioritizes cases to ensure the safety of students. However, for the most serious violations, schools usually terminate educators before the case is referred to UPPAC.
“Most cases where it’s like a sexual misconduct case or a serious student danger issue, these are cases where the (school) has removed the teacher from the classroom, and so that’s usually not a priority,” Rasmussen said. “But if that kind of case were still in the classroom, we would certainly prioritize that.”
At the same time, while acknowledging the importance of kids’ safety, lawmakers who are also educators questioned whether the process did enough to protect teachers who are later found innocent. 
“Something that somebody has brought up to me more than one time is that they felt like it was very lopsided and that they didn’t really have a voice in the process, and they felt that all of the questioning was very one-sided,” Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, said. 
Riebe also described the action of flagging licenses for potential misconduct in the state’s credential database while an investigation is underway as “really punitive.”
“It’s kind of shocking that you’d be guilty the minute somebody brought you up on an accusation,” she said.
Pierucci pushed back on that, arguing that whenever there’s a serious allegation, especially of sexual abuse, the teacher should not be in the classroom anymore.
“I want to be really careful saying this isn’t everyone, but there are some people who are dealing and interacting with their children that should not be there,” she said.

(File/Getty)It was the same story for criminal justice reform in the Alabama Legislature this year as in previous years: bills got filed, but most never made it to Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk.
Legislators did enact laws making incremental changes, such as a bill to make it easier for people who were formerly incarcerated to obtain occupational licenses and create more opportunities for diversion programs were approved.
And advocates said they were encouraged that legislation they continue to support moved further along in the process than in the past.

“Giving a grade on criminal justice reform in Alabama is always a challenge because the steps that are taken forward are, oftentimes, minimal, although they are impactful to certain segments of the population,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center. “However, what we as a collective community need to do is change the narrative around what actually is public safety and what drives making neighborhoods and communities safe.”
Bills to reform the parole and bail system in the state; allowing reconsideration of sentences for nonviolent offenses imposed before reforms of the Habitual Felony Offender Act, and delaying sentencing for those who are pregnant failed within their committees or stalled and were not considered by either the full House or Senate.
“There wasn’t any legislation passed for criminal justice reform, but there were still some very meaningful conversations about it that did move the needle forward, including a very frank discussion about the parole board to make sure there is oversight and attention to that fact that the parole board is not in compliance with the law,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa.
The Republican-dominated Legislature instead approved measures that increased existing penalties or provided an advantage to law enforcement in some way, including a bill enhancing immunity protections for law enforcement.
Reforming parole and bail was a focus of advocates, particularly as Republican legislators had shown growing impatience with the Alabama Board of Pardons and Parole missing deadlines to implement parole guidelines.
“I think one of the many things that we hoped to see coming out of the 2025 legislative session was legislation that created more accountability and transparency around the parole process,” Dees said. “There were a number of bills that were filed to specifically address that.”
HB 40, sponsored England, would have created a commission to create updated parole guidelines and require the board to stick with them. Under the bill, if the board deviated from the guidelines, it would have to publicly state why.
Parole applicants would also have been able to appeal denials to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.
Another bill, SB 324, sponsored by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, would have increased the number of members who serve on the Parole Board from three to five and require the Senate to confirm the appointments. It would also have changed the timeline that an applicant who has been denied can reapply for parole.
The Senate approved the measure by a vote of 16-8 in April and the House Judiciary Committee approved the bill soon afterward by the narrowest of margins. The bill did not come out for a House vote.
Chambliss later amended the state’s 2026 General Fund budget, which goes into effect on Oct. 1, to withhold the Board of Pardons and Parole’s funding until they develop parole guidelines.
Lawmakers have scrutinized Alabama’s parole system since 2019 when the state’s parole system decreased dramatically. The figure has increased to about 25% recently but remains below the original rate.
Legislators also turned away proposals to allow Alabama judges to issue a percentage bond to those in pretrial detention.
HB 42, also sponsored by England, would have left much of the Alabama Bail Reform Act of 1993 in place except to add three words, “a part of” to current statutes to give judges the authority to allow defendants to pay a portion of the total bond amount they owe so that they can be released from jail as their cases proceed through the court system.
The bail bond industry strongly opposed the legislation during two public hearings at both the House and Senate Judiciary committees.
The bill passed the House in April. But the Senate Judiciary Committee deadlocked on approval of the measure along party lines.
The Alabama Legislature also allowed another bill, SB 156, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, to fail.
The bill allows some of those incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons to have their sentences reconsidered by a judge if their crimes did not involve physical injury to others.
The bill would have allowed people who were convicted and received lengthy sentences before the state made substantial changes to the Habitual Offender Law  in 2000 to give judges more discretion regarding sentencing. Defendants who were convicted of homicides, sexually based offenses and violent offenses were not eligible for reconsideration.
The bill required two rounds of voting in the Senate chamber after members of the Senate Judiciary approved it in February.
In March, Senate Republicans rejected the legislation with a tie vote 16-16. Hours later, senators approved a motion to reconsider the legislation, and after discussing the bill, passed it by a vote of 17-8.
The House Judiciary Committee then approved the legislation in April, but it never came to a vote in the House.
“We were of course disappointed to see the Second Chance bill fail to pass the House, especially in light of the broad, bipartisan support it had this time around,” said Elaine Burdeshaw in a statement, policy director for Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, a criminal justice reform organization. “Despite the bill’s failure, we saw legislators across the aisle, all the way up to Gov. Ivey, understand this issue and why it matters– why it really is smart on crime policy.”

HB 244 got approval from the House on April 18 and from the Senate Education Policy Committee on May 1. Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, chair of that committee, told Butler after the bill was approved that it is unlikely the Senate will pass it because of the timing and said it needed to be in his committee earlier in the year to have a chance of passage; at the time, there were four days left in the session.
A Democratic filibuster launched in protest of the House’s handling of local bills on the last day of the session doomed Butler’s bill and many others.

Butler said he was offended by Chesteen’s comment that he should have filed the bill sooner but said both men remedied that after the committee meeting. A message seeking comment from Chesteen was left Thursday afternoon.
Butler filed the bill in February, but it did not go before the House Education Policy Committee until April 3, when the committee held a public hearing. The committee did not approve it until the following week. Butler said he asked Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, chair of the committee, for it to be put on the agenda many times earlier in the session.
“I repeatedly asked for it, and I was assured it was coming, it was coming, it was coming,” he said. “The chair had other things she said she was dealing with, and I think they waited to deal with several controversial bills at one time.”
A message seeking comment from Collins was left Thursday afternoon.
Butler said next year he plans to have a companion bill in the Senate to improve the bill’s chances of passage, “so we can move on both at the same time, and whoever gets there first wins,” he said. 
Butler said Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, was handling the bill in the Senate and plans to ask him to sponsor the Senate version next year. Kelley said in an interview that he and Butler will be meeting soon about companion bills for next session soon. 
“There may be some changes to it, a little bit here, a little bit there,” Kelley said. “We’re planning on bringing that back next year.”
The law currently prohibits such discussions in K-5. Butler’s bill would expand it to pre-K-12, which he said would bring it inline with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January.
Critics of the bill said at the April 3 public hearing that the legislation is unconstitutional and unnecessary.
A spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a consistent critic of the legislation, said in an interview Thursday she was relieved that the bill did not pass but she still had concerns for the legislation next year.
“I’m hoping that it stays dead, and I’m hoping that we don’t see a new extension, a revival of it,” Makhayla DesRosiers, state community organizer for the Alabama SPLC office, said.
Many members of the LGBTQ+ community spoke against the bill throughout the legislative process, all with similar concerns: what defines instructional time. DesRosiers said the lack of a definition opens the door for a complete prohibition of discussion.
“If I do extracurricular activities, is it also instructional time? If I’m learning something outside of my regular school hours, is that instructional time?” she asked. “Who gets to define instructional time?”
Butler has repeatedly said discussions of gender identity and sexuality are only prohibited when a teacher is teaching, but that is not explicit in the legislation.
“People keep saying the student can’t do this or that. No, they carry their First Amendment rights with them into the school, and they absolutely can talk to the teacher, the principal, the nurse, the counselor, about whatever they want to talk about,” he said.
Butler said the bill next year would be the original bill that was filed in February. A House amendment this spring removed a part of the bill that would have prohibited teachers from referring to students by their preferred gender if it conflicts with their assigned sex at birth. He said that is because another bill would have done the same thing.
HB 246, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, would give public educators legal immunity and students immunity from discipline for using a person’s legal name and pronouns aligned with their reproductive organs, instead of the name and gender with which they identify. It did not receive final passage either.
DesRosier said that while the people speaking out against the legislation may be small in number, legislation like this is not reflective of the state.
“Just because there is a majority of folks that are proposing and voting on these bills at the State House, that is not reflective of the communities they are elected to represent,” DesRosier said. “As long as bigotry and hate and human rights violations are proposed and passed, there are always going to be folks that are resisting that.”

GADSDEN, Ala.—Cruising upstream on the Coosa River through downtown Gadsden, it would be easy to miss the old coal ash pond sitting on the north bank of the river.
It’s mostly hidden by trees and bushes, except for a narrow opening with an aging chain-link fence and a “no trespassing” sign. Even from the air, the green synthetic liner that covers 65 years’ worth of coal combustion residuals looks like an extension of the Twin Bridges Golf Club that borders the pond to the west.
“There are people that boat by this all the time and have no idea what it is,” Coosa Riverkeeper Justinn Overton said as the boat idled in the channel. “Because it just looks like it’s an extension off the golf course, or nothing to be concerned about. It doesn’t look like it’s the leftover waste from the coal-fired power plant.”

Alabama Power’s Gadsden Steam Plant was demolished last year after 109 years on the river, but the unlined coal ash pond remains, and, according to the Coosa Riverkeeper, continues to leech potentially harmful substances like arsenic, boron, chromium and cobalt into the groundwater.
Now, Coosa Riverkeeper has filed a formal notice of intent to sue Alabama Power over the groundwater pollution from the old pond, based on groundwater testing results that Alabama Power is required to post twice per year.
The Riverkeeper, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, says it will file a lawsuit under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule, which regulates coal ash disposal. Such lawsuits require a formal notice at least 60 days before filing.
“Alabama Power has zero excuses for leaving its leaking waste dump in the middle of the commercial riverfront area of Gadsden and exposing the community to this hazard,” Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office, said in a news release announcing the move. “Other utilities across the South are cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps and moving waste to safer storage away from our waterways. Alabama Power must do the same in Gadsden.”
Alabama Power did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment by phone and email.
A test case for cover in place?

At 77 acres and 1.2 million cubic yards of coal ash, the Gadsden ash pond is much smaller than some of the other massive coal ash lagoons in Alabama. The one at Plant Barry, in Mobile County, is nearly 600 acres.
But Gadsden’s was the first coal ash pond in Alabama to fully close after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented federal coal ash disposal rules in 2015. In fact, plans for the closure were already underway before the final rule was issued.
Coal ash, or CCR, is an umbrella term that refers to several waste materials generated by the process of burning coal for electricity production. These waste materials can include fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag and flue gas desulfurization sludge.
Often, energy utilities combine these waste materials with water and store them in ponds at or near electrical generating plants, a practice environmental groups have criticized because they risk contaminating groundwater. Currently, Alabama has nine coal ash disposal sites across the state, most of which are located near waterways.
The Gadsden ash pond was covered in 2018, but still appears to be releasing significant levels of toxins into groundwater. The Riverkeeper says that the October 2024 sampling results show arsenic at 40 times the legal standard for groundwater.
The Gadsden ash pond is also close to the city’s riverfront area, including numerous boat launches and areas where people can fish from the banks. There’s also a drinking water intake just 0.6 miles downstream from the ash pond.
Overton said it’s concerning that the pond is still contaminating groundwater at high levels years after closure.
“We’ve been asking for the same thing, over and over again, which is [for Alabama Power to] move your ash to an upland lined landfill,” Overton said. “Unfortunately, it takes litigation at times to force movement.”
For all of its coal ash lagoons, Alabama Power elected to “dewater” and cover the ponds where they are rather than excavate the ash and move it to a lined landfill. In that process, the remaining ash slurry was dewatered and compacted into a smaller footprint. A low-permeability liner was then installed on top of the slurry to keep rainwater from entering the disposal area and carrying contaminants into the environment.
Environmental advocates and concerned citizens have urged the company for a decade now to move the coal ash to lined landfills away from the rivers to prevent groundwater contamination. They are also concerned about the potential for a catastrophic incident like the one at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston, Tennessee, plant in 2007, when a dam breach sent 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash slurry into a holding pond and then the Emory River.
In 2014, a steel sewer line under a North Carolina coal ash pond collapsed, allowing the waste material to flow into the pipe and, eventually, into the nearby Dan River, polluting the water and putting dozens of marine species in harm’s way. The disaster was among more than 160 cases of water contamination at coal ash sites that spurred adoption of the Coal Ash Rule in 2015.
The 2015 EPA coal ash rules allowed for cover in place, as long as certain conditions were met. The Alabama Department of Environmental Management signed off on the company’s cover in place plans, approving closure permits for all ash ponds in the state.
However, last year, the EPA rejected Alabama’s coal ash permitting program, saying it was “significantly less protective of people and waterways than federal law requires.”
“Under federal regulations, coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure,” the EPA said, in denying Alabama’s program. “In contrast, Alabama’s permit program does not require that groundwater contamination be adequately addressed during the closure of these coal ash units.”

A 2019 report by the Environmental Integrity Project and other advocacy groups found that 91 percent of coal-fired plants still had ash landfills or waste ponds that leak highly toxic metals and chemicals such as arsenic, lead, mercury, selenium and cadmium into groundwater at dangerous levels, often threatening streams, rivers and drinking water aquifers.
“Exposure to coal ash can lead to serious health concerns like cancer if the ash isn’t managed appropriately,” then-EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said of the federal government’s denial of Alabama’s coal ash permitting plan at the time. “Low-income and underserved communities are especially vulnerable to coal ash in waterways, groundwater, drinking water, and in the air. This is why EPA works closely with states to ensure coal ash is disposed of safely, so that water sources remain free of this pollution and communities are protected from contamination.”
An executive of Alabama Power, which owns most of the state’s CCR units, claimed at a September 2023 EPA hearing that the utility’s storage ponds are “structurally sound.” Susan Comensky, Alabama Power’s vice president of environmental affairs, told EPA officials that allowing the company to “cap” CCR waste in place, even in unlined pits, will not present significant risks to human or environmental health.
“Even today, before closure is complete, we know of no impact to any source of drinking water at or around any Alabama Power ash pond,” Comensky said at the time.

However, Alabama Power has been repeatedly fined for leaking coal ash waste into groundwater.
In 2019, ADEM fined the utility $250,000 after groundwater monitoring at a disposal site on the Coosa River in Gadsden showed elevated levels of arsenic and radium, according to regulatory documents.
In 2018, ADEM fined Alabama Power a total of $1.25 million for groundwater contamination, records show. In its order issuing the fine, the agency cited the utility’s own groundwater testing data, which showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead, selenium and beryllium.
The EPA denial notice cited Gadsden, among other coal ash ponds in Alabama, where waste ash material remains in constant contact with groundwater.
Overton said about 40 percent of the ash at Gadsden is saturated by groundwater.
“Alabama Power created this mess,” Overton said. “They shut this facility down and demolished it, but now they want to leave [the ash] here. Alabama Power claims to be a good neighbor, but I was taught that to be a good neighbor, you clean up after yourself.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The future of New England’s electric grid can be described with one word: uncertainty,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/new-england-electric-grid-future/,"Even if in-the-works transmission projects get built, headwinds from the Trump administration could be strong enough to derail them entirely.","Late last month — with considerable fanfare — nine northeastern states, including Connecticut, announced they were embarking on a groundbreaking interregional electric grid transmission effort.
It came just a few weeks after an announcement by the New England grid operator that it was soliciting proposals for new transmission to bring power — most likely land-based wind — from northern Maine into southern New England.
And that followed an announcement by the Biden administration’s energy department last August that the region would receive $389 million for a project called Power Up New England, which is primarily intended to provide the onshore connections and transmission for offshore wind power.
Here’s the problem, though. Even if all these transmission projects get built, the new power they’re supposed to connect to, such as offshore wind, faces headwinds from the Trump administration that could be strong enough to derail them entirely.
That potential became even more likely early Thursday with passage by the U.S. House of Representatives of a budget that could make any renewable power not already under construction financially implausible.
While concerning, the reality of a transmission and power mismatch is garnering less hand-wringing than you might expect. But one word you do hear over and over and over is uncertainty.
“The future is inherently uncertain,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP. “And uncertainty as well as rapid changes in development and the developments in the energy world are nothing new. Think about the fracking boom, or the Great Recession, or the COVID pandemic or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These all upended prior assumptions and created short-term and sometimes long, long-term disruption.”
And then she made another point: “Energy infrastructure takes a really long time to build.”
That last point is also made repeatedly for why this seeming mismatch of problematic additional power and more transmission is less concerning to some.
“The worst time to be building transmission is when you have the generation all constructed, ready to go,” Dykes said.
The overwhelming sentiment – get going on that transmission and other infrastructure.
“Yes, we should move ahead. This is an important step forward. We need more transmission, full stop,” said Kat Burnham, the state lead for Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for Advanced Energy United, AEU, an advocacy group for all aspects of advanced energy.
Francis Pullaro, president of RENEW Northeast, which works towards renewable energy in New England and New York, said the fact that New England hasn’t built out its electric grid is one of the biggest challenges to developing renewable energy here.
“But this isn’t a chicken and egg problem. The transmission has to be built first. You can’t connect the generator to nothing,” he said.
Even in the most stable of times it is tricky to predict what needs and conditions on the ground might be years in advance. What if that demand growth ends up being higher than expected or lower than expected, and what about different rates of technological development and availability and different cost trajectories? How do you ensure transmission additions or upgrades are flexible to accommodate a range of scenarios or changes?
Circumstances right now are anything but stable.
Trump, wind and powering up
Wind power has long been viewed as key to the region’s power needs and goals. It can provide large amounts of power while also meeting individual state renewable energy goals and helping to forestall the use of more fossil fuel power whose emissions are the primary culprits in climate change.
But President Donald Trump notoriously dislikes wind power. His Day 1 executive order halted all leasing, approvals and permitting for offshore wind, effectively shelving any offshore wind development in the pre-construction pipeline. And then in April the administration ordered construction stopped on the partially-built Empire Wind — destined to provide offshore wind power to New York.
One month later, as project developer Equinor was poised to pull the plug for good, more than three months of lobbying by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul paid off with a reversal of the stop-work order.
But the incident still leaves the remaining handful of offshore wind projects permitted and under construction, including Connecticut and Rhode Island’s Revolution Wind, fearing for their own survival.
The Interior Department, which houses the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, has been reviewing existing projects as part of the original executive order and in late April the wind opposition group Green Oceans released a report prepared for them by Planet A* Strategies that alleges fraud, among other problems, with the projects. Green Oceans subsequently used those findings as the basis for its request that the Environmental Protection Agency rescind permits for Revolution and Sunrise Wind, another New York project also under construction.


BOEM did not respond to questions about the status of the Revolution and Sunrise projects.
A spokesperson for Orsted, the Danish company developing Revolution Wind, said in an email that the project is about 75% done, remains on track for completion next year and that they “have an ongoing and constructive dialogue with our regulators.” But Orsted did not respond to whether the project was under review by BOEM and if so, what information was in question.
Orsted also did not respond directly to questions about the Green Oceans report and permit revocation requests. The company provided a statement that reads in part: “Revolution Wind received its federal construction approvals following years of reviews and scientific studies as well as public comment and other stakeholder engagement.” 
Maine’s first-in-the-nation floating offshore wind research installation is also among projects on hold after the Trump administration halted a $12.6 million grant while it reviewed the project. The move comes as Trump is in an open political feud with that state’s governor, Janet Mills, over transgender students and sports. It has spilled over into attempted financial retribution against the state in unrelated areas.
The state’s land-based wind potential may get caught in the crossfire. Trump’s order also targeted land-based wind projects for review. While mainly aimed at projects on federal land, it left the door open to going after other projects.
In early May, Connecticut, along with Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine and New York were among 18 states filing a lawsuit that argues the original wind executive order violates federal law.
But now any new renewable power could face stiff restrictions to qualify for the federal tax credits that for years have helped make them affordable. Under the House budget approved this week, a project needs to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage to get the credits — an impossibility for any new wind project. It must also be operational by the end of 2028.
If the Senate does not force changes, Burnham said it “would make it effectively impossible for any onshore or offshore project not already under construction to qualify for these long-standing, bipartisan tax credits.”
That could mean serious trouble for a Massachusetts and Rhode Island project called SouthCoast Wind, which doesn’t have contracts in place yet. The Massachusetts Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs declined to comment on the project’s future. SouthCoast did not respond to an email.
Now even Power Up New England, the transmission/interconnection component for future offshore wind may be in trouble. In March that project appeared as the biggest single item on a “hit list” seen by some news publications of proposed project cuts to the Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office.
On May 15, Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the department was requesting additional information from 179 Biden administration awards it had been reviewing. It’s not clear which awards were targeted.
The Department of Energy did not respond to specific questions to clarify the status of Power Up New England. It provided an email statement that said in part: “The Department is conducting a department-wide review to ensure all activities follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration’s priorities.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs in Massachusetts, the lead state on Power Up, declined to comment on the recent development specifically, referring to an earlier emailed statement.  
“The federal grant for Power Up New England has been conditionally awarded to the New England states, obligating the $389 million. We secured these funds through an agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). We will continue to coordinate with our fellow New England states as we work through the final phases of the award with DOE.”
The spokesperson declined to elaborate further on the project status — specifically what “conditionally awarded” means, but there is no evidence that any money has been accessed by the participating parties. Those parties include two utilities that are slated to build interconnection points, substations and battery storage to distribute power – especially new power anticipated from offshore wind projects.
One project, known as the Huntsbrook Offshore Wind Hub is to be built by Eversource in Montville, Connecticut. The other by National Grid is slated for Brayton Point in Somerset, Massachusetts.
Assuming Power Up moves ahead as a transmission project, it is designed to be flexible enough to enhance power distribution even if the offshore wind it was conceived for does not exist.
Predicting future power needs
What may complicate this uncertain dynamic even further is that, after years of flat energy usage on the New England grid, demand is poised to increase. The latest long-term forecast released on May 1 by grid operator ISO-New England projects regional energy demand will increase 11% in the next decade.

Up until now, demand had been held in check through energy efficiency measures and by residential rooftop solar that has been shown to take the edge off power demand during certain times of day — even through the winter when demands on gas for both heat and power generation can strain supplies. The ISO also predicts that the longstanding summertime peak demand season, due to air conditioning use, will switch to equal peak demands between summer and winter as more electric-powered heat pumps supplant gas and oil heating systems.
While New England has also seen robust adoption of electric vehicles, it has not experienced the massive surge in power needs other parts of the country are seeing from the growth of data and AI centers.
The prediction mirrors changes the Energy Information Administration is anticipating nationally over the next couple of years — with the bulk of the increased demand coming in the commercial and industrial sectors.
But predicting future EV and heat pump adoption, the cost of components from solar panels to steel and what generation will be available is difficult, said Matt Kakley, spokesman for the ISO.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty involved in pretty much everything,” he said pointing to the balance of three key factors — growth on the demand side, additions of generation and retirements of older power plants. “I think if those three work in lockstep, things are fine. If they get out of whack and the demand increases, but the generation doesn’t show up, or the retirements go quicker than you would like, then that’s where you start to run into problems. So what makes it difficult is that there is uncertainty on all three fronts.”
In other words – navigating what could shape up to be a mismatch between transmission and power. 
“The bigger fundamental challenge for Connecticut and New England at large is offshore wind, where the states have made really big bets on offshore wind as the scalable large capacity factor, clean energy source that is more directly interconnected into New England than just about any other similar technology,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “With that being so pulled back and at best, a long pause being put on that industry, we are now having to do a fundamental reassessment on where else is large scale electricity supply growth going to come from.
“We are in massively uncharted territory with respect to energy policy.”
North to south transmission
The broad plan to provide New England with more wind power from its windiest on-shore area of sparsely-populated northern Maine has run into difficulty in the past because there’s no transmission to get it to southern New England where it’s most needed.
The formal step toward finally doing that came in April when the ISO issued its request for transmission proposals. Those proposals are due in September, with project selections a year after that.
“There is no doubt in my mind that we need greater connections between northern New England and southern New England, and that has been well known for years,” said Melissa Birchard with the Georgetown Climate Center. She also served in the Grid Deployment Office during the Biden administration and is a former New England climate activist. “The ISO-New England’s own studies show that there needs to be much greater connection, and this is just one of them. So is that a smart plan to move forward with? Absolutely.”
Whatever projects are chosen might also be useful to transmit grid-scale solar, or power from Canada, where plans to expand hydropower from Newfoundland and Labrador are in the works. Whether the current political situation between the U.S. and Canada might jeopardize the potential for the use of that power in the Northeast is anyone’s guess, as is whether the Trump anti-wind mindset will stall or derail northern Maine wind projects.
The FERC, tariffs and other factors
Many kinds of major grid activity such as transmission, especially something brand new like the interregional strategic action plan unveiled in April, face approval processes from what will likely be a Trump-majority regulatory body — the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. It has five members with fixed terms. It allows no more than three members from one party and had been 3-2 Democrat when Trump came into office in January. But one of the Democrats resigned recently, with more than a year left in his term. That leaves the commission potentially deadlocked until another commissioner is appointed — more than likely a Republican.

The ISO’s Kakley said not all these projects will need to travel back through FERC for approval. “I wouldn’t say we’re concerned about it,” he said.
The next big thing is ISO’s revamp of what’s known as the capacity market. The plan is to switch from a so-called dynamic model, in which the ISO has to predict three years in advance what generation will be available for the grid, to a “prompt market” system that allows the ISO to wait until power is built and ready to go before incorporating it into grid planning.
“It won’t go [to FERC] till probably the end of the year …  in the fall or early winter,” Kakley said.
For the interregional effort – any FERC signoffs are likely much further off.
“These are long-term plans, and we’re not going to build these things overnight,” said RENEW’s Pullaro. “When the current president is long gone is when we’re going to be building these projects. And we really need to think long term.”
Not that he doesn’t have concerns. “It’s a hyper challenging environment right now,” he said. “This president, despite what he says, he only has a four-year term, and there are midterms that are going to happen next year.” 
A lot could happen – or perhaps more to the point, not happen – between now and then to upend the dynamic the way COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine did to the energy world not all that long ago.
The Trump administration could slash multiple in-progress projects as they attempted to do with Empire Wind. Their desire to expand fossil fuel use could succeed despite state renewable energy policies such as the kind Connecticut has. Supply chain issues, high prices and fraught international relations resulting from tariffs and other international policies and alliances could have an impact on every aspect of life, not just energy.
Ken Gillingham, an economist at Yale specializing in energy systems and a former senior economist for energy and the environment with the Obama administration White House Council of Economic Advisers, is not convinced rushing ahead with some energy projects is advisable.
“Right now my main thought is that you don’t plan or start anything until the uncertainty is at least somewhat resolved. Especially with tariffs potentially raising costs of a lot of materials, including those used in transmission lines and the fact that at the moment, we are heading towards a recession, which would reduce electricity/energy demand,” Gillingham said. “We are in a chaotic period right now, so it seems to me that the prudent course of action is to sit tight and wait. That seems to be what most firms are doing. It would mean slow walking or not moving forward with “Powering Up New England.”
He said the only reason to move forward right now would be if permitting could be expedited. “But I think the overall business uncertainty is a much stronger force influencing decisions,” he said.
The interregional plan also concerns Gillingham because it was researched and pulled together under more favorable pre-Trump economic and regulatory conditions.
“I wonder how they are thinking about all of this planning now that so many of the assumptions their analysis was built upon are thrown out the window,” he said in an email.
Should states step up?
AEU’s Burnham agreed there’s a lot of uncertainty now at the federal level, with tariffs and with changes in FERC leadership. 
“This is not our first time facing uncertainty, but the pressure is absolutely there,” she said. “That’s why I think we are looking to state collaboration and regional coordination, because we are not getting the regulatory certainty or the market certainty that we rely on from the federal level.”
The mantra that states need to step up has become widespread among advocates, but the unanswered question is where will the money come from if federal funds dry up, or worse, if existing funds are rescinded? And how can projects even attract investors in an economic climate that could be headed for recession?
DEEP Commissioner Dykes skirts the question, pointing to the roughly $1 billion in federal infrastructure and IRA funds the agency competed successfully for during the Biden administration. It’s not clear how much of that may be in jeopardy as the Trump administration ends programs and seeks to halt distribution of funds.
“We’re continuing to move forward with the implementation of those funds and to assert our legal rights,” she said.
Georgetown’s Birchard points out that the infrastructure and IRA funds were designed as a jumpstart, not to be permanent. “Those pots of funds were always time limited. They were never perpetual,” she said.
To her, it shows why the nine-state interregional effort is so important, and not unrealistic even in the current environment. 
“It has states working together in ways that they’ve never worked together before. But the reason they’re doing that is not because of the federal government, is because that’s what the moment demands,” Birchard said.
She said multi-state coordination and planning is needed to get offshore wind built off the northeast coast. It’s needed to have an electric system that is more resilient to extreme weather. And she said it’s needed to attain what she sees as four key goals: keep the lights on and people safe; bring costs down; ensure the transition to clean energy continues; and keep the country open for business.
“What the federal government does may change on a day-to-day, year-to-year, administration-to-administration basis, but those four things aren’t changing. They’re not changing right now, and they’re not going to change next year,” Birchard said. “But we are dealing with a situation where there is a great deal of uncertainty at the federal level, and so I think the easiest way to deal with uncertainty is to create certainty, and the states are taking that opportunity.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP21323785755341-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 08:07:05.321607

May 22, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz Veliz“No Justice, No Peace” and “Justice for Patrick” chants were heard again in downtown Grand Rapids Thursday, as community members gathered to demand justice for Patrick Lyoya and accountability for Grand Rapids police.
Dozens of demonstrators rallied with signs in hand at the doors of the Kent County Courthouse to share their frustration and anger against the decision by Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker not to seek a second trial against former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr.
Schurr was charged with second-degree murder and later fired from the police force after fatally shooting Lyoya, a Black Congolese refugee, in the back of the head while he was facing the ground following a traffic stop on April 4, 2022. The confrontation escalated into a struggle when Lyoya tried to flee after failing to produce a driver’s license.
During the announcement of his decision, Becker noted his decision was based on the fact that “there was never a majority for a guilty verdict” among the 12 jurors, whom he interviewed after the mistrial was declared May 8.

Thursday’s “emergency rally” was organized by organizations including the Grand Rapids Alliance Against Racist and Political Oppression, demanding a retrial on the Schurr case.
“I’m going to be very clear in saying that if the Grand Rapids City Commission is not willing to listen to us and reform the police, there may be a time for us to escalate. That doesn’t mean being violent, but it does mean maybe we need to disrupt the way that things are done in this city,” said Ivan Diaz, 27, a Michigan State senate candidate.
The rally was just the latest outlet for members of the public to vent their anger. Days after the mistrial, community members gave passionate comments at the Grand Rapids City Commission meeting, demanding justice for Lyoya and accountability over police actions. Additionally, on May 15, the NAACP organized a community listening session where residents expressed their experiences with police abuse and their outrage over the mistrial.
“I am going to keep showing up with everyone of you until we get the changes that we need. Because if we don’t, one of us, or one of our family members or friends, we will continue to be at risk of becoming Mother Patrick, Mother Rowley, Mother Sammy,” Erykai Cage, 44, said during her speech.

As the rally continued, more people began to approach the crowd, including Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand and Kent County Commissioner Robert S. Womack. However, only Womack stayed and took the microphone to address the public, while LaGrand limited himself to speaking to a few media members and some demonstrators around the crowd before leaving.
“What you have seen is supposed to be a trial. But what it has come down to is a test of our resilience. Does Grand Rapids go back to business as usual? Do the politicians who refuse to help change the policies and laws surrounding police and community relations, do they go back to business as usual? We have to be resilient,” Womack told the crowd.

Womack’s speech raised concerns among the audience about the absence of other politicians, with people asking why other commissioners weren’t present.
“The only thing they care about is their careers. They do not care about anything else. And if you want to test me, you can say, ‘Hey, maybe Commissioner Womack is just saying that.’ Okay, then where the hell are they right now?” Womack said.
Before the rally ended, the demonstrators chanted pro-Lyoya slogans and held up their signs. There was little police presence around the rally, and no counter protesters, so the gathering ended without incident.
“To me, this is personal because I’m a Black mother, and these children are, at the end of the day, somebody’s children, and they are also members of my community.  We’re unheard. They [politicians] have everything that they wanted. This is what their decisions made, not ours,” Cage said.
“As long as I have breath in my body, I’m optimistic because I’m going to continue to do what I need to do in order to make sure that I see justice,” she finished.

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/23/judges-rebuke-over-newark-mayors-arrest-should-but-wont-shame-new-jerseys-u-s-attorney/,"The U.S. Attorney's Office should be red-faced over its now-dismissed case against the Newark mayor. Alas, it simply turned its guns on a different political foe.","Rep. LaMonica McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka were both present for a May 9 protest at a migrant jail in Newark that led to Baraka's arrest and now charges for McIver. (Photos by Jemal Countess/Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)President Trump is finding out that it’s harder to prosecute his political foes for no reason than he thought it would be.
This week saw the implosion of the Trump administration’s case against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat arrested two weeks ago and charged with trespassing on the property of a migrant jail used by the feds — even though video evidence available to the public shows he was not trespassing.
Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal attorney for Trump who was given the job of our state’s chief federal prosecutor in March despite zero credentials, made dismissing the charge against Baraka seem like an act of goodwill, saying she was doing it “for the sake of moving forward.”
That statement bemused U.S. Magistrate Judge André Espinosa, who was overseeing Baraka’s case.
“What does that mean?” Espinosa asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Demanovich during a hearing Wednesday.
“Your honor, we believe just, in the interest of justice in this case, in considering all factors, that it was the most appropriate resolution in the interest of justice to move forward with this charge and dismiss. We weighed all factors and took it under careful consideration, and considering all that, the decision was made to dismiss the charges, with prejudice,” Demanovich said.
That’s a lot of words to say: We screwed up. Demanovich did not mention that his office spoke to a guard who admitted inviting Baraka onto the jail’s property. 
Espinosa, who formally dismissed the trespassing charge Wednesday, lit into the U.S. Attorney’s Office for its handling of the case, calling agents’ arrest of Baraka “hasty” and the decision, 10 days later, to dismiss the charge “embarrassing.”
“Federal prosecutors serve a singular, paramount client: justice itself. Your role is not to secure convictions at all costs, nor to satisfy public clamor, nor to advance political agendas. Your allegiance is to the impartial application of the law, to the pursuit of truth, and to the upholding of due process of all,” the judge said.
Habba was not present for this extraordinary dressing-down — perhaps she was busy with her alleged investigation of our governor and attorney general — though she should have been, since her public intention to use her office to punish New Jersey Democrats is clearly the reason the mayor of our state’s biggest city was placed under arrest on a charge so flimsy that Habba’s office couldn’t keep it alive for even two weeks.
Wednesday’s lecture from Judge Espinosa should serve as a warning for Habba. Alas, it won’t. We know this because moments after announcing Monday that she was dropping the Baraka case, she said she was filing criminal charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was involved in the melee that transpired when federal agents moved to arrest Baraka and now stands accused of assaulting federal agents. A prosecutor with an ounce of shame — faced with having to admit publicly that their 10-day-old prosecution of a political foe was a complete sham — would have taken a moment to reflect before then siccing her office on a different political foe, but shame is not an emotion Habba feels, I fear.
Trump is clearly on a revenge tour for the various criminal charges filed against him during his four years out of the White House, one that is sweeping up Democrats who had nothing to do with any of the charges he faced. He lit into McIver on Wednesday, saying she was “shoving federal agents” and proclaiming that “we’re going to have law and order” now that he’s president again. This was just a week after he extolled the new president of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who was until recently on the U.S. list of designated terrorists for his past links to al-Qaida and the Islamic State, as a “young, attractive guy, tough guy” with a “strong past.” Interesting, isn’t it, who gets his stamp of approval and who gets called a thug.
Unfortunately, a byproduct of the prosecutions that Trump faced is a public inured to the prospect of their political leaders jailing one another. An Emerson poll from last week found that 44% percent of respondents supported Baraka’s arrest, despite there being evidence from the start that he didn’t do the thing he was arrested for doing. This is a dangerous road we’re on, and I worry there’s no way back.

This year at the University of Vermont, the campus once again engaged in questions of Israel and Palestine — but this time through dialogue, scholarship and academic inquiry.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Matt Vogel: The difference a year makes.","This commentary is by Matt Vogel, executive director of UVM Hillel.This time last year, we stood on edge. An encampment had settled for nearly two weeks into the center of campus, its chants and signage echoing a narrow and often exclusionary narrative about Israel and Zionism.Many Jewish students felt unsafe and unwelcome on their way to study in the library for finals. There were threats of protests during graduation, and many of our students debated whether to even attend. Fear, confusion and isolation were all too present.What a difference a year makes.This year at the University of Vermont, the campus once again engaged in questions of Israel and Palestine — but this time through dialogue, scholarship and academic inquiry. Rather than shouting past one another, students and faculty came together to think deeply, listen curiously and ask hard questions.Instead of protests designed to silence, we saw programs designed to expand understanding. Instead of posting statements online, we listened, we convened, we learned and we adapted.The university hosted a symposium on Israel/Palestine this fall after a listening session last year where students said they wanted a chance to intellectually engage with these serious issues. It was an ambitious and important initiative rooted in history, nuance and learning and the first of its kind at UVM. While it hit the mark in some respects and missed it in others, the important thing to note is that this university was trying and it was doing so publicly.Renowned Harvard historian Derrick Penslar spoke about Zionism not as a monolithic idea, but as an evolving idea shaped by the Jewish people’s search for safety, self-determination, and moral responsibility.Earlier this spring Peter Beinart met with students to discuss “life after Gaza,” engaging in a thoughtful conversation about the human cost of war, the future of the region, and the weight of hope. Students of differing ideologies met, talked, and engaged in a conversation that was open and honest and would have been nearly impossible under the polemic debates of last year.These events didn’t ignore the pain or the politics; they embraced them. They modeled what it looks like when a university lives up to its promise: to teach, to challenge and to care by providing access to opportunities to learn.While it may have been federally compelled through the Title VI investigation and resolution, UVM was acting to improve campus climate by upholding their policies to prohibit antisemitism, anti-Arab and anti-Asian bias and harassment.We at UVM Hillel have seen the shift firsthand. Jewish student participation has grown significantly from last year’s lows to more than 1,500 meaningful student interactions this year. Students are hungry for spaces where they can be both intellectually curious and spiritually grounded, where they can celebrate Shabbat with friends one night and study ancient Jewish texts on protest, God, and artificial intelligence the next, all while sharing good Vermont food together.This past year, our team took bold steps to meet students where they are: off-campus dinners with Hillel Fresh, on-campus celebrations from Purim to Pride, Skinny Pancake Shabbat, Camel’s Hump hikes, and new Jewish learning fellowships that foster conversation rather than confrontation.These aren’t just programs. They’re invitations to belong and engage.When UVM students walked across the stage at graduation, many proudly wore blue and white cords from Hillel — a symbol of their Jewish identity, resilience and connection to one another. There are no calls to hide, no whispers of fear. There is pride. There is joy. There is community.We also introduced a new honor this year: the Patricia A. Prelock Ally to the Jewish People Award, named for UVM’s outgoing interim president, a steadfast partner who has consistently shown up for Jewish students with empathy, courage and action. This award recognizes university leaders who listen, who learn, and who lead with integrity. It’s a reminder that allyship isn’t performative, it’s personal and it makes a difference.There is still so much work to be done. The forces that seek to divide us remain real and recalibrating. But this year proved something powerful: that change is possible. That healing can happen. That dialogue can replace dismissal, and scholarship can replace slogans on our campus.Looking ahead, I hope UVM continues to lead not only in addressing antisemitism, but in uplifting all marginalized communities through compassion, education and accountability through policy. I hope we keep building spaces where complexity is welcomed, and where no student has to choose between who they are and where they learn.A year ago, we were bracing for the next impact. Today, we are building momentum.What a difference a year makes.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Matt Vogel: The difference a year makes.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

Impunity for foreign governments makes us all less safe.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Isaac Evans-Frantz: The Leahy Law can help us change course.","This commentary is by Isaac Evans-Frantz of Brattleboro. He is the director of Action Corps, an organization active in 30 states that campaigns for U.S. policies to save lives around the world. In 2022 he challenged then-Congressman Peter Welch for the seat that Sen. Patrick Leahy had previously held.Over the past two years, Vermonters have directly felt the impact of U.S.-backed Israeli violence against Palestinians. Vermonter Dylan Collins, a journalist, was injured by tank fire from the Israeli military on October 13, 2023, with no ensuing accountability.The following month a gunman shot three Palestinian students in Burlington. And on April 14, 2025, masked U.S. federal agents kidnapped another Vermonter, Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian U.S. resident.And throughout all this, the transfer of U.S. weapons have caused astronomical death and destruction in Gaza, violating U.S. law governing provision of such weapons. Our tax dollars are being used to harm civilians in Gaza, rather than strengthen our communities.And the violence has directly struck Vermont journalists, activists, residents and visitors. In protesting the violence, we and our neighbors are becoming targets of state repression. Decades ago, as a Vermont fourth grader, I attended a classroom talk by a Jewish man who had survived a Nazi death camp. His story was harrowing, and left me with the strong belief that when we face atrocities, we must not turn away — no matter the personal price. These are moments when we are called to stand with one another.We are witnessing crimes against humanity in Gaza and beyond, propelled by our federal government. Parents are pulling children from the rubble and grieving entire neighborhoods reduced to ashes. Many Americans are left asking why our government continues to contribute weapons and military support for these atrocities. Is there a way for us to stop our tax dollars from fueling abuse and devastation around the world? The Leahy Law offers a solution. When I first heard D.C. colleagues reference this law several years ago, I was proud to learn that its name comes from our own Sen. Patrick Leahy.The law prohibits the U.S. from providing assistance to foreign security force units when credible information shows they have committed gross violations of human rights. It allows the U.S. to target particularly egregious units of foreign security partners. This accountability encourages respect for human rights more broadly.The Leahy Law has been applied around the globe, halting aid to thousands of security force units across numerous countries, with one glaring exception: Israel. Despite years of credible reports of gross violations of human rights committed by Israeli security force units, including in the State Department’s own annual human rights reports, all U.S. administrations since the law’s adoption have failed to enforce the law in regards to Israel.This selective enforcement sets a dangerous precedent of impunity that emboldens the state of Israel to continue to commit gross violations of human rights. To the rest of the world, this double standard from the U.S. government sends the troubling message that some countries, because of political convenience or strategic alliances, can commit grave abuses without consequence.READ MORE
In an unprecedented move organized by DAWN, last December seven Palestinians and Palestinian Americans filed a lawsuit against the State Department to compel the Secretary of State to follow the Leahy Law with regard to Israel. It is absurd that it should require a lawsuit to uphold U.S. law and basic human rights standards, but this is an important step forward.On the congressional front, Vermont’s delegation to Washington has led the way in efforts to uphold the law. Building on Sen. Leahy’s legacy, Sen. Peter Welch has repeatedly pressed the State Department to apply the Leahy Law to Israel. In the House, just days after the Brattleboro Representative Town Meeting overwhelmingly passed a resolution to halt additional weapons to Israel until a permanent ceasefire is achieved, Rep. Becca Balint announced her opposition to sales of offensive weapons to Israel.When Sen. Bernie Sanders visited Brattleboro last summer, Action Corps Vermont members and friends asked him about the Leahy Law and requested that he introduce the first-ever joint resolutions of disapproval against certain U.S. arms transfers to Israel. Soon after, he did just that.Vermonters can be proud of our leadership on this issue, and rightly expect our congressional delegation to continue seeking accountability and an end to exceptions that undermine the law. Impunity for foreign governments makes us all less safe. I felt this myself last month when, returning home to Vermont from a weekend trip to Quebec, federal agents at the border pulled me over, interrogated me and searched my car. I couldn’t help but wonder if I was being targeted for my activism for human rights and against war.The longer the U.S. supports oppressive foreign governments, the more the U.S. has to become like those oppressive governments which suppress dissent. It seems that while the U.S. is imposing tariffs on imported goods, the U.S. is accelerating the import of repression to prevent Vermonters’ and our fellow Americans’ criticism of Israel.While the U.S. continues to look the other way when it comes to Israel’s crimes, Vermonters are less safe. Our members of Congress must continue to stand up for accountability under the Leahy Law. It’s the least we can do.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Isaac Evans-Frantz: The Leahy Law can help us change course.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

It is also one of the best memories I have with my friend Anita, and it brings us laughter to this day.
Another fond sports memory is my spontaneous decision, driving through Indianapolis after a morning work assignment, to grab a friends and snag tickets for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks in 2000. Talk about an electric atmosphere.
This year’s 500 coincides with the Pacers being back in the finals, and I am reminded how lucky we are to have a vibrant sports world right here in Indiana.
So, I put together a Hoosier sports-related bucket list. Go make some memories!
— Go to the Indianapolis 500: I don’t go every year because, frankly, it’s a lot. Plus, my husband likes to go early. This year, he is taking our daughter, and I am excited for them to have that experience together for the first time. He’s a spectator now, but at one point he was engine tuner for Vitor Meira’s Team Menard car. And three years ago, as a splurge, I gave him a ride in the two-seater, which blew his mind. The speedway is an absolute gem that we should be proud of — from holding races to hosting citizenship ceremonies, vaccination clinics and solar eclipses.

— Indiana Fever game: I have been to many Fever games but not since Caitlin Clark arrived. I must rectify that soon. The hype and excitement is contagious. And Clark is someone I want to say I saw play, because she will undoubtedly be an icon.
— March Madness in Indiana: Basketball doesn’t get any better than the NCAA college basketball tournament in Indiana. Whether it’s the first or final round, it’s fun to see fans of other teams come to the city and discover its hospitality and love of the game. While heartbreaking, watching Butler University play Duke in the 2010 championship game will forever be a highlight of my personal sports bucket list.
If I could make a subcategory here, I would add going to a game at Hinkle Fieldhouse. It has an old-school feel that easily trumps new, fancier facilities.
— Olympic trials: Indianapolis has hosted swimming and diving trials at multiple locations. I spent a few hours watching diving years ago and was amazed at the precision and power. I am still kicking myself for not going to the last year’s swimming event at Lucas Oil Stadium. So many friends have said how great it was to immerse themselves in a new sport.
But the fun isn’t just in Indianapolis.

— Notre Dame football: Find time to see the Fighting Irish at Notre Dame Stadium on a fall day. Nothing beats it. My husband and I went a few years ago to the Navy game and it was everything we had hoped. We walked the campus a bit before the game, taking in the revelry and the beauty. By far the best part of the day was seeing all the traditions on display.
— Parkview Field: The stadium in downtown Fort Wayne hosts the TinCaps and is a delight for families. I have only been to one game there, but it was full of quirky entertainment, with a great location and reasonable food prices (for a stadium).
This is not an exhaustive list. I’m sure I will hear from a few Colts fans and my dad won’t forgive me for leaving out the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis Raceway Park. The point is that Hoosiers are lucky to have such a rich sports ecosystem and should make sure to enjoy it!

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida A&M University has weathered its share of storms, the most recent being a deeply embarrassing debacle when a Texas donor conned former FAMU President Larry Robinson and a close circle of school officials into believing that the hallowed institution was the recipient of a $237.75 million gift. 
After discovering the gift was a hoax, Robinson resigned, which led to the uproar over the past several weeks surrounding the choice of Robinson’s successor. During a presidential search process shrouded in secrecy, the Ron DeSantis-dominated FAMU Board of Trustees voted 8-4 for Marva Johnson, a last-minute addition to the presidential finalist list.
  Marva Johnson via FAMU
“The late entry of Marva Johnson into the pool of candidates to become FAMU’s president has sparked concern about her allegiances, the selection process and her apparent lack of qualifications, MSNBC said. “Johnson, who has been appointed to boards by Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Gov. Rick Scott, has no college administrative experience and has remained an ally of DeSantis as his GOP administration has undermined Black history lessons in the state.” 
The likelihood that Johnson might be chosen provoked in a multipronged campaign of resistance, including a Change.org petition against her candidacy that gathered more than 10,000 signatures.
Florida’s state NAACP president threatened legal action over the selection process. Popular film director Will Packer, a FAMU graduate who has produced films like “Takers,” “Straight Outta Compton,” and “Think Like a Man,” warned that “a group of activist Republicans are trying to put in the highest position of power someone who is solidly and objectively unqualified for it.
A range of Black media personalities online also sounded the alarm on Johnson. 
There have been calls for boycotts and other punitive measures to express displeasure over how all this has played out. The primary objections involve Jonhson’s connections to DeSantis, who throughout his time as governor has exhibited barefaced hostility towards Black Floridians while implementing a raft of racist ideological MAGA policies aimed at institutions of higher learning.  
A WFSU story in the days following last Friday’s selection captures the temperature.
“Florida A&M University is ablaze following the appointment of Marva Johnson to the school’s presidency. Alumni, students and other FAMU stakeholders are weighing how best to move forward,” the story said. 
“Johnson is a controversial candidate for her ties to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, as he works to remake higher education in the state. Now, the school’s interim president is urging calm amid backlash and boycott threats in response to Johnson’s appointment by the FAMU Board of Trustees,” the story continues.
“I urge you to stay engaged and remain connected,” Interim President Tim Beard wrote in a statement. “Your advocacy, your feedback and your financial support are crucial to ensuring that our institution continues to thrive.” 
Wrecking ball
To describe DeSantis’ assault on higher education as a remaking is a grave understatement.
Since 2023, he has taken a wrecking ball to Florida’s higher educational system in his misguided effort to stamp out liberalism and “woke” ideology and install university presidents, educators, board members, and others who embrace the governor’s conservative agenda.
A 2024 report by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), details the “the various manifestations of political and legislative interfer­ence in Florida’s higher education system under the DeSantis adminis­tration and that of his predecessor, Rick Scott.”
“These include attacks on faculty academic freedom and tenure; the assault on the curricu­lum; the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; the development of a patronage system marked by politically connected administrative appointments; the stacking of the statewide board of governors with Republican former political officeholders and profes­sional political operatives beholden to the governor and the legislature; the passage of legislation making confidential identifying informa­tion of applicants for presidential positions at state universities or Florida College System institutions; political and legislative attacks on the higher education accreditation system; legal challenges to public employee unions; and the broader assault on the rights and social gains of LGBTQ+ communities.” 
In short order, DeSantis – term-limited from running again for governor – has enacted hostile takeovers of the New College, the University of Florida, Florida International University, and the University of West Florida. As the Florida Phoenix has reported, DeSantis is installing his political allies at state universities so that they can purge these institutions of ‘ideological concepts.’ To date, five of 12 schools have new presidents and another four are looking. 
People like Packer and Adora Obi Nweze, president of the Florida State Conference NAACP, issued calls to scrap the entire process and start again.
Nweze urged the FAMU Board of Trustees to “recommit to a fair and untainted process” that reflects the university’s legacy of academic excellence. 
She and others were ignored and Johnson now will become FAMU’s 13th president.
Introduction to campus
During a volatile meeting that ran about two hours, as Johnson introduced herself to the community, tempers ran hot. Packer warned trustees that choosing Johnson would be detrimental to FAMU’s future, but she sought to assuage those fears.
“I know that the comments you’re bringing – while they’re coming to me in a way that may evidence angst – are coming from your love for this university, your love for this university’s legacy, and your interest in making sure that you protect it. If I am selected, I would fight and win for FAMU,” Johnson told the crowd. 
“No, I’m not a Trojan horse. I was not sent here to dismantle FAMU. … “I would love the opportunity to work with you and to grow FAMU.” 
Johnson also said: “I understand the gravity of this moment. I’m grounded in the importance of FAMU’s legacy, and I’m energized by the opportunities that we have in front of us.” 
The new president served as vice president for governmental affairs (meaning she was a lobbyist) for Charter Communications, a telecom company, and is a former member of the State Board of Education.
I reached out to Desirée Nero, a corporate and government consultant and “a very proud alum,” said she understands the concerns but now that Johnson has been selected, FAMUANs must figure out how to work with her. 
“Universities are moving more in the direction of being managed like businesses. The president’s job is to raise money, build relationships, and increase the universities’ global impact and reputation. Marva Johnson can do that,” Nero said.
Nero gives Johnson props for succeeding as a Black woman in business – “I’m sure she has had to fight some battles in her rise to leadership,” she said. 
“She’s well educated; a Georgetown undergrad, an MBA from Emory and a J.D. from Georgia State,” said Nero, who has 20 years of experience working in leadership development within Florida State government. “Republicans and MAGA are not one and the same. There’s nothing recently that indicates she will walk the MAGA path.”
Disproportionately underfunded
FAMU, the state’s only public historically Black institution, was established in 1887 during the height of Jim Crow and segregation because African Americans weren’t allowed to attend white institutions. Racism and purposeful underinvestment has always dogged the university. 
In 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors – including DeSantis – urging these states to review $12 billion in funding disparities among land-grant universities. The U.S. Department of Education alleged that the states disproportionately underfunded Florida A&M University by nearly $2 billion compared to University of Florida – the second largest funding disparity among all land-grant universities.
This disparity has resulted in “inadequate resources and delay critical investments in everything from campus infrastructure to research and development to student support services,” then-U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona wrote. 
The Trump administration recently rescinded a $16.3 million grant that had been awarded to FAMU’s College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Meanwhile, FAMU is struggling to properly prepare its students to pass board examinations in its nursing, law, pharmacy, and physical therapy programs. Alan Levine, vice chair of the Florida Board of Governors, last year threatened to get rid of the programs if there’s no improvement.  
Those who support Johnson hope she has the political connections, fundraising acumen, and leadership skills to reverse these challenges. And they hope she will convince DeSantis not to mess with FAMU the way he did New College.  
“Change is inevitable and history has shown us that those who fight change are subject to be left behind,” Nero said. “Change isn’t coming to FAMU, it’s here. FAMU may be in the fight of its life and we need a warrior to champion this fight. This is too important to be confrontational.”

Minnesota is the second largest producer of hogs in the United States. With a population of roughly nine million, hogs outnumber humans here. Maybe that’s why, when I passed by a transport truck near a pork processing plant in Austin, Minnesota, I felt compelled to look inside.
As I peered through the slats, I locked eyes with one pig in particular. His body was covered in scratches. At only six months old, the typical age of slaughter in the pork industry, he was just minutes away from a brutal death.
What you may not realize is that the pork industry isn’t just a nightmare for hogs — it takes a tremendous toll on people, too. And right now, new policy stands to further endanger the health and safety of Minnesota’s roughly 17,000 meatpacking workers.
In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would allow slaughterhouses to permanently increase the speed of production. The USDA claims that the move eliminates “outdated administrative requirements that have slowed production and added unnecessary costs for American producers.”
Most meatpacking workers see faster line speeds as a direct threat to their health and safety on the job. Even before the threat of increased line speeds, meatpacking was one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, with some of the highest rates of workplace injury and illness across all industries. From 2013 to 2017, an average of eight workers per year died as a result of incidents in meatpacking plants.
More commonly, workers suffer from chronic musculoskeletal disorders caused by standing on the line for hours and repeating the same motions thousands of times a day. Carpal tunnel syndrome is especially common. Higher line speeds are likely to increase both the frequency and severity of these debilitating injuries.
The meatpacking industry relies heavily on workers from vulnerable populations, including immigrants and people with limited economic resources. This reality often leaves workers less likely to speak out about unsafe conditions or publicly advocate for labor rights.
Yet the situation has become so dire that, on April 17, hundreds of JBS meatpacking workers marched in shifts to speak out against increased line speeds and demand safer working conditions. This march marks the first demonstration of its kind at the Worthington plant in more than a decade.
Currently, JBS workers are processing more than 1,000 hogs per hour. Now, that rate could climb to more than 1,300. At some plants, like Quality Pork Processors in Austin, the faster pace is already a daily reality.
UFCW Local 663 — the union representing JBS workers in Worthington — is now in contract negotiations with JBS, advocating for conditions that would uphold safer line speeds and staffing levels.
“The decision to allow facilities to operate at higher speeds without any additional safety measures only puts workers and consumers at risk,” UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement.
The courage of JBS meatpacking workers to march reflects just how grave their health and safety concerns have become in the face of faster line speeds. When meatpacking companies prioritize corporate profits over worker well-being, the results are devastating. Minnesota’s meatpacking plants now face a critical choice: they can continue down a path that sacrifices health and dignity for efficiency, or they can lead by maintaining or reducing line speeds to protect workers.
In a 2019 interview with Human Rights Watch, Ignacio Davalos, a worker at a Smithfield-owned hog plant in Nebraska, put it this way: “When we’re dead and buried, our bones will keep hurting.”
With enough pressure from unions and consumers, Minnesota meatpacking workers may have a fighting chance at their fundamental right to safety.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz.)One of the nation’s largest real estate companies has transferred its corporate registration back to Indiana from the state of Delaware, in what Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales has dubbed a “big win.”
“We are proud to welcome Simon Property Group home.  This move is a big win for Indiana — and it sends a strong message that our state is open for business,” Morales said in a news release. His office’s Business Services Division managed the redomestication process. 
The domestication certificate was dated May 14, 2025 and took effect the next day.
The company cited “strong historical ties” with Indiana in a 2025 proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of an annual shareholders meeting last week in Indianapolis.
Simon and its predecessors have maintained headquarters in Indiana for more than 60 years, and in 2006, the company built its new physical home just steps away from the Statehouse. The company owns eight properties in Indiana and more than 70% of its corporate employees reside in-state, or about 3,000.

“Given our significant presence in Indiana, the Company is committed to the state’s business community and continued economic growth. We believe that redomesticating the Company to Indiana emphasizes this commitment in a meaningful,” the statement read. It also cited Elevance Health, Eli Lilly & Co., and Cummins as other “successful public companies” that are both headquartered and incorporated in Indiana.
“The legislators and judges making corporate law will be fellow members of the Indiana community, not residents of a state in which the Company has no substantial connections beyond being the historical state of incorporation of (Corporate Property Investors),” it continued. “The Board and (Governance and Nominating) Committee believe that local decision-makers have a deeper understanding of our business and, therefore, are more likely to make decisions on a more fully informed basis and lasting way.”
Simon acquired and merged with Corporate Property Investors and Corporate Realty Consultants in 1998, according to the document. It was previously incorporated as a real estate investment trust in Maryland in 1993.
The board and committee “did not find that aspect of Delaware domicile compelling such that it justifies a split between the Company’s legal home and its physical home,” the statement read.
But another main motivator was “meritless litigation” against the company “brought by financially interested law firms” — even though it has no pending litigation related to Delaware law, according to the statement.
Simon described Indiana’s approach to corporate law as “statute-focused” and Delaware’s as more dependent on judicial interpretation. The company noted that even proposed legislation to ease litigation-related risks couldn’t convince it to stay because “Indiana still has the better balance,” but it acknowledge that Hoosier case law is more limited.
Indiana Code would also explicitly let Simon’s board members take into account customers, employees, suppliers, surrounding communities and other stakeholders — not just shareholders. The company said that “can help foster a more holistic governance model and potentially reduce distraction, short-term bias, and missed opportunities.”
The company also expects to save money. Instead of paying Delaware a $250,000 franchise tax annually, it would owe Indiana $50 every two years when it files business entity reports.

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”


A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
New laws proliferate
Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
Washington state compromises
For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

Dave Griffith, a Republican from Jefferson City, speaks at the House Health and Mental Health committee Feb. 17,(Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri Veterans Commission has received $80 million from sales taxes collected from marijuana dispensaries and other fees since the state’s cannabis program began in 2020.  
Of that, $33.8 million has come in during the current fiscal year, which began in July and ends June 30.
The money goes towards the operational needs of the state’s seven veterans homes, including payroll and maintenance of existing infrastructure, a commission spokeswoman said.
While it may appear that the money is a big boon for veteran homes across the state, the cannabis funds have rolled in just as revenue from casinos has rapidly dropped off, said Democratic state Sen. Steve Roberts of St. Louis, who is vice chair of the commission.
The commission receives funds from the $2 fee people pay to enter a casino, he said, but those numbers have declined significantly since the pandemic. The marijuana funds are helping fill that hole, he said, but money for the state’s veterans home remains in limbo every year.
“We still need to find a mechanism to ensure that [veterans homes] have the funding they need,” Roberts said, “because just with the casinos and marijuana funds, it’s not enough. And it’s forcing the commission to continue to have to go back to the legislature to ask for additional money.”
Republican state Rep. Dave Griffith of Jefferson City, who is also a board commissioner, compared the situation to a business unable to make a long-range plan. 
“The Missouri Veterans Commission can’t do that,” Griffith said. “They have to go from year to year to year to see what is appropriated by the General Assembly.”
He disagrees with House members who believe that marijuana funding is the solution, he said, and that general revenue can be appropriated elsewhere. 
“The Senate actually has done a better job of taking care of the veterans commission and some of the properties that we’ve got,” Griffith said. “It’s frustrating for me that it seems like every time we want to try to do something for veterans, we’re looking at vices — gambling and drug use.”
Missourians voted in November 2018 to adopt a constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana, and it also requires fees and taxes generated by the program, minus operational expenses, be transferred to the commission. 
Then in 2022, voters approved another amendment to legalize adult-use marijuana. With these sales, revenues from taxes and fees are divided between three causes: grants for substance use prevention, the public defenders system and the veterans commission. 
In fiscal year 2024, the commission received $19.4 million between both medical and adult-use sales, and $33.8 million in 2025.
 The Division of Cannabis Regulation transfers funds from medical marijuana sales tax revenues and fees to the Missouri Veterans Commission. Similarly, the division transfers funds from adult-use cannabis sales tax revenues and fees to the commission, Missouri Public Defender System and DHSS for its substance use disorder grant program. 
In the fiscal year that begins in July, the commission is set to receive $32.6 million.
However, future funding depends on the health of the cannabis industry, which can experience ups and downs, Griffith said.
Both Roberts and Griffith said they’re committed to finding more stable funding for veterans. 
“We’re very fortunate that this is a bipartisan issue,” Roberts said. “There are veterans homes in Democratic and Republican districts, and all the senators I’ve talked to seem to be very supportive.”
Roberts pointed to Gov. Mike Kehoe’s State of the State address in January, where he addressed the underfunding of the homes and need for continued support. 
“Under the Kehoe administration,” the governor said, “no veterans homes will close due to a lack of state funding.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021725-0270-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

The state Public Disclosure Commission levied the civil penalty on Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW following a short hearing in which the union did not contest the punishment. SEIU represents more than 30,000 nurses, health care workers, and behavioral health workers in Washington.
Under a stipulated agreement, SEIU 1199NW will pay $3,000 within 30 days of the signing of the final order. The remaining amount is suspended if the union complies with campaign finance laws without significant violations for four years.
Let’s Go Washington filed the original complaint last November. The group alleged the union did not report a substantial sum of expenditures made in October until after the Nov. 4 election. That violated campaign finance laws intended to give voters campaign spending information before they cast their ballots, the group said.
Commission staff investigated and found SEIU1199NW made three expenditures totaling $430,000 on Oct. 3 and two others, totaling $2,400, on Oct. 21, that were not reported until Nov. 11. 
Those included a pair of $200,000 contributions to the political campaign committees of the state House and Senate Democratic caucuses, according to the commission’s online database.
On Thursday, assistant attorney general Susie Giles-Klein, representing the commission staff, said there was no evidence the union acted intentionally to deceive voters. But, she said, this is an established committee and its finance officials should have known the rules.
Commissioners deliberated briefly in executive session before emerging and voting 3-0 to impose the penalty.
Union officials did not speak at Thursday’s hearing.
In December, an attorney for SEIU1199NW acknowledged the late filing but denied it was done willfully.
“The Union regrets its error and supports the work of the PDC and its mission. However, as the error was unintentional, the Union requests that a written warning be used as a remedy for this inadvertent violation,” attorney Carson Flora wrote to the commission’s compliance officer.
Let’s Go Washington founder Brian Heywood criticized the commission’s action as too lenient for “one of the most active political organizations in the state.”
“They knew what they were doing by hiding that information,” Heywood said in a statement. “This is one of the most serious public disclosure infractions and should be treated as such, but they were given a relatively minor penalty by the PDC despite admitting their guilt.”
He said it raises questions about whether the campaign watchdog is “giving preferential treatment to politically aligned organizations.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/money-closuep-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

(Courtesy of Feeding South Dakota)As Congress weighs the latest budget reconciliation bill, it’s important to take a step back and consider how these decisions will affect everyday people in South Dakota. Reducing federal spending and promoting self-reliance are important goals, but some of the proposed changes could unintentionally create more problems than they solve.
If you’ve been to the grocery store lately, you’ve likely noticed how much harder it has become to afford the basics. For many families in South Dakota this isn’t just a budget concern – it’s a daily challenge.
We urge Rep. Dusty Johnson, Sen. Mike Rounds and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to consider the concerning impacts that the current proposal by the House could have. Federal support for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would be significantly reduced, shifting more of the cost to states. South Dakota’s share of that expense could range from $9 million to $18 million as early as 2028 — an increased pressure on a state budget already stretched thin.
SD Rep. Johnson votes yes as U.S. House Republicans push through budget reconciliation bill

At the same time, it would impact the South Dakota economy as SNAP supports 789 retailers in the state to the tune of over $156 million. Each SNAP dollar has up to $1.80 of economic impact, supporting the supply chain from farmer to store. Reduce the program, reduce the revenue.
The increased state cost and reduced revenue would force states to make tough choices: cut benefits, limit eligibility or raise taxes to cover the gap.
Proposed Medicaid cuts would hit rural hospitals especially hard, many of which are already stretched thin. These facilities are often the only source of care in their communities, and losing access would be devastating.
The bill also includes new requirements tied to work. SNAP already includes work incentives and gradually reduces benefits as income rises. In South Dakota, over 80% of SNAP recipients live in a family that has one working adult.
Congress modernized SNAP by requiring regular updates to the monthly benefits. However, the current bill includes a proposal to limit future updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, which determines SNAP benefit levels. This would reduce support over time, even as food prices remain high. The average SNAP benefit is still just $6.57 per person, per day, in our state.
At Feeding South Dakota, we are seeing more working families, seniors, children and veterans through our programs and partners; in fact, 15% more than this time last year. We are operating at full capacity and have already felt the very real impact of federal changes after food for 147,000 meals was immediately discontinued in April. It is critical that federal programs stay strong to support the fight to end hunger, or the gap between need and resources will become too great for us to close.
If you take nothing else from this, know that the proposed cuts would:

Increase hunger.
Decrease local revenue.
Overwhelm already strained food pantries.


We urge our lawmakers to think critically about any cuts through a budget reconciliation bill that undermines SNAP and Medicaid.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMore than 100,000 income-eligible residents are going to have free access to Vermont’s state parks this year, thanks to a first-in-the-nation pilot program.The Park Access Fund Pilot Program will give people who receive benefits through the state’s Economic Services Division or the Women, Infants and Children program free entrance to any of Vermont’s 55 state parks during the season, which runs from May through October. To participate in the program, residents can show their EBT or WIC cards at the park entrance. Those who are eligible but do not have an EBT card can visit their local Economic Services Division District Office to request a card that can be used for state park entrance in 2025, according to the Park Access Fund website.Once inside, all guests have the option to participate in free park-led activities, such as bird walks, concerts and evening campfires. The state parks events and programs page contains information on upcoming programming. READ MORE
The initiative originated from an idea to bring park accessibility to Vermonters experiencing food insecurity, according to Sarah Alberghini Winters, the executive director of Vermont Parks Forever, which runs the program. This new program is an extension of the Parks Access Fund, which grants free park passes to 55 nonprofit community partners to help their clients get outside, according to Winters.Winters said she hopes this year’s expansion of the program is well-utilized. Depending on its success and donors’ willingness to support future efforts, the pilot program could continue in 2026 and beyond, she said. “It really takes a village,” Winters said. “We’re so thankful to have support from local and national foundations.”Vermonters not eligible for this pilot program can also receive assistance accessing state parks through library passes and the Green Mountain Passport.Financial barriers are not the only thing preventing some Vermonters from getting outside, Winters said, but this program is a starting point. She said her hope is that Vermont will set an example for other states to consider expanding programs for outdoor accessibility. “We’ll continue to learn about how we can help with other barriers that exist,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s state parks are offering free entry for income-eligible residents in 2025.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/plymouth-state-park-1-20230921-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

Greg Gianforte […]","A picture of a sprinkler on grass (Photo by Michael Mol via Flickr | CC-BY-SA 2.0). Montana’s public officials take an oath of office when they assume their positions.  This is not optional and is required by Montana’s Constitution:

Article III – General Government – Section 3.  Oath of office.  Members of the legislature and all executive, ministerial and judicial officers, shall take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation, before they enter upon the duties of their offices: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States, and the constitution of the state of Montana, and that I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity (so help me God).”
 

Now, it appears that another enclave for the mega-wealthy is defying both Montana’s water rights laws and the constitution — and so far, they’re getting away with it as Gov. Greg Gianforte and Attorney General Austin Knudsen are lax in upholding their sworn duty “to protect and defend” our constitution.
As reported this week, the Crazy Mountain Ranch is an 18,000 acre super-upscale development by “Lone Mountain Land Co., a subsidiary of CrossHarbor Capital Partners, a private-equity firm behind the development of the equally exclusive Yellowstone Club, Spanish Peaks Mountain Club and Moonlight Basin Resort at Big Sky.”
By now Montanans are deep into learning the hard lessons that those with big money tend to do what they want, following the old adage that “it’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission.”  And in this case, neither permission nor forgiveness are even being asked for — merely a “we’ll do what we want and if you don’t like it, sue us.”
But there’s another old adage in the West that’s equally applicable here:  “Whiskey is for drinking, water is for fighting.”  And while the monied clients of the “ranch” may be eating thick steaks and sipping old whiskey, the multi-generational ranchers whose water rights are threatened are “lawyering up” and fighting — and they could use some help from the governor and attorney general.
In short, the Crazy Mountain Ranch spent a million bucks to “lay turf” on a 112-acre golf course — and they have stated their intention to water that high-price turf with or without state-approved rights to the water, even openly admitting they did so last year and intend to do so this year.  There’s a word for these kinds of people, and that word is “scofflaws.” 
The same constitution both Gianforte and Knudsen swore to uphold is clear: “All surface, underground, flood, and atmospheric waters within the boundaries of the state are the property of the state for the use of its people and are subject to appropriation for beneficial uses as provided by law.”
Despite wearing cowboy boots and jeans, Gianforte is not a rancher and may not understand the complexity of the Prior Appropriation Doctrine.  But Attorney General Austin Knudsen, who was raised in Culbertson in rural Roosevelt County, surely knows that water is the lifeblood of ranching in Montana.  As former Speaker of the House, he is also well acquainted with the state’s water rights laws — and the need to either follow those laws or be back to killing each other with shovels on irrigation diversion ditches. 
If these mega-wealthy developers want to defy Montana’s water laws, then let them take on the State and all Montanans, not just a handful of old ranchers they can easily outspend. Comes now the “call of duty” to Gianforte and Knudsen to honor their oaths “with fidelity,” protect the state’s water rights system, and immediately move to shut down the irrigation of the elite scofflaws’ “turf.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3767275297_684e1df395_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann stepped up to the front of a room in the back of Kavanaugh’s Esquire Club on the east side of Madison with a grin and quickly started a chant about Gov. Tony Evers.
“Tony’s got to go. Who’s with me?” Schoemann said about the current second-term Democratic governor. He encouraged others in the room to join him. “Tony’s gotta go… Tony’s gotta go. I’d like him to hear it if you don’t mind.”
The crowd of about 30 clapped enthusiastically and slowly started to pick up the chant.
Schoemann, who wore a red UW-Madison quarter zip up, jeans and a camo hat with his campaign logo across the front, was at the restaurant for the Dane County Republican’s monthly “Pints and Politics” meeting. It’s the one of the latest stops for Schoemann, who is the first candidate of either major party to launch his campaign in the 2026 governor’s race. 
Evers’ decision on whether he will seek a third term is still up in the air. He recently told WisEye that he is “not spending very much time at all thinking about whether I’m going to run or not.” 
Getting a head start
With about 14 months before a Republican primary might be held, Schoemann is working to get a head start on other potential candidates. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is mulling a run for the office, was critical of Evers as he addressed party members at the state GOP’s annual convention. Bill Berrien, a Whitefish Bay businessman and Navy SEAL veteran, recently formed a political action committee.
Schoemann said that it’s “entirely possible” for Wisconsin to be more competitive for Republicans. He launches his campaign as the Republican Party of Wisconsin is reevaluating how to win after their preferred candidate lost in the state Supreme Court race and as Democrats have won 12 of the last 15 statewide elections.
Schoemann sought to start his “Tony” chant a couple times as he spoke to the group — at one point telling attendees that he is the son of a Lutheran Minister and “can’t handle a congregation unless they join with me.” The crowd joined the chant more quickly this time, but Schoemann cut it off quickly as he pulled his camo hat off and placed it over his heart and encouraged attendees to stand up to sing “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” with him.
Schoemann has worked in Washington County as the elected county executive for the last five years and as the county administrator for six years prior. He owns a farm in the town of Trenton, located between West Bend and Grafton, with his wife and is the father of two.
Schoemann told attendees that he joined the Army National Guard, attended UW-Whitewater and then served in Iraq in 2003. Throughout the event, Schoemann returned to his faith and military service, telling the crowd that “love your neighbor” has been central to his work and will be central to his campaign. 
“It’s changed the trajectory of my life permanently,” Schoemann said, describing a memory of his time in Iraq when he gave bottles of water to a child who was drinking from a puddle.
“As he approaches the puddle, I’m thinking, ‘Oh, he’s just going to jump around in the puddle and play.’ He kneels down, and starts cupping his hands and starts drinking out of that puddle,” Schoemann said. 
“When I came back home, that moment kept coming back to me over and over and over, and I dedicated the rest of my life to the service and sacrifice of the guys and gals who didn’t come home, either in whole or in part, and of my Lord, Jesus, by loving my neighbor,” he continued, “ and that, ladies and gentlemen, is how we are going to win this election. We are going to turn Wisconsin red by loving our neighborhood.”
Rush Limbaugh and Ronald Reagan
Schoemann said he grew up a “Rush Limbaugh” and “Ronald Reagan baby” — with beliefs in smaller government, lower taxes and strong defense — and that those ideas have shaped his service in local government.
Schoemann repeatedly criticized Evers and spoke about his record.
“Under the education governor, are your schools better than they were six years ago?” Schoemann asked, with answers of ‘no’ coming from some in the room. “He’s filling potholes right now — getting his picture taken in every community can get to… Are your roads really all that much better than they were six years ago? No, no. They’re not, and if you look across the state of Wisconsin on every issue issue after issue, things aren’t better.”
Evers has been traveling across the state last week helping fill potholes as a part of an annual effort to call attention to the issue of improving the roads and his recent budget proposal of to dedicate funds for that purpose —  though Republicans have removed that from the budget. At one stop on his trip, Evers told reporters that he didn’t know much about Schoemann but thinks he’s “gonna have to be another Donald Trump.” 
“That’s the only way Republicans can kind of move forward in this day and age,” Evers said, according to WSAW-TV 7.
Schoemann said that he decided to run because he is “sick and tired of our kids, leaving the state for other opportunities in different states and not coming back” and “sick and tired of our retirees leaving this state that has become a complete tax hell.”
Schoemann also compared himself to former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson.
“Back when I was a kid in 1986, Tommy Thompson took out another Tony — [former Gov.] Tony Earl. A young, energetic Republican did very, very well in Dane County, and eventually by 1994, I believe he won Dane County,” said Schoemann, who is 43. 
Goal: Lose by less in Dane County
Thompson is the last Wisconsin governor to win a third term in office, and Schoemann wants to ensure that stays true by taking a page out of Thompson’s playbook. Schoemann said he would have three rules for his campaign: go to the Northwoods, go to Milwaukee and go to Dane County. He said that since his campaign launched he had visited Florence County to talk with a group of people, who, he said, likely “hadn’t seen a statewide elected official in decades,” had been on the radio in Milwaukee and his Tuesday evening stop in Madison was his second already. 
Schoemann said Republicans need to lose by less in Dane County, pointing out that President Donald Trump won the state of Wisconsin with nearly 23% of the vote in the deep blue county. 
“We’ve got to be pushing back towards 26, 27, 28[%], and we’re only going to do it by having conversations with our neighbors and physically being present,” Schoemann said. “I can tell you you’re going to get sick of seeing me because I will be back again and again and again. I want to hear from you what this state needs to be. I want to hear from you what direction the state needs to go.”
Schoemann then took questions from the audience.
One attendee asked about what he would do about property taxes. Local communities across the state have been strapped for funds in recent years due to restrictions in the ways that they can raise revenue with many turning to raising property taxes through referendums to help afford services.
“How many of you live in the city of Madison? How are you liking that new referendum for the school district and the city — one-two punch?” Schoemann replied. He added that property tax rates in Washington Co. are low because of decisions he’s made. He said that at times when they have “considered alternatives where we needed additional resources, we go to the people and ask.” 
The county went  to referendum in 2024 to help prevent cuts to its public safety services. While the referendum failed, a deal on shared revenue and a local sales tax for Milwaukee that  lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers made helped the county avoid the cuts. 
That deal led to a back and forth over social media between Schoemann and Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson after Schoemann took a jab at the city because of the tax. Milwaukee leaders were prominent advocates in helping secure the state funding, which has helped communities across the state, including Washington County.
Banning ‘Democracy in the Park,’ encouraging early voting
In response to a question about elections, Schoemann said that he believes in purging voter rolls, banning voting events including ‘Democracy in the Park” — a COVID-era effort held by the city of Madison where poll workers picked up absentee ballots from voters who dropped them off  — and having “significant election integrity” measures. He also talked about promoting early voting in more rural areas. 
“The clerks are part time, most of them work out of their houses. They don’t have an office at the town hall… In those places. If you want to have in-person absentee voting, you have to schedule an appointment at the home of the clerk. In Madison and in Milwaukee… the convenience level is through the roof right now,” Schoemann said. “It’s not quite seven days a week, 24 hours a day for those 13 days, but it isn’t far either, especially as compared to those towns.” 
Schoemann said his county sought to incentivize local municipal workers to add in-person absentee voting days and times by paying them 150% of the cost. He said the state needs to “completely transform how we think about elections in Wisconsin.” 
Schoemann segued to criticizing Evers for his relationship with lawmakers and the number of bills he has vetoed, saying changes in law need to come as the result of the governor working as a “coequal” branch with the Legislature. He said that the governor should work with bills before outright vetoing them.
“The fact that this governor doesn’t have the leadership capability to walk down the hallway and talk to legislative leaders is an embarrassment to our state,” Schoemann said, referring to communication difficulties between lawmakers and Evers, who are currently negotiating the next state budget.
Schoemann said that he wouldn’t want to “throw money” to help address education problems, though he thinks the system currently in place is outdated. He also said that he would seek to help change the veto power that governors have. 
This will be the first time Schoemann runs in a statewide election. He promised the room that no one would “outwork” him. 
“There might be more money. There might be worse press, there might be all kinds of things, but no one will outwork me,” Schoemann said.
In the weeks before deciding to run, Schoemann told the room that he asked his wife if she was sure she wanted him to run. 
“You know what she said to me?” Schoemann asked. “‘Well, can’t be worse than Iraq.’”

It's not happening here, but critics want to make sure it doesn't.","New Jersey lawmakers are considering banning octopus farming. Supporters say it is cruel to octopuses and breeds germs that threaten public health, while critics in the seafood industry complain it would hurt their business. (Image courtesy of the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, 2013 Northeast U.S. Canyons Expedition)Aquaculture farmers in New Jersey grow everything from clams and oysters to trout, bass, and other fish popular with sport anglers.
They don’t farm octopuses. Several state lawmakers want to keep it that way and now are pushing legislation that would ban businesses from raising octopuses in captivity to sell as seafood.
Washington and California already have such bans in place. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) introduced a bill last summer in Congress that would have enacted a national ban, but it failed to advance. The only known octopus farm in the U.S., in Hawaii, shut down in 2023 after years of advocacy by animal rights activists, and a plan to farm octopuses in Spain has also drawn opposition.
In Trenton Thursday, the Senate’s economic growth committee heard testimony on a bill that also would prohibit businesses from selling, possessing, or transporting farmed octopuses, with violators facing fines of up to $1,000 a day. They did not vote on the measure, with committee chair and bill sponsor Sen. Nilsa Cruz-Perez saying she would use public feedback to improve the bill.
Most of those who testified urged the committee to enact a ban, calling octopus farming cruel because octopuses are intelligent creatures who feel pain and stress.
They’re escape artists, too, so farming them threatens the broader ecosystem and its wildlife, as well as public health, should they break out of captivity, said Kerrie Espuga, New Jersey state director of the Animal Rights Initiative. They’re voracious carnivores and consequently create a lot of waste, she added.
“Wastewater from such facilities can spread harmful pathogens and parasites, which are transmissible to humans. Since octopuses are immune to vaccines, the farms could turn into pathogen incubators,” Espuga said.
Brian Hackett of the Associated Humane Societies seconded concerns about public health and the environment.
“Anytime an animal is factory-farmed, where mass numbers of animals are confined in a tiny space, given tons of antibiotics to prevent them from getting sick because they’re in disgusting conditions very close to one another, it’s a very bad situation for human health, environmental health, animal welfare, all things considered,” Hackett said.
The bill’s critics complained that a ban is pointless.
“Why are we passing a law now to ban something which isn’t even happening in the state of New Jersey?” said Scot Mackey of the Garden State Seafood Association, which represents more than 1,200 commercial fishermen.
Aquaculture is “the future of seafood production in the United States,” Mackey said. Banning octopus farming would be another restriction on an already overregulated industry, he added.
He reminded legislators of other sea creatures they’ve protected from commercial fishing, including striped bass, horseshoe crabs, and shark fins.
“Slowly and surely, we are dying, the commercial fishing industry, from the death of 1,000 cuts,” Mackey said. “As we continue down these paths of setting up these special rules and closing down these doors and windows of opportunity, you’re just making it harder and harder for hard-working people to make a living in the state of New Jersey.”
Hackett pushed back on that claim.
“Nothing in this bill would impact the Garden State Seafood Association from catching wild-caught octopus,” he said.
Kathleen Schatzmann of the Animal Legal Defense Fund said a ban is needed, even though octopus farming isn’t happening here, “to prohibit rolling out the red carpet for such an industry before there is an economic tie to this industry.”
“There’s research being done on octopus farming, but there is no viable way to farm octopus, and that’s why we want to ensure that big companies and those corporations do not come to New Jersey to try to get a foothold on this industry,” Schatzmann said.
The measure was one of two the committee considered Thursday that touch on animal welfare. They advanced another bill that would ban the surgical declawing of cats.
Supporters said these surgeries hurt cats and can cause long-term disabilities, with one likening it to an amputation. They also can drive declawed cats to resort to biting in self-defense, leading cat owners to surrender their pets to animal shelters, Hackett said.
A veterinarian opposed to the bill testified that pets’ medical care should be decided by pet owners and veterinarians, not legislators.
The Assembly versions of both the octopus farming and cat declawing bills have yet to be heard by any committee.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Democratic lawmakers are circulating a draft bill to extend the soon-to-end state child care support program and fund it with $480 million that was stripped from the 2025-27 state budget.
The proposed legislation follows action earlier this month by Republican lawmakers to remove child care support and more than 600 other items that Gov. Tony Evers included in his draft budget.
Both Evers’ proposal and the Democrats’ bill aim to continue support that child care providers have been receiving since 2020 as part of federal pandemic relief.
“This funding has been essential in continuing successful programs that support our early educators, child care providers, parents, and most importantly, our kids,” said state Rep. Alex Joers (D-Middleton) at a Capitol news conference Thursday announcing the legislation.
The $20 million that Wisconsin paid out each month to providers through mid-2023 “kept our early educators in the workforce, held tuition down for parents and provided a direct investment in our children during the most crucial years of their childhood development,” Joers said.
Payments were cut to $10 million a month in June 2023, and the last of those funds will be paid out by early July.
“But with this impending deadline, child care providers and early educators are faced with the impossible decision to either raise rates or have to close altogether,” Joers said. “Without assurance of this funding lifeline, many have already made that decision and have devastatingly shut their doors forever.”
Citing recent reports, Joers said that there are 48,000 children on waiting lists for child care in Wisconsin. In a survey of providers, 78% said they would have to raise fees for infant care — the most expensive age group in most child care programs.
“Altogether, if nothing changes, parents are looking at having to find an additional up to $2,600 in their yearly budget,” Joers said.
First-term Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi), the lead state Senate author on the legislation, said that when she was running for office last year, voters repeatedly shared their concerns about the cost and scarcity of child care.
“We have historically undervalued and underpaid child care and early education professionals,” Keyeski said. “This is no longer tenable.”
She described the plight of one constituent who had to change providers three times after the first and then the second provider went out of business because of financial difficulties or other constraints. The mother told her that her current provider — the third — had rates that are “at the top” of what the family could afford.
Keyeski said the provider has told the woman that unless the state can continue with its support, the center’s rates will go up $40 a week, or $160 a month. For the couple, “this increase is unsustainable,” she said. “Her family is left wondering, what to do next?”
Wisconsin’s rural communities have been especially hard hit, she added: In 70% of them, there are three or more children for every child care opening.
“In my district alone, over 34,000 children need care, but there are only about 26,000 available slots,” Keyeski said.
Child care should be viewed as essential infrastructure, said state Rep. Renuka Mayadev (D-Madison).
“And as a state, we support infrastructure. We maintain roads, we maintain bridges. Why is funding childcare such a fight?” Mayadev said.
Wages of less than $14 an hour are driving child care workers out of the field, she added. “There is no other industry where such high value work is being done at such dismal low wages.”
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) — accompanied by her toddler son before she took him to his child care provider near the Capitol — said the legislation calls for $480 million in state funds over the next two years.
“But I think the real question is what it will cost the state if we don’t do it,” Roys said. She forecast “continued massive closures” of child care centers.
“Already over 60% of child care providers have classrooms sitting empty or slots that can’t be filled because they don’t have the teachers to fill them,” she added.
Roys said child care was a critical need in order for the state to address persistent shortages of people to fill jobs.
“In critical areas like public safety, in K-12 education, in health care — what is it going to mean if the parents of even more kids can’t get child care?” Roys said. “We can’t afford that. We have to make this investment.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250522_094444-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

Moose, turkey, antelope and pheasant were among the delicacies highlighted at the Wild Game Cookoff in Lander.

Not so at the Wyoming Wildlife Federation’s Wild Game Cookoff. At this annual culinary competition in Lander, amateur chefs push the boundaries with exotic techniques and innovative combinations to showcase the harvested game in all sorts of unexpected ways. 
Here was moose, slow roasted for eight hours in a smoky chile and spice brine before being griddled in a soft taco with melted cheese and topped with avocado crema, pickled onions and cilantro. Dean Christianson, who was handing out plates, made sure eaters had containers of extra consommé for sopping up. Anders Christianson of team Kifaru International was forking out the tender meat of the bull he had harvested in Alaska and braised all day. 
Elsewhere, elk meatballs encased in rice were fried like the Italian delight Arancini — using cast iron skillets over an open-air cook stove for a chuck-wagon twist. These were dipped in chokecherry mayonnaise and washed down with chokecherry wine. Austin Chase of team Wild Iris had gathered the chokecherries and harvested the elk.

Maven, an outdoor gear company that also sponsored a team, had put out a staff call to contribute wild game for the event. The resulting mixture of pheasant, elk, antelope, and other game meat was chopped up and fried in the Japanese karaage style, and participants were served the crispy morsels with a squirt of Kewpie mayonnaise and pickled vegetables tart enough to cut through the richness. 
The Wild Turkey Federation, which kept it classic with savory turkey, elk and veggie kabobs charred just so and served alongside chokecherry chipotle sauce, won the judge’s choice for a simple recipe done exactly right.
And the people’s choice award? That honor went to Kifaru’s moose tacos. 
They were savory and satisfying on their own. Dipped in the rich consommé? Undeniable.

Sen. Lummis and state lawmakers work, across the aisle, to encourage innovation while protecting consumers who invest in one type of cryptocurrency, writes Sen. Rothfuss and Rep. Singh.
The post Wyoming’s bipartisan leadership on digital assets is a model for the nation appeared first on WyoFile .","A recent WyoFile opinion piece by Kerry Drake offered commentary about the GENIUS Act, bipartisan federal legislation designed to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. While we always welcome thoughtful discussions about digital asset policy, Drake’s piece contained inaccuracies about the legislation’s current status and Wyoming’s ongoing bipartisan efforts.

Opinion

Since 2018, Wyoming’s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology has approached digital assets with a clear and consistent vision: to regulate in a way that enables innovation rather than restricts it, while ensuring robust protection for consumers and financial markets. Our simple, but impactful, goal has been to encourage responsible innovation, protect everyday users and firmly position Wyoming as a national leader in financial technology.
This approach has yielded significant results. Wyoming is recognized internationally for its progressive, clear and responsible digital asset legislation, having passed more than 35 bipartisan laws covering everything from decentralized autonomous organizations to digital identity and custodial standards. Our state has proven government can work effectively and cooperatively to foster innovation while safeguarding the public interest.
U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis has been instrumental in advancing this bipartisan model at the federal level. She has worked closely for years with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, forging a rare and effective cross-party partnership focused on building a responsible digital asset framework for the nation. She has championed the GENIUS Act, which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins. The law would implement a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. These digital assets are designed to serve as a means of payment and maintain a stable value relative to a fixed amount of national currency. 
Sen. Lummis’ legislative approach mirrors Wyoming’s proven strategy: regulate to enable rather than restrict, balancing innovation with robust consumer protections.
The GENIUS Act itself is not about political posturing or partisan fights. Instead, it seeks to provide clarity and consumer protection in a sector — currently resembling “the bad part” of the old Wild West — that’s confusing, inconsistent and potentially risky. Clear regulatory guidelines at the federal level are essential if we want to avoid stifling innovation or leaving American consumers vulnerable.
Some have suggested that the GENIUS Act’s progress hinges on the support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. It’s important to clarify that she was not directly involved in the negotiations surrounding this legislation and has consistently expressed opposition to digital asset frameworks of any kind. The reality is that there is no version of a stablecoin bill that would earn her support. That’s why bipartisan efforts like those between Lummis and Gillibrand are so critical — they reflect a genuine commitment to thoughtful policymaking rather than ideological opposition.
Despite assertions to the contrary, the GENIUS Act recently advanced through the Senate with substantial bipartisan support on a 66-32 vote, thanks to Lummis’ determined bipartisan negotiations. Wyoming’s leadership on digital asset regulation serves as a positive example of effective governance. This work is not about partisanship but about partnership, demonstrating how lawmakers from both sides of the aisle can deliver real solutions. Our collaborative efforts in the Wyoming Legislature, alongside Lummis’ leadership in Washington, show that Republicans and Democrats can navigate complex issues together, crafting policies that protect consumers, foster innovation and strengthen America’s position in the global digital economy.
In a time when cooperation seems increasingly rare, Wyoming’s approach illustrates what can be accomplished when lawmakers prioritize solutions over politics. We are proud to continue this bipartisan tradition and remain committed to making Wyoming a beacon of responsible, innovative governance in the digital asset space.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., running for his first full six-year term in 2026, is getting early outside ad support from Senate Republicans that shows he and the party are taking a potential matchup with registered nonpartisan labor leader Dan Osborn seriously.
One Nation, the best-known advertising arm of the Senate GOP’s Super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, is announcing a seven-figure digital ad buy on Ricketts’ behalf Friday, the Examiner has learned. It’s starting with a positive ad.
Chris Gustafson, communications director for One Nation, touted Ricketts’ “long and trusted record” of results in Lincoln and Washington, D.C., where Ricketts is already making waves as a major fundraiser for the Senate GOP.
The Ricketts record

The online ad unveiled this week reminds Republicans and others about the Legislature’s push while he was governor to remove income taxes from Social Security income and of his federal push to do the same with President Donald Trump.
It’s noteworthy in part because it appears aimed at shoring up Ricketts on Social Security, because Osborn, who made Ricketts’ senior colleague, U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., sweat in a close 2024 race is mulling a 2026 bid against Ricketts.
Osborn relentlessly hammered Fischer and congressional Republicans for doing too little to protect Social Security and has said he would make sure that the benefits were protected from potential budget cuts. He campaigned on the issue.
It’s also interesting because Fischer drew criticism from national Republicans for waiting too late in the race to spend money attacking and defining Osborn. She  eventually sought help from Senate Republicans to beat him back with outside ads.
Gustafson and other people familiar with the race agreed that Senate Republicans are willing to be more aggressive sooner in the Osborn race than is typical for a GOP-led state. Political observers saw it as a sign to donors to get and stay engaged. 
The Osborn threat
Osborn has shown the ability to raise funds, having raised and spent nearly $15 million against Fischer, according to OpenSecrets.org. But Ricketts is a prolific fundraiser, too. His family owns the Chicago Cubs, and his political team has a cut-throat reputation.

Ricketts’ campaign team had no immediate comment on the ad buy. Osborn is still building his campaign apparatus. But when Fischer needed outside help, Osborn said it was a sign the millionaires and billionaires were paying attention.
Fischer and many Republicans have criticized Osborn for taking money from Senate Democrats and major Democratic donors funded through normal PACs and dark money groups — and then calling himself nonpartisan.
She called him a Democrat in sheep’s clothing. Osborn has denied being part of either party, pointing to his registration and willingness to hear people out. He has said he’s more focused on the needs of working people than their political beliefs. 
Why Ricketts is running again
Ricketts is known for cutting spending and taxes at the state level. He focused much of his time as governor on remaking processes for applying for government help to boost response times. Critics have said he slashed too much.
In Congress, he has been a reliable Republican vote. He has said his goal is to bring the same approach he brought to Lincoln to Washington, D.C., saying that the federal government could be run leaner and more efficiently.
In November, Ricketts won a special election to the final two years of former Republican U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term after Gov. Jim Pillen appointed him to the office initially. He agreed to run again as part of the appointment process.

The ban related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was announced Monday during a daylong visit to the Cornhusker state by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. […],"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins at a stop in Nebraska Monday signed what she called a “historic” waiver to ban Nebraska recipients of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) from using the public grocery aid to buy soda, soft drinks and energy drinks. (Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture)LINCOLN — Nebraska has become the first state in the nation to restrict low-income recipients of public grocery aid from using SNAP benefits to buy soda and energy drinks.
The ban related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was announced Monday during a daylong visit to the Cornhusker state by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.
Rollins, accompanied by Gov. Jim Pillen on her three-stop tour, was following through on a request Pillen had made earlier. She said the waiver she signed while in Fremont was the first approved by the USDA. It becomes effective Jan. 1.
Pillen, in a news conference last month, said he planned to submit a request for the federal waiver to remove the drink items he describes as unhealthy “junk.”
‘First of its kind’
“There’s absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,” said Pillen.
Rollins called the move “historic” and, in a statement, called Pillen a pioneer, along with the governors of six other states, in improving health in the nation. The waiver amends the definition of food products to be purchased by SNAP benefits, excluding soda, soft drinks, and energy drinks.
“Today’s waiver to remove soda and energy drinks from SNAP is the first of its kind, and it is a historic step to Make America Healthy Again,” Rollins said, adopting the phrasing popularized by the Trump administration’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Rollins’ visit and approval of the move came the same day the Nebraska Legislature upheld a Pillen veto of a bill that sought to lift a lifetime ban on SNAP benefits for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies.
Morrisey formally requests WV’s food stamp program no longer pay for soda

Both measures received instant criticism from nonprofits that work low-income families and inmates reentering their communities.
Eric Savaiano, manager for food and nutrition access for Nebraska Appleseed, said SNAP is designed to “maintain the dignity” of participants by helping low-paid people buy groceries. He called the latest SNAP ban “poverty-shaming.”
“With the approval of this waiver, some of that dignity is stripped away,” Savaiano said.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, or about 7.5% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, including seniors, children, people with disabilities, working families and veterans. Nebraska Appleseed said the average SNAP benefit received in the state is about $5.82 per person per day.
Savaiano, in a statement, said research shows SNAP recipients buy the same things as everyone else, including soda, soft drinks and energy drinks. “By targeting just SNAP participants, we’re poverty-shaming the most vulnerable among us and adding complications to an already complicated system.”
He said carrying out the restriction would cause extra expenses to grocers, and he worried that could cause smaller stores to stop serving SNAP recipients altogether, and possibly shut off options in some rural areas.
‘Nothing nutritious’
Pillen said SNAP is to help families in need get “healthy food into their diets” and that there is “nothing nutritious” about the drinks to be ruled out under the waiver.
“We have to act because we can’t keep letting Nebraskans starve in the midst of plenty,” Pillen said.
Also with Rollins and Pillen during the Nebraska ag tour was Sherry Vinton, director of Nebraska’s Department of Agriculture and U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb.
The group stopped at the Cargill Bioscience 650-acre facility in Blair, Wholestone Farms in Fremont and the Ohnoutka Family Farm in Valparaiso.

Bill Lee over his veto of a bill expanding the authority of parole boards. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A move to override Gov. Bill Lee’s first veto is crumbling.
Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican who sponsored the bill that Lee vetoed in early May, told the Tennessee Lookout this week he will not pursue an override on the bill expanding authority of the Board of Parole and Probation to deny inmates’ requests.
Rose said he spoke with the parole board and was assured it has the authority to deny based on the “severity” of the crime.
“Somebody else may pick it up, but I do not plan to,” Rose said. “I don’t plan to die on that hill. Not that I’m expecting to die, but it’s just not one I want to fight.”
The West Tennessee lawmaker who consistently backs conservative legislation notified the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference this week he would not seek to override the measure it brought to him for passage.
Rose could hand the measure to Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County. But Taylor told the Lookout he wants to consult with the Governor’s Office and the House sponsor, Republican Rep. Rick Scarbrough of Oak Ridge,  before making a decision. Taylor indicated that Lee might have a different view of the bill than the legislature, which passed it with little, if any, debate.
  “I don’t plan to die on that hill. Not that I’m expecting to die, but it’s just not one I want to fight,” said Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican who will not be urging an override of Gov. Bill Lee’s veto of a parole bill. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Scarborough, a former Clinton police chief in his first legislative term, said immediately after the governor’s veto that he would work toward an override, which requires only a simple majority vote of both houses.
But Sen. Todd Gardenhire, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, predicted an override would fail if it does come before the Senate. 
Gardenhire added that it’s not the right fight to take to the governor, even if he has only a year remaining in his second term.
This doesn’t appear to reflect a rift, either, between the governor and legislature on law-and-order bills, even though they’ve had their share of disagreements. Instead, it stems from frustration within the DAs Conference that the governor would veto its bill. 
The conference released a fiery statement in the wake of Lee’s veto condemning his decision and calling the move “dangerous” for Tennesseans.
DAs Conference Executive Director Steve Crump gave a statement in response to questions: “We are aware of Sen. Rose’s position. We remain committed to expanding the Parole Board’s authority in a way that supports rehabilitation while affirming the seriousness of crime. We are already in conversations with Sen. Taylor and are open to all options in pursuit of the passage of this bill. 
The measure expands the number of offenses for which the parole board can refuse to grant parole, from 22 to about 50.” 
Maybe they’re not accustomed to losing.
But senators felt the missive went overboard in attacking the governor on an obscure bill that isn’t likely to have a major impact on the criminal justice system and protecting victims.
What bid-rigging?
The legislature’s Fiscal Review Committee, acting on advice from Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, opted to postpone bids for six months for two contracts totaling $1 billion in mental health and health services for the Department of Correction.
New litigation filed by Wexford Health Source drove the delay, although few people expect the matter to be resolved by November.
The state awarded a contract to a company called Centurion Health even though one of its former officials pleaded guilty in connection with big-rigging accusations when a state official provided information to a company officer during bidding for a state contract.
Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville was the lone vote against extending contracts with Centurion in Wednesday’s Fiscal Review meeting.
“It’s absolutely indefensible that we are going to re-up a contract with a provider that has been big-rigging and had all kinds of issues with the service and is involved in a lawsuit, and this whole thing has been done with the recommendation of the AG,” Campbell told the Lookout. “It’s not only bad advice, it’s malpractice.”
The Department of Correction accepted contract offers from Wexford, which is represented by state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, and YesCare over the past year but held those up when Centurion protested. Wexford is challenging the decision with a lawsuit.

Prison contractor Corizon also sued the state in 2021 claiming the state and Centurion officials conspired in the bidding. At the same time, the Department of Correction raised the performance bond on mental health services to $118 million from $1 million, making it harder for Corizon and small companies to win state bids, according to the filing.
The bid-rigging lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in early 2022.
Centurion was previously connected to Centene, a company that tried to persuade state lawmakers to pass legislation enabling it to obtain a TennCare contract for managed care after it failed to win a contract bid. 
House Speaker Cameron Sexton co-sponsored the bill, saying more “openness” was needed in TennCare contracting.
Former Democratic Rep. Jason Hodges of Clarksville called it a case of “bid-rigging.”
That mean green
In case anyone was wondering whether Tennessee parents and students would go for the $7,300 the state is offering with a new program for private-school vouchers, the proof is in the bank.
The Department of Education said this week it received more than 38,000 applications for the money, which can go toward 20,000 students this coming school year, followed by annual expansions. Of those, 18,852 applications were for kids who qualify based on income, at or below 300% of the federal lunch program, which would be about $173,000 for a family of four, while 19,300 were for “universal scholarships.” 
In other words, half the vouchers are to go toward those poor souls pinching pennies at close to $175 grand a year.
Lawmakers who argued for the vouchers said they hoped to help the single mother with two children to put her kids into a better school, proof that they have no faith in public schools or the children who attend them.

But this isn’t designed for poor people. 
During the governor’s bill-signing ceremony, he was backed by students wearing their private-school colors, not the poor, downtrodden kids whose mother is working 70 hours a week to put food on the table.
The program is slated to cost about $400 million next year and escalate to $1.1 billion in five years, Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons says, calling Gov. Lee’s program “a scam that will harm students, de-fund public education and expedite our state’s impending budget crisis.”
Lee and Republican lawmakers have continually defended the concept by saying students shouldn’t be stuck in failing schools because of their ZIP code. 
Here’s the question, though: Are the schools failing the kids or is the state failing the schools? Or are the students just failing to crack a book? The more lawmakers get involved in education, the worse it gets.
No shocker here
House Democratic Caucus Leader Karen Camper issued a blistering rebuke of AG Skrmetti this week, accusing him of “a breach of trust” that eroded his credibility in regard to absorbing Tennessee Human Rights Commission employees.
Lawmakers voted this year to merge the commission, which is designed to protect people from discrimination, into the AG’s Office. But at what cost?
The commission has been in place since the early 1960s. But lawmakers said it wasn’t doing what it was supposed to do, so they turned the politically independent agency over to Skrmetti, who has proven to be a bit partisan.
Tennessee legislature puts state watchdog agency under attorney general

Camper said in her letter that Skrmetti told her the 30 employees were to be absorbed into other state agencies to continue protecting people from discrimination. The Nashville Banner reported that they initially were told they’d be laid off July 1 but then were given a week to prep resumes and reapply for their jobs.
The report led Camper to say Skrmetti could be remembered “as the one who dismantled a vital institution and misled those trying to protect it” or one who “corrected course and chose to stand on the side of fairness, truth and the people of this state.”
The AG’s Office didn’t respond Thursday to a Lookout request for comment.
Talk about a switch
When Republican Rep. Andrew Farmer introduced a bill on the House floor this year to ban Glock switches, Democratic lawmakers hooted at him. 
They’d been trying to pass a similar bill for years, and Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson of Memphis made the point that their legislation was getting hijacked.
Regardless, Farmer moved on with the measure, enabling Republicans to take credit for a new gun control law signed by Gov. Lee. Speaker Sexton and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson sponsored the bill.
Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety issued a statement this week commending them for joining a bipartisan movement supported by law enforcement.
Glock switches allow handguns to be converted into illegal fully automatic machine guns with after-market tools. They’ve been used in multiple mass shootings, including one in Memphis, according to the group.
Lawmakers could have done this two years ago in the wake of the Covenant School mass shooting that claimed six lives. But for some odd reason, they waited until few people were paying attention and passed it in the waning days of this year’s session when everyone was torn up about immigrant students and a Memphis school takeover.
Some would call that odd.
“Let me up, I’ve had enough”
The Tennessee Journal reports that former Sen. Brian Kelsey will have his state pension renewed after President Donald Trump pardoned him for a federal campaign finance conviction. 
This is great news for Tennessee taxpayers, coinciding with musician John Rich’s request for the president to pardon Cade Cothren, recently convicted on 19 counts in a political kickback scheme, with former House Speaker Glen Casada. Rich says in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that Cothren was persecuted by the FBI and faces 20 years in prison for a “false, TN State, minor infraction.” Nevermind the mountain of evidence prosecutors presented showing he tried to cover up his involvement in Phoenix Solutions to tap into state funds and campaign and Republican Caucus money. 

I have personally advocated to @realDonaldTrump to pardon @CadeCothren who was targeted by Biden’s DOJ, persecuted by the FBI and other agencies, and is now facing 20 years in prison for what amounts to a false, TN State, minor infraction. See his story below and pls repost: https://t.co/IBiH2WsbGw
— John Rich (@johnrich) May 21, 2025
Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison joined the fray, saying the pair was found guilty by “an impartial jury.” Faison drew a response from Cothren’s girlfriend, Ava Korby, who called him everything but sliced bread and said he got his talking points from the person who makes sure he keeps his post, an apparent allusion to Speaker Cameron Sexton.
Cothren had to promise the judge he would keep his nose clean and avoid text battles in order to remain free on bond until his Sept. 12 sentencing. It’s not clear whether this violates his word, but it could fall into the questionable category.
Likewise, the president might not have realized he set a precedent when he pardoned the people involved in the Jan. 6 insurgency at the Capitol who were responsible for the deaths of multiple police officers. 
If he lets them off the hook, he has little choice but to do the same with any political ally convicted of a lesser crime. But the bigger question is: Why do we have a justice system anymore if the president keeps letting felons go free on a whim? Just make him judge, jury and executioner, or have we already?

(Wesley Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Tensions are escalating at the State Capitol as a legislative package that attempts to lower auto insurance costs in Louisiana nears its final stage of approval.    
On Wednesday, the Senate advanced six of the more controversial insurance measures in a floor session that lasted late into the night. The debate included impassioned floor speeches and a heated clash between two lawmakers, both attorneys who stand on opposite sides of the issue.   
Gov. Jeff Landry has signaled support for the proposals. 
Only one of the bills cleared the chamber with bipartisan support, while the other five passed mostly along party lines with Republicans voting in favor of them and Democrats against. Those five are so-called “tort reform” proposals that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation, making it harder for accident victims to file successful lawsuits. 
Tort reform legislation from previous years has failed to reduce auto insurance rates, though most Republicans, including state Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, have said those measures were not strong enough.
This lack of results was among the points of contention during Wednesday’s debate on Senate Bill 231, which took up most of the evening before the bill passed in a 27-8 vote. Sponsored by Sen. Mike Reese, R-Leesville, it would effectively reduce the money plaintiffs can recover for medical expenses in an auto accident lawsuit. The amount would be limited to what a plaintiff actually pays for care rather than what doctors and hospitals bill. 
Supporters of Reese’s bill argue it would provide medical billing transparency in personal injury lawsuits and prevent plaintiffs’ attorneys from basing claims on artificially inflated medical bills no one actually pays. 
Opponents argue transparency should apply to both sides. They pointed to a separate tort reform law that allows insurers to hide certain details related to their policyholder’s coverage during a trial. Jurors could lower a monetary award if they believe an individual defendant — rather than an insurance company — will be personally on the hook for paying it, according to their viewpoint.
“Current law allows the plaintiff to lie to the jury, and it does not allow the defendant to tell the truth,” Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, an attorney whose practice includes insurance defense, said in support of the measure.

Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, took issue over what he called Seabaugh’s “ambush-type” strategy to tack on a late-hour amendment to Reese’s bill that other senators had no time to review. 
Luneau, a personal injury lawyer, said the amended bill was being rushed because Seabaugh had a conflicting court date Tuesday, when the Senate convenes next after a long Memorial Day holiday.  
Standing at the Senate floor lectern within a foot of each other, Luneau and Seabaugh got into an exchange that quickly grew intense.
Seabaugh said the amendment, which was eventually adopted, requires judges and juries to be shown both the amount paid and the amount billed for medical expenses in auto injury cases, but confusion ensued over its text. The Republican senator, defending his amendment, said that Luneau, himself, had requested the provision. 
When Luneau denied this and offered to withdraw the purported request, Seabaugh, in a raised voice, accused Luneau of lying.
“You were pounding the table, saying ‘Let’s tell the jury everything. Let’s let them see the billed amount,’” Seabaugh said, pausing but drawing no response from Luneau. “You are just gonna come up here and blatantly bald-faced lie, and I’m not surprised.”
The accusation drew quick intervention from Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and prompted Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Louis Carral Jr. to swiftly approach the lectern, prepared to physically separate the two men.  
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, come on!” Henry told the two senators. “There’s a certain amount of decorum that we expect to have in the Senate. Y’all need to relax.” 
The amendment actually would have allowed defendants to try to lower jury awards following a trial
Later, Luneau delivered a lengthy speech against the bill, so long that he appeared to be mounting a filibuster to delay a vote. But he ultimately ceded the floor after detailing his comprehensive argument against tort reform. 
Luneau cited data from the Louisiana Department of Insurance that shows there are more than 100 auto insurance companies in Louisiana, countering arguments that more insurers are needed in the state to create competition. Overall, they received $5.9 billion in premiums and paid out $3.4 billion in claims and losses, the date shows.
The five largest auto insurers in the state — State Farm, Progressive, Geico, Allstate and GoAuto — control 70% of the market, according to state data Luneau shared. 
“This is a bad bill,” Luneau said. “It’s going to take money away from people who are legitimately injured, and it’s not going to reduce automobile insurance rates. And we’ll be right back here again with people screaming about the next round of tort reform we need to do.”
Reese’s bill next heads to the House for consideration. 
Rate history disclosure
Only one of the five proposals, House Bill 148, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, received bipartisan support. Republicans counted for all of the no votes in the 26-9 outcome. 
Wiley’s proposal would require homeowner and auto insurance companies to show customers what they paid previously for coverage when sending out renewal notices. It would let customers see whether their rates have changed before they decide to extend their policy.
The bill would also give the state insurance commissioner power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. Temple has lobbied against this provision, arguing it would force him to choose between rates based on real market conditions and the perception that he’s lowering rates to improve his reelection chances.
Senate Republicans weakened the provision Wednesday when they inserted language into Wiley’s bill that could let Temple approve excessively high rates as long as an insurer shows that they weren’t chosen arbitrarily or randomly.
Gov. Landry’s approach to lower insurance rates could cast his political fate

Another amendment to Wiley’s bill allows the public to review documents insurance companies file with the state when seeking a rate increase, but only if the insurance commissioner determines the information shouldn’t be kept confidential as a proprietary trade secret.
The measure will return to the House for a final vote on amendments before heading to the governor’s desk.
Other insurance legislation the Senate approved included:
House Bill 450, by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand. 
The bill received final approval in a 28-9 vote and awaits Gov. Landry’s signature. 
House Bill 434, sponsored by Rep. Jason DeWitt, R-Alexandria, would limit bodily injury claims by plaintiffs who did not carry auto insurance at the time of the accident. It would forbid them from recovering as much as $100,000 worth of damages.    
The bill received final approval in a 28-9 vote and has been sent to the governor. 
House Bill 431, sponsored by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, would change Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. 
Proponents argue comparative fault allows someone to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault. Opponents say it is the fairest way to assign liability. 
Under current law, if a court finds one party in a lawsuit is 60% at fault for an accident and the other party is 40% at fault, they would each be liable for their respective share of the damages and could file claims against each other for the remaining amounts. Under Chenevert’s bill, anyone who is 51% or more at fault for an accident would get nothing. 
The bill passed in a 28-9 vote and will return to the House for changes made in the Senate.
House Bill 436, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — who are injured in car accidents from receiving compensation for pain, suffering and lost income. The proposal would still allow recovery for property damages and medical expenses. Auto insurance companies could still sell policies to unauthorized immigrants.
It cleared the chamber in a 27-10 vote and will return to the House for a vote on Senate amendments.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)Our soldiers have endured unimaginable hardships and faced profound challenges, testing the very limits of human resilience and strength. When they arrive home, the trauma many veterans experience abroad comes with them, and the toll it takes on their mental health can be devastating without intervention. Veterans will face additional challenges if promises of massive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs layoffs around the country and in Idaho go forward. 
Our veterans deserve better. 
Several Americans have protested cuts to the VA. Here in Boise at the VA campus, local community members have supported those protests, demonstrating just how important VA services are to Idaho veterans. Our communities are concerned about access to behavioral health care for our veterans and with good cause. Military veterans are 57.3% more likely to die by suicide than non-veteran U.S. adults. This stark statistic reveals the harsh reality that our service members face, particularly those living in rural areas like many veterans do here in Idaho. Our state has one of the highest rates of rural military populations, and it has a higher rate of VA reliance for health care than the national average. 
The Trump administration aims to cut 83,000 jobs from Veterans Affairs. The VA is tasked with caring for our veterans who return home, it provides crucial medical and behavioral health services including telehealth services for our rural vets. At the Boise VA campus alone, we may lose 300 employees, and this is a VA that already lacks staff for the vets it serves. 
Veterans and active-duty military personnel face unique challenges. Reintegrating into civilian life, Adverse Childhood Experiences (or ACEs) and post-traumatic stress all can contribute to poor mental health outcomes for our nation’s heroes. 
Many veterans shy away from seeking help due to stigma, barriers to care created by the isolation of rural living, or a lack of access to services, but the need is real. Veterans in rural areas often feel most comfortable accessing these services through the VA, a community that knows what they have gone through, specifically telehealth options which can allow access to behavioral health professionals working from home. 
Current changes by the administration have put into question these services, leaving our veterans uncertain about where they might find care in the future. 
Here in Idaho, one of the most pressing issues connected with this uncertainty is the disproportionate suicide rates among service members. Research consistently shows that veterans, especially those living in remote, rural regions — a common way of life in Idaho — are at greater risk of suicide. A lack of accessible mental health services can prevent veterans in need from receiving vital care. 
Furthermore, for patients at risk of suicide continuity of care, including consistent follow-ups with trusted health care providers is critical. Any threat to losing that continuity of care poses a significant danger, it is well known to be a key component of successful strategies to prevent suicide.  
Veterans health care provided by the VA removes barriers to care associated with insurance accessibility and affordability, and in many cases has been offered with telehealth options. However, any health services required outside of the VA falls on the service members to cover. If the VA’s behavioral health services are disrupted in a way that jeopardizes telehealth for rural veterans, it not only creates a crisis in continuity of care but also establishes a significant barrier to access for many low-income veterans.


For more information on the Idaho Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, go to www.idahoafcc.org.


For veterans who are unable to access mental health services through the VA, safety net options such as the Idaho free and charitable clinics are crucial. These clinics are closely monitoring the situation, hoping for continued care and support for our nation’s heroes.
 In the meantime, they can provide health care to any Idahoan without health insurance including our former service members. To ensure the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes, we must advocate for health care and behavioral health care as a basic human need, and work to improve and protect access to these services. 
Veterans and service members deserve the support and care necessary to thrive, both during and after their service.

Evers' Facebook pageAs Republicans in Congress struggle to deliver President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, education, health research and just about every other social good you can think of, in order to clear the way for trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest people in the U.S., here in Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and state lawmakers are working on the next state budget.
The one thing our Democratic governor and Republican legislative leaders seem to agree on is that we need a tax cut.
After throwing away more than 600 items in Evers’ budget proposal, GOP leggies now say they can’t move forward with their own budget plan until  Evers makes good on his promise to meet with them and negotiate the terms for the tax-cutting that both sides agree they want to do. Evers has expressed optimism that the budget will be done on time this summer, and said the tax cuts need to be part of the budget, not a separate, stand-alone bill. Evers wants a more progressive tax system, with cuts targeted to lower-income people. In the last budget, he opposed expanding the second-lowest tax bracket, which would have offered the same benefits to higher earners as the lower middle class.
But what if we don’t need a tax cut at all?
It has long been an article of faith in the Republican Party that tax cuts are a miracle cure for everything. Trickle-down economics is  a proven failure:  The wealthy and corporations tend to bank their tax cuts rather than injecting the extra money into the economy, as tax-cutters say they will. The benefits of the 2017 tax cuts that Congress is struggling to extend went exclusively to corporations and the very wealthy and failed to trickle down on the rest of us. 
 In the second Trump administration, we are in new territory when it comes to tax cutting. The administration and its enablers are hell-bent on destroying everything from the Department of Education to critical health research to food stamps and Medicaid in order to finance massive tax breaks for the very rich. 
If ever there were a good time to reexamine the tax-cutting reflex, it’s now.
Evers has said he is not willing to consider the Republicans’ stand-alone tax-cut legislation, and that, instead, tax cuts should be part of the state budget. That makes sense, since new projections show lower-than-expected tax revenue even without a cut, and state budget-writers have a lot to consider as we brace for the dire effects of federal budget cuts. The least our leaders can do is not blindly give away cash without even assessing future liabilities.
But beyond that, we need to reconsider the knee-jerk idea that we are burdened with excessive taxes and regulations, that our state would be better off if we cut investments in our schools and universities, our roads and bridges, our clean environment, museums, libraries and other shared spaces and stopped keeping a floor under poor kids by providing basic food and health care assistance. 
Wisconsin Republicans like to tout the list of states produced annually by the Tax Foundation promoting “business friendly” environments that reduce corporate taxes, including Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska and Florida. They also like to bring up ALEC’s “Rich States, Poor States” report that gave top billing last year to Utah, Idaho and Arizona for low taxes and deregulation. 
What they don’t track when they lift up those states are pollution, low wages and bankrupt public school systems. 
I’m old enough to remember when it was headline news that whole families in the U.S. were living in their cars, when homelessness was a new term, coined during the administration of Ronald Reagan, the father of bogus trickle-down economics and massive cuts to services for the poor. 
Somehow, we got used to the idea that urban parts of the richest nation on Earth resemble the poorest developing countries, with human misery and massive wealth existing side by side in our live-and-let-die economy.
Wisconsin, thanks to its progressive history, managed to remain a less unequal state, with top public schools and a great university system, as well as a clean, beautiful environment and well-maintained infrastructure. But here, too, we have been getting used to our slide to the bottom of the list of states, thanks in large part to the damage done by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker. 
We now rank 44th in the nation for investment in our once-great universities, and the austerity that’s been imposed on higher education is taking a toll across the state. Our consistently highly rated public schools have suffered from a decade and a half of budget cuts that don’t allow districts to keep pace with inflation, and recent state budgets have not made up the gap. 
Now threats to Medicaid, Head Start, AmeriCorps, our excellent library system, UW-Madison research and environmental protections do not bode well for Wisconsin’s future.
In the face of brutal federal cuts, we need to recommit to our shared interest in investing in a decent society, and figure out how to preserve what’s great about our state.
Tax cuts do not make the top of the list of priorities.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo illustration)The Lac du Flambeau (LDF) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians is offering a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the 1990 murder of Susan “Susie” Poupart, a LDF tribal member.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The tribe has also offered a $25,000 reward for information concerning a tribal member, Melissa Beson, 37, missing since March 17. 
“Poupart was last seen on May 20, 1990, in Lac du Flambeau in Vilas County,” the band stated in a press release issued May 16. “She had left a house party at approximately 4 a.m. on that date and was walking home alone when two men in a car pulled up next to her. Witnesses saw her enter the car but never arrived at her home, and her family reported her missing two days later.”
There was no LDF Tribal Police Department at the time of Poupart’s disappearance, so the Vilas County Sheriff’s Department investigated the case and is still the lead investigative organization.
“Deputies and fire department personnel conducted ground searches for four or five days, hoping to find her alive and return her to her two young children,” said the press release. “Eventually, specially trained tracking dogs were brought in from Minnesota to assist in search efforts, to no avail.”
The release said deer hunters found her remains, along with her purse and tribal ID card six months later, on Nov. 22, 1990. They were found in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, about 12 miles from her home. 
“Poupart’s death was determined to be a homicide, and in the decades since her murder, continuous improvements in DNA technology have kept her family’s hopes alive that her murderers will be brought to justice,” the press release states. “Investigators share that hope, as even now they await the results of DNA testing on evidence that was recently sent to sophisticated, high-tech crime laboratories for DNA analysis.”
The release also states that “police believe there are persons who have information that could result in the arrest and conviction of the persons responsible for Susan Poupart’s murder.”.
The tribe’s governing board said it was offering the $25,000 to “incentivize anyone with information relating to Poupart’s murder to come forward.”
The Wisconsin Examiner reached out to LDF Tribal Governing Board Chairman John Johnson to ask why the tribe was now offering a reward after over 35 years, but Johnson did not return phone calls.
Detective Cody Remick of the Vilas County Sheriff’s Department, who was assigned to the case two years ago, said he had heard from Poupart’s daughter that at one time there had been a $10,000 reward for information.
While the cold case is 35 years old, Remick said, his office only recently began working with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Justice Services (OJS) Missing and Murdered Unit.
The only other Wisconsin case the BIA OJS is presently working on is the 1989 murder of Rhys Pocan, a Menomonie tribal member living in Milwaukee. Pocan went missing in August 1989, and her headless body was discovered in September 1989 in Sheboygan County. Later, her head and hands were found in Waukesha County.
Though the press release says DNA is being analyzed, Remick said his office has items it is “preparing for DNA examination” that may lead to a break in the Poupart case.
“It goes without saying that Poupart’s children, now grown, deserve answers in the death of their mother, who was so cruelly taken from them,” said the May 16 press release. “The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Community, too, deserves to know what happened to one of their own. Most important, Poupart deserves justice. She was only 29 years old when she was murdered. She had her whole life in front of her, and her two beloved children to raise. Her killers must answer for their crime, so that Susie can finally rest in peace, and her family and community can begin to heal.”
Anyone with any information regarding the disappearance and murder of Susan Poupart is asked to call the Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441 or the Wisconsin Department of Justice at (608) 266-1221 or the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717.
The tribe said the reward will be apportioned as deemed just by the governing board in the event, for example, multiple credible tips are received. Employees of law enforcement and correctional agencies are not eligible to collect the reward.

The meetings will update the expansion of about 31 miles of Highway 85 from Interstate 94 to North Dakota Highway 200. The estimated construction cost is about $290 million.
There is no funding yet for that part of the expansion. Construction would start in 2028 if funding becomes available. 
Watford City is at the north end of the Highway 85 project. The widening project covers about 62 miles of highway in Stark, Billings and McKenzie counties. The south end of the project is at the Interstate 94 interchange near Belfield. 
Crews have already completed replacing the Long X Bridge over the Little Missouri River and widening the section from Watford City to that bridge.
Construction for the section from Highway 200 to the Long X Bridge is to begin in 2026. 
That includes a 6-mile area of the Badlands estimated to cost $95 million. The rest of that segment is estimated to cost about $117 million, which includes a roundabout at the intersection of 85 and 200. 
The Legislature in the recent legislative session approved $150 million for Highway 85. The state also is seeking a $55 million federal grant.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore’s veto of the Maryland Reparations Commission bill came as a shock to lawmakers, but they are confident they can override the veto, making it little more than a temporary setback for the initiative.
“We’re not done in getting this bill into a law. That is the ultimately goal, no matter what hurdles are in front of us,” said Delegate Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a House version of the measure and helped pass Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s).
For advocates around the country, however, the shock is still being felt. They worry what the bill’s troubles in Maryland — a state with a Black governor, a Black attorney general, a Black House Speaker, a Democratic super-majority and a powerful Legislative Black Caucus — portend for their states.
“Gov. Moore needs to realize that he’s not only impacting Maryland, but he’s impacting South Carolina and many other states with the veto,” said South Carolina state Rep. John King, a Democrat from Rock Hill.
The Maryland bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs.
Unlike previous years, when reparations bills had price tags of $1 million or more, the bill passed this year drew heavily on volunteers and existing resources. It was expected to cost $54,500 in its first year.
In his veto letter, Moore praised the work and the intentions of those behind the bill, but said “now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.”
He cited a number of studies over the past 25 years on the legacy of slavery and promised that his legislative agenda next year would include a package of proposals to “address the barriers that have walled off Black families in Maryland from work, wages and wealth for generations.”
Those justifications appeared to be lost on many advocates, however, who called the veto everything from shocking to a betrayal.

  Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, has asked the South Carolina Democratic Party to rescind its invitation for Maryland Gov. Wes Moore to speak at its annual fundraiser. Here, King is seen during a House Judiciary Committee meeting in Columbia, S.C., on Tuesday, March 8, 2022. (Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)

There is no similar effort in South Carolina.
But King expressed his disappointment on his Facebook page Monday, when he called on the South Carolina Democratic Party to rescind an invitation to Moore, who is scheduled to be the featured speaker at the party’s annual Blue Palmetto Dinner on May 30.
Tickets start at $150 for the party’s largest fundraiser of the year, which has featured potential presidential candidates in the past. That includes U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who headlined last year’s dinner with Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.
In 2019, King was the first South Carolina legislator to endorse Booker for president. (Booker dropped out of the presidential field in January 2020, a month ahead of South Carolina’s then-first-in-the-South primary.)
While Moore has said he’s not running for president, his speech in South Carolina can be seen as a 2028 audition of sorts. On May 31, the day after Moore’s address, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be the keynote speaker at Democrats’ convention in the state that last year held the party’s first presidential primary.
“I will still support [the] governor, if he decided to run for president,” said King, who spent summers in Maryland where his mother grew up in the Baltimore area. But in light of the reparations veto, “I don’t think the timing is right for him to come to South Carolina,” he said in an interview Tuesday.
South Carolina Democratic Party officials did not respond to requests for comment. But as recently as Wednesday, the party sent out emails urging people to buy tickets for the dinner and the chance to “hear from Maryland Governor Wes Moore.”
“Tickets will sell out,” the email said.
King’s colleague, Rep. Annie McDaniel, a Democrat from Fairfield County, said she also disagrees with Moore’s veto.
“I’m not saying whether the governor’s right or wrong. I’m just saying that the way he chose to handle this is not good,” McDaniel said in an interview Tuesday with Maryland Matters. “It’s not good for the plight that African Americans are on now in this state.”
But McDaniel, who chairs the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, also said Moore should attend the Blue Palmetto Dinner and explain himself.
She said she would also like to see an invitation extended to Delegate Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus.
“I think that would be an awesome opportunity,” McDaniel said. “I don’t want the conversation to be one-sided. I believe in fairness. I just think that having her [Wilkins] in the room and having him [Moore] in the room at the same time will give us an opportunity to hear both sides.”
Wilkins declined to comment. A spokesperson for the governor’s office also declined to comment.
 ‘Reparations now’

Moore’s veto Friday was announced hours after he spoke at commencement for the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, one of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, and the day before an unrelated reparations rally in Washington, D.C.

The governor’s decision has sparked some conversation on online broadcasts and among civil rights organizations. David Johns, CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective, called the governor’s decision in a statement Tuesday “a betrayal of generational efforts to pursue truth, healing, and repair.”
“As the first Black governor of Maryland, Gov. Moore had an opportunity to lead with moral clarity, political courage, and historical awareness,” Johns said in a statement Tuesday. “Instead, his decision represents a dangerous step backward in the long and necessary march toward racial justice.”
Outside the State House on Tuesday, as the governor was inside for the last bill-signing of the year, a small group of protesters stood on Lawyers Mall, holding signs and chanting: “What do we want? Reparations! When do we want it? Now!” The rally was led by Malik Shabazz, an attorney representing Black Lawyers for Justice, who said the legislature should override Moore’s veto.

“Clearly, the governor’s not for reparations,” Shabazz said to reporters. “And clearly, he’s looking to cut off a study and calculation of an assessment of the damages of what has been done to the people and the constituents of his own state, and that’s unacceptable.”
But Linda Lee Tarver, with the Black conservative organization Project 21, said Wednesday that reparations aren’t the answer to help Black communities.
Tarver, who runs a political consulting business in Lansing, Michigan, agreed with Moore’s veto message that studies have been, and continue to be, done by other organizations.  She referenced her own group’s policy recommendations, which include election integrity, reducing “harmful ‘environmental justice’ agenda,” making health care more market oriented and protecting science, technology, engineering and math instruction “from the poison of ‘equity’ activists.”
She said she was surprised at the apparent disconnect between Moore and the Legislative Black Caucus, which had endorsed the reparations bill.
“I believe that Gov. Wes Moore got caught in pretending to care for reparations, and then his pen was required, and he punted,” Tarver said. “It’s shameful. Just say up front you don’t believe in it.”
Disconnect or not, McCaskill said the debate is healthy — and the debate will continue as the commission moves forward, as she believes it will.
“I am excited to hear that it’s on folks’ minds, in opposition or proponents for it,” she said. “This commission is important to hear from all Marylanders because it will eventually affect every Marylander.”

(Kayla Bartkowski | Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

It’s a statistic the Delta’s U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson used to emphasize the difficulties people in his district face to a crowd of a few dozen people gathered in the Mound Bayou Delta Health Center parking lot late Wednesday morning.
In a recorded video, he talked about the particular risks this health care gap has on older adults, like a higher chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease. 
“We know that too many seniors are going without the care they need,” he said. 
The crowd he and eight others spoke to was gathered to celebrate a multimillion dollar step toward addressing that problem. The Delta Health Center — in collaboration with Greenville’s Delta Health System hospital, Mississippi State Office of Oral Health and the Bolivar County Council on Aging — received a $5 million grant through the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation’s Senior Oral Health Partnership Program to improve access to dental care for seniors in the area.
Representatives from each of the organizations said they will replace aging equipment at the Mound Bayou dental clinic, hire more oral health staff, develop new transportation options for services and conduct screenings among Delta seniors for tooth disorders. 
It’s the first time Delta Dental’s foundation, the philanthropic arm of the national dental insurance company, has funded a senior oral health partnership outside of California or Washington, D.C.

Robin Boyles, the Delta Health Center’s development officer, said she and her coworkers thought the grant was a long shot when the application first came out.
“Five states were eligible, and they were going to fund one partnership,” she told the crowd. “…Oftentimes I would say ‘uh, no.’ But what we finally decided was, the need is great. Our need is so great here, and we have partnerships”
For instance, Boyles said, there are no dentists in Washington County who serve patients regardless of their ability to pay for care, and many residents there end up seeking oral health care at the Greenville hospital’s emergency department. The partners hope to create ways to transfer these patients to one of the Delta Health Center’s dental clinics with the help of these funds. 
As a general dentist for the center, Dr. Clarke Allen sees these needs on a daily basis. She told Mississippi Today that when elderly patients come into the clinic and she asks them how long it’s been since their last dental appointment, most tell her it’s been more than five years.
Because Medicare, the federal government’s health insurance for adults 65 and over, often doesn’t cover most dental care, Clarke said clinics like hers, which offers lower priced services for underinsured and uninsured patients, need all the resources they can get. She thinks hiring more oral health clinicians with the grant’s funds will be a big help for Delta residents. 
“Our patient base is huge, but we don’t have as many providers to take care of all those patients,” she said.
Clarke said she’s also excited about the ways this grant will help older adults without transportation. The Delta Health Center plans to expand its efforts to bring buses full of dental services to communities throughout the Delta, and the Bolivar County Council on Aging will help provide rides from patients’ homes to the mobile clinics. 
For dental and other health care visits, medical transportation can be difficult to schedule throughout Mississippi. LaShonda McKinney, the council’s executive director, told Mississippi Today that’s why she was grateful the Delta Health Center thought of her organization and Delta residents’ transportation needs when planning out its mobile dental efforts. 
“Even if you park in senior communities, how are they going to get to the mobile units?” she asked. “They have their own transportation, but we have a lot more vehicles, vehicles for individuals who may need wheelchairs or walkers.”

John Fairman, the Delta Health Center’s chief executive officer, told Mississippi Today that since its founding in 1965, his community health center has always prided itself on going beyond checkups and doctors appointments to make sure Delta residents are healthy. 
He says that through addressing people’s needs beyond the walls of the Mound Bayou clinic, this grant continues that same tradition. 
“We’re really excited,” he said. “Delta Dental Foundation is just a godsend.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/21134315/3X0A1179.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

(Photo: John Partipilo)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities





In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
Tennessee legislature puts hundreds of millions toward private-school vouchers

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Mother’s Day may have just passed, but what hasn’t passed is the growing threat facing mothers like me across the country. While many of us were being celebrated with cards and flowers, lawmakers in Washington were advancing a budget that would devastate the programs that help us survive.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently issued a chilling report: Republican leaders are pushing a federal budget proposal to slash $880 billion from health care, particularly Medicaid, to fund another round of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. That is not a gift to mothers. That is a gut punch.
As a working mom in Kentucky raising two beautiful daughters, Medicaid has been the difference between surviving and slipping through the cracks. It allows me to access regular checkups, medications, dental appointments, and essential care not just for me, but also for my children. I work two jobs. Neither offers health insurance nor pays a living wage. Without Medicaid, we would have no safety net, no way to stay healthy, and no protection when things go wrong.
I cannot imagine what I would do without Medicaid or SNAP benefits. These supports are not handouts. They are how I keep my family going in a system that too often fails to value mothers like me.
Let’s be clear. The majority in Congress is proposing to roll back the Medicaid expansion that has been a lifeline for millions. Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), only seniors, people with disabilities, children and pregnant women qualified for Medicaid. Low-income working people were left out. The ACA changed that. In Kentucky, expanding Medicaid in 2014 drastically reduced the number of uninsured people, saved rural hospitals from closing, and ensured access to mental health and addiction services during public health emergencies.
Most of those who gained coverage through the expansion were women, especially mothers. After giving birth, Medicaid became even more vital when postpartum coverage was extended, giving new mothers a full year of health care. It also supports preventive care and chronic disease treatment for women of childbearing age, helping create better outcomes for mothers and children.
Ten states still refuse to expand Medicaid, leaving millions uninsured. And instead of encouraging progress, Congress is proposing to strip health care from those of us who need it most.
Despite working two jobs, I still can’t consistently afford groceries without Medicaid and SNAP. Yet Congress is rewarding billionaires with tax cuts while targeting mothers like me for cuts. That’s not justice. That’s betrayal.
Medicaid is the largest source of federal funding in every state. In Kentucky, over 1.5 million people rely on it. Slashing this lifeline would harm families and damage schools, hospitals, clinics and emergency services that depend on Medicaid dollars. Just over the mountains in West Virginia, 516,500 people rely on Medicaid. This includes 49,000 seniors, 196,000 children, and 86,000 people with disabilities. Across Appalachia, one thing is clear: our families depend on these programs for survival.
This is not what the American people voted for. Medicaid has broad support from Democrats, Republicans and independents alike. Most of us know someone who relies on it, whether it’s a mother, a grandparent, a child or a neighbor.
We must protect the programs that value our lives if we value mothers. This isn’t just about policy. It’s about dignity. It’s about survival.
If Congress can afford to give billionaires tax breaks, then it can afford to provide health care to the millions of moms, kids, grandparents and people with disabilities who need it.
Our representatives must protect Medicaid, mothers, and the people who hold this country together daily. Because taking health care away from moms doesn’t save money, it breaks families.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 06:02:10.442938

This is the final story in a Lantern series about homelessness in Western Kentucky. Read the earlier articles here.
CENTRAL CITY — Sitting on his bed at the Central Inn on a bitterly cold January day, John Paul Shanks had already handwashed his clothes, after pre-soaking them in Gain detergent, and hung them to dry. Living outdoors in this Western Kentucky town has given him a lot of experience in making do.
“I’m probably one of the only people you’ll see that can just sit there and lay on a piece of concrete with a pillow or nothing and go to bed,” Shanks said. “That hardens you up.”
Gwen Clements is why 41-year-old Shanks, his red beard long and his head shaved, had a motel room that day. Clements also knows about making do. She’s a leader in a loose coalition of the compassionate, working to help her homeless neighbors in a place that offers them few formal resources.
She met Shanks years before when she took a job at the Perdue Farms poultry processing plant in Ohio County around the time of the Great Recession. He was a production line leader. 
It’s unclear to Clements what put Shanks on the path to what she describes as being “chronically homeless.” But as she began seeing him walk the streets she started checking in with him and asking if he needed anything.

On days when she wanted to find Shanks, she would make sure to get up early to drive around town and check a few of his haunts. Outside the Central Inn. Inside the local Wendy’s. On a bench next to a local bank where people driving by gave him money, food and sometimes clothing. 
“The only people that know him are the people who stop and talk to him, people that know him from the past,” Clements said in January.
With deadly cold in the forecast that January week, Clements, through a Facebook group she started in early 2024 focused on homelessness, had urged her neighbors to send her money so that she could put people up in the motel and keep them safe overnight. 
Finding Shanks during severe weather and making sure he had shelter had become a priority for her. 
It was easy for Clements to check Shanks into a motel room for the night. Finding help for his deeper issues is not. Clements said that’s true of other people she helps, some of them grappling with what seem to be untreated mental illness and addiction and living without permanent shelter. 
“People like John Paul, there’s no help for them. You can make all the appointments you want for him. He’s not going to go,” Clements said. “He doesn’t have transportation if he did decide to go.” 
Shanks said he injured his back years ago when on the drive to work the vehicle he was in hit a patch of black ice that “flipped the car.” The nerve pain was so intense, he said, it could take him 30 minutes to dress. In the motel room, he also described grappling with addiction and using prescription opioids, cocaine and methamphetamine. 
According to court records, Shanks has been arrested a number of times. Once he was screaming and throwing rocks from a train track. Shanks told police he hadn’t realized one of the rocks had almost hit a woman. Another time he was arrested for disorderly conduct for allegedly yelling obscenities at a local IGA grocery store. 
In 2022, a Central City police officer and Chief Jason Lindsey found Shanks at a strip mall where Shanks had previously trespassed, according to an incident report. Shanks had allegedly told a minor “he would take him out back and beat his brains out.” Shanks told law enforcement the minor “had said things to him about him being homeless and getting a job.” Shanks was arrested and banned from entering the strip mall property.
Tammy Piper, the director of business development for the city, told the Lantern last year the city had tried to help Shanks multiple times by putting him in a hotel room or offering work. Piper said in one instance, Chief Lindsey drove Shanks to live with family members several counties over and had secured a job for Shanks, only for Shanks to return to the Central City streets.

In the fall of 2024, the city removed the bench next to a local bank where Shanks often sat, sometimes dozing or asking passing drivers for money. The move sparked debate on social media and made television news in Evansville, Indiana. Central City Mayor Tony Armour told the Evansville station the bench was removed because Shanks made people uncomfortable. 
The mayor also said the city has tried to offer Shanks work. Shanks, in the motel room in January, disputed that the city had offered him a job. 
The bench took on larger significance for some, including Clements, who saw its removal as a symbol of apathy and, at times, disregard by local officials and police for people who are unsheltered and struggling.
“That was just a small part of how our homeless are treated in this county and this city,” said Clements. 
Clements said Shanks and other people dealing with homelessness need more than a bench where they can spend their days or even a roof over their heads. She sees a need for mobile mental health services that can meet people where they’re living outside, considering that homelessness can deteriorate mental health. 
“He’s suffered a lot of trauma from being unhoused. I don’t think people understand that,” Clements said about Shanks. “They just want to think that, ‘He’s lazy and a druggie, and he needs to get a job, get off drugs and he’ll be fine.’ It’s much more than that.
“The warming shelters and stuff is the ‘more.’ John Paul needing mobile crisis mental health — that’s part of the ‘more.’ It’s just so much more than the bench being removed,” Clements said.
When Shanks was asked in the motel room if he believed others in Central City cared about people experiencing homelessness, he said: “I think they worry about others. I think there’s just a lot to worry about.”
Clements replied to Shanks: “The problem is too big, and they don’t know how to handle it.” 
More than a bench
Paramount among the needs is more housing and temporary shelter, according to Clements and others in the band of helpers pushing to address homelessness in Muhlenberg County. 
The Muhlenberg County Economic Growth Alliance, the economic development arm for county government, retained an Ohio-based housing research firm in November 2023 to better understand the local housing market. The study found a need for more than 300 additional rental units and more than 700 additional owner-occupied homes through 2029. The report noted the need for affordable rental units would continue because of persistent poverty in the county.

But the path for creating more housing or even temporary shelter remains unclear. 
Kelsey Rolley, who has helped the loose coalition at times through her work at Pennyrile Allied Community Services, said some of the divisions among the community spring from fear of the unknown. She imagines questions from local “higher ups,” such as who else might come into the county to seek shelter if more were available and whether it might attract more crime.  
When Armour, the mayor, raised concerns about a church’s plans to turn the Central Inn into efficiency apartments to help homeless people transition into something more permanent, he worried his community could be “destroyed” by an influx of people drawn by the assistance.
“It’s going to take a village, and until that village can be formed, created and run properly, all of us work together — I feel like it’s just going to keep us stuck,” Rolley said. 
The loose coalition is persisting, though. Clements and others recently visited Somerset to see how a nonprofit shelter and resource hub were started just a couple years ago, and Clements has been considering buildings to potentially start her own version of that nonprofit in Muhlenberg.

An eviction hearing, an urn and a stoop
The way forward to stable housing remains strewn with challenges and struggles for the people who talked about their experiences of being homeless in this series.
 Shanks remained on the concrete stoop of the Central Inn in May, waving at passing cars. He mentioned he needed a shower, a pair of socks and maybe another stay in a motel room. “You gotta appreciate everything about everything,” he said.

Courtney Phillips, who slept outside the Abundant Life Church for weeks, is still piecing together what she wants her life to be. The church has provided her a room to sleep in. At her nursing home job, she’s working long hours and building relationships with residents who deal with mental health disorders including dementia. 
She wants to save money for a car — what she calls a “baby step” toward where she wants to be. She made it to the top of a waiting list for a rapid rehousing program and hopes it will help her find an apartment soon. 
She’s also been carrying on without her dog, Joker, who cuddled with her while she was sleeping outside. Joker died earlier this year; a wooden urn with Joker’s ashes sits in her room at the church, and Joker’s bed is still beside her bed. 
“It’s real different, but he’s still with me,” Phillips said. 
Mallie Luken, who slept in the church parking lot before Clements helped her find housing, was anxious for weeks leading up to a hearing on her possible eviction from the apartment Clements had helped her find.
After police left Luken in her wheelchair outside the Abundant Life Church on a stormy night in September, Clements came to her aid, helping her secure an apartment at the Greenville Housing Authority. But her housing situation was uncertain yet again by this month. 
Luken, 70, was served an eviction notice because of alleged complaints from neighbors about her behavior and inappropriate language that they said was directed at them. Clements, who admits Luken can be her own “worst enemy,” also said the housing authority alleged Luken hadn’t paid rent, something she said wasn’t true. 
The stress of her predicament had Luken exhausted and apprehensive.

“Somehow or another I keep falling through the system,” Luken said weeks before the hearing. 
Earlier in May, in front of a district court judge, Luken with the help of a Kentucky Legal Aid attorney was able to come to an agreement with the housing authority: She can stay in her apartment until another apartment opens up at a housing authority in Beaver Dam, next door in Ohio County where Luken previously lived. 
Clements said Luken has friends near there, potentially a support system. In Muhlenberg County, Clements played a large role in Luken’s support system. Their relationship has grown over the months they’ve been together. 
“I can’t imagine what she’s done for other people,” Luken said in praise of Clements’ generosity. 
Leaving Luken’s apartment earlier this year, Clements told Luken she loved her. 
Out on the sidewalk, Clements, in a voice choked with emotion, said, “I can’t imagine my mother being in that predicament. I just can’t.”

(Mountain Association photo)By any measure, the economy of Eastern Kentucky and the wider Appalachian region is struggling. The collapse of the coal industry, the opioid crisis and the recurring natural disasters have left scars that are slow to heal. Families and individual households trying to make ends meet rely on an array of federal assistance. 
Recently, there have been cuts or threats to these assistance programs, including a proposed total elimination of a vital energy assistance program that supports 6 million low-income households each year across the country. 
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is zeroed out in the proposed federal budget for the fiscal year that begins in September 2025. LIHEAP provides life-saving aid to millions of Americans by helping them afford their heating and cooling bills. For many, it is the difference between choosing food or heat, medicine or air conditioning. 
In 2024 alone, the program was utilized more than 219,000 times by Kentucky households. These are small disbursements — a max of $250 per season — that function as safety nets for working families, elderly residents and people with disabilities who are trying to survive on limited incomes in one of the most energy-burdened regions in the country.
Despite this need, the Trump administration’s 2026 budget proposes defunding LIHEAP entirely. Their reasoning is that lower energy prices are on the horizon thanks to a move toward American energy dominance and the America First platform. But here in Kentucky, the future hasn’t arrived yet. Energy bills are still going up, not down.
In some Eastern Kentucky counties, low-income families pay up to 14.5% of their income on utility bills — more than double the 6% threshold that experts define as a “high” energy burden. Rural residents, especially those living in older, less energy-efficient homes, feel this pain the most. Rural areas often pay disproportionately high electricity costs due to utilities charging higher rates, in part due to infrastructure costs utilities incur covering more miles of transmission lines, etc., and in part due to utilities being owned by investors who are guaranteed a certain rate of return on their investment.
And while some cities have access to local programs that might soften the blow of high bills, rural communities often don’t. That’s where LIHEAP comes in. It funds weatherization improvements that make homes more efficient — reducing future energy costs and minimizing the need for repeated emergency assistance. In fiscal year 2023, the program weatherized more than 60,000 homes nationwide and helped prevent countless power disconnections.
The federal government allocated approximately $54 million in LIHEAP funds to Kentucky in fiscal year 2025. To access these funds, individuals must meet certain requirements and provide documentation showing their need for assistance. These requirements are designed to support Kentucky’s most vulnerable residents and some examples include households where someone has a health condition or disability (verified by a doctor’s note), someone is 65 or older, or a child under the age of 6 is present. 
This money is especially important during the extreme summer and winter temperatures Kentucky experiences. Kentucky is one of just 10 states where utility shutoffs due to nonpayment are allowed even during dangerous weather events. Sometimes families are cut off because they owe as little as $6.
Cutting LIHEAP cannot just be a budget decision — this is an issue that needs to consider the survival of our most vulnerable neighbors. Because it’s so critical, the program is housed under the Department of Health and Human Services and has received bipartisan support for nearly 45 years. 
The Trump administration recently acknowledged that Appalachia is at a disadvantage due to loss of coal jobs and the opioid crisis, and because of that, it was  leaving funding for another program in the budget that benefits this area. We argue that many low-income communities across the country face similar systemic challenges that have them needing a little extra help to stay and revitalize these areas of the United States. 
If you have an experience to share about how LIHEAP has impacted you or your community in a time of need, now is the time to share your story.

(Photo: Connect Images) Earlier this month, the North Carolina House of Representatives passed House Bill 519, also known as the “Parents’ Medical Bill of Rights.” As a board certified OBGYN who treats minors, I am deeply concerned about the implications of this bill. This legislation, which aims to revise the laws regarding minors’ consent to medical treatment and parental access to medical records, poses significant risks to the health and wellbeing of patients across the state. 
HB 519 will impede the trust young patients have in their medical providers and therefore undermine the confidentiality of their care. Currently, North Carolina law allows minors to consent to treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, substance abuse, and mental health issues without parental involvement. This provision is crucial for ensuring that young patients feel safe seeking medical help without fear of judgment or repercussions from their parents.   
By mandating parental consent for these sensitive treatments, the bill risks deterring minors from seeking necessary medical care. This could lead to untreated STIs (which can lead to future infertility), unaddressed mental health issues, and unintended pregnancies, all of which have serious long-term consequences for our young North Carolinians’ health and wellbeing. 
The trust between patients and healthcare providers is foundational to effective medical care. Confidentiality is a cornerstone of this trust, particularly for minors who may be navigating complex and sensitive health issues. HB 519 threatens to erode this trust by introducing parental oversight into the patient-provider relationship. Healthcare providers may find themselves in difficult positions, having to balance the legal requirements of HB 519 with our ethical duty to protect patient confidentiality.  
Advocates for HB 519 argue that the exclusion of parental consent in our current laws leaves children to navigate serious medical situations alone.  This perspective completely ignores the role that healthcare providers like myself play in the navigation of these issues. We do not leave our young patients “alone” to navigate their medical decisions, but instead provide thoughtful guidance, including often suggesting the involvement of their parent(s) in their medical care. Unfortunately, for some of my young patients, their medical team members are the only trusted adults in their lives, and if they are required to obtain parental consent to seek treatment, they simply will not do so.  
House Bill 519, while ostensibly aimed at empowering parents, poses significant risks to the health and wellbeing of minors in North Carolina. By undermining confidentiality, creating barriers to mental health and reproductive care, and hindering substance abuse treatment, the bill jeopardizes the autonomy and safety of young patients. As a physician who treats young patients, I urge the lawmakers to reconsider the implications of HB 519 and prioritize the health and rights of minors in our state.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pregnancy-test-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 06:02:10.442938

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island State Crime Lab Director Dennis Hilliard says he is still struggling to fill three open positions for firearms examiners, nine months after an investigation found discrepancies in testing conducted at the troubled lab.
But the State Crime Laboratory Commission put Hilliard’s job performance under the microscope during a 90-minute closed-door meeting Thursday at the Cranston office of the Rhode Island Attorney General. 
Hilliard, who earns $143,628-a-year as lab director, a position he’s held since 1992, waited in the lobby while four of the five commissioners met in a conference room. 
“Just to let you know, the person they’re going to discuss is me,” Hilliard, 70, told reporters.
The lab in Fogarty Hall on the University of Rhode Island’s (URI) Kingston campus temporarily suspended toolmark testing last August after discrepancies were found in lab results for casings from a Glock pistol seized as evidence in a 2021 Pawtucket murder case. The casings were flagged as matching a different firearm in possession of the Boston Police Department. 
That led to delays in nearly two dozen criminal cases, which underwent re-testing at labs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Hilliard told the commission that all those cases have since been verified.
Commissioners had copies of a report by an assessment team from the ANSI National Accreditation Board, which visited the lab in March. The report found “no issues with the competency of the examiners” who now handle evidence for firearms, trace evidence, and latent prints at the lab. 
But it did find the lab did not conform with 15 of 172 professional standards or 91.3%. Hilliard said the issues were mostly paperwork-related and that staff were working to address them in order to maintain accreditation.
The executive session took up half the commission’s quarterly meeting. Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein, who chairs the panel as a designee of the AG’s office, announced that no action was taken following the commission’s return to open session.
Hilliard moved up the lab’s accreditation review two years sooner than required in its standard accreditation cycle after it had to halt how examiners determine if a cartridge or shell is fired from a specific gun last August.
What will it take to exonerate the R.I. State Crime Lab?

The lab in Fogarty Hall on the University of Rhode Island’s (URI) Kingston campus temporarily suspended toolmark testing after casings to a Glock pistol seized as evidence in a 2021 Pawtucket murder case matched a different firearm in possession of the Boston Police Department. The suspension prompted delays in nearly two dozen criminal cases, which underwent re-testing at labs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Hilliard told the commission that all those cases have since been verified.
A report published last October by California-based consultant Ronald Nichols, who formerly worked for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), found there was a lack of diligence and confirmation bias on the part of three forensic examiners who performed toolmark analysis at the state lab. The three firearms examiners have since left the lab. 
Nine months later, Hilliard said it’s been nearly impossible to find replacements. Most experienced examiners, he said, can work as consultants where they can make far more money in a shorter amount of time compared to what they’d receive at URI.
“We’ve got a really limited pool,” Hilliard told the commission. 
Hilliard said only one serious candidate had applied to be a lead examiner position when the position was first up between November and early 2025. That applicant had toured the facility and passed a competency test, but turned down a job offer, saying the salary was too low.
At the time, URI offered a salary range of $70,971 to $107,830 for the lead examiner’s position. The new job listing posted on URI’s website May 16 lists a salary range between $82,082 to $125,379.
No applications have been received as of Thursday, Hilliard told the commission.

Goldstein questioned why the lab has only recently updated the salary range when Hilliard told the commission in January that a pay bump would likely be needed to attract applicants.
Hilliard explained that it took that long for URI to reclassify the job’s pay grade.
“It wasn’t until last Wednesday that I was informed that they would accept, recruit, and update,” he told the commission.
A similar pay update will be required for the position of a standard examiner, which initially had a salary range of $65,980 to $100,314. A technician from Baltimore had been offered a job, but Hilliard said the candidate declined due to family issues. 
He told Rhode Island Current the new salary will likely range between $76,159 and $116,529.
Of the two standard toolmark examiners, Hilliard told the commission one will be filled by an in-house candidate being trained by the ATF. He is expected to begin work early next year, Hilliard told reporters.
In the meantime, new toolmark exams will continue to be handled by two former New York City police examiners from Stria Consulting Group contracted by the lab. 
Any toolmark case still requires final verification by examiners at SCL Forensics in Texas and FoCoSS Forensics in New Hampshire. Additional verification was deemed necessary by the commission to minimize the risk of confirmation bias — the principle that if you know what you’re looking for, you’re more likely to find it. 
But Hilliard said third-party labs have slow turnaround times. He told the commission it often takes six to eight weeks to receive the external verification since the labs handle other cases from their own states as well. Hilliard asked the commission to allow the lab to reduce the number of cases verified out of state. 
Goldstein denied that request, telling Hilliard to come up with a formal proposal for a “statistically valid sample of cases” for the commission to consider at a future meeting.
“Until that is proposed,we proceed with the current process,” she said. 
After the meeting ended, Hilliard said he’s proud of what he’s done for the lab.
“I’ve done everything in my power to expand this lab,” he said in an interview. “This was a dream job up until this issue.”

The board’s unanimous 7-0 vote directs the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) to open the state’s compliance pathways in its state administrative code governing special education by removing the requirement for graduate-level coursework earned towards an Early Childhood Special Education (ECSPED) endorsement.
VDOE staff said the need for additional teachers with ECSPED endorsement has been “longstanding,” noting that 7% to 9% of educators have taught outside their endorsed area over the past six years. 
Elementary education Pre-K-6 and special education PreK-12 were the top two critical shortage areas staff identified, which they said showed the necessity of updating compliance standards to make hiring special education teachers easier.
“All we’re asking is to remove the word ‘graduate’ and align it with all of the rest of the special education endorsements and make a pathway that is easier to fill for early childhood education,” said Rob Gilstrap, VDOE assistant superintendent for human capital, at Thursday’s board meeting.
The ECSPED endorsement requires special education teachers to have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution.
Teachers must have also graduated from an approved teacher preparation program in early childhood special education, completed a college major in early childhood special education or 27 semester graduate hours in early childhood special education.
Virginia schools still struggling to fill critical teaching positions, new report finds

The board was provided two solutions to facilitate the compliance change. One will create an ECSPED add-on endorsement, which will be developed by the Advisory Board on Teacher Education and Licensure in September. The Board of Education will vote on the final details, and the process could take an extended period to complete. 
The second solution is to make a minor revision to the state’s administrative code, which the board said would align licensure regulations for ECSPED endorsement and increase flexibility by removing an arbitrary graduate-level course requirement. This will also allow teachers without a graduate degree to add the endorsement outside of an approved program pathway.
Since the second solution would likely not spark public disagreement, the regulatory changes could be fast tracked and completed after 90 days.
VDOE said the changes could fill at least 70 positions in the future and would put the commonwealth in alignment with all other state special education endorsement requirements.

Warm seawater will likely drive another above-average hurricane season this year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday.
Forecasters expect between 13 and 19 named tropical storms to form in the Atlantic Ocean between June 1 and November 30.
Six to 10 will become full-blown hurricanes, with three to five eventually becoming major storms.
National Weather Service director Ken Graham said improved forecasting has dramatically cut fatalities from these storms, particularly storm surge projections.
But he warned that things can change quickly and people need to heed warnings and be prepared.
“Every Cat 5 that’s hit this country was a tropical storm or less three days prior. The big ones that hit this country are fast,” Graham said Thursday.
Officials said new forecasting methods and technology are being rolled out this year to better anticipate the rapid intensification of storms.
He also noted that his call for preparation isn’t just for coastal communities.
“When you live 500 miles inland and you really don’t think that you could be impacted like that, right? So it’s hard for people to understand what has never happened before,” Graham said.
Virginia to receive $46 million in federal funds for Helene relief efforts

Last year, during another above-average hurricane season, Hurricane Helene dumped 30 inches of rain on communities hundreds of miles from the coast across the Southeastern United States. The storm was the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005.
“These storms are a stark reminder about how vital it is to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season now, before the storms begin forming in the Atlantic basin,” said Laura Grimm, NOAA’s acting administrator.
Towns in Western Virginia, North Carolina and other states are still recovering from intense flooding and Graham said they’re exploring better ways to notify people of the threats.
The warnings come as the National Weather Service has faced staffing and budget cuts, measures that some worry could hamper weather monitoring efforts.
Grimm said during Thursday’s announcement that NOAA’s Hurricane Center is fully staffed and the cuts won’t impede monitoring.
“We are really making this a top priority for this administration.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The U.S. House Republican budget bill could spell significant losses for low-income families in Ohio, specifically those in need of food assistance and those on Medicaid.
Advocates for Medicaid and anti-hunger leaders have said reductions and eliminations connected to the two programs would negatively affect Ohioans as a whole, and the state’s economy and spending power as well.
Only one Republican U.S. representative from Ohio voted against the congressional budget bill, passed early Thursday with a vote of 215-214. U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson, posted on X, formerly Twitter, Thursday morning that he supported “many things in the bill,” but that “deficits do matter and this bill grows them now.”
“The only Congress we can control is the one we’re in,” he wrote, alongside a bar graph showing the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the bill’s deficit effect. “Consequently, I cannot support this big deficit plan.”
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, stood with the rest of Democrats in voting against the bill, saying in a statement after the vote that the bill is “a cruel and catastrophic budget that rips health care, food and opportunity from Ohioans and millions of other Americans just to bankroll bigger and better tax breaks for billionaires.”
 Medicaid
Beatty’s statement said the bill, which now moves to the U.S. Senate, includes “the largest cut to Medicaid in American history,” at $698 billion, and $267 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next decade.
“In Ohio, that means potentially substantial new costs shifted onto our state, and fewer hospitals, fewer nursing homes, fewer services for our most vulnerable neighbors,” according to Beatty. “It’s not just bad math – it’s moral failure.”
Ohio would see direct impact from the bill in its own state operating budget, currently being drafted by the General Assembly.
The Ohio House’s version of the bill kept a provision proposed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget to eliminate the state’s Medicaid expansion group if the federal government reduced the contribution it makes to the program.
Currently, the federal government pays 90% of the Medicaid funding in Ohio, with the state covering the other 10%.
In the Ohio House’s version of the budget bill, Ohio would eliminate Group VIII — another name for the Medicaid expansion group that covers more than 700,000 Ohioans who live above the income requirements for traditional Medicaid but are still in need of assistance — if the federal government’s share of the funding dips below 90%.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Medicaid advocates and experts have said losing this expansion group would cause Ohio’s uninsured rate to go up, and those dropped from the program to seek self-pay medical options, or skip care all together, causing the health of the state to suffer.
According to Ohio child advocates Groundwork Ohio, nearly 48% of Ohio children younger than six rely on Medicaid for health coverage, and the program covers about 50% of all births in the state.
The Center for Community Solutions found in a recent study that Medicaid covers 2 in 5 children in the state, as well as 1 in 5 working-age adults, and 1 in 10 adults aged 65 and older. The largest group covered in Ohio’s Medicaid program, 53.2% of cases, is families and children.
 SNAP funding
The national Food Research & Action Center said the cuts would represent a nearly 30% reduction in SNAP funding, and would increase each state’s share of spending for the food assistance.
“The bottom line is this bill would end up costing America,” wrote Crystal FitzSimons, president of FRAC, in a statement. “Rural communities would be disproportionately impacted. We would see higher rates of hunger and poverty, increased health care costs, reduced academic outcomes, less productivity and an economy that will be hit hard.”
The Congressional Budget Office said the cuts, particularly to Medicaid and SNAP, would create a 2% decrease in household income nationwide in 2027 for the 10% of Americans in the lowest income brackets, going to to 4% by 2033. Households in the highest income brackets, however, could see raises.
The loss of SNAP funding, along with Medicaid, would reduce access to services that “are vital for everyday Ohioans in every Congressional district,” according to Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
Novotny said the current proposal would shift nearly $500 million in SNAP costs per year onto the state of Ohio.
“That’s about the same as all the state general revenue spent to operate the entire Ohio Department of Job and Family Services each year,” Novotny said.
The food banks and other anti-hunger advocates are already asking the state to support bipartisan legislation that would create supplemental benefits for SNAP participants in Ohio.
Ohio House Bill 178, which has received two hearings the Ohio House Community Revitalization Committee, would require the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to provide “supplemental benefits to households receiving (SNAP) benefits if the household includes a member who is 60 years of age or older and receives a monthly SNAP benefit that is less than $50.
The supplements would cost the state $12.5 million in fiscal year 2026, and $21.4 million in 2027, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.
In supporting the bill, Hope Lane-Gavin, director of nutrition policy and programs for the state association of food banks said the average SNAP benefit in Ohio is $171 per month per person, or less than $6 per person per day.
The federal minimum SNAP benefit is $23 per month, according to Lane-Gavin. There are about 70,000 households with adults 60 or older as the head of them in which the household receives less than $50 per month.
“Access to SNAP benefits can reduce food insecurity, increase medication adherence and contribute to health care savings,” she told the committee.
If SNAP funding changes drastically, food banks will not be able to fill the gap, even as they served more than 230 million meals in 2024, according to Novotny. The language in the budget would force state governments including Ohio’s to “make impossible choices.”
“This cost shift wouldn’t just hurt families, it would impact local grocery stores, farmers and food suppliers, threatening jobs and access to fresh food in communities across Ohio,” Novotny said.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Michigan lawmakers are again aiming to boost state environmental cleanup standards and force polluting industries to rehabilitate brownfield sites. “Polluter pay” legislation, facing broad opposition from Republicans, failed last year but Democrats said they are engaging with industry stakeholders to craft laws that will target the worst sites and offenders.
Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin and Rep. Jason Morgan, of Ann Arbor, said they intend to rework bills that ensure companies and utilities pay for cleanups and open their records for public review. The legislation, which they plan to reintroduce in June, would also allow legal recourse for residents who suspect they have been harmed by the pollution.
The measure passed the state Senate last year but was lost amid a tumultuous and early end to the Michigan legislature’s lame duck session in December.
“We’ve migrated from ‘Let’s make this law that holds polluters to account,’ to ‘How can we focus on the most egregious cases,’” Irwin said. “How can we work around the edges of the law so as not to fundamentally change its approach, but nonetheless get better results?
“The idea is to require better cleanups of contaminated land and discourage companies from leaving a mess in the first place. I still expect universal opposition from polluters. Industry isn’t going to support more stringent standards no matter how reasonable, because it costs them money.”
The lawmakers are part of a working group that includes the Michigan Manufacturing Association, the Michigan Chemistry Council and some manufacturers. They said they want industries and state regulators to collaborate in the pollution assessment process, and they envision a negotiation process with some tough compromises.
It is likely that some sites will never meet residential standards, Irwin said.
“That gives us more flexibility to address those standards where they make sense,” Irwin said. “Some properties might continue to be designated for industrial use. Auto plants and other large industrial sites are the ones that may not be fully cleaned up (to residential standards).”
First introduced in 2023, Michigan Senate bills 605–611 are far different from laws recently passed in Vermont and New York, which are also often described as “polluter pays” measures. The Vermont and New York bills are modeled after the federal Superfund law, and would essentially tax big oil companies for their historic greenhouse gas emissions.
In Michigan, lawmakers are seeking accountability from businesses and industries that for years have left toxins in the ground or in the water.
 Testing Toxic Sites

Michigan has tens of thousands of toxic sites, including many one-time commercial enterprises, that will likely fall within the proposal’s reach. The former Gelman Sciences Inc. site in Ann Arbor, which manufactured medical filters and related products for the pharmaceutical and microelectronic industries, is a prime example.
The chemical solvent known as 1,4-dioxane, a potential carcinogen, was used in production and has been found in local groundwater and nearby wells. The state and Washtenaw County has been overseeing remediation activities at the site for over 30 years. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has recommended the site to the National Superfund Priorities List.
Irwin said troubled sites will be evaluated and tested, with soil and water samples, for a range of toxins. “Is the site near a residential area, or is it located downtown?” Irwin said. “The goal is to take this case by case, and allow flexibility for sites that are in different locations.”
Progress Michigan, an advocacy organization, said its polls show over 90 percent of the public support laws that could save taxpayers from huge remediation costs. Dave Dempsey, senior advisor at For Love of Water, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the Great Lakes Basin, said the proposed legislation is an attempt at fairness.
The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy “estimates it will cost $13 billion for all these cleanups,” Dempsey said. “It could take two generations to do this, or until the end of the century. Now we just have these old sites discharging pollution into rivers and lakes.” Dempsey’s organization also wants to prevent an increase in abandoned toxic sites.
Taxpayers are currently footing the bill for so-called “orphan sites,” locations where owners are unclear or unidentified. Under current law, developers who clean up unclaimed brownfields receive tax increment financing, Irwin said.
 The Biggest Culprits

Sean McBrearty, director of the nonprofit Michigan Clean Water Action, said he wonders if any polluter pay effort can succeed when corporations are often the biggest culprits. McBrearty pointed to DTE Energy, which has faced legal action over its coal-fired power plants and other facilities.
“There are industrial accidents that haven’t been cleaned up because it’s cheaper to lobby the legislature than clean up contaminated sites,” said McBrearty, whose organization has worked with Irwin’s latest version of legislation. 
Irwin acknowledged that his bill will again face tough political realities. “We worry about a ‘pay-to-play’ environment where companies will use payments to stop an investigation,” Irwin said. “Now that the Michigan House is Republican, that adds more of a challenge.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/landfill-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Last time Drew Cline visited family in his hometown of Hickory, North Carolina, he went to his favorite barbecue joint in a downtown area that had been struggling to keep businesses afloat in recent years.
“I always take a walk around downtown to see how it’s changed,” he said. “And there would always be vacant storefronts. Until last time I went and we did our stroll around downtown, and not a single storefront was vacant. And there were people walking around with beer, and I asked, what’s going on?”
Cline learned from shop owners that the area had become designated a “social district” where people were allowed to purchase alcohol at bars and restaurants and take it with them outside the bar within this social district. He said before the district was created, the closure of mills and competition from shopping malls and development along a nearby state highway had hurt businesses’ ability to stay afloat downtown.
“Now, Hickory won’t attribute 100% of its revival to the social district, but they do contribute a pretty large portion of it,” he said. “And so it’s working.”
Cline, who now lives in Bedford and works as the executive director at a conservative think tank called the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, pitched the idea to state Rep. Bill Boyd, a Merrimack Republican. Boyd said he used North Carolina’s legislation on social districts as a model to create New Hampshire’s House Bill 467, but also saw successful social district programs in Michigan, Georgia, and other states. Cline said officials he spoke with in North Carolina said they hadn’t seen increases in public drunkenness or crime.
“Not even trash,” Cline said. “Which is kind of surprising, but I think that’s part of the planning for these downtowns, is that you do plan for more trash receptacles, more recycling bins.”
Last week, the New Hampshire Senate approved HB 467, which now heads to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk. The bill would allow New Hampshire towns and cities to opt into the program and establish social districts within their borders. The districts would have to be approved by a city council or other municipal body, or during a town meeting, and plans would be submitted to the liquor commission. The bill lays out operational guidelines, including the containers designated for alcohol, signage with information and rules, and time limits set at the discretion of towns and cities.
The bill also has backing from the New Hampshire Municipal Association. Brodie Deshaies, the association’s legislative advocate, described the bill as “a great private-public partnership” that towns and cities have been asking for.
The bill is one of several that lawmakers are moving through the State House in an attempt to loosen restrictions on bars in the Granite State.
House Bill 81, a bipartisan proposal to allow patrons to bring alcohol into the restroom at a bar or restaurant, is also headed to Ayotte’s desk. State law currently prohibits people from bringing alcoholic beverages into “foyers, hallways, kitchens, restrooms, or other areas not approved for service by the commission.”
Supporters of the bill, which was sponsored by Bethlehem Democratic Rep. Jared Sullivan, characterize it as an effort to reduce the risk of date rape drugs being placed in drinks. Rep. Erica Layon, a Derry Republican, said during a hearing last month that lawmakers had heard about a woman who left her drink on a table while using the restroom because a sign said it was illegal to take it with her. While she was gone, Layon said, the woman’s drink was drugged.
“She was out at a bar, had one drink, and then woke up in a hotel room the next morning after being raped,” Layon said. “Hopefully, you share the view that it is more important to empower people to protect themselves from unwanted assaults than it is to micromanage how they manage their drinks.”
Henry Veileux, on behalf of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, said people within the industry were opposed to the bill because of potential for underage drinking and overconsumption. He added that bartenders can hold on to a patron’s drink while they use the restroom.
Another bill proposed this session takes aim at an old rule for establishments.
New Hampshire has long prohibited bars from selling liquor without also selling food, though there’s a series of exceptions that the Legislature has carved out for hotels, airport bars, and other establishments over the years. House Bill 276, sponsored by Claremont Republican Rep. Wayne Hemingway, sought to change that and create a new liquor license — “a tavern license” — in the state that allows bars to sell hard liquor, beer, and wine without serving food. However, that bill was tabled by the state Senate last week, which means senators didn’t kill it entirely but they’ve decided against approving it for now.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BarleyHouse-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast-building states get more babies

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Key things have changed since CT last exceeded the spending cap,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/ct-spending-cap-2007/,To say Connecticut's government is better prepared to handle a spending cap exception now than it was in 2007 is an understatement.,"Gov. Ned Lamont frustrated fiscal conservatives and progressives alike this week when he agreed to legally exceed Connecticut’s constitutional spending cap for the first time since 2007.
Republican legislators and others on the political right slammed the fiscally moderate governor, calling his action the first step down a path that would return Connecticut to the 2010s, an era marked by several state tax hikes.
But many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats and other liberals say the relief he approved was akin to sharing a few crumbs from a lavish table. The spending cap deal offered a tiny amount of temporary flexibility, allowing General Fund spending to increase by 1% extra — and only in the next budget. After that, the spending cap, which keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation, falls back in place. 
“This ‘emergency’ means that Gov. Lamont can no longer call himself a strong believer in the spending cap,” said Carol Platt Liebau, president of the Yankee Institute, a conservative policy group based in Hartford. “Is our leadership really telling us that not one single dollar can be cut from a state budget of $55.7 billion” proposed by the Appropriations Committee?
Meanwhile, progressives add, education, health care, social services, municipal aid and other core programs that have been slipping for years — or decades — will enjoy modest increases in some cases or lose ground in others.
“We refused to really deal with the future,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat and a member of the Appropriations Committee. “I think, in fact, we’ve been completely irresponsible in this respect.”
CT finances are much healthier now than during last cap exception
To say state government is better prepared to handle a spending cap exception now than it was in 2007 is an understatement.
The first line of defense against any recession, the rainy day fund, is in far better shape. 
Connecticut entered the 2007-08 fiscal year with a nearly $1.4 billion in reserve, equal to about 8.5% of the General Fund, according to state budget records. It currently holds more than $4.1 billion or 18%.
Former Gov. M. Jodi Rell’s spending cap exception came in June 2007 as government prepared to close the fiscal year with a $269 million surplus equal to almost 2% of the budget. Lamont expects to wrap 2024-25 with $2.4 billion unspent, or 10%.
At first glance, the pension systems for state employees and municipal teachers almost two decades ago were in similar shape as the current ones. Analysts estimated Connecticut had enough assets to cover 62% of pension obligations to state retirees and 63% to teachers entering the 2007-08 fiscal year, compared to 56% and 62%, respectively, now.
But the state counted on an average annual return of 8.5% on its pension investments back then, very aggressive assumptions that inflated the funds’ values by billions of dollars. Connecticut has since lowered those expectations to 6.9% and crafted plans to retire pension debt more gradually by around 2050.
And Lamont and the General Assembly have made $8.6 billion in supplemental pension payments since 2020 using surplus dollars, on top of the more than $3 billion the state must contribute annually. Connecticut reduced pension debt faster than did any other state in 2022, analysts from The Pew Charitable Trusts reported earlier this year.
Unlike how it handles pensions, the state still doesn’t save the full amount needed to cover health care benefits retired to state employees. And by not doing so, it effectively shifts millions in costs, plus interest, onto future generations.
House Republicans chastised Lamont and majority Democrats last month for shorting this contractual obligation by $228 million in their respective budget proposals for the next two fiscal years. State Comptroller Sean Scanlon, a Democrat and former legislator, said this week he still hopes to mitigate that as he negotiates with the state’s Medicare Advantage insurance carrier.
But Connecticut didn’t pre-save anything to cover this benefit in 2007, nor would it require state employees to set aside anything else until 2009.
Further, concessions agreements with unions in 2011 and 2017 would expand those employee contributions, require the state to begin saving annually for retiree health care, and scale back program and pension benefits for future hires.
Lamont draws sharp response from conservatives
The Lamont administration recently pledged that the next state budget would not deviate from responsible fiscal principles that have been the governor’s hallmark since taking office in 2019.
“Our fiscal house has been rebuilt to weather an economic downturn,” said Jeffrey Beckham, Lamont’s budget director and secretary of the Office of Policy and Management. “Now is not the time to tear it down.”
Beckham added that the next two-year budget “must ensure that state spending is sustainable and will not lead to future tax increases or service cuts.”
Not everyone, though, shares the administration’s confidence.
“Get your pocketbooks, your wallets ready,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield said earlier this week, predicting Lamont’s cap exception would be the first step toward eventual fiscal chaos. “You’re going to give over more of your money [to] the state of Connecticut.”
Sen. Heather Somers of Groton, ranking GOP senator on the Appropriations Committee, said, “We have a governor who has literally folded like a lawn chair over this.”
Lamont, who told business leaders in mid-January that the spending cap was “sacrosanct,” has invalidated his fiscal credentials, according to the Yankee Institute.
Liebau noted that the $55.2 billion budget Lamont proposed for the upcoming biennium also maneuvered around the spending cap in other ways. The plan would shift $300 million outside the formal budget — and cap rules — to fund early childhood development. It also would borrow $60 million for a municipal grant to cover road repaving and winter snow removal. Borrowing and debt service payments also are outside the spending cap system.
“Connecticut’s residents and businesses can’t afford an increased tax burden,” Liebau added, “but after this, more taxes are what they should expect. This is no way to run a lemonade stand, much less a state.”
Rell launched big new investments. Lamont, not so much
Lamont also faces criticism, of a different kind, from progressive groups and many Democrats in the legislature’s majority.
The emergency he declared allowed legislators to spend $284 million more this fiscal year than the cap allowed, chiefly to cover a shortfall in the Medicaid program and ensure that health clinics, nonprofit social service agencies and other providers who treat the poor would be paid on time.
But Lamont could have used his declaration to also increase allowable spending in each of the next two fiscal years to grow by the same $284 million, plus roughly another 5% or $14 million.
He opted not to do so.
Instead, the administration pledged to allow legislators to carry about $255 million to $260 million of this fiscal year’s surplus into the coming biennial, giving them modest, temporary spending cap flexibility.
These carry-forward dollars originally were appropriated in this fiscal year, so spending them in either of the next two won’t count against cap limits in the coming biennium. But once those surplus dollars are spent, any extra spending cap room is gone.
Democrats already are making plans in the new budget they’re negotiating with Lamont to scale back planned increases in Medicaid rates and special education aid to K-12 schools. 
By early Thursday evening, Lamont still hadn’t announced a deal with SEIU 1199NE, which set a Tuesday strike deadline for about 6,400 workers serving 51 nursing homes and nearly 200 group homes. Union members work for private employers whose chief funding source is Medicaid payments, meaning the prospects of a strike hinge on state budget negotiations.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, predicted the private nonprofit agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services, which already lose hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t matched inflation for years, will be disappointed with the new budget.
The reason, he said, is that the $255 million to $260 million one-time surplus transfer Lamont will allow in the next two-year budget is nowhere close to sufficient, or sustainable enough, to support the major investments many legislators insist are necessary.
Rell, however, launched two huge new investments in 2007 by allowing $690 million in over-cap spending in the first year of a biennial budget. Adjusted for inflation, that represents almost $1.1 billion in 2025 currency.
And Rell ordered that $690 million spending cap exception to continue in perpetuity. Based on cap rules, that extra spending capacity also increased annually, usually between 2% and 4%, to keep pace with growing household income or inflation.
Rell, a Republican, agreed with a Democratic-controlled legislature that this ongoing infusion of cash was needed to provide one of the largest increases in local education funding in state history, a $261 million boost over two years, which represents more than $400 million now after adjusting for inflation.
Officials in 2007 also ordered a $323 million annual increase in Medicaid payments to providers that treat the poor.
That investment, worth almost $500 million now, is the last across-the-board Medicaid rate hike the legislature has approved.
 A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, joined other Democratic leaders in January calling for a $300 million annual investment in Medicaid by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
Gilchrest said she’s disappointed that legislators will settle for a more modest increase, not only because many poor patients no longer can find doctors willing to accept additional Medicaid patients but because of the huge piles of cash Connecticut holds.
Besides this year’s projected $2.4 billion surplus, which equals 10% of the General Fund, analysts project budget caps will capture at least about $1.3 billion in each of the next two fiscal years.
Connecticut has funneled $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017 to build reserves and scale back pension debt, a furious pace that far outstrips any similar effort in modern history. But those unfunded pension obligations, which topped $35 billion entering this year, still aren’t projected to be retired until about 2050. 
Gilchrest and many other Democrats say health care, education and other programs can’t keep sacrificing this much money to debt reduction much longer, let alone for two more decades.
“We have not solved the spending cap issue because our budget is still not in a good place,” she added. “We are ignoring decades of underfunding for Medicaid. … I think members are looking to make a significant investment in our state this year, and we’re tired of hearing the governor say there’s not enough money when we know there is.”
Winfield and others say Connecticut has overcompensated for fiscal mistakes of prior decades and is saving excessively now at the expense of communities, schools, health care and vulnerable residents.
While Lamont points with pride to the large surpluses achieved during his tenure, critics say these weren’t inessential funds but rather were leeched from core programs that have been dangerously undermined.
“What we have done is break a promise to people by not talking about these [surplus] overages,” Winfield said. 
Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, said the officials here cannot ignore the spending cap’s dysfunction, given the impending huge cuts to Medicaid and other federal assistance.
“When decisions from Washington, D.C., are increasing chaos and inflation, Connecticut has an opportunity to make life easier and more affordable for residents,” Byrne said. “But this requires bold action. At a time when families are struggling to put food on the table and pay for housing and health care costs, the spending cap shouldn’t be sacrosanct.”
Rell’s cap exception preceded a huge CT tax hike
Others say Rell and the 2007 General Assembly were irresponsible.
The governor originally proposed a state income tax hike to help pay for her education aid initiative but withdrew it that same year under pressure from her fellow Republicans in the legislature.
Aggressive spending wasn’t the only problem the state faced. But that, coupled with the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, brought state finances crumbling down.
By June 2009, legislators had emptied state reserves, ordered a nearly $875 million tax hike and ran up nearly $1 billion in operating debt.
The bleeding didn’t stop there.
Democrat Dannel P. Malloy inherited a budget deficit of more than 18% when he became become governor in January 2011 and approved a tax hike estimated at more than $1.8 billion a year. Four years later, in 2015, they ordered another $670 million in tax increases while canceling or deferring about $225 million in previously approved tax cuts that hadn’t taken effect yet.
Lamont often urges legislators to remember Connecticut’s past mistakes. He says sustainable budgeting enabled them to two years ago to deliver the state’s first income tax rate cut since the mid-1990s, which saves middle-class households about $300 per year.
“At the core of Connecticut’s economic turnaround is predictability and affordability, after years in which difficult economic conditions combined with challenging budgets didn’t allow for much of either,” Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s communications director, said Thursday. “The governor is committed to ensuring that our spending and revenue remain sustainable and in sync, without creating the need to raise taxes in the future.”
Ritter, who brokered this year’s spending cap compromise with Lamont, also insists on sustainable budgeting.
But the speaker added that those who say programs are strained and investments are needed also aren’t wrong. Still, Connecticut pledged in its contracts with state bondholders not to broadly alter the spending cap or other fiscal controls before July 1, 2028, though more modest adjustments can be made.
“The spending cap is tough,” Ritter said, adding it’s uncertain whether the state can avoid more exceptions or other cap workarounds for three more years. “At some point, we’re going to have to make a decision.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jodi-Rell-CT-Public-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

But they said they will face an uphill battle in order for the governor to consider their petition.
“We’re putting our heads together now to figure out what is the best way to make a change here in Rankin County,” said the Rev. Ricky Sutton, of Mount Carmel Ministries in Pearl. Sutton said Gaines “doesn’t represent the people, and we don’t really need someone in office like that.”
At a May 3 breakfast meeting, Gaines told a crowd of 100 people that the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department’s lawyer, Jason Dare, “beat the pants off those guys – the dopers, the people that raped and doped your daughters.” Two days earlier, Dare had announced the department and county would pay $2.5 million to settle the civil rights case brought by the two men tortured by Rankin “Goon Squad” deputies.
Addressing the outrage following his remarks, Gaines said his comments “were not aimed at anyone personally,” and that he “did not name any individuals.”
The petition effort also follows supervisors’ approval in April and rescission this month of an unpopular zoning ordinance that would have restricted the placement of mobile homes and required rural residents to seek a planning commission’s consent for add-ons to their property, among other changes. 
The Rev. Ava Harvey, of Pilgrim’s Rest Missionary Baptist Church in Brandon, described the ordinance as an “overreach,” but said Gaines’ comments “pulled the scab off” as county residents seek to heal from the reign of the “Goon Squad.” 
Harvey said the group of 30 has hired a lawyer to comb through state law and advise them on the “tedious” petition process.
While the removal of most elected county officials, including sheriffs, requires the signatures of 30% of all registered voters in the county, there’s a higher bar – 51% of registered voters in a district – to remove a county supervisor, justice court judge or constable.
There are 20,958 registered voters in Rankin County’s fourth district, which means that a petition for Gaines’ removal would need 10,689 signatures, more than the number of voters who participated in the last supervisors’ election in that district.. In 2023, 9,965 voters cast ballots in the supervisor election for District 4 – and Gaines won with more than 75% of the vote. 
“For whatever reason,” said Korbin Felder, a Justice Fellow at the Center for Constitutional Rights, “those three positions within all county governance are carved out from it.”
Fifty-one percent of voters from the district the supervisor represents “is an incredibly high bar,” Felder said. 
The law requires the petition to be submitted on a specific size and type of paper, and each page must be notarized to show that the signatures were collected within 60 days.
“You can tell it’s written by people who are already in office, and they don’t want anybody to remove them,” Harvey said.
Once the signatures are collected and verified by the county registrar, the petition must be submitted to the election commissioner’s clerk. The governor must then consider and count the verified signatures, and if they meet the 51% bar, the supervisor in question would be served notice to show cause as to why a removal election ought not to be held. The governor would then convene a “removal council” headed by the county’s senior chancery judge to determine whether there is a substantial basis for a removal election. If they determine that there is, a removal election would then be conducted. Only after a successful removal election would the governor declare the supervisor’s office vacant, and appoint a temporary replacement. 
“It’s a long process that seems to be meant to disincentivize citizens from using this power,” Felder said.
But the citizens working on the petition expressed a commitment to try and push for a successful petition despite these challenges. 
In addition to door-knocking, Harvey said, the group is considering establishing drop-in stations where registered voters in the district can sign the petition at certain times.
Laura Faulker, a Rankin County activist, said that even if the petition fails, she hopes the effort will raise awareness about the importance of holding local elected officials like Gaines accountable.
“I thought that he stood behind what people voted him in for, to make a change for the good, not to speak down on victims,” Faulkner said.
Sutton expressed fear that his grandsons could be stopped by deputies one night, and stereotyped like Jenkins and Parker were, “just because they wear dreads or maybe earrings,” he said. “Until we change this mentality, I think we’re going to continue to have problems in Rankin County, and I just refuse to go back.”
Though Rankin deputies appear to have targeted people based on suspected drug use, not race — most of their accusers were white — their tactics were reminiscent of the Jim Crow era, when sheriffs and their deputies harassed and beat Black Southerners and civil rights activists.
“It’s really not just a Black and white thing,” Sutton said. “This is a right and wrong thing.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/15104139/IMG_0496.jpg,,,2025-05-23 06:02:10.442938

North Carolina hardly needs any more wake-up calls about the devastating impacts of climate change, but a new, must-see PBS/NPR documentary provides another powerful reminder on the subject of dealing with the extreme weather that climate change is spawning.
The documentary is entitled “Hurricane Helene’s Deadly Warning,” and in it, NPR’s Laura Sullivan exposes a wasteful and vicious cycle that has come to dominate how our state and nation deal with natural disasters. It’s one in which the federal government spends more than $50 billion every year to help communities recover from disasters, but that frequently includes properties that have already flooded repeatedly.
This cycle is now on full display in western North Carolina where politicians and the construction industry are resisting common sense rules that would govern how new buildings are sited and constructed.
The bottom line: “Hurricane Helene’s Deadly Warning,” should be required viewing and listening for all elected leaders and average Americans. Look for it online at PBS or NPR.

Revised data released Thursday show the situation’s even worse than that.
While 191 closings were originally reported for 2024, the pharmacy board on Thursday revised that number 13% upward, to 215. 
“This included 19 independent, 14 small chain (2-11 stores), and 182 large chain pharmacies (12+ stores),” the board said in a written statement. “Board of Pharmacy licensing data also shows 35 closings in 2025, including five hospital outpatient, 17 independent, six small chain, and seven large chain pharmacies. Further, revised figures show the number of retail pharmacies declining in Ohio from a high of 2,218 in 2015 to 1,799 in 2024, a reduction of 19 percent.”
To healthy suburbanites, the loss of pharmacies might not seem pressing.
But for those lacking good transportation and medical access, the neighborhood pharmacist is more than a place to get medicine. It’s also an opportunity to consult with a medical professional about chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. 
The loss of isolated pharmacies creates deserts, and they’re growing. In Meigs County in Southeastern Ohio, for example, nearly 40% of the census tracts are part of what the pharmacy board terms pharmacy deserts.

“Pharmacies are essential for maintaining the health and safety of our citizens,” Ohio Board of Pharmacy Executive Director Steven W. Schierholt said in a written statement Thursday afternoon. “We hope that this data can provide much needed insight to improve access to pharmacy services throughout Ohio.”
Independent and small-chain pharmacies have for years complained that the practices of huge health conglomerates that own pharmacy middlemen, big health insurers and their own pharmacy operations are driving them out of business. In January, the Federal Trade Commission released an interim report saying that the conglomerates’ practices appeared to show that the small pharmacies have a valid point.
The board of pharmacy website says that 331 independent and 180 small-chain pharmacies have closed in Ohio since 2012, for a total of 511. Over the same period, 544 large-chain pharmacies have closed, but the pattern has been starkly different. 
Closures of independent and small-chain pharmacies have stayed within a 30-store range each year since 2012. From 2012 through 2023, a total of 355 large-chain pharmacies closed. Then in 2024, a whopping 182 more did.
The vast majority of those are owned by Rite Aid, which has twice declared bankruptcy and closed hundreds of stores in Ohio and Michigan. 
Also, Walgreens was in the process of closing thousands of its stores in March when it sold itself to a private-equity firm. Many more closures are expected — especially in already-underserved areas.
At the time, Dave Burke, a former state senator who is now executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, said things have gotten so bad that Congress has no choice but to take dramatic action.
“Probably one of the best things that happened in pharmacy was Walgreens saying, ‘We just can’t take it anymore,’” he said. “I think we’re at a point of inflection. It’s slow-moving, but I think we’re there. If I were (part of the private equity group) I would probably buy Walgreens as well because we are at rock bottom. If this goes any lower, I don’t know where people get their prescriptions. We have a health crisis at that point.”

(Getty Images)Treatment for substance use disorders is a vital service that is critical for the health and well-being of our state. However, as the state considers budget proposals, important and effective mechanisms that fund treatment for substance use disorders have been targeted as a way to meet other budgetary needs. Important services such as outpatient treatment, partial hospitalization, and residential treatment could be at risk of becoming a casualty of the state’s budget. 
How could this happen? To understand this, it is important to first understand how treatment for substance use disorders is funded in New Hampshire.
Much of New Hampshire’s substance use disorder treatment has been funded by the Alcohol Abuse, Prevention, and Treatment Fund (better known as the “Alcohol Fund”) and the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. The Alcohol Fund was created in law in 2000, with the intent of dedicating 5% of gross profits of state liquor sales toward substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery programs and services. The Opioid Abatement Trust Fund started in 2020 and utilizes money gained from legal settlements with drug companies to fund the treatment of opioid use disorder. These funding mechanisms were meant to be sustainable and ensure that these life-saving treatments would be available for any Granite Staters who need it.
While Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s budget proposal includes full funding for the Alcohol Fund, it also proposes to utilize money from the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund to pay for police overtime and drug enforcement operations in the North Country. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, proposes to utilize money from the Alcohol Fund in other areas of the budget and then backfill this money using the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. 
While both proposals do maintain funding for the Alcohol Fund, each could have devastating consequences. Under both proposals, access to care for those seeking treatment for substance use disorders in New Hampshire is jeopardized. 
In shifting these funding sources, both budget options propose to take dedicated funds from the Opioid Abatement Fund. Regardless of how the state proposes to divert these funds, this would dramatically change the programs and services available here in New Hampshire for treatment of other substance use disorders, such as alcohol use disorder or stimulant use disorders. From 2019-2022, nearly a third of drug overdose deaths were not related to opioids. Thus, defunding the treatment of other substance use disorders could lead to more lives lost to the potentially fatal consequences of untreated substance use disorders. 
Treatment for substance use disorders amounts to more than dollars and cents — there is a real human cost too. The New Hampshire Drug Overdose Fatality Review Commission reports that from 2019-2022, 1,572 people in New Hampshire died due to drug overdose. Of these people, 1,402 (about 90%) either had no evidence of substance use disorder treatment or were not currently receiving treatment. Those that were in treatment at the time of their death comprised fewer than 10% of those who died. This serves as a stark reminder that treatment works, and treatment saves lives. 
As the state considers budget priorities, it is important to note that utilizing money from the Alcohol Fund or the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund in any way other than how it was intended could come with severe consequences. We need to protect the programs and resources that have been shown to save lives. With drug overdose continuing to have such a high death toll, diverting money away from the mechanisms that fund this treatment could be devastating for access to care and lead to more deaths.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/opioids-1024x628.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

There is overlap with the bills. Both pieces of legislation would regulate online gambling through the Ohio Casino Control Commission and internet gambling would start by March 31. 
Nearly all of the tax proceeds from internet gambling would go to the state’s general revenue fund and 1% would go to the Problem Gambling Fund. Both bills only allow an Ohio casino or racino to be licensed as an internet gambling operator. Someone would have to be at least 21 and physically in Ohio to participate in internet gambling. 
The lawmakers behind these bills say Ohioans are already participating illegally in online gambling.  
“It is important to highlight that online gambling is already occurring in the state of Ohio,” Manning said during his sponsor testimony last week in the Senate Select Committee on Gaming. “It is difficult to quantify an exact number, but it is clear there is significant illegal online gambling going on in the state, as there was illegal sports betting before it was legalized.”
Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia all have legalized online gambling. 
Senate Bill 197 
The 700-page bill would authorize three types of online gambling — internet gambling, iLottery, and online betting on horse racing. 
The bill levies a 36% tax on an operator’s internet gambling receipts. There would be a $50 million initial fee and a $5 million renewal fee for Ohio casinos and racinos. Manning predicts this could generate at least $500 million per year for Ohio. 
S.B. 197 would move all Ohio gambling regulations under the Ohio Casino Control Commission. This would nix the State Racing Commission and the Casino Control Commission would take over their responsibilities. 
Ohio Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, questioned the horse racing aspect of the bill.
“I don’t think the Casino Control Commissioner knows anything about how to regulate horse racing,” he said. 
In response, Ryan Soultz, vice president of governmental affairs for Boyd Gaming Corporation, said other states have found a way to have one regulatory body that oversees both. 
Trevor Hayes, vice president of government relations for Caesars Digital, supports the bill.   
“Our experience shows that regulated iGaming provides a significant new source of state tax revenue, provides consumers with a strictly regulated and fair gaming option, and protects vulnerable populations,” he said this week to the Senate Select Committee on Gaming. 
House Bill 298
When compared to the senate bill, H.B. 298 is smaller in scope. It would not allow online Ohio Lottery games nor would it legalize online betting on horse racing. 
“This bill would authorize Ohio to take the next logical step in generating state revenue by authorizing internet gambling in the state of Ohio,” Stewart said this week to the House Finance Committee. “It’s reasonable to take the next logical step, technological step, and allow Ohioans to play these games online, as well as in person.” 
The bill would impose a 28% tax on internet gambling receipts, which is the same as Michigan. 
Stewart and John estimate this could general between $400-$800 million a year in revenue. 
“There’s a lot of things that we want to do in the state of Ohio that require increased revenues,” John said. “This is one way that we can go about expanding the consumer base of players who prefer an online setting.”
Democratic lawmakers raised concerns in committee that this could lead to more people under 21 participating illegally in online gambling.
“If we can bring regulations to this market, then it is my feeling that we will be able to help, hopefully, curb the underage participation,”  John said. 
There are more than 250,000 problem gamblers in Ohio and 1 in 5 problem gamblers attempt suicide, said Ohio state Rep. Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. This data is from the 2022 Ohio Gambling Survey.
“Where is the line?” Isaacsohn asked. “At what point do we say this isn’t worth it anymore, that it’s not worth the additional revenue that could fund a tax cut or a stadium or whatever else it goes towards.”
John said regulating online gaming could help put measures in place to help people “before they get to the point of making a decision that they can’t return from.”

(Photo by Joe Zimmermann/Maryland Department of Natural Resources)Blue crab abundance in the Chesapeake Bay this year was at its second-lowest level since winter dredge surveys began in 1990, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
But the department is holding strong on the current harvest regulations, said Mandy Bromilow, blue crab program manager at the department.
“We’re still OK,” Bromilow said. “It’s not ideal, but it’s not something where we’re super concerned.”
That’s partly because the low levels did not fall below a key threshold of 72.5 million spawning-age female crabs. At 108 million, this year’s figure was below the department’s target of 196 million, but it didn’t hit rock bottom.
Scientists at DNR say that a harsh winter may be to blame, with cold snaps capable of killing off crabs bedding down for the season. The numbers of male, female and juvenile crabs all declined in 2025’s survey, conducted from December through March. The total figure was 238 million crabs — compared to 317 million crabs the year before.
But the department is also awaiting the results from a fuller assessment of the blue crab stock, due out next spring, that promises to reshape the way the beloved crustacean is managed throughout the Chesapeake. It will be the first major stock assessment for the species since 2011.
The assessment doesn’t involve any additional surveys out on the water, but rather an in-depth review of existing data, with the goal of determining not only the overall health of the population, but the reasons for its fluctuations.
Chesapeake Bay oyster population stays strong, but budget cuts sow concern

Scientists already know that the blue crabs are highly sensitive to factors like water temperature, and they only live for a few years, so the population can experience “boom and bust” cycles. But lately, the “busts” seem to keep coming, with six straight years of a below-average population of juvenile crabs. The lowest total population recorded by the survey since 1990 was just a few years ago, in 2022.
“Layered on top of those natural annual fluctuations, there are some additional somewhat unclear or mysterious factors that many hypothesize are influencing the blue crab population,” said Allison Colden, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
Could it be the high population of invasive — and hungry — blue catfish gobbling up young crabs? Could it be water pollution depressing the growth of underwater grasses — a critical shelter protecting crabs from predators? Or might it be a question of climate change harming blue crabs by altering their ecosystem?
“We know the temperatures are increasing. We know that the timing of different algae blooms and other important cycles within the Chesapeake Bay is changing,” Colden said. “The relative impact of each one of those factors is something we hope that Maryland and Virginia will be able to investigate and address through the upcoming stock assessment.”
Bromilow noted that Maryland has taken action in response to the declining trend. For example, in 2022, when the population reached its nadir, the department set the first-ever bushel limits for male crabs, shifting a management strategy that had focused on females. The department has kept the limits in place since then. But the population hasn’t responded accordingly. The number of adult male crabs fell from 46 million in 2024 to 26 million in 2025 — a record low.
“The changes that we’re making — we’re not really seeing a response, and so it seems likely that there’s something else going on, like the environmental factors,” Bromilow said.
The stock assessment will bring in scientific literature, computer modeling, and years worth of winter dredge data, and it could yield a changed paradigm for blue crab management in the bay, including for male crabs, Bromilow said. The assessment is produced by scientists from institutions such as the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, as well as natural resources departments such as Maryland’s.

“The threshold or target could change, or we could learn that maybe males are more important than we thought previously, and there needs to be maybe a male reference point,” Bromilow said. “But we don’t know that just yet.”
In a news release, the Bay Foundation called the 2025 numbers “distressing” and called for Maryland to maintain bushel limits for male crabs, and increase protection for female crabs, “including reducing the importation of egg bearing ‘sponge’ crabs from Virginia.”
“Reducing harvest overall — and managing conservatively until we have the stock assessment — is probably a good idea, considering the trends we’ve been seeing over the past five to six years,” Colden said.
The Bay Foundation is calling on Virginia to decrease its harvest, and “consider additional protections for males,” because of the historically low density this year, which fell below 2022’s figure of 26 million. The foundation also renewed its calls for the federal government to maintain funding for clean water initiatives at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, citing their benefits for blue crabs.
Rob Newberry, a waterman and chairman of the Delmarva Fisheries Association, said Thursday that he wasn’t surprised by the bad results this year, given the tough winter, with temperatures that quickly plummeted and stayed cold, shocking crabs buried in the mud.
East Coast fishery managers remain vigilant over status of Atlantic striped bass

“All the sudden the water [temperature] drops. Well, they’re dormant, and they can’t bury any deeper,” Newberry said. “They get clobbered.”
Brian Nesspor, a Rock Hall crabber known by the nickname “Beefalo” or “Beef,” said he’s expecting an “average” year for the blue crab harvest. He’s optimistic about the number of young crabs, in part because he’s heard good news from fellow watermen who target clams on the bay bottom.
They’ve seen more little crabs on their conveyor belts than crabbers see in their crab pots, which have a bigger mesh that allows small crabs to escape, Nesspor said.
“The report has been from them that it’s a very good banner crop of small crabs,” Nesspor, who is a member of Maryland’s Tidal Fisheries Advisory Commission.
Nesspor has doubts about the baywide winter dredge survey. He argues that the sites selected for the survey each year may fail to capture the changing behavior of wintering blue crabs.
Each year, the surveyors randomly select 1,500 sites in the bay with water deeper than 5 feet for the survey, which DNR conducts alongside the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, according to its website. Nesspor has suggested that the department add one extra site per county suggested by watermen, based on the conditions they observe in the estuary. But he said he has been turned down.
“The crabs are bedding farther north. They’re in shallower water,” Nesspor said. “Everything is changing in the bay. Mother Nature is way ahead of us.”
Newberry shares the skepticism about the methodology.
“It’s not like counting sheep in a field,” he said. “There’s a little bit of a difficult problem here: They’re underwater, and you’re not.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Blue-crab-2024-winter-survey-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

(Photo by Troy Bennett / Maine Morning Star)About a decade ago, a Topsham-area school district became concerned about how often staff members physically restrained students who were acting out and put them in seclusion rooms, especially the district’s 500 or so special education students. 
Those tactics are only supposed to be used in emergencies under state law, but at the time, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 75 recorded 176 restraints and 152 seclusions on just 15 students, according to district-level data shared with Maine Morning Star. Staff were routinely scratched and bruised in the process, said Amy Hall, the district’s special education director.


May 21: Restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used on students in emergency situations. Accounts from families and educators show how districts’ interpretation of state law vary widely and how traumatic the experiences can be.
May 22: State data reveals only a fraction of Maine’s schools and districts are consistently reporting incidents of restraint and seclusion in violation of state law. Even with the underreporting, Maine schools are relying on these practices thousands of times per year.
May 23: How one district worked with researchers to change its approach to student behavior and significantly reduced the use of restraint and seclusion

“We started to get very concerned about the level of staff injuries, student injuries, and just the level of crisis we were dealing with in our schools,” Hall said. 
So in 2018, the district decided to pursue an alternative. Today, because staff members now view student behavioral issues as a problem to prevent and solve, rather than an infraction to punish — and because of a significant investment in training to execute that shift in mindset — the 2,350-student district’s use of restraint and seclusion is down to the single digits: two restraints and seven seclusions in the 2022-23 school year.
The Maine Department of Education is touting that success story in the hope that more districts will sign onto MSAD 75’s approach and rely less on restraint and seclusion — when a staff member temporarily immobilizes a student and places them alone in a room until they calm down. Research has shown that the tactics “are not effective in altering a student’s behavior and that the experience of being restrained and secluded can be traumatizing and cause lasting effects for students,” according to the Maine DOE website. The state and some school districts have worked to reduce their use for years due to staff and student injuries.
The model MSAD 75 turned to was developed by a Maine-based nonprofit, Lives in the Balance, that works nationally and has been adopted by a handful of other districts — including the much larger Fairfax Public Schools in Virginia — to dramatically reduce their use of restraint and seclusion.
But despite that model’s success, it has not been widely adopted across Maine, according to Ben Jones, director of the organization’s legal and policy initiatives. Although Lives in the Balance has offered free technical assistance to districts since 2022 through a state Department of Education partnership, Jones said only two districts have followed up on the offer. 
Sarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine who recently co-authored a report on student behavior, said the state is failing to provide adequate assistance to districts to make sure these tools can be implemented properly. 
“Any one of these programs would decrease the behavioral crises, and then need for seclusion or restraint. But part of the issue there is that the state doesn’t really have the infrastructure to support implementation,” Wilkinson said. 
In response to questions about state support, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for Maine DOE, said the department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them.  
“What works in Falmouth isn’t going to work in Machias or Fort Kent, and that’s where folks at the district level need support to implement these approaches in a way that works for their population,” Wilkinson said.
Since 2021, Maine has limited the circumstances under which school staff can restrain and seclude students through a change in state law that aimed to nudge districts away from their frequent use. But recent complaints of worsening student behavior since the pandemic led to an effort to loosen those restrictions, which disability rights advocates fear could result in a spike. 
The Topsham-area district, MSAD 75, is seeing that same increase in extreme behavior among younger students, Hall said, but relaxing the law on restraint and seclusion is not the answer. 
“The mental health needs of our population of students have increased, while restraints and seclusions have dramatically decreased,” she said. 
Instead, Hall advocates for educators to rethink how they view behavior. Most kids will do well in school if they can. Problems with behavior often signal a response to an underlying problem that educators need to uncover and address, she said.
“If a kid is not doing well, then we need to shift the way that we’re working with that student,” Hall said. “Once we get to a restraint or in a seclusion, you’re way too late.”
Changing how schools think about student behavior
The founder of Lives in the Balance, Ross Greene, a child clinical psychologist and former Harvard Medical School faculty member, came up with the model based on a mindset shift that MSAD 75 adopted.
Greene’s approach helps schools address what he calls “concerning behaviors” without resorting to punitive measures, based on the idea that when children struggle with frustration, refuse to follow instructions, or can’t keep up academically or socially, their response is to act out.
“I get it, those behaviors are dangerous and scary and disruptive, but they’re communicating the exact same thing — they’re having difficulty meeting a particular expectation,” he said. 
Rather than respond with punishment or continue to demand compliance, educators can work with the child to identify and address the underlying problems. By temporarily adjusting expectations and focusing on solving problems, educators can prevent behavioral issues from escalating and build students’ skills so they can meet expectations in the future, Greene said.
“The problem is that a lot of adults, not just in schools, see a kid who’s having difficulty meeting an expectation as being noncompliant, and what they do is they shoot for compliance,” he said.
Greene’s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model has been studied in students with significant behavioral challenges, including nonverbal students and students with oppositional defiant disorder, and those studies have found the model leads to notable improvements.
One district that’s advocating to loosen the state’s restraint and seclusion law, MSAD 11 in Gardiner, said it considered Greene’s model but worries that the approach is not enough to address increased reports of aggressive student behavior.
“Given that we’ve almost never experienced the type of dysregulation we’re seeing in very early learners, I am not confident that only going down the proactive pathway is a solution to the current context and climate that we are in,” said Angela Hardy, the district’s director of curriculum and instruction. 
In the upcoming school year, Hardy said the district will try to implement some strategies that worked for MSAD 75 and that Greene advocates for, such as designing a learning environment that helps prevent incidents. 
Classroom design as prevention
A special education teacher at the time, Samantha Lapointe started thinking that restraints and seclusions were no longer an option when MSAD 75 first made the change, even though the law permits their use in emergencies. 
“It’s hard to imagine how you would do business without those tools, until you commit to thinking about not having them,” said Lapointe, who is now the district’s elementary special education coordinator. “That leads to a lot of thinking about what to do instead — and that leads you into new territory, right around what new skillsets need to be stronger, what prevention strategies need to be stronger.”
Classroom design is one element of prevention, Lapointe said. The idea is to minimize any danger in case a student acts out — and reduce the need for staff to physically intervene.
She started working with students on the floor, then brought in a sofa. When the school got new furniture, she requested two heavy, communal tables instead of individual desks that students could easily move or overturn. The tables also had to be low to the ground so students climbing atop them would not be in danger. And Lapointe hung all the posters high enough so elementary students couldn’t rip them off the walls. Staff also locked the closet that stored toys and activities.
“I’ve still had kids climb on tables, and I’ve had to ask myself, how dangerous is this really?” she said. “Is it an extreme, imminent risk of harm if they fall? You should be constantly weighing out what really constitutes danger to the extent that you would need to go hands-on.”
The other piece was training ed techs — aides who often work one-on-one with students — in the new approach. 
“Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand,” Lapointe said. “The way you talk to kids matters a lot.”










Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand. The way you talk to kids matters a lot.


– Samantha Lapointe, MSAD 75 elementary special education coordinator


If a student tries to leave the classroom, for example, instead of stopping them, staff can start a conversation by asking them where they’re going, what they need to leave for and what their plan is after leaving, she said. Meanwhile, she also trained her staff to ask themselves: “What can I tolerate? Why can’t they leave the classroom? What’s the worst that’s going to happen?” 
“The level of thinking and intentional decision-making needs to be very high, and that’s one thing also that I train my staff in: intentionality,” Lapointe said. “You must ask yourself, before you say anything, before you do anything: What is it you’re going to say or do and why? What outcome are you hoping to get?”
That’s the kind of training Maine teachers are asking for and largely not receiving, said Wilkinson with the University of Southern Maine.
“Teachers or ed techs will report, ‘We’ve been safety-care trained, we’ve had de-escalation training’ … all of these things that really only happen when a behavior gets to a certain point,” Wilkinson said. “That means that the behavior has to get to that point before they have the skills to deal with it. Teachers are not reporting that they’re confident with all of the things you would do before the behavior escalates.”
Even in the Topsham-area district, the training in Collaborative and Proactive Solutions isn’t complete. Lapointe said it’s now a priority to expand beyond special education to general education classroom teachers and higher grades.
A new approach
The Topsham-area district combines Greene’s model with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS — a research-based model used in schools across the country that’s built around positive reinforcement of good behavior and gradually increasing levels of intervention and consequences for kids who misbehave. 
This is how the combination of the two models could look.
In the library, the expectation for all students is that they keep their voices low and read, Hall said. PBIS lays out a system to reinforce positive behavior, often through small rewards, and address infractions. But Greene’s approach would come into play if a student can’t keep quiet in the library, she said.
It may be that the child can’t focus, keep still, has sensory issues, or is too stimulated in that setting. Instead of punishing the child, teachers try to problem solve: They might offer them headphones, move their reading time to a quiet classroom, or even allow the child to leave the library, Hall said.
Moving away from demanding compliance from students helps educators understand and work with them to solve the issue underlying the behavior, instead of an outburst or aggression stemming from it, she said.
“Instead of just asking them to do the same thing over again and sustain in an environment that they can’t, you try to figure out what’s behind the behavior,” Hall said. “We still have rewards, and kids still have consequences, but the consequences just aren’t, ‘We’re going to put you in a seclusion room.’ Because that’s not a consequence, that’s a crisis response.”

(Photo by WEWS.)An Ohio bill would restrict government entities from discussing election information during the 30 days before the election. This would prohibit school districts from acknowledging their levies while early voting occurs.
Public school districts in Ohio have been facing challenges.
“We had a lot of levies that went down,” retired teacher Will Vickery said. “As a result, we’re seeing rifts of teachers, we’re seeing ending of programs, we’re seeing sports cut, we’re seeing busing change and only offered to kindergarten through 4th grade.”
Voter education is an important step in passing school levies, Vickery added. But he is worried about a new House bill that would limit communication ahead of elections.
“They have 11 other months of the year to provide information to their citizens,” state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, said.
Mathews and state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, introduced H.B. 264, which would prohibit government entities from referring to — even without saying how to vote — a levy, bond issue, or candidate during early voting, the 30 days before an election.
“Making sure that their taxpayer dollars are used for the governing of their entities rather than influencing elections,” Mathews continued.
Current law already bans public jurisdictions from taking partisan stances on issues. This would extend that provision to now prohibit the agency from providing information, explanation, or viewing.
The following would be prohibited from being sent by a government entity in the 30 days before the election: a notice, placard, advertisement, brochure, flyer, direct mailer, newsletter, electronic message, internet article or advertisement, or other form of general publication that communicates information about the plans, policies, and operations of a state agency, political subdivision, or public official to members of the public. This doesn’t include individual correspondence with a constituent.
Some candidates, if they already hold a public office, could send excessive mailers to keep their name top of mind, he added. State lawmakers already have this prohibition.
“Mail will go out and say ‘Look at how great our local jurisdiction is doing;’ it does not say vote, it does not say re-elect, it does not say any of those things,” the legislator said. “But it definitely leaves a positive impression on whoever is receiving that mail, and we want to make sure that there are clean lines.”
Since 2018, Parma City Schools has had its levies fail 7 times, including earlier this month. Superintendent Charles Smialek said that under this bill, he would not be able to email their families to acknowledge the existence of a levy or even address school finance.
“We know that we can’t campaign, but we should absolutely be allowed to inform,” Smialek said. “At some point, it’s infringing upon freedom of speech.”
Mathews denied this, saying that candidates or campaigns would be able to use personal money.
“You can still obviously campaign as long as you do it on your own time with your own money,” he said. “They had other months to discuss their financials.”
There are some exceptions to the bill. If a school district website already has an explainer on what the levy is ahead of the 30-day blackout period, they don’t need to take it down.
As far as how the boards of elections would handle this bill, Mathews responded that it would allow for some communication deemed “incredibly timely.” However, nonpartisan Case Western Reserve University elections law professor Atiba Ellis couldn’t find this in the legislation.
“I know of no evidence of a problem that would require such a sweeping rule that has the potential to restrict government entities from performing their due tasks,” Ellis said.
The secretary of state’s office would still be allowed to conduct “voter education programs” even when the incumbent appears on the ballot, according to the bill.
“This over-inclusion problem can’t necessarily be solved by the exemption that was written,” Ellis said.
According to Mathews, Ohio Sec. of State Frank LaRose has been sent the language.
“Our team is currently reviewing the legislation and will continue to monitor and have conversations with legislative members as the bill progresses through the legislative process,” LaRose’s spokesperson Ben Kindel said.
Ellis also brought up freedom of speech concerns, which Vickery echoed.
“You got to be able to keep the people informed, and it’s their right to know,” the retired teacher said. “If they’re going to vote no, fine, vote no. But understand the potential consequences.”

[…]","The columnist's son, Baxter, runs across a field in New Hampshire in September 2013. He just graduated from middle school this week. (Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector) My eighth grader graduated from middle school on Wednesday, and I’m not sure how I feel about it.
You raise a child, care for them for years as they can barely speak or take care of themselves, and then they go and grow up. Our son now looms over my husband. He’s nearly my height. And he shows disturbing signs of independent thought.
That’s a joke, of course. Still, sitting in a packed gymnasium proved unexpectedly emotional. I was watching my child grow up, along with more than 200 of his peers.
I watched for others who couldn’t be there. My mother died 14 years ago this June, three months after our son was born. She was so excited to see pictures, to chat via videoconference. At the time, we lived in New Hampshire, while she lived in Kansas. She was never able to meet her grandson in person. And she was never able to tell me how quickly the time passes from late elementary school to the end of middle school — how in the space of three or four years, a little kid transforms into a towering teen.
I wish she could be there. But like much that we wish for ourselves and our loved ones and our lives, that’s not possible. My brother and sister were there, though, and they supported and congratulated their nephew after the ceremony.
We take life’s moments as they come, enjoy what we can, and move forward.
 
Grief and strength
Scanning social media, a message stood out. Paraphrased, the meme stated that grief encompasses more than sadness after someone passes away. We grieve when we lose something, and that needn’t be a life. We can grieve friendships, careers, politics, the passage of time.
I have felt so much grief over the past couple of years, grief that at times threatens to overwhelm me.
I have grieved watching state politics, as LGBTQ+ Kansans were ruthlessly targeted by lawmakers. I have grieved as institutions once thought unassailable, impervious to tampering, shuddered in the face of dime-store authoritarianism. I have grieved as I realized that I’m no longer the twentysomething who bounced right back from setbacks and disappointments. I have grieved watching others around me mourn the loss of a society they thought they understood.
At one time, I believed that age strengthened you. That as the years pass, you grow stronger and better equipped to face the world. I’m not sure that’s true. If anything, in recent days I’ve felt more vulnerable, more fearful, more uncertain.
All that mourning makes celebration difficult. My son heads to high school in a profoundly unsettled time, one in which politics and technology and social upheaval pose existential threats. I want to protect him. I want to vanquish these griefs, for his generation if not for my own.
Yet as I just write, that’s not possible. We live how we live and we have what we have. We can try our best — I can try my best — and the world around us still falls short.
Others have departed recently, others whose perspective and wisdom I would have valued. My former colleague at the University Daily Kansan, Andy Obermueller, would have offered dry and cynical takes. My former bosses and friends at the Concord Monitor in New Hampshire, Mike Pride and Mark Travis, would have drawn on their journalistic wisdom. My high school history teacher, Robert Nellis, would have cited battles from World War II.
The world would better and stronger if all these men were still in it.
 
Love and life
But I can’t leave this column in a pit of despair. My mother didn’t raise me that way.
We still live in a nation of wealth and opportunity. We still live in a state packed with caring, creative people of all ages. We can still make changes for the better, even if they do only a fraction of what we imagine.
I don’t know what the future brings. I do know, however, the love I feel for my son and family. I know how much love my mother, gone these many years, felt for us. Love may not make the world go round. It may not solve societal problems. But our lives don’t amount to much without it.
Despite my grief these past years, I’ve also found incredible joy. My husband and child help with that, of course. So do the multitudes of Kansas Reflector readers who have attended our town halls, sent along email messages of support and opened our newsletters every morning. So does the recognition that we all of us share the gift of existence, forming another link on the great chain of human life from the far past to the distant future.
An small, ceramic urn of my mother’s ashes sits on a bookcase in our living room. When I told my son that I was going to write about his graduation, and that I was sad his grandmother couldn’t be there, he replied immediately.
“She could have been there,” he said. “You just needed to carry her in.”
I chuckled, but of course he was right. I could have. I just wasn’t looking at the situation the right way.
Amid whatever mourning and grief we carry right now, let’s find a way to celebrate milestones while remembering those who brought us here. And may that whole ball of emotion, bound together by love, bounce us into whatever future comes.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio continues to rank terribly in nearly every way possible, according to the latest state rankings from the U.S. News & World Report.
The Buckeye State slid two more spots in the report’s latest rankings of the 50 states, moving from No. 36 in the 2023 report to No. 38 in the latest iteration.
In addition to ranking No. 38 overall, Ohio also ranks No. 41 in natural environment, No. 41 in higher education, No. 39 in economy, No. 34 in health care, No. 30 in crime and corrections, No. 30 in education overall, No. 30 in infrastructure, and No. 25 in fiscal stability.
On only one metric, opportunity, does Ohio crack the top half of states, at No. 17.
The U.S. News & World Report has been ranking the states since 2017, and Ohio has bounced around the bottom states in America that entire time.
In 2017, we were No. 35. In 2018, we dropped to No. 40. The year of 2019 saw us roaring back to No. 39. After no rankings in 2020, we came in at No. 36 in 2021 and climbed mightily to No. 34 by 2023 before dropping back down to No. 36 last year and now No. 38 this year.
Before anyone starts howling with indignation about how horribly unfair and biased the U.S. News & World Report must be, I’ll note that the No. 1 ranked state for three years running is Utah — not exactly a bastion of crunchy liberal thinking.
So no, these aren’t politicized rankings: Ohio’s elected leaders fully earned this pathetic spot for our state via their poisonous politics and terrible policies and priorities.
Ohio politicians don’t need to worry though. Ohio voters seem determined to give them all endless free passes to do whatever they want no matter how atrocious the outcomes or rampant the corruption.
I assume their cushy careers will all be fine no matter how terribly Ohio does by every available metric, as long as they put the right party label next to their name on the ballot given whatever their geographic location. Actions don’t matter. Outcomes don’t matter. Rampant corruption doesn’t matter. Only partisan politics matters. Right?
Let’s take a look at some of those outcomes.
On the issue of crime, for corrections outcomes, Ohio ranks No. 46. On public safety, No. 22. Our incarceration and juvenile incarceration rates are both above the national average, but the violent crime rate is below the national average.
On the economy, we rank No. 30 for business environment, No. 43 for employment, and No. 36 for growth. Our venture capital investment, migration from other states, and job growth numbers all fall below the national average.
In education, our pre-K-12 ranks No. 15, while higher education ranks No. 41. Our student debt at graduation is higher than the national average, but so is our high school graduation rate and math scores.
Back in 2010, Ohio was ranked by Education Week as having the 5th best public school system in the nation. We’ve fallen far, and state lawmakers are looking at abandoning the Fair School Funding Plan, so who knows what that will do. School districts are already struggling mightily, with Akron for instance looking at $44 million worth of cuts. Being No. 15 in K-12 right now isn’t a point of pride or reason for optimism.
On fiscal stability, Ohio’s long-term outlook ranks No. 16, most likely because we have around $3.7 billion sitting in our rainy day fund. The short-term outlook isn’t so hot though, ranking No. 40 among the states, with our liquidity still well below the national average.
Health care is all pretty terrible for Ohio. We rank No. 40 in public health, No. 36 in health care access, and No. 28 in health care quality. Access to health care is set to take an enormous tumble if President Trump and Republicans in Congress pass the enormous Medicaid cuts they want.
More than 1 in 4 Ohioans rely on Medicaid – including 40% of children, 20% of working-age adults, and 10% of seniors. Hundreds of thousands of Ohioans stand to lose their health insurance under the Trump Republican cuts. Right now about 8.4% of Ohioans don’t have health insurance. That number is poised to skyrocket under the Trump plan. Again though, please rest assured, in case you were worried, the wealthy and well-connected will continue to do fabulously well.
In infrastructure, at No. 30 overall, Ohio ranks No. 15 in transportation, but comes in at No. 30 for internet access, and No. 32 for energy.
On natural environment, we rank No. 24 on air and water quality, but No. 45 for pollution.
As far as opportunity, Ohio is affordable, ranking No. 16. However, things get worse when it comes to equality, ranking No. 21. They fall off a cliff when it comes to economic opportunity, ranking at No. 38.
These rankings don’t capture some other things of note. For instance, 1.8 million Ohioans are food insecure. That’s out of a population of 11.88 million, which means more than 15% of our population is regularly going hungry. Data from Feeding America shows 1 in 5 Ohio children live in homes that are food insecure. Ohio is also among the top eight states for worst infant mortality.
Taken all-in-all, while there might not be much opportunity to improve your lot in Ohio, at least it’s a vaguely affordable place to stagnate in poverty.
We might have a lot of infant deaths, low incomes, hungry children and families, a lack of health care access, poor public health outcomes, horrible pollution, pathetic corrections, a bad employment situation, a bad energy situation, dim prospects for growth, worsening higher education, and disinvestment from public schools, but at least we have… middling prospects for long-term fiscal stability.
Congratulations, Ohio. We’re No. 38. We’re No. 38.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Fire Administration)Almost three months after the Federal Emergency Management Agency abruptly canceled classes at the National Fire Academy, saying it would only support mission-critical functions, someone at FEMA apparently decided that fire training is critical to the agency’s mission.
FEMA announced Thursday that classes would resume June 2 at its “national schoolhouses”: the National Fire Academy and the National Disaster and Emergency Management University, both in Emmitsburg, and the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama.
Classes at all three had been canceled abruptly and without explanation in an email on March 7, a Friday, that said programs were suspended effective immediately and that the cancellations would remain in place indefinitely.
But in Thursday’s announcement, FEMA and the U.S. Fire Administration said they had “determined certain courses provide effective training to enhance national readiness for state, local, tribal and territorial emergency managers, first responders and local leaders. FEMA’s principles for emergency management assert that disasters are best managed when they’re federally supported, state managed and locally executed.”

More than 60 members of Congress — including every Democrat in the Maryland delegation — wrote to the head of FEMA and to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on March 17, demanding to know why the center had been closed and when they would reopen. They never got an answer to their letter, but Thursday’s reopening announcement said the closing ordered as part of the work of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Service.
The shutdown was in response to a Feb. 26 executive order from President Donald Trump on “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative, to ensure alignment with the Administration’s priority of good use of taxpayer funds.” It came in the early, heady days of DOGE, when grants and payments were suspended and programs put on ice, before courts stepped in and started slowing or reversing DOGE actions.
Even though they never got an answer to their letter, Maryland lawmakers welcomed the news Thursday that the fire academy would soon be back in business.
“I am happy to share that programming will be resuming immediately for dedicated fire fighters and first responders from around the nation,” said Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th). “The rash decision to close the academy wasted valuable resources and undermined our communities’ safety, resilience, and response efforts. ”
McClain Delaney, whose district include the academy, called the original closure “senseless.” That was echoed by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in a joint statement on the reopening.
“The Trump Administration’s decision to abruptly cancel these classes made no sense – and what’s more, it risked significant harm to our communities and those who protect them,” Van Hollen’s statement said. “While the good work done by the men and women [of the] National Fire Academy never should have been halted, I’m glad to see the Administration has heeded our calls to lift this senseless ban.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/firefighters-24.3000x2000-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
 New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
 Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
Oregon bill would implement protections for Uber, Lyft drivers

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

Wes Moore (D) will allow a handful of bills to become law without his signature rather than issue vetoes. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A bill meant to regulate so-called “earned wage access” loans for the first time in Maryland will become law without the governor’s signature and over the objections of a coalition that strongly opposed it.
House Bill 1294 is one of a handful of bills that Gov. Wes Moore (D) will allow to become law without his signature, including a measure to clarify provisions of a clean-energy building standard and other to increase oversight of the Department of Information Technology. Moore cited beneficial elements for each bill, but also pointed to provisions that were potentially troublesome, leading him to withhold his signature.
The bills are the last gasp of a month in which the governor signed almost 800 bills from the 2025 General Assembly into law and they come a week after he announced vetoes of 23 measures, including his controversial veto of a bill to create a commission to study possible reparations. Lawmakers are expected to override that veto, if not others.
In Maryland, there is no pocket veto for the governor, who must veto a bill to reject it. Of the left-over bills, the most contentious may have been HB1294, which aims to regulate “earned wage access” programs that advance workers money they have earned but have not yet received, then requires them to pay it back with interest.
Critics say the bill as drafted exempts app-based lenders from state laws that “prohibit lending that is discriminatory, is deceptive, or carries extremely high interest rates.” The Center for Responsible Lending said in a statement that the new law makes it easier for Marylanders to be sucked into “financial quicksand” because of payday loan apps.
“The bill becoming law but without the governor’s signature is indicative of serious, widespread concerns about these payday loan apps, including from the governor’s administration,” said Whitney Barkley, deputy director of state policy and senior policy counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending.
Moore to veto reparations bill, one of a list of measures he will reject

The center was part of a coalition of more than three dozen advocates, including the NAACP Maryland State Conference, that had urged Moore to veto the bill.
Earned wage access programs typically come in two versions – one offered by employers to their employees and another offered by private companies directly to workers. The loan is typically paid back through automatic deductions, usually with a fee or “tip.”
Opponents said the tips are finance charges. Often those charges exceed 300% interest, higher than the state’s 33% limit. They said the new law “removes the best defense against predatory lending” in Maryland.
In a letter explaining his decision, the governor said early access to earned wages can “provide a tangible benefit to workers” with unexpected expenses such as flat tires, medical copays and veterinarian bills.
While he commended lawmakers, including House Economic Matters Chair Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), for “advancing a path on regulating these products,” Moore also acknowledged concerns with the bill.
Roughly 345,000 residents used wage access apps more than 11 million times between 2019 and 2024, in transactions totaling about $108 million. Nearly one in four accessed the service every two weeks, “suggesting habitual use,” Moore wrote. About half pay “expedited fees.”
Those who default on the loans tend to be 65 or older, earning less than $50,000 a year and users tend to live “in the lowest income communities in the state,” Moore wrote, adding that “protections are warranted.”
He called for a cap on amounts that can be borrowed from a single or multiple lenders, and said the law should not exempt lenders from existing commercial financial protection laws. Finally, soliciting a tip for a loan “is inappropriate,” Moore wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The governor also took a pass on House Bill 49, which would help clarify key provisions of the Building Energy Performance Standards. Some building owners could receive credits, including for generating renewable energy on-site.
The bill was requested by the Department of the Environment, Moore withheld his signature over changes made by the legislature. In a letter explaining his decision, Moore cited “constrained (budget) resources” and “significant operational challenges” for the department, which must implement the law.
“And overall, this bill, as amended by the General Assembly, undermines the Department’s regulatory flexibility to meet the climate goals set out in the Climate Solutions Now Act,” Moore wrote.
The bill, as requested by the department, was intended to provide flexibility to building owners who must comply with electrification requirements and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Failure to do so will result in fees — some as much as $600,000 for poor performing buildings — levied by the Maryland Department of the Environment.
But lawmakers amended the bill to exempt hospitals and some manufacturing facilities. Also exempted are emissions associated with steam sterilization and back-up generators at medical facilities, nursing homes and laboratories.
Senate committee considers taming IT department as part of ongoing budget effort

Moore said he is also “concerned with the study requirement included in the bill,” which calls on the department to analyze other potential changes to the BEPS program. The governor said the amended bill “introduces uncertainty into an already complex regulatory effort … It is not clear that the expectations of this study can be met by the department, given the fiscal constraints and timeline challenges the law has put in place.”
Moore will also allow House Bill 738 and Senate Bill 705 to become law without his signature.
The identical bills — sponsored by Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery) and Sens. Sens. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) and Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) — aim to refocus the Department of Information Technology on major projects and ensure compliance with auditors’ recommendations.
The law imposes new oversight and reporting requirements on a department who has come under fire from lawmakers and the Office of Legislative Audits. One top lawmaker characterized the agency as a money pit.
A key part of the bill expands and defines the responsibilities of the department secretary on oversight of major IT projects, and it bars the department from contracting for IT services or products that are not consistent with its master plan. The law also requires the department secretary to meet quarterly with the chief information officer of agencies or departments with planned or ongoing IT projects.
It also sets up an expert panel to advise the legislature on IT issues and requires the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Health and Government Operations committees to convene a work group to evaluate the bill and other potential changes. The work group will determine if other actions are needed to resolve issues raised by the auditor.
Moore, in a three-page letter, said he agreed that changes needed to be made to how major information technology projects are overseen. But while the bills are “well-intended,” he said “many of its provisions recycle ineffective policies from the past, mirror reforms that are already underway or are overly prescriptive.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0377-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 04:02:36.456339

Glenn Ivey (D-4th), who represents the district where Kilmar Abrego Garcia and his wife live, led the chant “bring him home” outside the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt last Friday, before a hearing in Abrego Garcia’s case. (Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) will travel to El Salvador on Friday in hopes of checking in on one of his constituents, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the undocumented immigrant who has been held by authorities there since mid-March at the direction of the Trump administration.
Ivey’s spokesperson, Ramon Korionoff, said Thursday evening that the congressman is scheduled to meet with individuals from human rights and other nongovernmental organizations and that he hopes to meet with Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa  to discuss Abrego Garcia’s case. Ulloa and Ivey met more than two years ago, Korionoff said.
“It’s a fluid situation because it’s a weekend, so we’re trying to get all these appointments. A lot of them are happening on Monday,” Korionoff said. “We’re trying to use all avenues, both diplomatically and with volunteer organizations to secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.”
He said Ivey will be accompanied on the trip by labor union representatives — Abrego Garcia was an apprentice sheet metal worker in a local union when he was arrested March 12 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, has been shielded from deportation since 2019, when a U.S. immigration judge said that sending him back to El Salvador could put his life at risk from the gangs there that caused him to flee the country in the first place. He was living in Beltsville with his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, and their child when he was detained on March 12 by ICE agents while driving with his 5-year-old son.
The ICE agents told him only that his “status had changed,” according to court filings. Those documents said Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, “was called and instructed to appear at their location within ten minutes to get her five-year old son, A.A.V.; otherwise, the ICE officers threatened that the child would be handed over to Child Protective Services.”

Three days later, on March 15, Abrego Garcia was placed on one of three deportation flights to El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele had agreed to house U.S. deportees at his country’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in exchange for millions in payments from the U.S.
ICE and Justice Department officials later admitted in separate court filings that Abrego Garcia’s deportation to CECOT was an “administrative error” under the 2019 court order protecting him. But they insist Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, even though he and his supporters deny it and he has never been charged criminally. At an April meeting in the White House between Bukele and President Donald Trump, both presidents claimed they did not have the authority to ask the other to release Abrego Garcia.
Attorneys for Abrego Garcia, meanwhile, claim he was denied his due process rights and courts have largely agreed. That includes the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered the Trump administration in April to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia.
While he has been moved out of CECOT to a less-restrictive prison, however, he remains in custody in El Salvador. His attorneys, and lower court judges, have accused government officials of dragging their feet in efforts to return Abrego Garcia.
At a hearing last Friday before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, attorneys for the government argued that they could not provide some information about Abrego Garcia’s case because it is protected by the “state secrets” privilege — a claim Xinis appeared skeptical of.
Department of Justice attorney Jonathan D. Guynn said during that hearing at the federal courthouse in Greenbelt that the Trump administration is complying with court orders in the case. But even if Abrego Garcia was brought back tomorrow, he said, the government would seek to hold him or deport him again.
“He’ll never walk free in the United States,” Guynn said.
One of the attorneys for Abrego Garcia, Andrew J. Rossman, said at the hearing it’s “deeply disturbing” that administration officials, including the president, have made public statements that contradict court orders directing the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.
Prior to the hearing, Ivey joined Abrego Garcia’s family and other supporters outside the federal courthouse in Greenbelt.
Ivey is not the first U.S. politician traveling to El Salvador on Abrego Garcia’s behalf.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) spent several days in El Salvador in April, seeking to meet with Abrego Garcia and Bukele. He was brushed off until the last day, when Van Hollen got to meet Abrego Garcia in a stage-managed meeting in a hotel lobby.
Van Hollen’s trip was almost immediately by a trip by four Democratic House members who traveled on their own after they failed to persuade the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee to schedule an official committee trip to investigate Abrego Garcia’s case.
Korionoff said Ivey’s trip this weekend is another opportunity to keep “the spotlight on this issue.”
“It’s important to the constituents that the congressmen highlight this situation and assure the American people that we’re not going to give up on this guy, just like we won’t give up on anybody else who hasn’t had their due process rights,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/img_4879-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 04:02:36.456339
,California,2025-05-23 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s high living costs and high poverty sharpen its  economic divide,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/california-living-costs-poverty/,"California went from being a state with high economic mobility and opportunity to a society starkly separated by wealth, income and race.","Forty years ago, I wrote a series of 14 articles for the Sacramento Bee describing major economic, social, cultural and political trends coursing through California as the 20th century was drawing to a close.
One theme of the series, which later became a book, was the transformation of California from a state with high economic and social mobility to one of relatively rigid classes defined by ethnicity, education, incomes and wealth.
I quoted two researchers, Leon Bouvier and Philip Martin, who had projected California’s future as “the possible emerging of a two-tier economy with Asians and non-Hispanic whites competing for high-status positions while Hispanics and blacks struggle to get the low-paying service jobs.”
Unfortunately their analysis turned out to be quite accurate.
California has the nation’s highest rate of poverty as defined by the Census Bureau when it includes the cost of living in its calculations — 18.9% in 2023, or more than 7 million people.
Additional research by the Public Policy Institute of California revealed that 31.1% of Californians were living in or near poverty in 2023;  more than half  that group is Latino and another 13.6% is Black.
Furthermore, the poverty rate among undocumented immigrants was 29.6%. And, unsurprisingly, Californians without high school diplomas were almost four times more likely than college-educated Californians to be poor. 
High poverty rates underscore the fact that Californians’ costs for housing, utilities, fuel and other necessities of life are among the nation’s highest. In some high-cost counties, California’s housing department considers adults making more than $100,000 a year to be poor in terms of qualifying for housing assistance.
Being poor from an income standpoint has another aspect that hasn’t gotten as much attention — the even starker stratification of Californians by wealth.
There’s a logical connection between the two. Low family income and high living costs make it more difficult to buy a home, contribute to retirement accounts and otherwise acquire what’s known as generational wealth — assets that can grow and be passed down to heirs.
The Public Policy Institute of California also has delved into that aspect of Californians’ personal finances.
“Wealth creation is of particular concern in California, where high costs of living, high poverty rates, and a shortage of housing all exacerbate the challenges of building up assets,” PPIC researchers Tess Thorman and Shannon McConville write in their new study. “But while Californians keenly feel the barriers to building wealth, many have only a broad sense that the experience is shared, and relatively little research has explored this important component of economic well-being in the state.”
While overall, Californians’ net worths (assets minus debts) are about 50% higher than those of other states, thanks in part to California’s high housing values, low wealth is concentrated in Latino and Black households, corresponding to lower levels of education.
“Homeownership rates and equity are low among Latino households, driven largely by their younger age profile and lower education levels,” the study found. “In contrast, Black/other homeownership rates are low even after we account for factors like age, income, and education levels.
“While three in four households owe some money on unsecured debts (those without collateral), like credit cards, student loans, and/or medical bills,” the report continues, “older households are less likely than others to hold any unsecured debt, as are white, Asian, and immigrant households. Latino households are more likely to carry credit card debt and Black/other and Latino households are more likely to carry education-related debt than white and Asian households.”
So there it is, another confirmation that California has, indeed, become a highly stratified society — the perhaps unchangeable reality of a state whose political leadership still insists that it is a model for the world.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/011723-LA-Homelessness-Inequality-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 04:02:36.456339

Loudermilk was the featured speaker for a weekly breakfast meeting series for local conservatives.
But Loudermilk says he has no plans to take part in a traditional town hall meeting with constituents.
“We don’t right now,” he said in the IHOP parking lot. “I’m out in the community continuously doing things like this meeting. The town halls we’re doing have been pretty open. So we just haven’t had any of those old traditional town halls because they have not been productive. It’s usually just a chance for people to come in and take over and scream and holler and so we found it more productive to do more smaller venues such as what I’m doing here.”
Some of Loudermilk’s Georgia Congressional colleagues have first-hand experience with disruptive town hall participants. A tense Roswell town hall for Republican Congressman Rich McCormick of Suwanee helped spur GOP leadership to call on members to tamp down in-person town halls.
Last month, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Rome went ahead with plans for an Acworth town hall, which turned Jerry Springer-esque when multiple protesters were dragged out, shocked with a Taser and arrested.
Georgia’s Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock faced hecklers at a recent Atlanta town hall, who shouted over him for several minutes in opposition of the senator’s vote to sell weapons for Israel to use in Gaza, and fellow Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff faced civil but tense questioning from fired federal workers who questioned his commitment to fighting for them. Similar scenes have played out across the country.
Still, it would be hard to characterize the IHOP get-together as “pretty open.” It was not advertised and an organizer refused to open the meeting to a reporter.
In an email to invitees, the organizer, who did not respond to a request to comment, described the breakfasts as “a shelter in the midst of the storm, a sanctuary, a place of refuge where political points are often fine-tuned, where opposing views are often shared by those elected and candidates alike. We lift high the banner of ethical behavior and encourage building a good reputation upon merit.”
“When, ‘It’s time to begin,’ freewheeling conversations gives way to ‘updates,’ from Elected and Appointed Officials, Candidates, Lobbyists, Special Groups and Committees, Political Parties, eventually: everyone who wants to share with positive input. So, if you are a positive thinking, politically motivated conservative and looking for a place of encouragement come join us!” the email continues.

Earlier this month, Cherokee County Democrats held a mock town hall featuring a cardboard cutout of Waldo, the hard-to-find world traveler from the Where’s Waldo books, with Loudermilk’s face.
Waleska resident Genevieve Hutchings said she’s been trying to get in touch with Loudermilk for months and wants him to host a public town hall.
“That’s divisive for our county and for our country, if that’s his stance, that he’s only going to meet the people that agree with him,” she said. “And how could he possibly govern in a way that’s going to be helpful to all of those constituents if he doesn’t hear from all of them?”
Hutchings was one of a few dozen protesters in downtown Woodstock on a rainy weekend as part of the progressive Indivisible movement, which has hosted larger protests outside Loudermilk’s office.
Further down the road, Woodstock resident John Thomas held a one-man counterprotest, holding up a sign with the Trump-Vance logo atop a pair of garden gnomes.

Thomas said he expects to see members of Congress host town halls as well.
“America was founded on, you know, stump speeches and people standing out there and taking questions and answering questions from all sides. And how else can we, Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike, get a message out and get people to understand our side of the debate, unless we’re out there talking to both sides of the aisle?”
The Recorder reached out to the offices of each of Georgia’s 14 members of Congress about recent or future town halls. Representatives for Greene, and Democrats Nikema Williams of Atlanta and Hank Johnson of Lithonia responded.
Greene’s office cited her recent Acworth town hall and said she hosts multiple such events per year. Williams’ staff sent a list of recent public events, including a traditional town hall in March and other smaller-scale meetings with constituents. Johnson’s office said the Congressman has been hosting regular in-person and streamed events, with the next public town hall scheduled for May 28 in Lawrenceville.
“These are your bosses”
With most of Georgia’s congressional districts safe for either party, politicians are unlikely to face a real threat from the other side, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. That means there’s no real incentive for most politicians to face the heat from constituents on the opposite political wavelength.
“I think that would be their assessment, that there’s nothing to be gained from it, that the people who would show up and protest are not going to vote for them under any circumstance,” he said. “Therefore, they figure that their credentials are good for the kinds of voters who would show up in a Republican primary – if they were to get primaried, and certainly incumbents often are not, or at least don’t draw serious opponents. So I don’t think they’re going to be worried about the fact that there may be some media story saying, ‘why aren’t they holding town halls?’”
Democratic members of Congress dealt with the same dynamic when President Barack Obama was in the White House, said Kennesaw State University political science professor and former Cobb County GOP Chair Jason Shepherd.
“This has been kind of going on for a few years now, and Democrats saw this with Obamacare back in 2010 with Democrat members of Congress being shouted down,” he said. “Now we see it with Republicans, and it makes it impossible for actual constituents, because let’s face it, a lot of times the people who show up to town halls and disrupt things don’t even live in the district, can’t even vote for the member of Congress.”
Shepherd said it makes sense for politicians to try to avoid shouty town halls or to replace them with streamed events with pre-screened questions, but doing so is anti-democratic.
“This is part of our democracy,” he said. “You’re not only going up in front of voters every two or six years, but these are your bosses. These are the people whose taxes pay your paycheck.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative committee on Thursday advanced the governor’s two appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, but just one secured the committee’s support before heading to the full Legislature.
The roughly three-hour confirmation hearing and 15-minute executive session to consider and vote on the appointments came just 48 hours after the defeat of Legislative Bill 677 to provide additional guardrails to the commission. That bill sought to aid implementation of the voter-approved laws and delay a July 1 deadline for rules and regulations to be in place.

Gov. Jim Pillen, who opposed the ballot measures legalizing and regulating medical cannabis, appointed Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, prevention director at Heartland Family Service in Omaha, to the commission.
The General Affairs Committee voted 5-2, with one member “present, not voting,” to recommend Oldenburg but tied 4-4 on favorably advancing Mueting.
Under legislative rules, all gubernatorial appointments reach the full Legislature anyway. Committees can recommend to approve or reject an appointment, or lawmakers can make no recommendation, which happens in the event of a tie. 
Either appointee would need 25 votes to be confirmed to a six-year term. They would join the members of the Liquor Control Commission, whom voters also placed on the Medical Cannabis Commission: Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, Harry Hoch Jr. of Omaha and Kim Lowe of Kearney. Liquor commissioners, too, are appointees of the governor. Hoch’s term ends Saturday.
Appointee backgrounds
Mueting said her role as a prevention specialist for 24 years has been to prevent people from having problems with alcohol and other substances. She said she has looked at medical cannabis from a “360-degree view,” and as a self-described “solutions-focused” person, she said she views the Nebraska medical laws as helping patients with “debilitating” health conditions.
“Helping to guide the rulemaking process around the needs of the people it’s intended to serve is my goal,” Mueting said. “There’s nothing about that goal that says we need to sacrifice public health and safety to attain it.”

Mueting has a psychology and health promotion management degree from Hastings College and has a master’s degree in kinesiology from Kansas State University.
Oldenburg said she is “not a prohibitionist” of cannabis but is “pro-research.” She said cannabis has “a place in pain management” for certain ailments that cause suffering.
“Nebraska needs to seize the opportunity to be slow and deliberate in the manner in which we determine how best to designate appropriate conditions for medical cannabis and regulate those entities that will dispense medical cannabis in our state,” Oldenburg said. “I look forward to working with various parties to ensure that we in the State of Nebraska get this right.”
Oldenburg graduated from the University of Dallas with a degree in biochemistry and chemistry before getting her medical degree from Creighton University. She has been an anesthesiologist for 18 years, first in Colorado and returning to Nebraska in 2017 with her family. 
Part of the move, she said, was because of how the “evolution” of medicinal to recreational marijuana went in Colorado. She said there weren’t many medical regulations at the start.
Pillen has described the women as “experienced, well-qualified individuals” who would ensure strong regulations “to the letter of the law the people of Nebraska enacted.” He and other LB 677 opponents, such as State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, say the commission can meet its July 1 deadline.
Oldenburg declined to talk with the Nebraska Examiner prior to the Thursday hearing. Mueting did not respond to repeated requests for comment before or after the hearing.
Committee member ties
Of the appointees, Oldenburg said she was encouraged to apply by Storm, a member of the General Affairs Committee, who called and asked if she had considered the position.
Mueting listed Storm as a personal reference on her application to the governor. Under legislative questioning, Mueting at first said she didn’t know “exactly how the governor got my name” before clarifying she applied. She said she didn’t know appointments would go before the General Affairs Committee, just that full legislative approval was needed in the end.
During the closed-door executive session, which is open to reporters, Storm defended the appointees and said they showed up for a hostile and intimidating environment.

State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue spoke for the first time to criticize what he viewed as a conflict of interest. Storm said the application process was public and flipped the question on Rountree and other committee members for not reaching out to possible applicants, too.
In addition to Mueting and Oldenburg, Pillen interviewed Erin Bone, a prevention specialist in North Platte. The governor did not interview a fourth applicant: Ogallala City Manager Kevin Wilkins, according to records shared with the Examiner.
Mueting and Oldenburg are registered Republicans. Bone is a registered Democrat. Wilkins is a registered nonpartisan.
During Tuesday’s debate on LB 677, Storm acknowledged he had talked with Mueting but said he hadn’t talked about the bill with Mueting. 
Mueting, when she testified against LB 677 in March, answered questions from Storm about what she’d like to see from medical cannabis in Nebraska. Her answer included limiting allowable forms of cannabis (not smoking or vaping), limiting qualifying conditions and placing restrictions on tetrahydrocannabidiol potency, serving size or servings per package in cannabis products.
Mueting was “neutral” on a Storm bill, LB 483, to reduce the allowable possession down to 300 milligrams, 0.21% of what voters approved, and only allow pills or tinctures for the medicine.
Need for neutrality?
Much of Thursday’s hearing focused on opposition to the appointments because Oldenburg and Mueting have both consistently opposed the legislative proposals that long-time medical cannabis advocates in Nebraska have supported in the Legislature.
Oldenburg testified against proposals in 2018, 2019 and 2021, while Mueting opposed legislation in 2019, 2021, 2023 and 2025.
‘Absolute failure’: Medical cannabis regulatory bill stalls in Nebraska Legislature

After more than a decade of legislative attempts, advocates succeeded last fall by ballot measure at legalizing up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation. “Exclusive” regulatory authority is vested in the Medical Cannabis Commission, per voter directive.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which led the campaign, said the appointments seemed like a “calculated act” by Pillen. She said lawmakers have an “ethical responsibility” to approve individuals committed to the program’s success, “not its obstruction.”
“I don’t think an arsonist should be in charge of the fire department,” Eggers testified.
Cavanaugh asked whether that meant Eggers should be appointed. She said, “Absolutely not.”
“I do not believe that this commission should be made up of anyone that has spent time, energy, in their personal or professional capacity, being opposed or supportive to this,” Eggers said.
‘Derail, stall and sabotage’
Shelly Gillen of Bellevue, testifying on behalf of her 23-year-old son Will, said that for people “enamored” with requiring U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval first — as has been the consistent policy for Mueting’s Heartland Family Service — Gillen said those people should ask what FDA-approved meds have done to Will Gillen, making him “an innocent, unintentional addict.”
“We were told by a neurologist that weaning him off one of his meds would be similar to weaning off someone on heroin. FDA-approved meds landed him in the hospital for two weeks in complete somnolence that made him develop pneumonia and silent aspiration on his own saliva,” Gillen testified.

The Gillens were among the first families to consistently fight for medical cannabis, back to 2015 legislation from former State Sen. Sue Crawford of Bellevue. Mueting supported that bill.
Gillen said there was “no doubt in my mind” that the appointees would “do everything they can to derail, stall and sabotage access to medical cannabis for as many patients as possible.”
Angelica Marsaglia of Lincoln, who would benefit from medical cannabis, opposed both appointees and noted Mueting is part of an organization in part to help addicts. Marsaglia urged senators to see patients and “please hear us.”
“We are not addicts. We are medical patients,” Marsaglia said. “We just want access to a plant, a plant that grows freely and only the government has made illegal.”
Law enforcement angle
Maggie Ballard and Mary O’Neill, both of Heartland Family Service, defended Mueting, as did Sarpy County Sheriff Greg London.
London attested to Mueting’s character and integrity and said she’s “perfect” for the appointment because she understands the importance of rules and regulations. London was one of 53 sheriffs to join Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers in opposition to LB 677.
The AG’s Office has vowed to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission if it begins licensing medical cannabis dispensaries, which could begin by Oct. 1 under the laws. 
Advisement to law enforcement is still a “work in progress” when it comes to medical cannabis, London said, and he argued no one has a medical cannabis recommendation card yet.

“I’ve met at least one,” Cavanaugh said.
“Oh. Congratulations,” London responded.
Keith County Attorney Randy Fair, in his personal capacity, said that while both appointees may be very good people, he said appointees should be neutral-minded individuals who can support good regulations.
Fair said that cops will do the same thing they do now during traffic stops: Pull people over now if they smell marijuana for probable cause, search vehicles and issue arrests or tickets if people have more than 5 ounces of marijuana, or not if someone has a recommendation.
“We don’t try to arrest tons of people for that because, quite frankly, it would be a waste of resources,” Fair said. “I do think that a lot of these concerns are blown over.”
It would be Fair’s “ethical duty,” he said, not to prosecute someone unless they have actually violated the laws of Nebraska.
‘One of the biggest hearts’
Ballard said she’s served on Heartland Family Service’s prevention team with Mueting for 11 of Ballard’s 13 years with the organization. When learning that there might have been an overflow room because of widespread opposition, Ballard said, “Honestly, that hurts my heart.”

While Mueting and Ballard have different backgrounds and don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, Ballard added, Mueting “has one of the biggest hearts of anyone I’ve ever met.”
“I just can’t think of anyone better than her to serve on this commission, because she will do a very good job of balancing public health and public safety against people who need help with their debilitating conditions,” Ballard said.
Ballard and Mueting said voters have spoken, despite the Heartland Family Service position. Ballard said her coworker’s job would be to oversee and “try to do things as well as possible and not to just bang her head against the wall saying, ‘No, we can’t do this here.’”
“That’s not practical, and it’s not in Lorelle’s nature either,” Ballard continued.
Nothing in the law requires “debilitating” conditions, Cavanaugh noted. Any health care practitioner, including out-of-state, can recommend cannabis if they feel a patient could benefit.
‘I don’t have the power’
While no one spoke in favor of Oldenburg’s appointment, multiple senators said after the hearing that they were impressed with her credentials. State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, who opposed Mueting but supported Oldenburg, said there were some unfair shots taken at Oldenburg whose skill set he highlighted. He did not specify his reservations on Mueting’s appointment.

State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said he was “very impressed” by Mueting’s 24 years in the prevention field and that she was qualified for the role.
Mueting said she didn’t view her appointment as trying to “squash” the law, “because I don’t have the power to do that.” 
“My goal is not to make this harder for people,” Mueting said. “My goal is to put some rules around the substance as we were given in statute.”
Oldenburg noted that in residency, she was taught to never be afraid of prescribing opioids for patients’ pain, but that’s changed. She added that Nebraska can learn from other states in the interest of health, safety and well-being for a better program.
Multiple opponents of the appointees, including Angela Cornett of Norfolk, a nurse, said patients were tired of waiting, including for new research. Cornett said her mom was one of dozens of advocates who died waiting for possible relief over the past decade.
Oldenburg stayed for the whole hearing, but Mueting left after her invited witnesses testified. State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue said she had a previously scheduled appointment.
‘Obligation to protect society’
Cavanaugh grilled both appointees over what they view as the commission’s role, such as whether commissioners should list qualifying conditions, limit permissible forms of using cannabis, restrict how many dispensaries can be licensed and more.

Mueting and Oldenburg, noting they are “one of five” on the commission, said they didn’t know and weren’t attorneys. They said they would seek guidance as a team, though both said they opposed smoking as a form of using cannabis.
“I’m a law-abiding citizen of the State of Nebraska, and I have to follow the will of the people, and I have to follow the statutes,” Oldenburg said.
Andersen, who also opposed LB 677, criticized Cavanaugh’s line of questioning about Mueting’s personal views on medical cannabis and compared it to asking a public defender whether a client is guilty.
“They’re going to do a job and defend the person,” Andersen said.
“That’s a really good analogy,” Mueting responded.
Storm said that at the end of the day, he and others want to help Nebraskans in the right way.
“If cannabis can help people with ailments, we should do that, very much should do that,” Storm said. “But we have an obligation to protect society, and we can’t let this get out of control.”

All touted a message that immigrants and refugees were good for the state’s economy, workforce and growth. And as passing cars honked and gave thumbs up, the speakers proclaimed their words from a stage.
It was an intentionally blatant show of support, said Itzel Lopez of the Latino Economic Development Council, which helped Omaha Together One Community (OTOC) organize the event at la Plaza de la Raza on South 24th Street.
“We want to draw attention that, yes, it’s safe,” said Lopez. “That there are people in our community who truly care about the well being of immigrants in our state.”
Lopez, speaking to the crowd, admitted that she can’t help but worry herself about the fallout of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies. Though she has grown up in Omaha, has seen success in business, she is a DACA recipient without permanent legal status who finds herself “preoccupied with simply feeling safe.”
Reach congressional delegation
OTOC leader Denise Bowyer said the diverse speaking lineup representing business, labor, agriculture, faith and community groups was intended to push back against negative messages and restrictive policies initiated at the national level. She said the group wants their message to reach Nebraska’s congressional delegation and urged people to get louder and more active.
James Krenz, senior program director for the International Council for Refugees and Immigrants, said admissions for refugees are effectively suspended. He said the Trump administration views refugees as “a threat rather than a part of shared humanity.”

“What we see today is not normal,” he said, adding that quiet acceptance “allows injustices to persist.”
The rally was similar in spirit to one on the steps of the State Capitol in September, which drew more than 60 Nebraska organizations to announce a unified resolve to change state and federal policies to be more welcoming to immigrants and refugees.
Over the past four months, said Bowyer, people’s lives nationally and in Nebraska have been upended by executive orders, non-renewals of Temporary Protective Status and revocations of parole processes for people who entered the country with permission. OTOC is a religious-based network formed three decades ago to advocate for social justice issues.
Crack down 
Trump, who campaigned on the promise to crack down on immigration, has said he is enforcing national laws and that mass deportations and strict border security protect Americans and the country’s economic and social structures.

Anne Wurth, senior attorney at the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said challenges representing newcomers have compounded in the last few months. While Nebraska has not seen the large-scale enforcement raids of the past, or high-profile arrests as some other states, Wurth said foreign-born Nebraskans should know their rights and be “aware.”
From what her organization has seen across the state, Wurth said, immigration agents have focused on “stated enforcement priorities” — targeting people with prior removal orders and past criminal convictions.
She said her office has information that federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security ostensibly have been conducting “wellness checks” on young people who entered the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and were released to Nebraska sponsors.
No one to her knowledge has been detained, said Wurth. “But under this administration, those things can change.”

Heath Mello, president of the Greater Omaha Chamber, said his members hear daily from employers who are struggling to fill jobs. He said the business group believes immigration reform must be part of the state’s workforce solution.
“Smart, constructive immigration policy is not just the right thing to do — it’s good economics,” Mello said.
Sue Martin, president of the Nebraska AFL-CIO, said that without immigrants, America’s workforce would shrink, meaning decreased tax revenue.
John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, said Nebraska’s largest single industry, agriculture, struggles with workforce issues. He named pork producers, dairy producers, poultry producers, beef feedlots, seedcorn companies and the meatpacking industry and said all are dependent on immigrant labor.
Other speakers included Mustafa Babak, cofounder of the Afghan American Foundation, the Rev. Debra McKnight, founding pastor of Urban Abbey and Dawn Essink of OTOC.
Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the statewide Heartland Workers Center, said immigrant communities help Nebraska thrive.
“We are growing the food, building the homes, running big and small businesses, caring for families and keeping Nebraska moving forward.”

There is, however, a great deal of artifice.  
The book’s very authorship is a sham, according to its ghost writer Tony Schwartz, and Howard Kaminsky, the publisher, both of whom claim Trump played no role in the writing. 
In reality, Trump’s “art” of making deals amounts to bullying, intimidating, suing, extorting, bribing and lying to get what he wants, even though he most often fails.  
For instance, Trump says, “Deals work best when each side gets something it wants from the other.” (The Art of the Deal) But to gain leverage, Trump first makes threats or files lawsuits or imposes unfair penalties on his competitor; then he offers to withdraw the threat or penalty to get what he wants.  Sounds a lot like extortion, or like the quid pro quo he offered President Volodymyr Zelensky during his “perfect call,” when Trump withheld Congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky agreed, as a “favor,” to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son.
Likewise, in Trump’s second term, he prefaced “deals” with Canada and Mexico with the imposition of tariffs; or in the cases of Greenland and Panama, with threats of military force. 
In addition to threats and extortion, Trump also deals in lies and manipulation. “The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people’s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts.”
On the contrary, when a U.S. president plays with the faith of millions of voters like an unscrupulous used car salesman selling a “lemon” to a trusting customer, he’s inflicting suffering on an entire nation to further inflate his own ego and personal wealth. Indeed, rather than solving the problems he hyperbolically promised, he has only exacerbated them.  
Consider this campaign whopper: “When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One.” By slapping tariffs on other nations, he expected the world to fall at his feet and bend to his will.  Or as he graphically bragged, “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a–.” They are dying to make a deal, ‘Please, please, sir, make a deal.  I’ll do anything, sir!” 
[Note: whenever Trump quotes someone addressing him as “sir,” it’s a tell-tale sign he’s made up the entire encounter.] 
Then he compounded the lie, falsely claiming, “I’ve made 200 deals,” on tariffs.  First, there are only 195 countries in the world.  Second, it turns out Trump had made precisely no deals at that point.  In fact, he admitted that rather than negotiating deals, he was simply dictating terms: “We’re going to put very fair numbers down, and we’re going to say, here’s what this country, what we want. And congratulations, we have a deal.”
In other words, he’s made demands, not deals. 
Indeed, when he finally announced a so-called “deal” with a specific nation, the United Kingdom, it amounted to no deal at all.  The 10% tariff imposed on the UK before the deal remains at 10% after the deal, with further details to be negotiated.  But according to chief economist at RSM, Joe Bruseulas, “A trade agreement where the details are still being negotiated is not an agreement.” 
Trump’s economic dealings with China amount to more brags and bluff.  The President would have us believe that he imposed stratospheric tariffs on China based upon his alleged study of Chinese culture and thought. “I’ve read hundreds of books about China over the decades. I know the Chinese. I’ve made a lot of money with the Chinese. I understand the Chinese mind.”  
I assume this is more of his “truthful hyperbole” because it strains credibility that the man who can’t read security briefings has read hundreds of books on anything, much less China. And far from knowing the Chinese mind, he can’t even remember that China never blinked in the face of tariffs during his first administration.  Meanwhile his latest so-called “agreement” with China to reduce reciprocal tariffs returns the trade war to “square one.”
​But all of Trump’s deal-making bluff and bluster has cost American consumers more at the cash register, reduced investors’ life savings, and thrown a wrench of uncertainty into the complex machinery of the world economy.  Further, it has alienated our allies, and undermined our nation’s reputation, security, and status in the world.  [I will save for another day the cost of another of his hyperbolic promises: to “end the war in Ukraine “on day one.”]
Suffice it to say, that Trump’s “truthful hyperbole” amounts to the substance of Trump’s persona, character, and leadership. It is a euphemism for the lies he tells the American public. The truth is that Trump’s deal making, like the man, is more artifice than artful.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP-trump-art-of-deal.jpg,,,2025-05-23 01:00:22.340300
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 04:01:39+00:00,CT Mirror,Incentivizing CT’s air travel a better way,Tony Sheridan and Michael Shea,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/incentivizing-air-travel-a-better-way-tony/,Let the CT's dormant aviation fuel user fee go back into effect.,"The state legislature has rightly shown interest in taking steps to ensure that our state’s airports are well-served by a broad mix of airlines that meet the needs of our state’s leisure and business travelers. 
Air travel facilitates economic development, connecting our corporate community with business opportunities across the country and globe, and it provides easy access for tourists who wish to partake in our beautiful state. The Connecticut Airport Authority (CAA) airport system alone generates nearly $4 billion in total impact to the Connecticut economy, including support for over 25,000 jobs.
The question at hand is how to best nurture the vital aviation industry. 
Some airlines, led primarily by one of the state’s newest ultra-low-cost carriers, have lobbied aggressively for the elimination of the state’s aviation fuel user fee. Arguing that such a fee inhibits route growth, this lobbying effort resulted in the suspension of the state’s aviation fuel user fee for a period of two years with a scheduled return in July 2025 at a roughly 50% reduced rate (saving the airlines millions of dollars compared to the pre-2023 tax rate). 
As we approach the introduction of that reduced rate this July, some airlines and other interested parties are advocating to either permanently eliminate the fee or shift its proceeds to other entities. 
Here’s why that is short-sighted:
1) The aviation fuel user fee supports the operation and capital development of the CAA’s five general aviation (GA) airports. 
The CAA’s GA system operates at a deficit, as is common for GA systems across the country, but is maintained due to the significant economic impact that its facilities produce for the community. These airports (Danielson, Groton-New London, Hartford-Brainard, Waterbury-Oxford, and Windham) generate $409 million annually in total economic output, support 2,500 jobs, and generate over $15 million of state and local taxes. 
These GA airports support military operations, state emergency services, flight schools, business flights, recreational travel, and many other businesses. Commercial service airports generate adequate revenues that self-fund their own operations, and they therefore should not require subsidization from this revenue stream. 
If the aviation fuel user fee is eliminated or if the fee’s proceeds are diverted away from the CAA’s GA system, these airports will suffer from deteriorated infrastructure and the likely loss of services.
2) Connecticut is already a low-cost state for the airlines, as Bradley International has maintained an extremely competitive rate structure. 
Airlines use a standardized metric, cost per enplanement (CPE), to compare their costs at different airports. BDL’s CPE has been lower than other major airports in the region for the last eight fiscal years. In FY24, if BDL had adopted the rate structures in place at TF Green in Providence or Boston-Logan airports, the airlines would have paid the CAA an additional $3.3 million or $43.6 million, respectively. As a result of the CAA’s cost-consciousness, impressive airline growth has followed – including pre-2023 with the higher aviation fuel fee rate.
3) Connecticut compares favorably to the tax structures in place in other states. 
Some states, like Massachusetts, allow municipalities the ability to levy a 5% tax on aviation fuel. Ten states have lower “state aviation fuel fees,” but apply the state sales and use tax to aviation fuel sales. Some states impose separate environmental/inspection fees and taxes on aviation fuel. Connecticut allows none of these.
4) Arguments about the impact of a $0.15/gallon fee on airfares are overstated. 
In an analysis of the fuel burn for the longest-haul service of the state’s new budget airlines (Bradley International to San Juan Puerto Rico), the CAA found that the fee impact would equate to $2.73/seat. And that is an extreme example. Shorter-haul services would naturally result in less fuel burn and lower fee impacts.
There is, however, a more effective way to incentivize growth in Connecticut.
Airline incentivization should be targeted and limited, not broad and perpetual. Eliminating the aviation fuel user fee, at the expense of the GA airports, incentivizes all routes regardless of whether they meet a strategic need. The CAA incentivizes air carriers that launch service to unserved destinations via fee waivers and marketing assistance for a limited period of time to encourage BDL route network growth and help the airline build public awareness in a brand-new market.
The state has also wisely selected targeted destinations for incentives in the past, including Aer Lingus’ service to Dublin and, more recently, service to Montego Bay, Jamaica. These routes served strategic purposes, reestablishing nonstop transatlantic service and providing connectivity for the state’s large, proud Jamaican-American population.
We can and should do what it takes to promote the growth of passenger air travel in the state for the sake of our residents and corporate community alike. But we can achieve that growth through targeted incentives that are limited in duration and do not damage other critical components of our state’s economy.

One of the most promising solutions, supported by decades of evidence, is the  establishment of overdose prevention centers . These centers save lives and provide comprehensive support to people who use drugs.
Senate Bill 1285, An Act Establishing an Overdose Prevention Center Pilot Program, was recently absorbed into Senate Bill 7, An Act Concerning Protections For Access To Health Care And The Equitable Delivery Of Health Care Services In The State. In summary, the legislation proposes the opening of four overdose prevention centers across our state.
Despite the profound potential of overdose prevention centers to save lives, both Commissioner Manisha Juthani of the Department of Public Health (DPH) and Commissioner Nancy Navarretta of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) have hesitated to fully endorse this critical bill. The Statewide Harm Reduction Partnership believes it was disconcerting to see the lack of full support from key public health leaders.
Overdose prevention centers offer a wide range of services, including access to naloxone, drug checking, syringe exchange, wound care, and crucially, the prevention of overdoses themselves. Overdose prevention centers are also a key public health tool by providing wraparound services such as HIV prevention and treatment, mental health care, and connections to social supports.


Commissioner Juthani of DPH has professed a commitment to revitalizing public health in our state,particularly in addressing the opioid crisis. In her testimony, she importantly acknowledged at least one of the many benefits of overdose prevention centers, stating that the DPH “understands the policy interest for an overdose prevention center, as they create safer environments for people to use drugs, especially for higher-risk populations.” 
Despite this, she did not extend her full support or address the DPH’s responsibility to lead in this space. As a physician and public health leader, Juthani’s expertise is invaluable, and her full endorsement could significantly impact the success of Senate Bill 7. 
Similarly, Commissioner Navarretta of DMHAS, upon accepting the position as Commissioner, affirmed a commitment to supporting “those affected by the opioid epidemic by providing holistic, comprehensive, and effective services and supports that foster dignity, respect, and self-sufficiency in those we serve.” 
In her recent testimony, she astutely acknowledged “the important role harm reduction can play in an individual’s recovery journey.” However, her testimony also fell short of endorsing overdose prevention centers, instead pointing to the SafeSpot system as a harm reduction tool. While SafeSpot is indeed valuable, it cannot replace the comprehensive support offered by overdose prevention centers, nor can it serve some high risk populations effectively (e.g., unhoused or low income folks without access to phones, rural populations without service, etc.). 
As both the leader of addiction services in our state and as a clinical psychologist specializing in addiction and behavioral health, Commissioner Navaretta is uniquely positioned to advocate for evidence-based solutions to address the overdose crisis.
So, why were both Commissioners not supporting Senate Bill 1285, now merged into Senate Bill 7? Their testimonies discussed concerns about the legality of overdose prevention centers under federal law, citing the need for changes in federal statutes (i.e., 21 U.S. Code § 856) or a clear interpretation from the Department of Justice. However, Scott Burris, a leading legal scholar in public health law, has clarified that arguments claiming overdose prevention centers violate 21 U.S. Code § 856 are a matter of political opinion rather than legal certainty. While there is uncertainty in the federal landscape, this underscores why states must take the lead. 
Since the last time an overdose prevention center legislation was introduced in Connecticut, more than 2,000 residents have lost their lives. We cannot afford to wait any longer.
Our Statewide Harm Reduction Partnership has sent letters to both the commissioners of DPH and DMHAS, outlining the life-saving potential of overdose prevention centers and urging their full support for Senate Bill 1285, now Senate Bill 7. To date, no responses have been received from either office. 
While we certainly understand the implications supporting overdose prevention centers might have in this current political landscape, the silence from both commissioners is nonetheless concerning. We remain hopeful that a lack of response to our letter does not suggest a reluctance to engage with or support innovative approaches to addressing the overdose crisis. We stand firm in the belief that both commissioners are uniquely positioned to advocate for overdose prevention centers as evidence-based solutions that can address the overdose crisis.
While our coalition deeply appreciates the many current efforts championed by both the DPH and the DMHAS, Connecticut continues to lose too many lives to preventable overdose. Connecticut needs courageous leadership to address the overdose epidemic effectively. We urge Commissioners Juthani and Navarretta to reconsider their positions and fully support the establishment of overdose prevention centers. The evidence is clear: overdose prevention centers save lives and provide the dignity and support that individuals affected by the opioid crisis desperately need.
In the upcoming legislative vote on Senate Bill 7, we call on public health leaders, including Commissioners Juthani and Navarretta, to step up and support this essential initiative. The health and safety of our communities depend on it.

The Connecticut House of Representatives on Thursday night overwhelmingly approved a bill to overhaul the state’s towing law, making it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow.
After weeks of negotiations and just a few minutes of debate on the House floor, lawmakers said they came to a compromise with the towing industry. Two bills have been merged to include massive reforms to towing procedures from private property and rate increases for highway tows that typically follow car accidents.
“This bill is a result of months of collaboration and has the blessings of consumer protection advocates, towers themselves, municipal leaders, police chiefs, property owners,” said Transportation Committee co-chair Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, as she introduced the bill Thursday night. 
The bill had support from both sides of the political aisle and was approved 126 to 21.
“We all, many months ago, heard a lot about towing,” said Transportation Committee ranking member Rep. Kathy Kennedy, R-Milford. “Towing was all in the news, and all different things were happening. We are so far from that. Finally, I think we’ve put forward a good, solid bill.”
House Bill 7162 overhauls the state’s 100-year-old towing statutes and comes in response to an investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that showed how state towing laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of drivers. 
The news organizations found that Connecticut’s state law allowing the sale process to begin in 15 days is one of the shortest windows in the nation and has particularly impacted people with low incomes. Reporters also spoke with people who said the tower required them to pay in cash or wouldn’t allow them to get personal belongings out of their vehicle. Many couldn’t afford to get their towed vehicles back and lost transportation or jobs because of it.

The bill that passed the House Thursday night takes several steps to make it easier for people to get their towed vehicles back and requires towing companies to take more time and increase documentation during the sale process. 
It requires tow companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles quickly just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic, fire hydrants or parked in an accessible space.
Under the bill, towing companies can still start the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, but would now have to provide the owner with a chance to claim the vehicle. The DMV would be required to check whether the driver issued any complaints about the tow before approving the sale, and the tower would have to send the notice ahead of the sale to the registered owner and lienholders via certified mail, with receipts of delivery.
The actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
“The hope is that they’re exhausting all efforts to have the vehicle returned to the rightful owner before a sale is able to proceed,” said Transportation Committee co-chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, in an interview before the vote.
A spokesperson for the DMV could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday night. 
The bill would also establish a working group to study the best way to handle proceeds from the sales of towed vehicles. State law currently requires that towing companies hold profits in escrow for a year in case the vehicle owner claims them, then remit that money to the state, but CT Mirror and ProPublica found the DMV never set up a system for that process to occur.
The DMV would also have to work with the state’s attorney general to develop a consumer bill of rights on towing.
If companies are towing vehicles, they also have to be available to allow people to get their vehicles or personal property. In a story published earlier this month, CT Mirror and ProPublica reported that tow truck companies often hold onto people’s belongings to pressure them into paying their towing fees. 
Under the new law, drivers would be allowed to retrieve their belongings from the vehicle, even if they don’t pay the towing fees.
Timothy Vibert, president of the Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, could not be reached for comment Thursday night.
Cohen said in an interview that tow companies “are in recognition of the fact that something has to be done to protect against the bad actors in their industry.”
The bill next heads to the Senate for a vote, which Cohen said will likely be early next week.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4369-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 23:00:25.849078

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)An outdated calculation by the state education department and Gov. Dan McKee’s budget office last fall now leaves Rhode Island schools facing a $24 million budget shortfall.

“This is not your fault, but it is your problem,” Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat, told Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) officials at a legislative hearing Thursday. “It’s our problem.”
The discrepancy was driven by the data, or lack thereof, on low-income and multilingual learner students in the state. Both populations factor in the statewide education funding formula that determines aid to local school districts. 
The Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) generates enrollment numbers in March and October, using data provided by school districts. Typically, the governor’s budget office uses the March data when preparing the education funding formula around August, ahead of the release of the governor’s budget the following January. 
But this time round, McKee’s office used the October 2024 data collected by RIDE, which showed declining enrollment overall, and therefore fewer students in poverty. The new March numbers, according to RIDE, showed things swinging in the opposite direction, with more English learners and students living in poverty than accounted for in the fiscal 2026 budget McKee submitted months ago.
“The October data hasn’t been great the last few years,” Mark Dunham, the education department’s finance director, told senators. “And then 2025 was the first year that October was used.”
The discrepancy includes roughly $12 million in basic education aid and another $12 million tied to the Student Success Factor, a weight in the state’s school funding formula that gives additional support to districts with many students living in poverty.
For fiscal year 2025, the state began using October enrollment figures instead, and RIDE reported a total enrollment of 136,000 students, while the governor’s budget used 134,000 for the number of students statewide. The March 2025 update later corrected the count to 135,600 — revealing a roughly 1,000-student gap between RIDE’s projection and the updated total. 
“OK, so the numbers in October were incomplete for your assessment, we [now] believe the numbers in March are complete,” said committee chair and Middletown Democratic Sen. Lou DiPalma. “I’m trying to understand how we have a new set of data here. How do we believe what we have that this is correct? How do I know that the 39 cities and towns that provide the data are still not incomplete?”
“It looks to us that they did not completely update their poverty numbers,” Dunham said of local school districts who had to submit data.
The state currently uses food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) enrollment to calculate student poverty, applying a 1.6 multiplier to estimate the real total need. RIDE has also considered matching students through Medicaid, but the state has not yet fully incorporated it into the formula. 
“An overwhelming number of states in the country use Medicaid match as their proxy for poverty,” Dunham said, then described what that approach could mean to the state budget. “At the time we suggested it, it was about a $20 million number. Now, with all the new data we have, the enrollment updates, it’s a $40 million number.”
Victor Morente, a RIDE spokesperson, said in an email Thursday, that RIDE updates the data twice a year as part of its own preparation for submitting a budget request to the governor.
“At this time, research is ongoing to determine if there is an actual under identification,” Morente said.
Legislation in 2022 changed how students are counted, Morente said, which may have resulted in the undercount. 
“We were probably under-counting the number of students in poverty in certain districts,” Office of Management and Budget Director Brian Daniels told lawmakers. “And the broader way of fixing it…is changing your student success factor based on the wealth of each individual community.”
“But if you do that … are you setting 40% [aid] as the floor, or is that the starting point?…It gets very complicated, because in that case, you have winners and losers. So I think this is a longer term issue. We do need to fix this.”
Daniels said the budget office will be submitting a budget amendment which reflects the changes in enrollment from March.
Dunham said states like Massachusetts and Connecticut are facing similar data collection issues when it comes to low-income students. 
“I think we’d have to really rebuild the whole formula to be the same as Massachusetts, because I think the core [funding amount] is a lot less, or at least less, than ours,” Dunham said. “But we do wonder. We do understand that there are different levels of poverty that we should be able to address.”
Dunham ended his comments on a resigned note: “Even if we match all the kids exactly, we still are probably going to undercount a lot of the kids that are eligible for different reasons.”
DiPalma shrugged.
“Until we change the system, that’s what it is,” he said.

A vote is now planned for Tuesday.","At their regular Thursday morning press briefing, House Democratic leadership appeared confident about passage of the most significant housing legislation to come before the Connecticut legislature in years.
But by Thursday night, the vote on the bill had stalled under threats of a filibuster and a split Democratic party. Lawmakers said an altered version is likely to come up for a vote on Tuesday.
In its latest publicly released draft, House Bill 5002 is an ambitious omnibus measure that tackles zoning, transit-oriented development, parking policy and homelessness. After closed-door negotiations that stretched across most of the day Thursday, it’s not clear what will remain in the bill.
“I try to remind everyone this is somewhat of a normal part of the process in which there are fits, starts, restarts, amendments made, but I think eventually we are going to get there with this housing bill,” said Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, on Thursday evening.
Rojas said he had worked to compromise with Republicans on several key issues and that it came down to not having enough time in the day for the long debate.
Thursday morning, he focused on the compromises already made on the bill. It was the first time in several legislative sessions he had said the progress on Connecticut’s lack of housing wasn’t “painfully incremental.”
“I’m proud of what’s in here,” said Rojas on Thursday morning. “It’s been informed by conversations with a lot of people. I took the time to meet with a number of our Republican colleagues over the course of the session. I’m not suggesting that they’re endorsing the bill, that they’re voting for the bill. It seems unlikely that they will, but I have taken a lot of time to talk to people.”
“His bill is going to be grounded in experience and good public policy, and he probably is as good at that as anybody out of the 187 legislators,” said Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford.
Republicans slammed the bill Thursday, saying it would be bad for businesses and communities and contained “major flaws.” They planned to debate it for 10 to 12 hours, Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said. The threat points to the power of the minority party later in the legislative session to talk until time runs out and a bill is dead.
But that opposition was expected.
Less expected among advocates and some members of the General Assembly was the level of pushback from moderates and some urban lawmakers within the Democratic party concerned about changes to parking policy, the conversion of commercial lots to residential and a requirement that every town plan and zone for a set number of units of affordable housing.
“We didn’t expect 100% of Democrats to vote for this bill,” Rojas said. “Their support or lack thereof was not the primary motivation for a delay in the vote.”
Candelora said he expected at least 20 Democrats to vote against the bill Thursday night, which would have left the majority party with a tight but passable margin. Much of the negotiation centered around how long debate would last.
“Large companies like GE and Lego move their headquarters out of our state, being replaced by Amazon warehouse workers,” Candelora said. “It is no longer affordable for those individuals to be able to live here in the state of Connecticut. So we certainly do have an affordability issue. But I think we’ve got to look more broadly at what are the policies that they are passing that are only causing us to have economic loss.”

Some lawmakers also took issue with the way the bill was drafted — as an omnibus bill containing more than a dozen concepts from at least three different committees. It’s a strategic decision typically used to limit debate. The idea is that it’s easier to do one long debate on a big bill rather than several long debates on small bills.
But frustrations about the process rose across both parties in the Capitol on Thursday, people close to the conversations said.
“It’s an insult to everything we do here,” said Rep. Doug Dubitsky, R-Chaplin. Dubitsky planned to introduce several amendments to the bill, he said, which likely would have lengthened debate.
The parking policy changes sparked consternation among Democrats and Republicans on Thursday. The bill would have limited towns’ ability to mandate the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for certain types of new developments.
As it stands, parking requirements vary widely from town to town. Some spaces are determined by the square footage or seating capacity. It’s also different based on the type of development. For example, In New London, bowling alleys must have three spaces per lane. In Wethersfield, it’s five per lane and one per employee. Meanwhile, in Westport, there must be one space per 180 square feet.
The cost of building parking adds significantly to the cost of housing, and land use advocates have said it means large swaths of downtowns are taken up by parking lots instead of businesses, housing or green space.
But opponents said they feared it would mean people have to walk several blocks from their cars to their homes, that it would dilute local control and didn’t take safety into account.
“I don’t know how else you slice and dice that. You can cook it any way you want, but it’s a mandate, and it’s a grab at local control,” said Planning and Development Committee ranking member Rep. Joe Zullo, R-East Haven.
Members also argued over the details of a bill known as “Towns Take the Lead,” which would consider regional housing supply, need and wealth to determine the number of units of affordable housing that each town would be required to plan and zone for. These plans would have to be included in the 8-30j affordable housing plans that each town submits to the state every five years.
Advocates say that the policy aims to increase affordable housing supply while cutting down on segregation. It’s similar to a “fair share” policy proposed in past legislative sessions.
The conversion of commercial property into “middle housing,” or housing with up to nine units, was also a sticking point. The bill would have required that towns allow that type of conversion without a special hearing before the planning and zoning commission. 
Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, has advocated for this policy since he joined the legislature in 2022, saying it would help address the housing crisis and use up office space that’s been empty since the pandemic.
But opponents said it ignored individual towns’ needs.
“It’s a total upending of zoning,” Candelora said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0522_SR_Session_123-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 22:01:30.737704

(Photo by Hollis Europe and Jacob Barbaro/NOAA Fisheries)Conservation groups and a Tribal government have sued to overturn a permit that allows a mining company to build a road and expand an airstrip at a site important to endangered whales.
At issue is the permit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted in September to Contango ORE Inc. for construction work at the Johnson Tract mining prospect on the west side of Cook Inlet.
The site is along the Johnson River and near Tuxedni Bay, a place where Cook Inlet belugas gather in winter to feed.
The lawsuit alleges that the Corps failed to properly consider impacts of the development on the endangered belugas, including the impacts of aircraft and vessel noise. The complaint also says the Corps failed to properly analyze the anticipated acid rock drainage and other sources of water pollution. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, alleges violations of the federal Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act.
The plaintiffs are Cook Inletkeeper, the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, the Center for Biological Diversity and a Soldotna resident, Anna-Maria Mueller.
Satchel Pondolfino, clean water lead with Cook Inletkeeper, said in a statement that the Corps failed to assess the effect on the belugas in the inlet, which is named Tikahtnu in Dena’ina.
“The Johnson River supports an ecosystem rich with salmon, herring, wolves, wolverines and iconic Alaskan brown bears, which are becoming scarcer as Tikahtnu becomes more industrialized,” Pondolfino said. “What’s at risk is one of the most ecologically rich corners of Tikahtnu and the Army Corps has a duty to carefully scrutinize all implications of this permit.”
A spokesperson for the Corps’ Alaska district office declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing policies concerning pending litigation.
Cook Inlet belugas are highly sensitive to noise and depend on calls and songs to communicate and navigate. Tuxedni Bay is a refuge for them because it currently lacks the industrial noise widespread in other parts of the inlet, according to scientists.
Last year, Cook Inletkeeper and the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service to create a protective zone around Tuxedni Bay, limiting traffic and human activities there to keep noise levels low. That petition has not been granted.
The Johnson Tract, comprising about 21,000 acres, is within the borders of Lake Clark National Park but owned by Cook Inlet Region Inc., an Alaska Native corporation. CIRI acquired the inholding through a trade enabled by a 1976 federal law, the Cook Inlet Land Exchange. For decades, the corporation has been considering options for mining development at the site.
In 2019, CIRI leased the site to Vancouver-based HighGold Mining Inc., which conducted some exploration. Fairbanks-based Contango bought HighGold last year, and with that acquisition, the company took over Johnson Tract exploration operations.
Contango is also a part owner of the Manh Choh mine near Tetlin in eastern Interior Alaska, is developing the Lucky Shot mine in the Hatcher Pass area of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and has other projects in early exploration stages.
The Johnson Tract holds gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead. Contango estimates that the Johnson Tract property holds over 1 million gold equivalent ounces, an industry measurement that combines different types of precious metals. Initial capital costs to develop the mine are estimated at $214 million, and once built, the mine would operate for at least seven years, according to a technical report the company released earlier this month.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


A preliminary budget request from President Donald Trump takes aim at a satellite program with a 50-year history whose data is housed just northeast of Sioux Falls, at a facility employing hundreds of people.
Trump’s discretionary budget request for NASA would cut $1.1 billion in funding for Earth observation programs, including what the request describes as cuts to the “gold-plated, two billion dollar Landsat Next” mission. The cut amounts to roughly half of the space agency’s budget for Earth observation, which includes money for Landsat design.
Landsat Next is planned as the next generation of Landsat, whose nine iterations have created the longest continuously collected Earth observation record in history. The first satellite launched in 1972.

NASA builds and launches Landsat satellites. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates them and curates the data collected by them.
The USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center near Sioux Falls has housed Landsat data since 1973, in addition to millions of images from other satellites and modern and historical aerial imagery, all of which is accessible at no cost to users. Landsat’s free data is used to calibrate data from commercial satellites, contributing to what the USGS calculated last fall as a $25.6 billion return on public investment since the agency began freely sharing data in 2008.
The most recent satellite in the series, Landsat 9, entered low-earth orbit in 2021. Between that satellite and its near-identical predecessor, Landsat 8, the system gathers new imagery data of the entire Earth’s surface — as well as imagery from spectral bands like infrared that are invisible to the naked eye and measurements of Earth surface temperatures — every eight days.
  Powerful storms containing heavy rains caused major flooding to areas in the east central portion of the United States in early April 2025. Some communities in Kentucky saw more than 15 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. In the days following April 7 — the day Landsat 8 captured this imagery over a portion of the affected area — the Kentucky and Ohio rivers were forecast to reach historic levels and crest in dozens of locations. (Courtesy USGS Landsat program)
Landsat Next was set to launch around 2030, with improvements in resolution and speedier repeat image collection.
Trump’s budget request would “restructure” the Landsat Next mission “while NASA studies more affordable ways to maintain the continuity of Landsat imagery, which is used by natural resource managers, States, and industry.”
The request also calls for the elimination of $562 million in USGS funding. The change “eliminates programs that provide grants to universities, duplicate other Federal research programs and focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change) to instead focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals,” Trump’s budget request says.
The cut to USGS amounts to about a third of its $1.6 billion budget.
The budget request is separate from the federal government’s efforts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to pare down the federal workforce.
Probationary employees across multiple federal agencies were first dismissed in February, but many returned to the federal payroll and placed on paid administrative leave after legal challenges.
It’s unclear how those moves to reduce the federal workforce have impacted the EROS Center.
Around 600 government employees and contractors work at the center, according to the latest figures posted on the USGS website, but the site including that figure hasn’t changed since March 2023.
Emails from South Dakota Searchlight to USGS press contacts at EROS and in regional and national offices on the number of employees who’ve departed since Jan. 25 went unanswered.
Searchlight also asked about the potential impact of the USGS budget cut proposal to EROS science programs, and about how changes to the Landsat program could affect EROS.
A NASA spokesperson told South Dakota Searchlight that the agency would be in a better position to respond “once we receive the President’s full budget request in the coming weeks.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, pointed out that presidential budget requests are “aspirational” and “rarely implemented as written.”
“Dusty will continue to be supportive of Landsat’s efforts in Congress,” said a Johnson spokesperson.
The NASA budget has not emerged as a discussion point in budget reconciliation talks underway in Washington, D.C., on Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, sounded similar notes in his response to questions about Landsat.
“The president’s discretionary budget is just that — discretionary. It outlines the president’s priorities and wish lists, but it will ultimately be our job in Congress to set the budget and appropriate federal dollars,” Rounds said in an emailed statement.
Representatives for Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return emails requesting comment on Landsat and EROS.
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told Searchlight during a visit to Sioux Falls recently that he hadn’t heard about requested cuts to the satellite program or to the USGS.
Even so, Rhoden said he trusts that an open relationship with the Trump administration on South Dakota’s priorities will help preserve them through budget negotiations.

“They give you some wiggle room as far as what your priorities are, and so I’m kind of optimistic that they are tempering some of those decisions with common sense,” Rhoden said.
Trump’s actions have had at least one public impact on EROS, though not an operational one.
EROS is home to a supercomputer whose processing power is shared across multiple arms of the Department of Interior. The system came to EROS with the name Denali, named after the tallest peak in the U.S.
Like the Alaska mountain after which the computer was named, the Denali system at EROS was renamed “McKinley” after the issuance of a Trump executive order.
Denali has long been the mountain’s name among Alaska’s Indigenous Athabascans, but the federal government embraced the name given to it by a prospector for about 100 years. The prospector called it “Mount McKinley,” after then-presidential candidate William McKinley.
President Barack Obama renamed it Denali in 2015, matching the name the surrounding national park had taken nearly 40 years earlier.
The order does not mention the USGS or supercomputers, but rather instructs the Department of Interior to “update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.”
The EROS supercomputer’s name was changed based on the order, however.
“Pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order No. 14172, ‘Restoring Names that Honor American Greatness,’ this supercomputer has been renamed to McKinley,” a poster in the EROS visitor area now reads.

(Getty Images Creative)Food and nutrition cuts in the reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House early Thursday would cost Wisconsin taxpayers at least $314 million if they are signed into law, a state health official said Thursday.
  Bill Hanna, Wisconsin Medicaid director
A requirement for the state to pick up some of the costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, a provision penalizing the state for errors in distributing benefits, expanded work requirements for recipients and the elimination of a nutrition education program will all contribute to that cost, said Bill Hanna, Medicaid director at the Department of Health Services (DHS) in a briefing for reporters Thursday afternoon.
The SNAP program is known as FoodShare in Wisconsin and administered by DHS.
SNAP currently includes a work requirement for adults ages 18 to 54 without children to receive benefits. The legislation would raise the upper age to 65 and add the requirement to adults with children who are 7 or older.
Wisconsin has an employment and training program to help FoodShare recipients meet the existing work requirement. With the increase in people who would have to meet the requirement, “We estimate that would cost another $44 million a year,” Hanna said.
Currently the federal government funds 100% of the food benefits under SNAP. The new bill requires states to pick up a portion of the cost, which is tied to a state’s error rate, Hanna said. Errors include the payment of more benefits than a person qualifies for or the payment of fewer benefits than they qualify for.
“When errors are identified, we correct them, meaning if there was an overpayment to a member, that is recouped on future benefits, or if there’s an underpayment, we fix that and back pay those payments,” Hanna said.
Wisconsin’s error rate is low enough to require the state to submit only a 5% match for SNAP funds under the House Republican proposal, he said. But another change — which would allow zero tolerance even for errors that in the past have not counted against state programs — would boost the state’s required match to 15%.
DHS estimates based on the proposed new requirements the state would have to pay about $207 million a year in benefit costs, he said. If the state is able to reduce its error rate to qualify for the 5% match, it would still need to pay $69 million a year.
A higher state share of administrative costs in the bill would add $51 million to the state’s costs for SNAP, Hanna said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).LINCOLN — A “public safety” package on Thursday cleared a second lawmaking hurdle and retains what has been the most controversial element — lowering the minimum age at which a youth can be detained from 13 to 11.
Before Legislative Bill 530 passed on a 35-9 vote, however, lawmakers approved smaller juvenile-justice related changes to address some concerns of certain lawmakers and nonprofits, said State Sen. Carolyn Bosn, chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee.
Among modifications was a requirement that all temporary and alternative placement options be exhausted before a child age 11 or 12 would be detained in a facility, which critics say causes lasting trauma.
‘Super predator’ flag
Removed as a reason a youth could be detained was “harm to self” language. “We didn’t want to create an illusion that we were detaining youth who might be going through a mental health crisis,” said Bosn.

Also changed was the name of a new designation a court could bestow on certain youth offenders. Omaha State Sen. Ashlei Spivey had taken issue with the earlier proposed “high-risk juvenile probationer” category, comparing it to a “super predator” flag that would disproportionately harm youths of color. Amended language now refers to those youths as “comprehensive supervision probationers.”
In the end, Spivey was among nine “no” votes, joining State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who was unsuccessful in garnering support for additional changes. For example, he wanted to limit which law enforcement levels are to receive a monthly list of “comprehensive supervision probationers” generated by the Office of Probation Administration.
McKinney proposed that the list be provided only to high-ranking officers, not those below the rank of captain. He said his concern was the “rogue” law enforcement officers who can misuse such information to “provoke” or unfairly target youths. He said that happens disproportionately in his district.
McKinney noted during Thursday’s debate that a teen was dead after being shot by a Douglas County sheriff’s deputy that morning. The investigation is ongoing.
“I’m trying to make sure more lives don’t get lost,” McKinney said.
Good will, heartburn
Bosn said that no one likely would be completely satisfied with the juvenile justice parts of the public safety package, but she called the results so far a “showing of good will.”

Spivey said that while some parts still give her “heartburn,” she appreciated the process to try to reach a compromise on parts opponents said were overly punitive.
Bosn, a former prosecutor, views the overall package as promoting public safety while also better re-directing juveniles who have veered into trouble.
LB 530 includes an underlying bill introduced by State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha which aims to increase fines for speeding violations and to change the law to help “vulnerable road users.”
Segments of at least nine bills were folded into the megabill before the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee moved it to the floor for full debate. Lawmakers advanced it 33-0 in the first round and now, after approval Thursday, it moves to final reading.
Megabill parts
Other components folded into the package:
LB 6, introduced by Bosn and aimed at fentanyl poisoning, calls for enhanced penalties when the person using the controlled substance dies or sustains serious injury.
LB 44, by McKinney, allows individuals to file for post-conviction relief up until the age of 21 if the conviction occurred as a minor.
LB 124, by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, would match a drunken driver’s penalty for motor vehicle homicide of an unborn child to the penalty that drunken driver would get for motor vehicle homicide.
LB 395, by State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, would allow police access to a sealed juvenile record when someone applies for a concealed handgun permit.
LB 404, by State Sen. Robert Hallstrom of Syracuse, authorizes courts to extend a term of probation upon a joint application from the probation officer and the person on probation.
LB 600, by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, authorizes the Department of Transportation to temporarily reduce speed limits on highways under specific conditions such as adverse weather or traffic congestion.
LB 684, by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, was essentially gutted and replaced by a series of juvenile justice measures, including the lowering of the age at which a youth could be detained in a facility. That element, which sparked criticism from many during a public hearing, was originally part of a bill by Ralston State Sen. Merv Riepe.
Bosn said the Judiciary Committee sees the measures as ways to “improve accountability for juveniles and transparency for law enforcement.” Spivey said the detainment measures were among the package’s most concerning, and that prevention and rehabilitation services are more effective when dealing with young people whose brains are still developing.

Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, speaks in favor of House Bill 62 on Friday, May 16, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature is on pace to raise the state’s age of sexual consent to 18 next year, after the state House voted 39-0 to approve House Bill 101 on Monday.
The bill now goes to the state Senate, which is expected to take it up in January, when lawmakers convene for the second year of the 34th Alaska State Legislature.
The bill comes from Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, who said on Monday that it represents a way to fight rape and child sexual assault.
Under current law, it is legal for an adult to have sex in Alaska with a 16-year-old or 17-year-old who consents. If that child is assaulted, Gray said, they must prove that they did not consent.
“This makes prosecutions of these cases of sexual assault and sex trafficking more difficult, especially if the young person had seen the perpetrator on multiple occasions, or if alcohol and drugs were involved,” Gray said. 
The bill has a significant exception: “For teens 13 to 15 years old, they can consent to sex with someone up to four years older than them. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds can consent to sex with someone up to six years older than them,” he said.
That exemption came at the suggestion of domestic violence shelters, sexual assault experts and homeless shelters, who were concerned that without the close-in-age exemption, they would deter teens from seeking help.
Additional clauses in the bill criminalize the sending of explicit images of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds. 
“It is my hope that this bill will prevent the strategic targeting of 16- and 17-year-olds by predators,” Gray said.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, also spoke in support of the bill.
“This bill reminds us that those who are under 18 are still children,” she said. “They’re vulnerable youth. They are figuring out who they are in the world. … Raising the age of consent to 18  makes it easier for law enforcement to say, ‘We’re going to help you.’ It puts the onus on the offender instead of on the victim. That child victim no longer would have to prove that what  happened to them was not consensual.”
Vance and Gray unsuccessfully attempted last year to change the age of consent, but the proposal ran into technical problems and the session ended before those could be resolved.
HB 101’s passage came three years after the Legislature voted to limit child marriage by banning marriages involving Alaskans younger than 16. Because sex is permitted between married partners of any age, that effectively raised the state’s age of consent to 16.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday signed a bill born out of the backlash against his administration’s plan last summer to build golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts at nine state parks.
The Legislature unanimously approved HB 209, which prohibits construction of specified sporting facilities and public lodgings in state parks, such as golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball courts, and ball fields.
Southeast Republican Rep. John Snyder pitched the proposal following backlash and protests from Republicans and Democrats alike, who opposed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s leaked plan to build such facilities.
While state officials dropped the plan, DeSantis tried to distance himself from it. He also told reporters during a press conference on May 7 that he would sign the bill. The governor’s office announced his approval of the bill among a list of 17 bills DeSantis signed Thursday.
“What began as the so-called ‘Great Outdoors Initiative’ to develop our parks has ended in a landmark law ensuring they are protected forever. This achievement is nothing short of historic,” Florida’s chapter of the Sierra Club posted on Facebook.
The new law requires the state to announce public hearings regarding projects in state parks 30 days in advance. The department had scheduled meetings to gather public feedback on the same date and time across the nine state parks, prompting further outrage and causing the postponement of those meetings.

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A female corrections officer fired for an alleged romantic relationship with an inmate has been awarded unemployment benefits.
State records indicate Azucena D. Valenzuela was employed as a corrections officer at the Fort Dodge Correctional Facility for three years before she was fired by the Iowa Department of Corrections in March 2025 for a having a relationship with an inmate.
According to the records, two of Valenzuela’s superiors approached her last October about a rumor that she was being enlisted to smuggle items into a correctional facility for a specific inmate. Valenzuela denied any knowledge of such activity, but her superiors allegedly told her that her interactions with the inmate in question were concerning.
On Dec. 22, 2024, the department placed Valenzuela on administrative leave while it investigated an alleged improper relationship between her and the inmate. The investigation looked into reports of Valenzuela talking with the inmate on the phone, talking with the inmate for extended periods during work hours, and what the department characterized as the two looking at each other in an “inappropriate” manner.
The department alleged that video footage showed Valenzuela talking with the inmate for extended periods on multiple occasions between Oct. 8, 2024. and Dec. 22, 2024, including six occasions in which they were captured on video while Valenzuela was working.
The department also claimed that during an encounter on Nov. 21, 2024, Valenzuela took the inmate’s iPad-style device and input the number of a “burner phone” she had purchased. However, at Valenzuela’s subsequent hearing on her application for unemployment benefits, the Department of Corrections provided “no evidence of any information put into the device at or around the time” Valenzuela handled it, Administrative Law Judge Blair Bennett observed.
The Department of Corrections also alleged the inmate had called Valenzuela’s phone on multiple occasions, expressing his affection for her and wanting to be with her. The person on the other end of the phone made similar comments. The department claimed multiple people said they believe it was Valenzuela on the receiving end of those calls, but it provided no such testimony from those individuals.
The department, Bennett later concluded, had conducted an extensive investigation and had determined that allegations of staff sexual misconduct were founded. Bennett noted that the corrections department had chosen not to offer any testimony from the witnesses it claimed to rely on in deciding to fire Valenzuela, nor did it provide her with any copies of phone recordings.
The department, Bennett found, “chose not to produce any witnesses to the alleged incidents, and did not produce anything that would credibly establish (Valenzuela) as being involved in phone calls with the inmate.” As such, she ruled, Valenzuela was qualified to receive unemployment benefits.
It’s not the first time the Department of Corrections has chosen to provide no direct evidence at hearings alleging workplace misconduct. In 2023, for example, the Fort Dodge facility fired corrections officer Robert W. Goodner for allegedly providing some unspecified form of “contraband” to inmates.
At Goodner’s hearing for unemployment benefits, none of the financial and phone records the department had subpoenaed — which would likely reveal the full scope of any alleged sales and the precise nature of any contraband — were offered into evidence. In addition, none of the DOC employees directly involved in the investigation testified at the hearing. As a result, Goodner was awarded unemployment benefits.
Asked then why the DOC didn’t present any records at Goodner’s hearing, Fort Dodge Correctional Facility Deputy Warden Don Harris said it was unclear what information the DOC should be sharing with others.
“I don’t know, since that’s part of an investigation for criminal prosecution, that the information should be put out there for anyone else,” Harris told the Iowa Capital Dispatch.



Iowans investigated for workplace porn, ‘sexual noises’ and Google Chat
Other Iowans recently fired for alleged misconduct include:
— Thomas E. Patterson, who in April was fired from the Iowa Department of Corrections’ Mt.  Pleasant Correctional Facility. Patterson had worked for the DOC as a full-time corrections officer since May 1999. State records indicate that while DOC policy restricted employees’ personal use of the internet, the agency’s employees regularly used Google Chat to communicate with each other at work. Throughout Patterson’s employment, he allegedly used Google Chat to discuss with colleagues subjects that were not work related.
On Dec. 2, 2024, the DOC began an investigation into Patterson’s internet usage and downloaded and reviewed more than 4,000 pages of Google Chat conversations between Patterson, his supervisor and his coworkers that dated back to 2023. As part of that process, the department also compiled all of the comments the claimant had made that the employer deemed objectionable, such as comments that were critical of management or which expressed frustration with staff or the workplace.
On April 2, 2025, the Mt. Pleasant Correctional Facility fired Patterson due to alleged violations of the employer’s information technology policy. He was awarded unemployment benefits, with the judge noting that Patterson’s Google Chat conversations had included his own supervisor, which provided the facility’s management with “immediate knowledge” of any misconduct. Despite that knowledge, the judge noted, Patterson wasn’t fired until April 2025.
— Ricky Lichtenberger, who was fired in February from Per Mar Security where he had worked since October 2023. According to the company, Lichtenberger was working in the security office of a hospital when a female EMT walked in and found Lichtenberger watching a sexually explicit video on his phone. The EMT later reported the video was playing loudly and she heard references to a woman’s anatomy and to certain sexual positions. When a manager asked Lichtenberger about the incident, he allegedly replied that it may have happened as described and that he “might have forgotten (he) was at work.”
Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson ruled Lichtenberger was ineligible for unemployment benefits and ordered that he repay $2,227 already collected. The video content, she ruled, “had nothing to do with his work as a security officer and (Lichtenberger’s) decision to not just watch the video but play its sound at full volume created, at minimum, an uncomfortable work environment for his coworkers and all others entering the security office.”
— Allison Austin, who in April was fired by the University of Iowa where she worked as a clerk.  According to state records, Austin was accused of making “sexual noises” during a quarterly, department-wide Zoom meeting that she attended by computer. Austin told the Iowa Capital Dispatch she doesn’t recall whether she had her computer’s camera activated during the meeting, but said that at some point during the session she had inadvertently activated her microphone. She said she believes she may have made some innocuous comments she didn’t intend her colleagues to hear, but which two human resources officials later claimed were noises of a sexual nature.
“You think these people in HR are there to protect you, but they’re accusing you having sex on a team meeting,” Austin told the Capital Dispatch. “I was mortified.”
Austin was fired not for her conduct during the meeting, but for discussing with her co-workers the university’s investigation of that conduct. She was denied unemployment benefits. Austin said she intends to appeal that ruling.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-05-22 20:03:52.355717

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) Thursday afternoon to protest what they say is his lack of accountability, absence from public events since taking office, and his position on the federal budget bill.
“We are here to tell our representatives that we are watching them. Their votes have real consequences for real people; it’s costing lives. They think they can just cast their votes and be done, give all these tax cuts to the rich, and put blood on their hands,” Zahna Woodson, 31, from Caring Across Generations said. “This affects real people, this affects real lives, and it is detrimental to us. We have things to say, and they should come and face us.”
The protest was scheduled for noon, when demonstrators began arriving with signs criticizing the Trump administration and Rep. Barrett, while expressing support for Medicare and Medicaid services.

“We were hopeful that we could get Tom to vote no on this federal budget bill. We knew it was going to be hard, but we wanted our voices to be heard. Now, we’re shaming him for constantly voting against his constituents’ needs,” said Cecilia Garcia-Linz, 50, a member of the Sierra Club.
On Thursday morning, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved the sweeping tax-cut bill dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill” by Donald Trump, sending it to the U.S. Senate.
Absent Tom Barrett, 7th District town hall meeting lets constituents express concerns, frustrations

In an “X” post, Rep. Barrett announced he voted yes, stating he did so to “deliver for hard-working families across mid-Michigan. Promises made. Promises kept.”
“We have thousands of supporters across the state of Michigan, and we will be impacted by this terrible budget bill. Seniors, veterans, and those who rely on Medicaid, like I did as a child and I do for mine, were able to survive and escape poverty because of these social services,” Garcia-Linz remarked.
The demonstration continued with various speakers emphasizing the defense of social services including Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, which are currently considered under threat by the approval of the federal budget bill.
“I don’t know how many of you here are on Medicaid, but Medicaid and Medicare save lives,” said Judy Suess, 65, finishing her speech, followed by applause.

As the speeches came to an end, some protesters began chanting and waving their signs at passing drivers and pedestrians, with a few honking their horns in support of the cause.
Kimberly Smith, 65, a senior resident from Dewitt, was chanting and waving her sign passionately to the passing drivers until the end of the demonstration, and she explained her concern about these possible social service cuts.
“Social Security came about to bring seniors who have retired out of poverty years and years ago. Set to fund itself, and it does, and it was working just fine. Medicaid and Medicare help our seniors, our disabled, and those who need it, to keep them alive with the medical care they cannot have,” Smith said.
After about an hour, approximately 15 protesters headed to the office of U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) at the Federal building in Lansing to demonstrate after they learned through an email from the Sierra Club about her vote in favor of legislation repealing California’s EPA waiver. 
  Protesters gathered outside Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s (D-Holly) office on May 22, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz Veliz
In an email, members of the Sierra Club criticized Slotkin’s position.
“This standard has been one of the most powerful tools in reducing harmful air pollution, protecting our health, and fighting climate change in the United States. Trying to take away this authority is not only legally questionable, it would also have serious consequences for our health, our environment, and our economy,” the email stated.
In a press release, Slotkin emphasized her commitment to Michigan workers, noting that they live in the world’s auto capital and rely heavily on the automotive industry. She added that, as other states are beginning to reverse course on the policy, Michigan should consider doing the same.
“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035. Michigan is the auto capital of the world, and as Michigan’s U.S. Senator, I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry,” Slotkin stated.
The protesters then returned to Barrett’s office, where they ended the demonstration without incident.

“These new majors reflect both student demand and workforce trends in Iowa and across the nation,” said college President Scott Stokes in a news release. “They give our students more targeted opportunities to begin their educational journey locally while ensuring a clear and cost-effective route to a bachelor’s degree.”
The transfer degrees cover areas of study in agriculture business, agronomy, animal science, communication, English, political science and social work, according to the release. Each of the degrees were formed in agreement with the University of Iowa, University of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University and will count for the first two years of a bachelor’s degree.
With the new additions to its academic offerings, the community college now offers more than 20 transfer degrees, the release stated, ranging from math to education, fine arts and more.
These degree programs were developed to make the transfer process from community college to university easier, with the assurance that their credits will seamlessly transfer, according to the release.
“Whether students are aiming for a career in agriculture, education, communication, or social services, these Transfer Majors give them a solid foundation,” said Beth Elman, executive director of marketing, in the release. “This expansion supports our mission of providing accessible, high-quality education that prepares students for lifelong success.”

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Washington leaders are warning that at least 194,000 people in the state stand to lose Medicaid coverage under a Republican-backed budget bill that passed the U.S. House early Thursday.
Only eight other states could potentially have more residents lose their health insurance from Medicaid than Washington, according to estimates released by Democrats on Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. 
Washington would also lose about $2 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next four years, Gov. Bob Ferguson said at a press conference Thursday at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. He said “no rainy-day reserve fund is going to backfill that.”
But he stopped short of saying the proposed cuts would necessitate a special legislative session since many of the bill’s provisions wouldn’t go into effect immediately.
The cuts also threaten the livelihood of the state’s nursing homes and rural hospitals, officials said.
“Hospitals will close in Washington state, in rural parts of our state and urban parts of our state,” Ferguson said. “Take that to the bank. That’s going to happen. Nursing homes in our state will close.”
In light of this, about two dozen Washington state Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, pleaded with the 12-member congressional delegation to avoid cuts that would imperil the state’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health. 
“We urge you to protect Medicaid,” they wrote in a letter sent Wednesday. “We can’t afford to lose local health care resources, and our rural communities will not be able to ride out the economic shockwaves that are sure to follow if this program is significantly cut.” 
The letter marked a departure from Republican lawmakers’ tact on federal policy maneuvering, as they’ve largely remained mum on the potential Medicaid cuts and numerous other hot-button topics since President Donald Trump took office in January.
Massive bill
The legislation that Republicans in Congress are forging ahead with is sprawling in scope. It would extend tax cuts approved in 2017 during Trump’s first term, pump more money toward border security, rework energy permitting and restructure college aid, among other changes.
To cut spending in line with their desired tax breaks, House Republicans propose reductions between $600 billion to $700 billion over 10 years to Medicaid, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. The program, which is run jointly by the federal government and states, provides health care for people who are poor or disabled. Roughly a quarter of Washington residents are covered by Medicaid.
The bill squeaked through the House by a single vote, with only Republicans in support. The two GOP representatives in Washington’s delegation, Dan Newhouse, of Sunnyside, and Michael Baumgartner, of Spokane, voted for it. 
Newhouse and Baumgartner’s red districts have the highest proportion of Medicaid enrollees in Washington. 
In a statement, Newhouse defended his vote, saying Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” would implement “real, common-sense reforms to strengthen the integrity of Medicaid, protecting the program for low-income families, seniors, and those with disabilities.” 
One of the key changes the bill proposes is a requirement that certain Medicaid recipients prove they are working to qualify for coverage.
Specifically, the proposal would require childless adults without disabilities to work, volunteer or attend school for 80 hours per month, with some exceptions. Work requirements would go into effect by the end of 2026, up from the initial 2029 meant to give states time to prepare.
Of Washington adults on Medicaid, 70% are working, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.
Democrats have universally decried the legislation, framing it as an attempt by Republicans to pay for tax cuts that will deliver outsized benefits to wealthier taxpayers, while undermining safety net programs for lower-income Americans.
“This legislation is a betrayal of Republicans’ promise to lower costs for everyday families,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina. “It will rip health coverage away from millions of families while increasing groceries, utilities, and health care bills.”
The bill would also punish states like Washington that offer Medicaid-style coverage to immigrants without legal status. Enrollment in Washington’s program for immigrants is capped, and it is funded using only state money.
For states that offer programs like this, House Republicans want to decrease how much the federal government would pay to cover enrollees who qualify for Medicaid under expanded eligibility stemming from the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Hundreds of thousands of Washington adults got Apple Health coverage under that expansion.
Over the next decade, this could shift to the state $10 billion in costs the federal government previously covered, according to KFF.
The legislation still needs to pass the U.S. Senate before reaching the president’s desk.
By way of background
Washington receives over $13 billion in federal funding for Medicaid, according to fiscal year 2023 data from the state Office of Financial Management. The state chips in another $8 billion, one of the largest categories of spending in its operating budget.
As of last month, nearly 2 million Washington residents were enrolled in Apple Health, including over 850,000 children, according to the state Health Care Authority, which oversees the program.
Jen Chong Jewell’s son, Gabriel, is one of them. The Everett 14-year-old has developmental disabilities and has used Medicaid to cover surgeries, therapies and medical equipment. 
“I love my son, and I hate that he, along with so many others, are being swept into this narrative about the need to, quote ‘eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,’” Chong Jewell told reporters.
Also looming is the expiration of expanded tax credits for the Affordable Care Act that allowed more people to purchase insurance. That change and others to the federal health care law could cost another 79,000 residents in Washington their coverage, according to the congressional analysis. 
Nationwide, this would bring the total to 13.7 million people with lost coverage by 2034.
The bill also would stop coverage for gender-affirming care for transgender people and reproductive care through Planned Parenthood. Washington state Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, was among more than 500 legislators across the country who called on congressional leadership this week to preserve Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services.
Meanwhile, cuts to federal food stamp benefits — known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — would shift $300 million in annual costs to Washington, according to Ferguson’s office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3329-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 20:03:52.355717

(Getty Images)A Republican plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from food assistance and health care programs for low income Americans to make way for tax cuts would have “devastating” results in West Virginia, advocates and providers say. 
The U.S. House of Representatives early Thursday passed a budget bill that analysts say would cut Medicaid by at least $716 billion — the largest in the program’s history — and cause roughly 15 million people to lose their health care coverage over the next few years. 
The bill, which has yet to be approved by the U.S. Senate, would also cut the Supplemental Food Nutrition Program by $300 billion through 2034 and push a portion of the cost of the program to the states to backfill. 
Both West Virginia Reps. Riley Moore and Carol Miller, R-W.Va., voted in support of the bill, which narrowly passed with a 215 to 214 vote.
Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the bill breaks a lot of promises made by Congress and President Donald Trump.
“It does, in fact, enact deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP that will result in eligible people losing those benefits. It will raise grocery prices and health care costs for tens of thousands of West Virginia families,” she said. “And despite all that, it still increases the deficit, and that’s because it extends huge windfall tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthiest households in America.”
“Overall, this package just feels like a really bad deal for West Virginians,” she said. 
In West Virginia more than 500,000 people rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program for their health coverage.
The bill adds work reporting requirements, primarily for the expansion population — those that are on the program as a result of the Affordable Care Act expanding coverage to low-income households, Allen said. It also requires more frequent renewals, where participants are revaluated for eligibility in the program. 
The work reporting requirements and the more frequent determinations would result in an estimated 50,000 West Virginians being kicked off the health programs, despite continuing to qualify for coverage, she said. 
“The vast majority of West Virginians on Medicaid are either already working or likely would meet an exemption because they’re doing caregiving, they’re in school, they’re disabled,” Allen said. “But just because what we’ve seen in other states who have tried this is that overwhelmingly, people who do qualify get kicked off because the new requirements are confusing, burdensome and difficult to follow.”
The bill also adds co-pays up to $35 per Medicaid service and reduces retroactive eligibility from 90 days to one month, which would lead to hospitals in the states absorbing more uncompensated care, Allen said. 
The changes are estimated to cost West Virginia about $200 million per year in federal health care money that go to the state’s hospitals and providers, Allen said. 
“We know hospitals will see less revenue, and instead they’ll see more of a need for uncompensated care,” Allen said. The loss of revenue will result in an estimated loss of 2,000 to 3,000 health care jobs in the state, she said.
Laura Jones, executive director of Milan Puskar Health Right, a free and charitable clinic in Morgantown, said the Medicaid cuts would have a “profoundly negative effect” on the communities the clinic serves.
“We will have, once again, many people who lack health insurance,” Jones said. “And while there are six free clinics in the state in somewhat strategic locations, there are many areas of the state where options for people without insurance are limited or nonexistent.
“People will resort back to using the emergency room for primary care, which is by far the most expensive way to provide care,” she said. “Wait times at emergency departments will increase, and hospitals will be overwhelmed with uncompensated care yet again.”
Jones’ comments came during a virtual press conference about the Medicaid cuts Thursday hosted by the health care advocacy organization Protect Our Care. The group urged West Virginia Republicans Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice to vote against the cuts when the Senate considers the legislation. 
“Medicaid is a lifeline for West Virginia families, seniors, people with disabilities, low income adults and children,” Lynette Maselli, state director of Protect Our Care, said during the press conference. “Today, nearly one in three West Virginians rely on Medicaid for their health care. Cuts to the program mean fewer doctor visits, fewer life saving prescriptions, and more families forced to choose between paying rent and affording care for providers. It means more uncompensated care, lower reimbursements, job losses and potentially even closures of medical centers.” 
The bill does not extend tax credits put in place under the Biden Administration that have helped approximately 50,000 West Virginians pay for their health care on the health insurance marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act. The tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year. Allen said the tax credits expiring is likely to mean 15,000 state residents will lose their health care because plans are no longer affordable. 
“I think West Virginia would be among the state’s most impacted, because we have the highest health care prices in the country,” she said. “So those subsidies have made a huge difference in helping make prices more affordable.”
States would pick up some costs of the SNAP food assistance program 
The federal government has historically covered the entire cost of SNAP benefits, which help approximately 277,000 or one in six West Virginia residents get access to food. The state splits the cost of administering the program with the federal government.
Under the bill that passed the House Thursday, the federal government would shift between 5 to 25% of the cost of SNAP benefits to state governments beginning in 2028. The amount a state pays would depend on its payment error rate. 
West Virginia would pay up at least $28 million and up to about $141 million, depending on the error rate, according to an analysis from the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities. 
“[$141 million is] more than West Virginia spends on child care, CPS workers and the Promise Scholarship combined,” Allen said. “There’s not a lot of flexibility in the state budget right now as we’ve seen. That almost certainly means state lawmakers would have to raise taxes, raise revenue or cut SNAP or other things that are currently being paid for through the state budget.”
In addition to shifting the costs to the states, the proposal would expand a current work requirement for SNAP recipients. With some exceptions, able-bodied people up to age 54 who receive food benefits are required to work 80 hours a month or face a time limit on receiving SNAP assistance. Under the bill, those work requirements would be required through age 64. Parents of children age 7 and above, with some exceptions, would be subject to the work requirement. 
An estimated 80,000 West Virginia residents become subject to the work requirements or live in household with someone who does, Allen said. 
Amy Wolfe, executive director of the Charleston soup kitchen Manna Meal, said the cuts to food assistance would be devastating to the people her program serves. Wolfe estimates that at least 80% of Manna Meal clients get SNAP benefits. Her program helps families fill in the gaps that the SNAP program does not cover, she said. 
“Millions of families could lose access to healthy foods that literally we need,” she said. “These are the foods that we need to thrive, and we’re going to cut that? I mean, we’re talking children, seniors, people with disabilities, people without stable access to health care because of the Medicaid cuts — all of our local economies will be affected.”
The bill also eliminates funding to SNAP-Ed, the educational arm of the SNAP program. In West Virginia, SNAP Ed supports the West Virginia University Extension program. Kristin McCartney,  public health specialist and director of the SNAP education programs with WVU Extension, said the cuts would decimate staffing for the extension service, which currently has 40 staff educators in addition to administrative staff. 
“There would probably only be enough funding for potentially, like half of that,” she told West Virginia Watch. 
The West Virginia Democratic Party condemned Moore and Miller’s support for the bill, calling the legislation “a massive tax giveaway to the ultra-wealthy that slashes essential services for working families across West Virginia.”
In the statement, party vice chair Teresa Toriseva called the bill “a disaster for West Virginians and a betrayal of the very people Moore and Miller were elected to represent.”

Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to stop the bill from progressing through the Senate.
The U.S. House narrowly passed the “big, beautiful bill” early Thursday in a 215-214 vote, sending it to the Senate. Measures included in the package include an extension of the 2017 tax law enacted during President Donald Trump’s first term in office, increased spending for border security and defense, and a $4 trillion lift to the country’s debt limit.
It also includes provisions that would make major changes to Medicaid, reducing spending for the health coverage program by $625 billion over 10 years, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. It also shifts some of the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to state governments. CBO analysis found these changes would result in income losses for low-income families across the country, but would increase resources for the highest earners in the U.S. in coming years.

All of Iowa’s current U.S. representatives are Republican, and all voted in favor of the bill Thursday. Three of the four representatives were also involved in the process of passing parts of the budget reconciliation package through committees earlier in May, including the pieces making changes to SNAP and Medicaid.
U.S. Reps. Zach Nunn and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, both Republicans currently representing districts that are considered possible pick-ups for Democrats in the 2026 midterms, have repeatedly defended their support of the bill against criticism from Democrats and others who say the cuts to public assistance programs like Medicaid will hurt Iowans.
Nunn released a statement Thursday saying the bill is a “win for Iowa” by extending tax cuts and providing assistance to farmers and businesses.
“The bill also safeguards key benefit programs for vulnerable Iowans while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,” Nunn said. “It bolsters border security, restores accountability, and invests in American energy dominance — where Iowa is already leading the charge.”
Miller-Meeks similarly praised the bill, saying it will help Iowans who need public assistance by taking steps like “removing illegal immigrants from Medicaid” and preventing future tax hikes.
“As a former small business owner and Army veteran, I know what’s at stake,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “This bill protects Iowa families, seniors, and small businesses while strengthening Medicaid for the vulnerable — not for those who can work and choose not to. I’m especially proud that my two bills to improve Medicaid integrity and expand access to pediatric care were included. Today’s vote is a win for Iowa and for every American who believes in work, responsibility, and a government that serves its people, not the other way around.”
In the wake of the bill’s passage, several Iowa organizations opposed to the cuts warned that if the budget reconciliation package becomes law, thousands of Iowans could lose health coverage or struggle to pay for food. Evan Schultz, a Des Moines resident with quadriplegia who works at Central Iowa Center for Independent Living, said in a Fairness for Iowa news release that he relies on Medicaid and SNAP to live independently.
“My Congressman chose tax breaks for billionaires over me,” Schultz said in the news release. “I can’t tell you how sad, scary and disappointing this is. Medicaid and SNAP don’t make anyone rich. They help us get by. They help me live on my own and make sure I have enough to eat. If I get kicked off Medicaid my life will be upside down, but at least I have my family to turn to. For many, their lives will be over.”
Iowa Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, who is running as a Democratic candidate in Iowa’s 3rd District, said Nunn went back on earlier pledges to defend Medicaid and SNAP.
“Zach Nunn is the worst type of politician,” Trone Garriott said in a Thursday statement. “Just last month, Nunn vowed to block any attempt to cut Medicaid or SNAP benefits – but it was just talk. His actions show who he really is: last night he voted to rip away health care and food assistance from Iowans already struggling with the rising cost of living.”
In a news release, Nunn pointed to a provision included in the budget reconciliation bill that he advocated for which prohibits consideration of future funding cuts to SNAP and Medicaid for people under age 19, 65 and older, pregnant women and people with disabilities.
While the measure passed the House, the Senate is expected to make changes to the bill — meaning it will be sent back to the House for another round of consideration before reaching Trump.
State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, urged U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst to vote against the budget package as it goes through the Senate during a Thursday news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched earlier in May to oppose Trump administration policies. Wahls spoke alongside Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, who served as administrator of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) during the Biden administration, about the potential loss of Medicaid coverage for Iowans that could occur if the budget reconciliation bill is passed.
Wahls said the GOP funding plan will “cuts health care funding that 700,000 Iowans rely on.”
“I can tell you exactly what voting for this so-called budget means: It means a $518 million hole blown in our state budget, it means 86,000 Iowans losing their health care and higher costs for hundreds of thousands of Iowa families,” Wahls said. “While the ultra rich are going to get a big, beautiful tax cut, it’s middle class and working Iowans who are going to get stuck with the bill.”
Wahls quoted Ernst speaking during a tele-town hall Monday with U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, when the senator acknowledged there were “hiccups” involved in some federal funding cuts made through the Department of Government Efficiency.
“I’m not going to say that there’s not a little pain involved with that because we know there is,” Ernst said, the Gazette reported. “But, we are trying to do it in a meaningful manner here in Congress and take into consideration what our Iowans are thinking.”
Wahls said this approach cannot be taken for cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
“When you cut food assistance school meals for kids and Meals on Wheels for seniors, it’s not ‘a little pain,’ It’s 116,000 Iowans going hungry,” Wahls said. “When my neighbors and constituents can’t see a doctor because you cut their health care, it’s not a little pain, it’s a matter of life or death. Iowa deserves better than politicians who just shrug their shoulders at suffering and dismiss it as ‘a little pain’ while they hand out tax breaks to their billionaire donors.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, also Republican, said in a May 14 call with reporters that negotiations are continuing on the bill in the Senate, but that he wants a bill that “is going to be pro-growth and deliver policies that are good for Iowans.”
“We can’t let everything just fall apart, because we’re going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, with the sunsetting of the 2017 tax bill,” Grassley said. “We’ve got to keep it going.”

In her final official appearance before lawmakers, Wyoming Supreme Court Chief Justice Kate Fox defended the process for choosing the state’s judges. But some lawmakers still want changes.
The post As scrutiny of judges grows, lawmakers weigh changes to Wyoming’s selection process appeared first on WyoFile .","For her final official appearance before a legislative committee, Wyoming Supreme Court Chief Justice Kate Fox visited Torrington on May 19 prepared to defend the state’s judiciary system.
Weeks before the meeting, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus had criticized the judiciary in a pair of blog posts. Citing recent court decisions and some judicial nominations, the caucus’ blog post alleged Wyoming’s process for selecting judges was shaped by “political insiders” and “left-wing institutional capture.”
Fox’s rebuttal came from the book of rules governing Wyoming judges. 
“A judge shall not be swayed by public clamor or fear of criticism,” Fox read from the book, drawing from a chapter dealing with questions of external pressures.
“Our job is to follow the laws,” she added. “Not to be subject to the popular will, because what we do is often not popular.” 
The Freedom Caucus’ push for lawmakers to scrutinize the state’s judiciary system comes as President Donald Trump and his allies increasingly clash with, and criticize, federal judges, even calling for their impeachment in some cases. It also comes as the state waits for a momentous decision from the Wyoming Supreme Court on whether legislative attempts to block abortion access are constitutional. 
And for Fox, the scrutiny comes as her time on the bench ends. After 11 years presiding on the state’s high court, the law requires her to step down at age 70. Her last day is May 27. So, in an era where a new guard is changing Wyoming politics, the Joint Judiciary Committee meeting played host to a vivid, if respectful, exchange between the outgoing chief justice and a group of mostly freshmen lawmakers aligned with the Freedom Caucus. 
Those lawmakers questioned Fox as to why Wyoming’s system for nominating judges was, in large part, walled off to public scrutiny, without elections or necessitating Senate approval for appointments.
Some of the changes suggested by lawmakers would open the judiciary to the kind of “political and financial influence” its rules currently guard against, Fox said. 
But the Judiciary Committee decided to consider a significant change to the judge-nominating process at its August meeting in Casper. The committee voted 8-6 to have the Legislative Service Office draft a joint resolution that would ask voters if they wanted the Wyoming Senate to have final approval over the appointment of new state Supreme Court justices.
It was the second of two close votes as Rep. Jayme Lien, R-Casper, sought to find a path for the committee to take up a bill draft, against the wishes of its two chairmen — Sen. Jared Olsen, a Cheyenne Republican and attorney, and Rep. Art Washut, a Casper Republican.
Lien’s first motion, for a bill that would have changed state law without going to voters, failed on a tie vote. That bill would have required Senate confirmation for all new judges, not just supreme court justices. 
The swing vote between the two motions was longtime Sen. Larry Hicks, R-Baggs.

Rep. Laurie Bratten, R-Sheridan, had sought to add days to the Joint Judiciary Committee’s meeting agenda for studying judicial reform — something Freedom Caucus leaders previously indicated to WyoFile they hoped a committee would explore during the time between legislative sessions. Olsen overruled that idea. Lien said she was moving for the joint resolution to ensure the committee scrutinizes the topic. 
“Ultimately, I’d like the entire nominating commission to go away,” she said before a vote on her first motion, “but … we’re not going to get enough time to discuss that.” 
Wyoming selects judges today under what is commonly called the Missouri Plan, where a commission reviews applicants and sends a limited set of choices to the governor for a final pick.
In Wyoming, the Judicial Nominating Commission is composed of seven people. Three are attorneys, elected from within the Wyoming State Bar, and three are non-lawyers who are appointed by the governor. The seventh member, who serves as chairperson and tie breaker, is the chief justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court. 
Fox repeatedly told lawmakers she believed there already was public input in both the selection and retention of judges. In selecting judges, that comes principally because people can weigh in with the governor, who makes the ultimate decision on what candidate to nominate for a bench seat.
When a judgeship opens, the Judicial Nominating Commission fields and reviews applications for the position. 
The names of applicants are not made public. Those names stay confidential for two reasons, Fox said. One is to allow practicing attorneys to apply without signaling to their clients or law firms that they’re pursuing a new job. The other reason, she said, is to insulate the nominees and the process from political pressure. Fox and two nominating commission members previously interviewed by WyoFile described the review of applicants as a study of their merits and judicial temperaments that includes feedback from attorneys and judges. 
Once the commission vets candidates, it sends three nominations to the governor. At that point, the public can weigh in. That’s an option Freedom Caucus lawmakers have exercised in the past, such as when former Republican lawmaker Tim Stubson was among the three nominations in 2023 — Stubson was involved in fundraising and campaign efforts that sought to blunt the Freedom Caucus’ rise in the Legislature. 
Gov. Mark Gordon picked Robert Jarosh for the bench over Stubson. 
Judges also appear on the ballot in Wyoming, Fox noted. Though they’re appointed into office, voters have an opportunity to vote them out every four, six or eight years, depending on the level of court they serve in. State Supreme Court justices only face retention elections every eight years. 
Notably, Fox said she and others in the judiciary would consider publicizing the names of applicants for judgeships while they’re under consideration by the Judicial Nominating Commission. “I think the court would be open to revising that process,” she said. 
But on the whole, Fox questioned lawmakers’ motivation for scrutinizing the state’s third branch of government. 
“I really need to push back on a lot of the basis for this conversation,” Fox said. “What really is the problem? We have some very good judges in Wyoming. So, before we start saying ‘how can we fix it?’ I really want to know what is wrong with it.”
The most recent polling available shows more residents approve of how the state’s judges handle their jobs than disapprove. In polling conducted last September and October by the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center, only 13% of respondents told the center they disapproved of how judges handle their jobs, while more than 40% of respondents said they approved.

In its blog posts, the Freedom Caucus cited specific court decisions they didn’t like. Chief among them was a Teton County judge’s ruling against the Legislature’s 2023 abortion ban, and a more recent decision by a Natrona County judge to pause a transvaginal ultrasound requirement and stringent regulations lawmakers sought to place on Wyoming’s only abortion clinic, which is in Casper. 
Rep. Tom Kelly, R-Sheridan, told WyoFile he did not believe the Wyoming judiciary system was in need of stringent reforms. But he said a series of politically charged court decisions — in both Wyoming and nationally — drew fresh attention to the way judges are selected in Wyoming, and people found the system opaque.
Publicizing the names of judicial applicants could allow people concerned about the system to better understand who was applying and who wasn’t making the cut, he said. “Anything that government institutions can do to be open and transparent will help bolster faith in our system again,” he said. 
Lien’s proposal for Senate approval of new supreme court justices brings a major practical question with it: With a citizen legislature, the Wyoming Senate is only in session two months a year or less. Several lawmakers in Torrington questioned what would happen if a supreme court seat came open when lawmakers weren’t in Cheyenne.
In the moment, Lien did not have an answer for that question — saying she wanted to order a draft bill so the committee could craft a policy together at its next meeting. 
While Lien only needed a majority of the committee to agree to draft the bill, there is a higher hurdle for the committee to vote to sponsor the bill when the Legislature convenes in 2026. The proposal will need the backing of a majority of the representatives and a majority of the senators on the committee for sponsorship. 
And because next year’s legislative gathering is a budget session, such a bill would need to receive two-thirds support for introduction.

Advocates and lawmakers in favor of the bill oppose the use of eminent domain by the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol facilities in Iowa, and neighboring states, to underground storage in North Dakota. 
Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuel Association’s executive director, said on the call that HF 639 does not protect landowners from eminent domain, but specifically targets carbon capture pipelines. 
“You hear a lot of talk about principles, but what we see are bills that are about preferences,” Shaw said.
Impact to other projects
Mike Jerke, the CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, an ethanol facility in Council Bluffs, said the bill would impact his ability to connect to the Tallgrass Trailblazer carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska, even though he has been able to secure 100% voluntary easements for the project.
The project in Nebraska is operated by Tallgrass and converts an existing pipeline owned by the company into a carbon capture pipeline that is projected to be operational at the end of 2025. Jerke said SIRE has plans to start capturing its CO2 by mid 2026, following the construction of the technology. 
Jerke said even though he has no need nor intent to use eminent domain to connect to the pipeline in Nebraska, HF 639 would impact his project. 
HF 639 requires pipeline operators to carry insurance that would cover any loss or injury that occurs from accidental, negligent or intentional discharges from the pipeline. It also requires pipeline operators foot the bill if landowners have increased insurance premiums because of the pipeline. 
“So apparently, we need to go find a product, an insurance product, who will allow us to do something that would be in violation of the very permit that we’re applying for,” Jerke said. 
Jerke said his project, and future projects in the state, are also impacted by the provision in the bill that limits carbon sequestration pipelines to just a single, 25-year term, without an opportunity for renewal. 
“We’re making a significant investment — we have contracts in place for over $45 million to build the equipment on our site to capture and compress the CO2,” Jerke said. “Apparently, this is going to be, if this were to stand or be signed into law, something that we would only be able to operate for 25 years.” 
Shaw no one would built a house or a business on Main Street if they knew in 25 years, they would have to walk away from the project, without the ability to sell it, or renew the permit. 
“This fall, Iowa will no longer be the world’s most profitable place to turn corn into ethanol,” Shaw said. “The moment Tallgrass starts operating and the plants hooked up to Tallgrass in Nebraska can sequester, the premium they will get in the market … will make Nebraska the most profitable place in the world to produce ethanol.” 
Shaw said this will impact Iowa facilities, not just in terms of canceling planned carbon capture expansion, but could also lead to the closure of several plants. 
Vic Miller, a Fayette County farmer and member of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the bill impacts the “very viability” of corn growers.
Corn farmers are projected to produce nearly 16 billion bushels in yield this year and have around 1.8 billion in carryout, or grain left after demand, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data analyzed by National Corn Growers Association.
“It’s ahead of anything we’ve ever raised,” Miller said. “Once you get above that 2 billion mark in carryout, basis widens, everything just goes south.” 
Corn farmers and the ethanol industry see entry to ultra-low carbon markets, most prominently the sustainable aviation fuel industry, as the best opportunity to expand the market. 


Federal action
Pipeline opponents were worried by language in early drafts of the U.S. House budget reconciliation bill that would have allowed pipeline operators to work around state permitting agencies, and laws like HF 639, and a South Dakota law banning eminent domain for CO2 pipelines.
The language was removed from the bill, which passed the House early Thursday.

Those in support of the bill, including the Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club and the Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, have been celebrating the passage of HF 639. 
A press release from Bold Alliance and the Iowa Easement Team said the bill does not fulfill landowners’ primary goal of banning eminent domain for CO2 projects, but does “protect landowners” via the new insurance mandate and impact the Summit project via the change in definition of a common carrier.
“We still have work to do to ensure Iowa bans eminent domain for carbon pipelines,” Jess Mazour with the Sierra Club said in the release. “We will be back in 2026 to fight for a ban …. This will be a leading election issue.” 
The Free Soil Foundation, a citizen group opposing CO2 pipelines, urged Iowans to call the governor’s office and voice support for the bill, which it called “a major step forward in protecting Iowa landowners and preserving constitutionally-protected property rights.”
IRFA has also been urging its members to call the governor, who has not indicated if she will sign the bill or veto it. 
“What would happen if she signs it? I’m not willing to think about that yet,” Shaw said. “I’m only worried about how we can get Iowans to reach out and say, regardless of how you feel about CO2, this bill has really massive negative unintended consequences that will impact all forms of energy, all forms of economic development across the state.”

Jane Raybould of Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature will retake a vote on a proposal to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases – but likely not this session. 
A Democratic-led minority and Republican-led majority in the officially nonpartisan body fought Thursday over whether to allow reconsideration of the vote on Lincoln State Sen. Jane Raybould’s Legislative Bill 258. 
Raybould, whose family owns a grocery store chain that includes Super Saver, is the lone Democrat supporting the slowdown. State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont is the lone Republican opposing the bill.
The rest of the Legislature’s Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive who usually votes with them, argued against ignoring “the will of the people.” They celebrated a brief tactical victory May 14 by forcing a faster vote while one GOP senator was off the floor and missed the vote.
“Hats off to the opponents. Well played and well within the rules, just as this motion … is in order and appropriate,” State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse said. “We’re here today due to a heat of the moment.” 
Raybould’s revived proposal, in its current form, would shrink voter-approved annual wage increases by setting the annual increase at 1.75%. It also would create a youth minimum wage and amend a separate state training wage to limit it to workers aged 16 to 19 at 75% of the state minimum wage later this year, rather than at 75% of the federal wage. Training workers can earn that wage for up to the employee’s first 90 days on the job.
Under the voter-approved law, workers would see larger wage increases. Currently, the state minimum wage is $9 an hour. If lawmakers do nothing, voters will increase that to $15 next year. Then the base wage would increase each year based on a cost of living measurement, a calculation of inflation for the Midwest region from the previous August. 
The same lawmakers who used the rules to force a quicker vote and kill the bill challenged the legitimacy of the motion to reconsider. Speaker John Arch pointed to a reconsideration motion on a bill in 1984 as precedent, allowing State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln to file a reconsideration motion after all.

A reconsideration motion requires a senator on the “prevailing” side to want to change a vote, or the requesting senator must have missed the vote. Ballard voted “no” after realizing Sorrentino had missed the vote. 
“I disagree that this is in order,” Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said. “But even if it is in order, it’s a waste of the people’s time. If not, break, bend the rules in an effort to continue our parade of walking back the people’s votes. It’s kind of an embarrassment for the body.” 
Raybould pushed back on the idea that she was messing with the people’s will, saying she made  “a commitment to follow the rules of this body and not bend the rules, despite what so many might be saying today.”
She previously told reporters that she is uncomfortable with suspending legislative rules to bring back her bill. Raybould and supporters of her measure said her changes would protect small businesses that could not afford to pay more. 
“I am saddened that the debate on previous rounds of debate on this bill became ugly, heated and personal,” Raybould said. “It didn’t have to, and that was a choice as well.” 
Thursday’s push was the latest part of a trend of the GOP-majority Legislature pushing back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters on requiring paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, repealing school vouchers and legalizing medical marijuana. 
Arch said he didn’t intend to reschedule the bill for a vote for the remainder of the legislative session. He told a reporter that it’s a “matter of fairness,” because he is “just flat out of time.” 
“I’ve got 11 general file priority bills that are not going to be able to make it to the floor,” Arch said. “In fairness to those that have not been able to get on the floor … it’s not appropriate to bring a bill back for a vote, take perhaps another two hours … take time.”
The political dynamics facing the bill could change next year as voters see base wages increase to $15. Raybould’s proposal, if passed next year, would claw back some of the increases that young people would get under the current law, which Raybould acknowledges. 
“Sadly, what I think will happen come [next] January, and I’ve heard through several small businesses that I’ve been in contact with and have emailed me that they probably won’t hire 14- and 15-year olds,” Raybould said. “They’ll just give more hours to those that have been with them … more years.” 
If Raybould decides not to wait, Ballard and Raybould both said they’re still open to amending Raybould’s proposal into his paid sick leave bill. His proposal would weaken a voter-approved paid sick leave framework, using similar arguments to hers. Ballard said he would prefer to keep his bill clean.

Ryan Zinke speaks at a press conference announcing the launch of the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus on May 7, 2025. (Courtesy photo)Calling it his “San Juan Hill,” a reference to a Spanish-American War battle victory by Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders, Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke announced Wednesday he had successfully led a bipartisan charge to remove a provision to sell public lands from the federal budget bill. 
The provision to sell off roughly 450,000 acres of federal land in Utah and Nevada passed out of the House Natural Resources Committee in early May, but met opposition from conservation groups and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
The proposed sale and exchanges of land involved areas near Las Vegas, Reno and St. George, Utah, aimed at allowing for affordable housing developments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Land. 
Zinke, a Republican and former Interior Secretary who formed the new bipartisan Public Lands Caucus the day after the provision was adopted in committee, has been a strong opponent to the sale of federal public land. 
“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a press release on Wednesday. “Public access, sportsmanship, grazing, tourism… our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”
The House Rules Committee removed the provision from the budget bill after opposition from several Western Republicans, including Zinke, Rep. Troy Downing, R-Montana, and Public Lands Caucus Vice Chairman Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. 
The opposition to public lands sale threatened to derail President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping 1,116-page bill that contains the administration’s spending priorities.
With the federal land transfer portion struck from the reconciliation package, Zinke and Downing both endorsed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which includes extending the Trump Administration’s tax cuts from 2017, increasing funding for the border wall, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and temporarily eliminates taxes on overtime work and tips. 
The bill could also cut funding from programs such as Medicaid and SNAP benefits, which states may have to fund in order to keep service levels intact. It also includes implementing work requirements for Medicaid within two years and accelerates the phase-out of clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden. 
The bill, which passed an initial House vote by a single vote, still faces opposition for its price tag. The Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates it would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation’s debt.
 Public lands in public hands 

Multiple conservation groups released statements praising the work done by Zinke, and thousands of constituents nationwide, to remove the public lands sale amendment from the bill. 
“Tens of thousands of Montana hunters, anglers, and other outdoor enthusiasts have been flooding the Capitol switchboard, attending weekend rallies, and writing letters and postcards to Congress, asking that the public lands transfer amendment be killed,” said Mike Mershon, board chair and president of the Montana Wildlife Federation, in a statement. .
“Selling our shared public lands to pay for tax cuts for the rich was and is an awful, un-American idea, and we appreciate Rep Zinke’s work to keep it out of the bill. His colleagues never should have considered it in the first place,” Lydia Weiss, senior director for government relations at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement. 
Montana Conservation Voters, Trout Unlimited, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, MeatEater and other groups also released statements. 
The success in appealing to Republican leaders to make the change marked a strong win for the new members of the Public Lands Caucus. 
Downing said in a statement that he was pleased the bill removed the public lands sale, and that it includes keeping the Bull Mountains Mine in Musselshell County operational. 
“Our legislation delivers historic tax cuts, secures our borders, strengthens key programs for future generations, eliminates waste, fraud, and abuse, and sets the country on a path toward fiscal responsibility,” Downing said. “Our work is not done, but Republicans will not rest until this once-in-a-generation legislation is signed by the President.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/831A4227-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

Customers around Illinois will see significantly higher prices on their electric bills next month.

Customers around Illinois will see significantly higher prices on their electric bills next month.

The average residential customer of northern Illinois’ Commonwealth Edison will pay about $10.60 per month more this summer, according to a company statement. Downstate Ameren Illinois customers, meanwhile, can expect an 18% to 22% increase in their monthly bill. Prices will likely decrease in October once winter electric rates go into effect.

Increasing energy prices are causing alarm among some consumer advocates and state policymakers, who worry that the long-term problems underlying the rising costs could lead to even higher prices or rolling blackouts.

Clara Summers, who advocates for consumer-friendly energy policy on behalf of the nonprofit Citizens Utility Board, said the ComEd price increases were for two reasons: increasing demand from data centers and large manufacturing as well as procedural issues slowing down new renewable projects.

CUB officials said the issues underlying Ameren’s increase were similar, while noting that both were due in part to the way grid regulators structure pricing.

The price hikes are a major undercurrent of escalating tensions over a package of energy reforms making its way through Springfield as lawmakers race toward their scheduled May 31 adjournment.

“We’re trying to keep prices low while combating climate change,” Jen Walling, head of the Illinois Environmental Council, told Capitol News Illinois. The IEC has been heavily involved in advocating for parts of the bill.

In December, federal officials at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation — the nonprofit oversight agency for grid operators — designated the grid for central and southern Illinois as “high risk” for not having enough electricity to meet demand on hot days in the summer and cold days in the winter over the next five years. The grid that stretches from central Canada to the Mississippi river delta is the only power grid in the nation to have that designation, with much of its risk stemming from power plants closing.

Illinois’ northern grid, which includes parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. from Illinois to the east coast, faces “elevated” risk. That means extreme weather events are “likely” to cause shortfalls in energy reserves.

The increased demand stems from data centers, increasing adoption of electric heat pumps and the rise of electric vehicles, according to NERC.

David Braun, an executive at the energy technology company Intelligent Generation, said demand on the electric grid is the highest it’s been in the 30 years he’s worked in the energy sector.

“We haven’t seen this in a long time,” Braun told Capitol News Illinois. “So, it’s catching planners by surprise, and it takes a long time to build power plants.”

Shrinking supply

That demand, according to NERC’s December report, is coming at the same time supply is going down — increasing pressure on the grid.

Around the country, fossil fuel plants are closing as states move to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. While Illinois exports energy overall, plant closures elsewhere in the country can affect the price of energy, raising prices for Illinoisans. Grid operators nationwide, meanwhile, face yearslong red tape-induced backlogs on new renewables.

Downstate Illinois’ grid might run out of energy reserves as soon as 2034, per NERC. Northern Illinois’ grid has more reserves but will face decreased levels throughout the next decade. If nothing is done to either reduce demand or increase supply, this means prices could continue to increase or blackouts could become necessary to stabilize the grid.

To address these issues, lawmakers in Springfield are weighing sweeping energy legislation. The bill’s proponents say its provisions to incentivize new developments are the only way to prevent serious problems without walking back the state’s climate goals.

Republican critics contend that the main reason for the legislation is to fix problems with the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. Gov. JB Pritzker’s marquee climate policy, they say, is a major cause of the supply shortfalls because it requires fossil fuel-burning power plants to shut down by 2045.

Others say provisions aimed at reducing data centers’ energy demands on the grid will hurt businesses in the state.

Lawmakers and advocacy groups are currently reviewing draft language for the bill, which has not been made public. Even with complex procedural maneuvering to avoid long-passed deadlines, lawmakers face a tight turnaround to reach an agreement before the legislative session ends.

The process could have become more complicated, some suggest, after the U.S. House passed a wide-ranging bill early Thursday that could drastically alter federal energy incentives if it becomes law.

Higher prices

Bills for customers of private electric utilities — most notably ComEd and Ameren — will go up in June.

The increase was determined at two recent capacity auctions, which are how grid operators set energy prices for years into the future. High prices at these auctions can indicate low supply relative to demand.

PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for northern Illinois, saw a roughly eight-fold jump in its most recent capacity auction compared to the year prior. Downstate’s energy grid, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, saw more than a 20-fold year-over-year price jump at its capacity auction in April.

Representatives of the state’s two largest electric utilities stressed that these increases occurred beyond their purview.

“ComEd does not profit from this increase, was not part of the auction, does not supply capacity, and does not retain any proceeds of the capacity charge payments,” ComEd spokesperson John Schoen said in a statement.

An Ameren spokesperson echoed the sentiment, noting that the state requires utilities to pass this type of cost to customers “dollar-for-dollar, without markup.”

The price is lower for ComEd customers than it could have been due to a provision in CEJA, which credits customers when energy generated by nuclear power plants is above a certain level. Consumer watchdogs at CUB estimate that the policy cut the increase for ComEd customers by about 17%. Customers in the Ameren area, which has much less nuclear power, are not eligible for the credit.

Other energy providers

While millions of Illinoisans get their power from ComEd and Ameren, some get their electricity through other means, including alternate retail suppliers, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives. Many of these energy suppliers are not affected directly by the capacity auctions.

Municipal customers in towns like Naperville, St. Charles and Rantoul are largely insulated from the spike, according to Staci Wilson, the head of government affairs for the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency. The IMEA is a private entity that provides electricity to 32 of the 42 municipal electric systems in the state.

IMEA sometimes participates in capacity auctions. But Wilson said the agency tends to secure energy through other means, such as having ownership stakes directly in power plants.

“IMEA member municipalities have rates that are currently lower than private utilities and our ownership model continues to gain value as we transition to a carbon-free future in an affordable and reliable manner,” Wilson said.

But other municipal utility officials, including those at Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power, are less optimistic about future prices.

“Regulations are forcing plant retirement a little too soon,” CWLP spokesperson Amber Sabin said. “And the grid operators that are here, they have resources that they can't connect to the grid. They're waiting, or they don't get financing or ever developed. They have supply chain issues, workforce issues, right? There's a cost to all of that.”

CWLP didn’t participate in the recent MISO auction, although it could have. The utility shut down several coal-fired generators over the past five years but continues to operate one coal-fired power plant on the southeast side of Springfield. That plant will need to shut down permanently at some point in the next two decades under state law.

“In the future, all the costs are going to go up,” Sabin said. “We do expect that capacity auction prices will affect our customers.”

That echoes what some state officials expect as well. Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, has worked on energy legislation for years and said that there is “nothing we can do” to reduce prices for this summer as capacity auctions have concluded, but he said lawmakers should do what they can to address the root causes of the spike.

“We think this is going to be the new normal,” Cunningham said.

Legislative moves

Negotiations over energy reforms in Springfield have included lawmakers, the governor’s office, and interest groups including environmentalists, organized labor and business associations. The process is sparking heated debate.

Over the past week, a draft of legislation began circulating among lawmakers and advocates, many of whom discussed portions of the bill with Capitol News Illinois.

“I don’t think, by any stretch, you’ll see a bill the size and scope that CEJA was, that we passed four years ago — certainly won’t see that,” Cunningham, who was involved in the negotiations, said.

Potential provisions deal with incentives for renewable power, energy efficiency regulations, nuclear power, data centers and more.

Environmental groups clashed with business and labor this week over a provision meant to lower the energy burden brought by data centers. That proposal would require large energy consumers to build their own energy generation through renewable sources like wind or solar power or pay the state to do so.

The pitch sparked fierce pushback from business and labor groups, which sent a collective letter to Pritzker, urging him to oppose the specific provision. The letter was co-signed by groups including the AFL-CIO, Climate Jobs Illinois, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and Constellation Energy — the last of which operates all the state’s commercial nuclear power plants.

The proposal is being pushed by environmentalists, who say they want more accountability from data centers and other large consumers.

“We cannot allow these power-hungry facilities to drive up costs for consumers who are already struggling to pay their bills,” Gina Ramirez, director of Midwest environmental health at the National Resources Defense Council, said at a Wednesday rally.

Other issues are less controversial, largely because they’ve been negotiated for months.

Cunningham, a prominent player in the passage of CEJA, has his own proposal in the current draft: incentives for the energy storage industry. The current draft of that provision closely parallels recommendations made by the Illinois Commerce Commission. That agency was directed by a bill passed earlier this year to study how to handle energy storage projects.

While legislative Republicans have largely been shut out of negotiations over the bill, some of their ideas are being considered.

Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, put out a pitch to ease the pressure on electric demand earlier this year by expanding nuclear energy. She was the architect of a bill two years ago that eased the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants, lifting it for next-generation, small generators.

This year, Rezin introduced a bill that would eliminate the remaining state restrictions on new nuclear power plants. Language similar to Rezin’s was included in draft legislation circulated this week.

Rezin, who leads several energy-related groups of lawmakers as part of her involvement at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said all states are facing similar issues around electricity.

“All energy buildout will take years because of the regulatory process,” Rezin said. “That's why it's important now. The state of Illinois needs to send positive messages to companies that are looking to invest in technology — whether it's nuclear or any other kind of energy producing plant — that we are open for business.”

The feds’ ‘big, beautiful bill’

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday morning passed a bill containing many domestic policy priorities of President Donald Trump that many fear could upend state energy policy.

The bill contains provisions rolling back several clean energy tax incentives. Several key solar company stock prices fell sharply Thursday morning in response, including NextEra Energy, FirstSolar and Enphase Energy among others.

The solar industry has been a key part of Illinois’ renewable energy plans and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Lesley McCain, the head of the Illinois Solar Energy & Storage Association, said that the bill could “cause solar energy companies of all sizes to cancel projects, and many will be forced to shut their doors.”

Environmentalists were quick to criticize the federal bill, which still requires negotiation and an eventual vote in the U.S. Senate before it can become law.

“It strips funding for climate programs, guts clean energy manufacturing, kills good union jobs, drives energy prices up, and abandons farmers and small business owners,” Walling said in a statement.

Illinois Republicans, meanwhile, expressed optimism that some of the bill’s provisions could help the fossil fuel sector in the state.

“If the federal government is going to help us to, you know, power up coal, power up gas — we want all energy,” Illinois House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, said at a news conference. “We want solar, we want wind, we want nuke, we want coal. We want all of it.”

Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, noted that the federal bill should not “be used as an excuse to rush forward” on the energy legislation under consideration in Springfield.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A man who died at the Milwaukee County Jail earlier this week has been identified as Gabriel Muniz-Jimenez, 33. Records from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office, obtained by Wisconsin Examiner, show that Muniz-Jimenez was pronounced dead Wednesday at 10:56 p.m. He is the second person to die in the jail so far this year. 
On Thursday, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) reported that an unidentified 33-year-old man had died after his cellmate reported to correctional officers that the man “appeared to be unconscious and in medical distress,” Urban Milwaukee reported.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The sheriff’s office said that the deceased man had been booked into the jail in November on felony methamphetamine possession. Online court records show that Muniz-Jimenez was charged with methamphetamine possession in April 2024 and the court case was filed in July. 
Booking information online shows that Muniz-Jimenez was booked into the jail in late November on methamphetamine charges. Court records showed that Muniz-Jimenez required a Spanish interpreter in court. 
The sheriff’s office announcement this week said officers attempted lifesaving measures including the use of Narcan, which can reverse an opioid overdose. A demographic report from the Medical Examiner’s Office on Muniz-Jimenez labels the cause as undetermined. MCSO has not responded to a request for comment, and the Waukesha County Sheriffs Department, which is investigating the death, declined to identify who died in the jail. The MCSO is a member of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), which handles officer-involved deaths such as shootings and in-custody deaths. 
The Milwaukee County Jail has garnered controversy for deaths in recent years. The 2022 suicide of 21-year-old Brieon Green was the first of six in a 14-month period, and families of people who died have allied with activists to call attention to the deaths. In March, 48-year-old Joseph Boivin died at Froedtert Hospital after being found by a nurse in the middle of a health emergency at the jail. A jail audit detected numerous issues, including use of force and what the auditors called “dangerous suicide watch practices.”  
A recent review by the Texas-based auditor Creative Corrections found that the jail has come into full compliance with 71.2% of the proposed corrective actions, with another 28.8% being in partial compliance.

May 22, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Thursday afternoon said she has complied in good faith with House Oversight Committee subpoenas that requested the state’s election training manuals, and that their vote on the House floor to hold her in contempt was a political stunt.
Benson, who is one of several candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2026, said in a news conference that if the move resulted in a lawsuit, then she would see the Republican House caucus in court.
“We have repeatedly asked the members of this committee to meet with us over the last several months, but they have refused,” Benson said. “Now my office has released documents to the House Oversight Committee five times. We have turned over more than 3,300 pages of election documents to this committee and to the public on our department’s website. So, if … House Republicans want to go to court over this, we will see them in court.”
Three key Michigan House Republicans, including Michigan House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), on Thursday morning held a press conference saying they would request a resolution to hold Benson in contempt for bucking the subpoena request for unredacted election training manuals. DeBoyer claimed that Benson and the department were given an opportunity to meet and discuss why the materials needed to be redacted and some information shielded, but he said the department declined the offer.

In an early response to the threat of a contempt vote, the Department of State told Michigan Advance that it sent DeBoyer and others requesting the documents a letter that indicated they were more than willing to sit down and discuss the matter – but with an independent third-party mediator present. The department also questioned the scope and purpose of the inquiry.
Shortly after the Republican press conference, House session commenced, and one of the first orders of business was to approve House Resolution 117 holding Benson in contempt. The resolution was sponsored by DeBoyer and Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee. Bollin was also present at the Thursday morning press conference, along with House Election Integrity Committee Chair Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin).
Benson held her own news conference on Thursday afternoon, following the House session. 
She said has a sworn duty to protect sensitive election information from falling into the wrong hands, and that included DeBoyer, who was given authority by the House to disseminate the information provided.
The secretary of state said that could very well happen if all that information was handed over without redaction or review. Overall, Benson said that the Republican-led House’s tactics were “no way to govern a state.”
“Every day the House Republicans spend playing political games like this, while the people of Michigan are struggling to pay for housing, pay for child care and pay for their basic needs, is an affront to the people they are elected to serve,” Benson said. “This is government rooted in bullying and chaos, and I’m tired of it. It’s not only ineffective, but it is dangerous, because [Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall] is the same person who chaired a committee meeting with Rudy Giuliani in 2020 to spread lies about the 2020 election.”
Although she believes in oversight and transparency, Benson said truth rules the day and that also meant ensuring the safety and security of the state’s elections.
“You cannot bully me or abuse your authority to get access to information that, if it ends up in the wrong hands, could be used to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment or impersonate a clerk on election day,” Benson said. “The caveat that we need to be clear and careful about is information that could end up in the wrong hands and essentially enable the tampering of election equipment, impersonation of a clerk or harm the chain of custody of ballots.”
Given DeBoyer’s broad authority, Benson said those concerns about security and confidentiality were real and justified.
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel Jr. in a statement said Hall and his caucus were abusing their power and control of the House to attack their political enemies and push election conspiracy theories.
“Right now, we are seeing yet another gross overstep by MAGA Matt Hall’s House Republican caucus as they put their extremist agenda ahead of the well-being of Michiganders,” Hertel said. “At a moment when Republicans at the federal level are trying to gut Medicaid, it’s deeply concerning that Michigan Republicans are doing absolutely nothing to help Michiganders and are instead wasting time with political attacks.”
Hertel added that the move by DeBoyer and Michigan House Republicans was not about election security, but rather a push to legitimize debunked election theories.
“It’s an embarrassment, and Michiganders deserve better,” Hertel said.

Photo by Peter D’Auria/VTDiggerThese days, everything seems to be powered, augmented or enhanced by artificial intelligence: phones, software, movies, etc.Now, add the state of Vermont to that list. For the past few months, all Vermont state employees have had access to a bespoke AI chatbot named — of course — ChatVT.“It doesn’t look that exciting,” Josiah Raiche, Vermont’s chief data and AI officer, said in an interview last month. “It looks like ChatGPT, basically, with some Vermont logos on it.”ChatVT has been available to all Vermont state employees since early 2025. Roughly 300 employees use it each week, Raiche said in April, for a variety of tasks: rewriting text on state websites to be more accessible to the public, coding state software, data processing, drafting and summarizing lengthy reports.In different areas of state government, the bot is trained with different documents: “Based on the teams that you’re in, the tool will have access to policies and background information that’s relevant,” Raiche said. State IT staffers built the bot with technology from OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, but with added privacy protections.“That all happens in a way that OpenAI doesn’t get access to our data,” Raiche said. “All of our data stays in our environment.” The tool costs the state roughly $300 a month in computing expenses.Last month, Raiche gave a reporter a demonstration of the chatbot: He copied and pasted language from a piece of legislation into a text field and told the AI that he runs a state technology division. “What areas of this bill should I focus on?” he asked. “What additional work might this make for my team?”ChatVT responded with a list of potential topics to look at, including “data security and privacy protocols” and “legal and compliance monitoring.”The response looked professionally done and comprehensive — something that Raiche said could be misleading. He gave another example in which he asked the bot to provide a recipe for eggs Benedict, in a bureaucratic style suitable for the Federal Register. It complied with a report of the “components, historical context, preparation methodology, variations, and nutritional data” of the dish.“Like, this looks like good content, but this is useless,” Raiche said. The bot is an example of why the Agency of Digital Services describes Vermont as a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in state government. According to Denise Reilly-Hughes, who leads the agency, Vermont was the first in the nation to have a state AI director, and the first to have a state AI council, both of which were created in 2022’s Act 132.Dozens of other states have since followed in Vermont’s footsteps, Reilly-Hughes said. “Vermont has been ahead of the curve,” she said.— Peter D’AuriaIn the knowThe Vermont Senate voted Thursday to scrap its version of this year’s landmark education bill, H.454, and replace it with the version of the legislation that the House passed last month. Following an afternoon of committee hearings on a proposed amendment to the bill, senators were planning to consider changes to it on the floor Thursday evening — though it wasn’t clear when they’d arrive at a final version.In effect, the decision backtracked on weeks of work by the chamber’s education and tax-writing committees. It came less than 48 hours after Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, conceded to his colleagues within the chamber’s Democratic majority that the Senate-crafted proposal had lost substantial support. “This idea that we will take the House legislation — and we will amend it, make it better — that will require a lot of work on the floor, a lot of work from our committees,” Baruth said on the floor Thursday morning before making the procedural moves that allowed the chamber to tee up the House’s proposed bill, rather than the Senate’s proposal. Even after all that work, Baruth then acknowledged, the legislation still “may not” get enough votes to pass.The Senate only took up H.454 briefly on Thursday morning. During an afternoon session of voting on other bills, Baruth said he hoped to dive into substantial debate on a potential amendment to the House language, offered by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, on the Senate floor that evening.Read more about the proposed amendment here.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveGov. Phil Scott signed lawmakers’ state budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year into law Wednesday. The plan lays out $9.01 billion in state spending for the yearlong period starting July 1 — and includes a handful of new measures designed to limit the impacts of potential cuts to the state’s federal funding. Scott, a Republican, was notably complimentary of the House and Senate’s budget bill in a letter to legislators that accompanied his signature. Democratic leadership in both chambers, knowing they almost certainly could not override a budget veto this year, trimmed tens of millions of dollars in proposed “base” spending — money expected to be appropriated year-over-year — from the legislation after Scott insisted on cuts. The governor had proposed an $8.99 billion state budget in January.“I appreciate that this budget makes important affordability investments,” Scott wrote, pointing to lawmakers’ use of about $75 million from the state’s general fund that’s expected to help reduce the property tax bills people pay to support education, among other measures.Read more about the 2026 budget here.— Shaun RobinsonScott also signed two Senate bills into law Wednesday that immigrant rights advocates have said would bolster protections for communities they serve as the Trump administration continues its crackdown of federal immigration laws in Vermont and across the country.The governor approved S.56, which sets up a committee to study whether the state should create a new office coordinating social and economic services for people who have recently arrived in the state from other countries. He also signed S.44, which further restricts how state and local law enforcement agencies can enter into policing agreements with federal immigration enforcement officials, short of getting the governor’s approval to do so.The latter drew fairly rare praise for Scott from the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, with Falko Schilling, a lobbyist for the organization, calling it “another important step forward in building the state’s firewall against federal overreach” in a statement Wednesday.— Shaun RobinsonVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Meet ChatVT, the state of Vermont’s homemade AI chatbot.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatVT-2-05212025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

Khalil […],"Demonstrators gathered across from the Central Louisiana ICE facility in Jena to protest Mahmoud Khalil's detention on Thursday, May 22, 2025. (John Gray/Verite News)JENA – A group of protesters headed Thursday from New Orleans to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in LaSalle Parish to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil. The former Columbia University student and pro-Palestine activist was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March and has since been held in detention.
Khalil was in immigration court Thursday for a hearing on a motion from his attorneys to terminate his deportation proceedings and release him. The hearing, which began in the morning, was still ongoing by mid-afternoon.
By early afternoon, hundreds of protesters had gathered in the grass across from the detention facility, chanting, flying Palestinian flags and playing drums. Some members of the group kneeled and prayed on the street.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident who was born in Syria, faces deportation for his involvement with pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last year. He is one of a number of people the Trump administration has detained over their political activities in the last several months, drawing alarm from free speech activists.
Kristi Dayemo, 29, arrived at First Grace Methodist Church on Canal Street for a bus ride to the ICE facility in Jena, along with other New Orleans residents.
Dayemo said she comes from a service-oriented family and that she has a spirit to help people. Her parents raised her to have a duty to make the world a better place.
“If we allow him to be arrested without a warrant and deported from this country it calls into question all students that aren’t from here, whether or not they’re allowed to have their First Amendment rights,” Dayemo said.

On the way to the facility from New Orleans Thursday morning, organizers handed out snacks and prepared the riders for their day of action. Sabrine Mohamad, a human rights lawyer traveling with the group, spoke to riders on the bus ahead of the arrival to Jena.
“Today is so much bigger than Mahmoud, it’s so much bigger than all of the students that have been kidnapped by ICE. This is really a vital moment in the history of the United States democracy and Palestine,” Mohamad said.
On the way to the facility, organizers handed out snacks and prepared the riders for their day of action. Protesters discussed current events, while removing biometric authentication from their phones and writing loved ones’ phone numbers on their arms in preparation for potential arrests.

  Noor Abdalla, Mahmoud Khalil’s wife, speaks with an organizer Thursday, May 22, 2025. Abdalla and her son were able to meet with Khalil before his hearing.
Once arriving in Jena, the New Orleans protesters joined with another group that had come in from Texas. Organizers disembarked from their buses, prepared their drums and signs and began marching towards the ICE detention center. The group was greeted by facility guards who kept them from setting foot on the property.
Noor Abdalla, Khalid’s wife, came out to the crowd to thank them for their demonstrations, saying that they are keeping Khalil going as he faces deportation. Abdalla had visited with Khalil on Thursday with their newborn son, Deen. It was his first meeting with the boy, who was born while Khalil was in detention.

Both chambers of the Legislature, and the administration, have broadly agreed the state should transition to a new education funding formula and move toward consolidating school districts. But disagreement has developed over the details and the timeline. The Senate changes being considered Thursday in committee hearings — included in an amendment offered by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison — would stick with the House’s longer four-year timeframe for the transition. The new funding scheme, a foundation formula, would not go into effect until July 1, 2029, and would be contingent on new districts being formed. A foundation formula is the most common type of education funding system across the country. The approach provides districts money based on the number of students in each district and how expensive those students are to teach. Hardy’s amendment would also require a comprehensive study on how those students — such as English learners, special education students and those pursuing career and technical education — should be factored to the funding formula before it could go into effect.Meanwhile, a committee to develop new school district boundary options for consideration by the Legislature next year would largely mirror the group of public education representatives and experts assembled in the House version, though both the House and Senate would also be able to appoint two people, not just one.While the original Senate version contained no class size minimums, the amendment maintains the minimums proposed in the House version, though it adjusts them downward. Calculation of the average class sizes would be based on student populations over three years rather than two, and the state secretary of education would have discretion about whether there would be certain mandates for schools that do not meet those minimums. The House version would have required the department to take those actions.The proposed changes to the House version would increase the number of currently operating independent schools in Vermont that would remain eligible to receive public tuition once new districts are operating. The Hardy amendment would limit eligibility to schools where tuitioned public students made up 40% of the student body during the 2024-25 school year. The House version uses a 51% threshold and a different comparison year, while the earlier Senate version set the boundary at 25%.Hardy presented her amendment to the Senate’s education and finance committees simultaneously Thursday afternoon.“We’re back to starting with the House version of the bill, so it’s deja vu all over again,” she told her colleagues.Kristen Fountain contributed reporting.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Senate looks to House language, rather than its own, on education reform package.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hardy-clarkson-1-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The U.S. House of Representatives passed their “Big Beautiful Bill” by a vote of 215-214. Every member of the Tennessee Congressional delegation voted yes, with the exception of 9th District U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat. And with that vote, they put thousands of Tennesseans at risk of losing their healthcare and their food benefits.
Cuts to TennCare, our state’s Medicaid program, will hurt vulnerable Tennesseans — people with disabilities, low income pregnant women, the elderly and children — who depend on this program for access to primary care, preventative care, prenatal and postpartum care and skilled nursing care. 
We also face historic cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, right as school lets out for the summer — a time when many kids go hungry. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 57,000 Tennesseans with children stand to lose their SNAP benefits. This means children will get up and go to bed hungry all over our state.
Healthcare workers in Tennessee have been sounding the alarm bells on a number of issues for years now: COVID public health measures and vaccine outreach, threats to reproductive healthcare, and, more recently, the NIH funding cuts and the resulting loss of grant money for medical research. 
Here in Middle Tennessee, one of our biggest employers, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), has announced $250 million in federal budget cuts and has already begun layoffs as a result of the funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). VUMC received $468 million in 2024 for medical research, the second most in the country according to Axios. Overall, Tennessee universities received $770 million in funding for research from the NIH last year alone.
250k Tennesseans could lose TennCare, private insurance under Congressional spending bill

Statewide, the cuts have also affected the University of Tennessee Health System, Meharry Medical College and St Jude Children’s Research Hospital. 
Meharry Medical College is an historically Black college (HBCU) in Nashville and it helps to fill the gap of underrepresented minorities in the healthcare workforce. In Memphis, St. Jude’s is the hospital where parents can get treatment for their children with cancer and other diseases without fear of medically bankrupting their families. We have only just begun to feel the pain from the loss of the critical NIH funding source for these essential organizations. Eventually, medical research will slow, and breakthrough science, like the work that was done at Vanderbilt to develop the COVID vaccine, will be threatened. 
Now, it’s time for health care workers and advocates to answer the call for healthcare again. We need to press that Code Blue button in Tennessee, gathering our colleagues together to fight the impending federal budget cuts that threaten Medicaid and SNAP. 
Inside the hospital, activating a Code Blue means there is a medical emergency and a patient in need of resuscitation. Here in Tennessee, our healthcare system is in dire straits.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 250,000 Tennesseans will lose their healthcare coverage as a result of Medicaid cuts and other changes to the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplace. This is on top of the already over 635,000 Tennesseans lacking any healthcare coverage in 2023, about 11% of the population in our state. Because of our high uninsured rate, Tennessee has had more rural hospital closures per capita than anywhere else in the country, which has led to maternity care deserts and factors into our dismal maternal mortality rates.
This “Big Beautiful Bill” will have far-reaching consequences for all Tennesseans, not just those who rely on TennCare and SNAP. Hospitals, especially rural ones, run on slim margins and will be at increased risk of closure due to the Medicaid cuts. 
According to Becker’s Hospital review, over 41% of rural hospitals in Tennessee are vulnerable. Rural hospitals in our state closing will inevitably lead to further crowding in the tertiary care hospitals in our big cities. Wait times in emergency departments will go up for everyone. Appointments to see primary care and specialists will be harder to get. 
It couldn’t be any clearer: when one person is denied healthcare access, it affects us all. 
There is a Code Blue in Tennessee. Our patients, neighbors, hospitals and communities need our help. We cannot let heartless politicians pull the plug and flatline our safety net just to give tax cuts to billionaires.  It’s time to gather all hands on deck to save our healthcare system that is teetering on the brink before it’s too far gone to resuscitate.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Republicans are moving forward with legislation to restructure a voter-approved state board that oversees a multi-billion dollar trust after it didn’t immediately allocate $50 million to pay for a new University of Oklahoma hospital, Democrat lawmakers said. 
Democrats said efforts to strip the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust of its independence follow a dustup between the agency, which oversees a $2 billion public trust, and Republican legislative leaders who became frustrated after the board did not promptly hand over funding to pay for OU’s new pediatric heart hospital. 
House Bill 2783, which heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s desk, would allow the TSET board of directors to be removed “at the pleasure” of their appointing authority and would limit them to no more than a seven year term. Currently the seven board members, who decide how to spend the proceeds of Oklahoma’s settlement with the tobacco industry, are appointed to a blanket, staggered seven year term.

While debating the bill in the House on Tuesday, Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, said the legislation was filed because Republican leadership wasn’t happy that TSET hadn’t funded the heart hospital. 
“What we are doing here is we are using legislative power to extract retaliation,” she said. 
Blancett said the legislation places “undue pressure” on the board and is “antithetical” to how the TSET board was set up when voters added it to the state constitution. 
The seven board members are appointed by the governor, treasurer, state superintendent, attorney general, state auditor and the leaders of the House and Senate. Appointees are required to have experience in health care or programs benefitting children or seniors. No more than four appointees may come from one political party and at least one appointee must come from each congressional district, with no more than two from the same district. 
The bill would not alter who has appointing authority or the other qualification requirements.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who voted for the measure, said Thursday TSET is in the process of awarding $150 million in grants, and lawmakers requested a third of that be awarded to help pay for OU’s hospital.
He said there’s been “some frustration” with how the TSET board responded to the request. While he said he’s satisfied with the current condition of TSET, Paxton said sometimes they need to listen to legislative funding needs. 
“One of the things I get concerned about with some of these agencies is that when you separate them too far from the legislative branch, that sometimes they kind of become their own kingdom where they don’t listen to the elected people,” he said.
The Legislature is moving forward with funding $200 million without the grant. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
TSET, established by voters in 2000, oversees the proceeds from Oklahoma’s portion of a multi-state settlement with the tobacco industry. The funds are used to invest in better health outcomes for Oklahomans. 
Thomas Larson, a spokesperson for TSET, said legislators asked the trust to consider funding for the heart center at OU Health. 
“We have a process and will be evaluating all proposals,” he said in an email. “We’ve had wide interest in this grant opportunity, with nearly 300 people attending a webinar about the grant. We will be considering this with all other requests.”
In a second statement, Larson said the application from OU Health for the heart hospital is still pending. He said the grant application period closes June 16 and the funding won’t be awarded until November, so no proposals have been awarded or denied. 
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, said these changes to the TSET board would prevent it from being free of “political manipulation.” 
She said she’s concerned that the TSET board is being rearranged because somebody in political power didn’t like their denial of a grant request. 
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, the House budget chair, denied that the bill was being run in retaliation for the OU heart hospital funding and said conversations on making changes to the TSET board have been happening for a “long time.”

“I think the main reason is we just want them to be more accountable to the electorate, the people,” he said. “And we’re trying to make sure they’re held accountable to the voters and the state of Oklahoma. We’re not changing the makeup of the board.” 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said voters in 2020 made it clear they don’t want lawmakers to have greater access to TSET funds when nearly 59% voted against using the trust to pay for Medicaid expansion. 
“They understand that TSET is an asset they don’t want us making rash decisions about,” she said. “This bill, I don’t want it to come across as a simple change, because it will drastically change the independence of this board. … You could have special projects from any of those appointing authorities come forward, and they could get strong armed into making things happen. I’m deeply concerned about what this is going to do.”
But Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, said while TSET is a great program in Oklahoma, sometimes good things need to be “tweaked.”
“There’s always a need to go in and make changes and tweaks here and there, and accountability in government is never a bad thing,” he said. 
The bill passed the House 60-30 and the Senate 36-8.

Dr. Miranda Durham, NMDOH chief medical officer, and NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie urged vaccination ahead of summer travel. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Top state health officials on Thursday recommended parents seek an early dose of the measles vaccine for very young children residing in New Mexico counties where measles is actively spreading or traveling to places with high case counts, such as Texas.
Standard measles vaccination recommendations include first shots for children at 12 or 15 months and second doses between 4 to 6 years old. Now, children in Lea, Sandoval, Doña Ana and Curry counties can receive a first dose at 6 to 12 months and ultimately receive three doses of the vaccine, NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said during a news conference in Albuquerque.
The reason for the change, she said, is “children under one are most severely affected by measles.”
Three doses is not a universal recommendation, she noted: “but if you’re living in a place with high risk for measles, it’s worth getting.”




Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus — more so than COVID-19 or influenza — and is spread by contact with an infected person’s coughs or sneezes. Symptoms can take several weeks to develop, and include a fever, headache, cough, red eyes and a spotty red rash that develops on the head and spreads across the body.
People are contagious several days before symptoms appear. Severe complications appear in about one in five cases and can include brain swelling, pneumonia and even death.




The new vaccine recommendation comes as the state reports two additional measles cases in Sandoval County, bringing the total there to four cases. Until recently, cases mostly remained limited to the southern portion of the state, spilling over from the initial outbreak in Gaines County, Texas.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded just over 1,000 cases of measles nationwide in the current outbreak. The statewide total of 76 cases marks the largest outbreak of measles in New Mexico in the past four decades, Durham said.
Durham said the department is watching closely for spread from Sandoval into Bernalillo or Santa Fe counties.
“Wherever it is in the state we’re concerned about spread because it is such an infectious virus,” Durham said. “We may look at it county by county, but that isn’t how the disease works.”
Officials had no additional information about the two new Sandoval County cases, and said additional  information will be released Friday.
NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in addition to outreach and vaccination measures, the state is also testing for measles in city wastewater, which can help identify spread. Those cities include: Roswell, Santa Fe, Albuquerque Las Cruces, Deming, Rincon and south-central Carlsbad; the recent results are mostly negative, DeBlassie said.
Health care officials emphasized the best protection from measles is vaccination, which is safe and highly effective in curbing spread. Durham said 29,207 vaccines have been issued since Feb. 1, nearly double the vaccination rate over the same time last year.
Increased travel during summer vacation could risk further spread.
“If you are vaccinated and up to date on vaccines, you really are very well-protected,” Durham said. “You don’t need to be scared, you can go travel — but the message is to get vaccinated before you do that.”
More vaccination information
Health officials recommend a 95% vaccination rate to reach herd immunity to prevent further measles spread. Durham said that vaccines given in childhood offer a lifetime of protection.
Officials recommend two doses of the measles vaccine for everyone, except for people who cannot receive the vaccine, such as children who are younger than six months and people who are immunocompromised or pregnant.
For questions regarding the vaccine or potential exposures, Durham urged people to call the NMDOH hotline at 1-833-796-8773. The hotline is staffed by nurses, who can offer information in English and Spanish.
NMDOH opened clinics offering measles vaccinations at no cost, and with no appointment necessary posted on their website.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)All ten Pennsylvania Republicans voted in support of the massive tax and spending bill that passed the U.S. House early Thursday morning, touting the tax relief, border security and support for working families they said it would provide.
Democrats, including seven in the state’s delegation, unanimously opposed it. They decried the budget’s cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, deficit spending and tax cuts for the ultra wealthy, which Rep. Summer Lee (D-12th District) described as dangerous, “undemocratic and unjust.” 
“I voted no. There’s nothing beautiful about a bill that forces families to choose between taking their kids to the doctor or feeding them,” Lee said. “We will continue organizing, pushing, and holding every policymaker accountable until the needs of working people are prioritized over profits.” 
But one moderate Pennsylvania Republican said he would keep working to improve the bill.
“As this process proceeds, I will be working closely with the Senate to make constructive changes to this bill, specifically in the energy, workforce, and health portions of the bill so we can strengthen SNAP and Medicaid solvency for the long-term and ensure access for the most vulnerable that truly need assistance,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) said. “This will be a red-line for me before supporting final passage.”
His office did not respond to the Capital-Star’s request for additional details.
The budget reconciliation, dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill” by Republican leaders, passed by a vote of 215-214, with two Republicans, Ohio’s Warren Davidson and Kentucky’s Thomas Massie, opposed. It will now go to the Senate, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said House Republicans will work with their Senate counterparts toward a goal of winning approval in the upper chamber and getting the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the budget, as it stands, would have a “very real impact” on Pennsylvanians.
“This morning, every single Republican member of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation voted to cut healthcare and food assistance from hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians and speed up the closure of dozens of rural hospitals across our Commonwealth – all while increasing our national deficit by $2.3 trillion,” Shapiro said in a statement.
Other Democrats, including Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-4th District), said the deficit would balloon even higher. “Today, House Republicans passed a bill that sacrifices critical programs for millions of everyday Americans to pay for another tax cut for the rich — blowing up the deficit by an estimated $5 trillion in service of the President’s cruel, corrupt purposes,” Dean said in a statement.
Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would shift $1 billion in food assistance costs to the state, putting benefits for 140,000 people in question. More than 300,000 Pennsylvanians could lose Medicaid benefits, rolling back efforts to reduce the number of uninsured people and increasing the cost of health care for everyone, Shapiro’s statement said. 
And the cuts to Medicaid could hurt 25 rural hospitals across the state that are already financially struggling and rely on the medical assistance program, increasing the likelihood they could close. 
“Any lawmaker in D.C. who thinks the commonwealth can backfill this massive hole they’ve created is wrong – and these cuts will have real life consequences for Pennsylvanians. As this heads to the Senate for a vote, I hope common sense and a concern for the people of Pennsylvania will prevail,” Shapiro said.
Republican members of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation highlighted the bill’s provisions to advance the Trump administration’s priorities.
“After years of wide-open borders, uncontrolled inflation, and government spending run amok, this budget finally addresses the needs of our community and our country,” Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District) said. 
H.R. 1 would provide $69 billion to complete border barriers, hire more Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, expand deportation capacity and stop drug and human trafficking at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Although it includes deep cuts to Medicaid spending, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Republicans including Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District) said the bill would protect the program and ensure tax dollars are used prudently.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“During this process, I fought to protect social safety net programs from the waste, fraud, and abuse that have threatened their long-term solvency. By ensuring states are not using Medicaid dollars on illegal aliens, conducting more frequent eligibility checks, and requiring work for able-bodied recipients … we are securing Medicaid for those who truly need it,” Bresnahan said in a statement.
He noted the Medicaid work requirements exempt children and seniors, pregnant women, students, disabled veterans and those with medical conditions including mental health and substance use disorders.
Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) touted the bill’s benefits for businesses and working families that would help improve the nation’s economy.
“Passing this bill will increase production so supply better meets demand, thereby reducing inflation. And with lower inflation comes lower interest rates, which leads to greater investment and more American production,” he said in a statement.
The legislation would eliminate tax on tips and overtime – among Trump’s populist campaign promises – expand the child tax credit from $2,000, and establish savings accounts for newborns.
It would also extend provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to benefit manufacturers and small businesses by allowing them to write off research and development costs and bonuses and expanding the small business deduction to 23%, Meuser’s office said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/capitolnight2025_0.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Following the U.S. House of Representatives’ 215-214 vote to approve Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” elected officials in Colorado had mixed reactions to the measure and how it will affect the state. 
The 1,116-page tax and spending bill extends President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for businesses and individuals; reduces funding for Medicaid by $625 billion over 10 years; shifts the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food aid program to state governments; drastically bolsters border security and defense spending; reworks energy permitting; and restructures federal aid for higher education, among many other provisions. 
A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released late Tuesday showed the package favors the wealthy, projecting it would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.
The measure now heads to the U.S. Senate for consideration.

Colorado’s members of the House voted along party lines, with Republicans in support of the bill and Democrats opposed. Republicans have celebrated the measure and said it will save working-class people money, while Democrats denounced it for cutting taxes for the wealthy and stripping Medicaid benefits. 
“This bill will deliver for the American people by securing our borders, extending tax cuts, unleashing American energy, and making our nation stronger than ever before,” U.S. Rep. Jeff Crank, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement. 
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the bill is “bad for Colorado, Americans, and the country’s economy.” Before he was elected governor, Polis represented Colorado’s 2nd Congressional District in Congress.
“I’m disappointed to see Republican members of Colorado’s delegation vote to take health care away from Colorado kids, families, and vulnerable people, increasing health care costs on everyone,” Polis said in a statement. “If this bill is so ‘big and beautiful,’ as Republicans boast, then Americans should be asking why it wasn’t voted on in the light of day? The reality is, Americans are being left behind and left in the dark by Republicans in Washington.”
The House vote on the measure came early Thursday after an all-night session.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, applauded the bill’s support for additional immigration enforcement resources and said it preserves the long-term viability of Medicaid for those who need it most. 
“This pro-family, pro-America bill isn’t just good policy, it follows through on promises made to working families,” Evans said in a statement. “As a father, Army combat veteran, and former cop, I fight every day to make Colorado a better place to live, work, and raise a family, and that’s exactly what this legislation does.” 










This monstrosity of a bill is so skewed towards the wealthiest Americans that more than 66% of the benefits would go to the top 20 percent of households by income.


– U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver


U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, said families in Colorado have shared their fears with her that the measure will affect their ability to afford health care.
“This bill means kids will go hungry, thousands of people will die without access to health care, and the progress we’ve made in fighting the opioid crisis will be erased,” Pettersen said in a statement. “Hospitals and nursing homes will shutter, and the health care costs for all of us will skyrocket. All to give the wealthiest people in the history of the world more tax giveaways on the backs of the rest of us.”
U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Windsor Republican, said the bill is a step toward “implementing the America First mandate voters delivered” in November. A news release from her office celebrating the bill said she fought specifically to implement work requirements for Medicaid and to ensure Medicaid does not cover “transgender surgeries” or abortion care.  
“This critical legislation makes the Trump tax cuts permanent, unleashes American energy production, invests billions in support of our farmers and ranchers by responsibly reforming SNAP benefits, strengthens Medicaid to focus on American citizens who truly need help, and delivers a final net deficit reduction of $1.5 trillion,” Boebert said in a statement.
While Republicans have touted Medicaid work requirements as a tool to ensure the program helps those who need it most, a KFF analysis has found that work requirements “would not have any meaningful impact” on how many recipients are working, and that 92% of adults on Medicaid are either working or would qualify for an exemption. 
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said the “One Big, Bogus Bill” will lead to millions of people losing access to health care, including 26,760 Denver residents. She said the bill was put together “following hidden negotiations, overnight markups, and the last-minute release of bill text” to keep Americans from learning the contents of the bill. 
“This monstrosity of a bill is so skewed towards the wealthiest Americans that more than 66% of the benefits would go to the top 20 percent of households by income, and people making less than $51,000 a year will actually see their taxes go up,” DeGette said in a statement. “This bill makes life harder for the American people while enriching the top earners in our country.”

(Submitted)TOPEKA — State officials have denied a federal request to disclose personal information of Kansans using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
On May 6, the Kansas Department for Children and Families received a letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that demanded “unfettered access to comprehensive data from all State programs that receive federal funding.” DCF spokeswoman Erin LaRow shared a copy of that letter and other communications in response to an inquiry from Kansas Reflector.
The USDA letter specified that information to be collected for each SNAP applicant or recipient included name, Social Security number, date of birth, personal address and records to calculate the amount of SNAP benefits participants received over time. It was signed by Gina Brand, senior policy advisor for integrity at USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services division.
The requested data would cover the time period from Jan. 1, 2020, to the present, the letter said.
DCF’s SNAP data is held by a third-party database administrator, Fidelity Information Services LLC. That company notified DCF on May 9 that a formal request for Kansas SNAP records had been made from USDA and that because of federal guidance, they were required to disclose that information.
“As such, FIS intends to fully cooperate with the USDA in facilitating its request for information, as required by applicable law and the guidance,” wrote Prashant Gupta, FIS senior vice president. He then asked for DCF’s written consent.
DCF stopped the process in a letter dated May 14, sent by Carla Whiteside Hicks, the DCF director of economic and employment services.
“Please be advised that we do not consent to your providing the USDA the requested information at this time,” Whiteside Hicks told FIS. “As you know, our obligation to maintain these records in confidence is paramount and may only be disclosed to the USDA for specific program-related reasons. At this time, we are unsure as to the reason for the USDA’s request. As such, we are unable to consent to your turning the information over.”
Whiteside Hicks also said DCF will be asking the USDA to contact DCF directly in the future. She asked FIS to turn over any information that they may have already provided to the USDA and to also provide DCF with any written communications the company has received from USDA.
LaRow said DCF is reviewing the request from USDA related to the personally identifiable data of Kansans.
“Security of Kansans’ personal information is paramount to the agency, and we are committed to maintaining confidentiality consistent with state and federal law,” she said.

(SDOT photo)Motorized scooters, popularized in culture by companies like Lime, are now a specifically regulated mode of transportation in the state.
Signed into law last week, House Bill 588, brought by Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, defines motor scooters and adds safety regulations for users. Motorized scooters now have the same rights on the roadway as a cyclist or someone riding a moped. The law also includes single-wheels, which essentially are motorized skateboards.
During the bill’s hearing in the House Transportation Committee, Duram, a former member of the Montana Highway Patrol, relayed a story about a kid in his community riding a single wheel on the roadway. To his credit, Duram said, the kid is safe while he rides — but being on the roadway was technically illegal.
“I suspect your community has a kid just about like him,” Duram said. “This really is his transportation.”
Duram said that trying to solve the problem of the single wheels led him to consider motorized scooters, too. The issue was seats — if something didn’t have a seat, it could not be on the road.
The bill solved the legal issue. It also stipulates motorized scooters can’t go faster than 30 mph. Importantly, motorized scooters are distinguished from motorized vehicles — an important difference because it means someone cannot be charged with driving under the influence while operating a scooter.
That does not, however, mean they could not be charged with other offenses. Duram said on the House floor on April 16 in that situation the person could be given a public intoxication charge.
The new law provides another avenue of transportation for those who lose their license.   
“My intention was that they’d be traveling at relatively slow speeds to transport the operator to and from his destination and location without the necessity of him having a driver’s license,” Duram said in the hearing. “This becomes, without a driver’s license, one of your standard forms of transportation.”
Motorized scooters are required to have white headlights, and red lights or reflectors facing behind There’s also stipulations on brakes, requiring a motorized scooter be able to stop from 10 mph within 25 feet.
Scooters are not allowed to be operated by motor on sidewalks or bike paths. Riders must yield to pedestrians when operating the vehicle.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/51615041503_19ef617fd6_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Preliminary findings by the Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal suggest the early Tuesday morning fire that seriously damaged the Matunuck Oyster Bar and displaced its 300 workers was accidental.
The investigation into the cause of the blaze continues, but several possible causes have been ruled out, according to a release from the state fire marshal. Commercial cooking equipment was not the direct cause of the fire.
Owner Perry Raso has vowed to rebuild the popular pond-to table seafood restaurant he opened in 2009 on Succotash Road in South Kingstown. Matunuck Oyster Bar employed about 300 workers.
As fire investigation continues, DLT expedites outreach for Matunuck Oyster Bar employees

“I want to focus on getting that building repaired so we can open our doors again,” Raso said in an interview Thursday afternoon. “I haven’t wrapped my head around everything that’s happened. I just know what the goals are, and I’m just trying to take one step at a time.”
Raso lives down the road from the restaurant and received a call around 3:45 a.m. about the fire from a truck driver who was sleeping in his truck in the parking lot. The driver had hauled a delivery of chairs to be received when the restaurant’s workers started arriving by 6 or 7 a.m.
Raso expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of community support since the fire. Restaurants across the state have reached out to connect with staff who are looking for work, he said.  
“Why not? We’ve got the hardest workers in the world,” he said. “I just hope that when we open our doors again we can get a lot of these people back.”
The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (DLT) “has made themselves so available to us and have really given us so much time and been so responsive,” Raso added.
DLT officials set up at the South Kingstown Recreation Center Thursday morning to assist the restaurant’s staff with unemployment and connecting to job coaches, Raso said.
“They asked for a show of hands this morning who were already signed up and it looked like a good number of them had,” Raso said.
The fire marshal’s office said steps have been taken to “preserve the security and integrity of the fire scene” so that the investigation can continue. Mitigation measures to prevent any contamination to nearby inland waterways have also been taken.

(Courtesy of WDTC)The vast majority of South Dakota’s technical college graduates from the 2023-24 school year secured jobs within six months of graduation, according to the latest state Board of Technical Education report.
Jenna Reis, policy and data analyst with the board, shared the report Thursday during a meeting at Lake Area Technical College in Watertown. She said that among graduates who are employable — not continuing with further education or joining the military — the data show 99% are employed, with 93% employed in a job related to their degree.
“These are strong numbers,” she said. “In fact, you may notice in the chart that we have very few graduates that are either not in the labor market or who are still seeking employment.”
The report evaluates the post-graduation outcomes of students from the state’s four technical colleges who responded to requests for information:

Lake Area Technical College (Watertown): Out of 781 graduates, 768 responded, with 150 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 562 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $27.23.
Mitchell Technical College: Out of 488 graduates, 480 responded, with 52 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 397 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $24.36.
Southeast Technical College (Sioux Falls): Out of 900 graduates, 778 responded, with 84 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 632 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $24.68.
Western Dakota Technical College (Rapid City): Out of 286 graduates, 249 responded, with 39 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 200 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $27.48.

Of the 2,275 graduates who responded, 1,961 — 86% — reported living in South Dakota. The average salary of all graduates working in their field of study was about $53,000 per year, according to Reis.
“I think these results show that our graduates are not only finding work and are staying in South Dakota, but they’re contributing to the workforce in their program areas, which is important,” she said.
The report drew data from graduate surveys, faculty outreach and phone surveys conducted six months post-graduation.

Slotkin campaigned on a promise not to allow an electric vehicle mandate.“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035,” she wrote in a statement. “I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”Debate over choiceCritics said the state regulation was effectively an electric vehicle mandate that robbed consumers of the option to purchase the vehicle of their choice.Because of California’s market share — the state accounts for 11% of cars and trucks sold in the country, according to the California Air Resources Board — and adoption by other states, the Golden State standard had a virtually nationwide effect, they argued.Republicans in the Senate focused on the 2035 deadline to end sales of new gas-powered vehicles, describing it as an electric vehicle mandate.In a video posted to social media, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Barrasso of Wyoming, stood next to Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and touted the vote as a victory for consumer choice.“Republicans have defeated Democrats’ delusional dream of forcing every American to drive an electric vehicle,” Barrasso said. “They wanted to force-feed the entire country things that don’t necessarily work, not practical.”But proponents of the California standards said the Senate was removing choice from state policymakers, despite Republicans’ longtime advocacy for state and local control.Manish Bapna, the president of the advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the move in a statement that said senators undermined state power.“This vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states’ legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease and heart conditions,” Bapna said. “After a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign from Big Oil, Republicans readily jettisoned their long-held view that states can best enact measures that reflect the values and interests of their residents.“If other states don’t like California’s approach, they don’t need to follow it,” the statement continued. “But federal lawmakers shouldn’t be intervening to block states from providing cleaner air and a healthier environment.”Procedural fightRepublicans’ use of the Congressional Review Act provoked a backlash from Democrats and environmental allies, who described it as “going nuclear” to tank the chamber’s filibuster rule.The Senate parliamentarian and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the waiver could not be repealed with a CRA resolution, but Senate Republicans opted to use the procedure anyway.“Senate Republicans exposed themselves as fair weather institutionalists. By overriding the parliamentarian — which the chair explicitly noted that the parliamentarian has been overridden — and in order to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, Republicans have eroded away at the Senate foundation and undermined this institution they claim to care about,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after a procedural vote late Wednesday.Republicans defended the move, saying they were responding to an unprecedented case in the chamber. The question of how Senate rules applied to the waiver should be decided by senators themselves, Majority Leader John Thune said.“I believe that when the Senate is facing a novel situation like this one, with disagreement among its members, it is appropriate for the Senate to speak as a body to the question – something the Senate does when questions over application of the rules arise,” he said in a floor speech.Thune, of South Dakota, noted that the Senate resolved a rules question with a floor vote just last year after a Democrat raised a point of order against a Republican’s attempt to fast-track a measure.“Nobody at the time cried nuclear, nobody said the Democrat member was blowing up the Senate – in fact, most members probably don’t even remember the situation, because it was just the Senate doing what the Senate is supposed to do, and that’s voting on how to apply the rules when faced with a new situation.”Uncertainty aboundsCritics of the move attacked the process, the policy and the precedent, saying the Senate undid a half-century of a California-federal government relationship regarding the Clean Air Act that had served all parties well.John Boesel, the president and CEO of clean transportation industry group CALSTART, called the Senate action radical.“This vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry,” he said in a statement. “It is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt. CALSTART will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today's federal action.”And the unusual use of the Congressional Review Act will likely lead to lawsuits from California and at least some of the states that follow it to “protect their authority,” Balik, of Evergreen Action, said.“But that's going to take some time to play out,” he said. “In the meantime, the whole marketplace has been plunged into unnecessary chaos.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Lawmakers advanced a bill Thursday that would codify a test used by judges to determine whether a disputed rent increase is “unconscionable.”
Supporters of the bill say it is part of the Legislature’s push to make New Jersey more affordable.
“Every New Jersey resident deserves a place to call their own — whether that’s buying a home or renting an apartment — at a price they can afford,” bill sponsor Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez said in a statement. “Housing policy isn’t just about buildings — it’s about dignity, access, and stability. That’s why we took steps today to improve how we develop, regulate, and expand housing across the state.”
The bill passed in the Assembly 50-26 with four abstentions. A companion bill in the state Senate introduced in March has not yet been scheduled for a hearing in the chamber’s community and urban affairs committee. 
Under the measure, a judge would consider several factors to determine whether a rent increase is too high, including: the amount of the hike; the landlord’s expenses and profitability; other area rents; the length of time since the last increase; the length of tenancy; and the condition of the property. 
The bill says no one factor would deem whether a rent increase is too high, would allow a judge to consider other factors not identified in the measure, and says the judge could weigh “whether the rent increase would shock the conscience of a reasonable person.”
New Jersey has no statewide rent control law but allows local governments to do so.
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris) slammed the bill for its “very subjective language” that doesn’t clearly define how much rent increases can be. 
“It puts all the onus on these property owners, and eventually, it’s going to end up in a tremendous amount of litigation,” said Bergen. “Yet another example of you killing business.” 
The bill would require a judge to consider not only other properties’ rents but also federal fair market rent estimates from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which say a one-bedroom apartment in the Hudson County area costs $2,029 per month and a three-bedroom costs $3,218. Around Camden County, they cost $1,512 and $2,468, respectively. According to Apartments.com, the average one-bedroom monthly rent in the state is $2,051 and for a three-bedroom, $3,521.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Service’s consumer price index reported in April the cost of housing was up in New Jersey nearly 6% over one year.
Most of the bill would go into effect immediately. The bill’s provisions that establish the confidentiality of certain eviction records would take effect six months later.

Leticia Russi-Shareno had earlier pleaded guilty to a wire fraud charge stemming from her theft that led to a $36,000 “out-of-pocket” loss to the union, according to court filings. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ex-union president for Homeland Security workers in Vermont avoids prison in embezzling case .","The Department of Homeland Security office in St. Albans on Nov. 15, 2022. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerBURLINGTON — A federal judge has handed down a probationary sentence to a New York woman who served as the head of the union representing U.S. Department of Homeland Security workers in Vermont and New York and who admitted embezzling from that union. Leticia Russi-Shareno, 60, pleaded guilty in December to a single count of wire fraud in connection with the theft that resulted in a $36,000 “out-of-pocket” loss to the union, according to court filings. Judge Christina Reiss sentenced Russi-Shareno to three years of probation during a hearing late Thursday afternoon in federal court in Burlington. The judge also required that Russi-Shareno make restitution to the union of $36,000. Reiss, in imposing the probationary sentence, said she took into consideration Russi-Shareno’s lack of a prior criminal record and her early acceptance of responsibility in the case. Russi-Shareno addressed the judge during the hearing, telling her she did not know why she stole the money from the union and she was working through counseling to try to come up with the answers. Russi-Shareno said she didn’t need the money, as her job at that time paid her more than $130,000 a year. “I’m trying to find out myself why I did this,” she told the judge.“I want to apologize to the union, to you and my family for my behavior,” Russi-Shareno said to Reiss.   According to charging documents, the embezzlement took place between August 2019 and December 2020 when Russi-Shareno lived in the Buffalo, New York, area. At that time, court filings stated, Russi-Shareno served as president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2076, the union representing employees of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who worked in Vermont and upstate New York.The union had a bank account at the Vermont Federal Credit Union in Vermont, according to court records, and in her role as union president Russi-Shareno had check-signing authority and a debit card that allowed her to make purchases. “As part of the embezzlement, Russi-Shareno made many ATM withdrawals from the VFCU account and used those moneys for her personal benefit,” according to the charging document. The charging documents also accused Russi-Shareno of falsifying expense reports and records. Mark Kaplan, Russi-Shareno’s attorney, argued during Thursday’s hearing for a sentence for his client that did not include any prison time. The federal sentencing guideline range in the case was four to 10 months in prison, according to court filings. The guidelines are advisory, but federal judges often take them into consideration when handing down a sentence. Russi-Shareno, Kaplan said, was currently taking part in mental health counseling that would be interrupted if ordered to serve a prison sentence. “In addition,” he defense attorney wrote in a court filing ahead of Thursday’s hearing, “individuals who know Leticia would never have expected her to become involved in embezzlement, considering her reputation and character.” Also, according to Kaplan, Russi-Shareno is “gainfully employed” and does not have a drug or alcohol problem.“Although there is no question that Leticia has been convicted of a serious crime, a period of incarceration would do more harm than good,” Kaplan wrote in his court filing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Aliberti, the prosecutor in the case, argued for a prison sentence at the “low end” of the sentencing guideline range. “The Defendant’s fraud is a serious offense,” Aliberti wrote in his sentencing memo filed ahead of Thursday’s hearing. “The case contains aggravating factors such as the amount that was stolen and the defendant’s position of trust.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ex-union president for Homeland Security workers in Vermont avoids prison in embezzling case .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Department-of-Homeland-Security-Vermont-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

Jill WilliamsJust ahead of the summer tourism season, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has announced the closure of lakeside parks, campgrounds and beaches across the southeast, with most in Georgia.
In a statement, the Corps said there are not enough workers to staff the 31 parks across six lakes.
“This decision comes after careful consideration of the safety and security of all visitors,” the statement says. “The well-being of our community is our top priority, and the current staffing levels do not allow us to maintain the necessary safety measures within our parks. This includes essential services such as park supervision, maintenance, and safety monitoring that ensure a secure and enjoyable environment for all visitors. We will be continually assessing and reassessing closures throughout the summer.”
Lake Lanier in northeast Georgia was set to see the most closures with 20 set to close, according to the release, but Republican Congressman Rich McCormick said fewer sites will be shuttered.
McCormick, whose district includes part of Lake Lanier, said he spoke with the Corps and the closures will be more limited than originally announced.
“I pushed hard for a better solution, and they listened,” he said. “All boat ramps will remain open, and only 11 recreation sites will close temporarily, not the 21 originally planned.”
Corps employees, like many federal workers, have faced layoffs and buyouts in an effort from the administration of President Donald Trump to shrink the government. Georgia Democrats like Sen. Sen. Raphael Warnock pointed their fingers at Trump and Elon Musk as the culprits for potential missed summer fun.
“After public outcry from myself and countless Georgians, we prevented more than half of the announced park closures from going into effect,” he said, referring to the Lanier closures. “This is welcome news for Georgia families looking forward to enjoying summer days by the lake. But because of this administration’s reckless cuts, parks are still slated to be indefinitely closed. We must continue to speak out: Enough is enough with these reckless cuts, Georgia families deserve better.”
Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff also criticized the closures.
“The White House must take immediate action to reopen these beautiful parks at Lake Lanier for Georgia families. This is a direct and predictable result of the Administration’s reckless and chaotic mismanagement.”
Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year, is under pressure from his party to be seen as opposing Trump and supporting fired federal workers.
The Corps pledged to reassess closures during the summer. See their announcement for a list of affected parks.
It’s not yet clear which sites will close and which will remain open after the revision. Lake Lanier has 76 recreational areas, including 37 Corps-operated parks and campgrounds, according to the Corps.
In addition to the spots at Lake Lanier, two are set to close at Lake Allatoona in Cherokee and Bartow counties, a day use area and a campground. Three sites are set to close at Walter F. George Lake and Lake George W. Andrews along the Georgia-Alabama border, and the announcement also includes a public shoreline area in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System, which runs through Georgia.
Army Corps of Engineer employees are mostly civilians, and part of their mission is to maintain dams and waterways. All of Georgia’s major lakes are man made, with many created and maintained by the Corps.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Reaction in Kentucky to the “big beautiful bill” Republicans in the U.S. House passed early Thursday ranged from alarm to applause.
The bill, which passed by a single vote and now heads to the Senate, would make deep cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care. 
Democrats and health advocates say the cuts could result in Kentuckians losing access to medical care in a state already grappling with poor health. 
Republicans, in general, say the bill wisely reins in Medicaid spending by returning the program’s focus to the people it was created  to serve in 1965.  Democrats in Congress expanded Medicaid in 2010, opening eligibility to low-income adults without disabilities in an effort to reduce the number of uninsured.
Hard choices face Kentucky Republican tasked with recommending Medicaid cuts

Despite the Medicaid cuts, the bill, endorsed by President Donald Trump, would enlarge the federal deficit, drawing objections from a few Republicans — prominent among them Kentucky’s U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of Vanceburg.
Massie was one of only two Republicans to vote against the bill which renews tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term.
The Congressional Budget Office projects the bills would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years as the tax cuts and new spending exceed its reductions in federal expenditures.
In a floor speech, Massie called the budget bill a “ticking debt bomb” and said, to applause,“if something is beautiful, you don’t do it after midnight.” 
The measure  squeaked through the House on a 215-214 vote early Thursday morning after a night of negotiations.
It would reduce spending on Medicaid by $625 billion over 10 years and result in  7.6 million people going uninsured, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
‘It’s wrong, it’s cruel,’ says Democrat Beshear
During his weekly press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said the bill would “lead to more Kentuckians not being able to see a doctor, not having health care coverage, less revenue to support our rural hospitals and health systems, and it’s going to leave more of our kids and seniors going hungry.”

The bill shifts to state governments some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food to low-income Americans. Melissa McDonald, executive director of Feeding Kentucky which represents the state’s food bank, says the plan would increase hunger in Kentucky. 
Beshear also warned of “people losing their ability to go see a doctor.” 
“It’s wrong, it’s cruel,” Beshear said, adding that “those that will lose their health care coverage and food assistance” will pay for lawmakers’ choices. 
Doug Hogan, the government relations director in Kentucky for the American Cancer Society and the Cancer Action Network, told the Lantern that a “significant” number of cancer patients rely on Medicaid and that the program “is crucial for prevention, detection, treatment and survival of cancer.” 
“Cuts have consequences, and we don’t want cancer patients caught in (the) middle of those consequences. Medicaid provides access to health coverage, which is one of the best predictors of whether or not a person survives cancer,” he said. “The proposed cuts in Medicaid could interrupt a person’s cancer care, or stop it altogether, and others would lose access to regular cancer screenings and prevention, which would have a devastating impact on cancer patients and their families.” 
Politicians: ‘Golden Age’ versus ‘course for the iceberg’ 
In Massie’s 90-second floor speech opposing the budget bill, he compared it to the sinking of the Titanic, saying “we’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg.” 
“This bill dramatically increases deficits in the near term, but promises our government will be fiscally responsible five years from now,” he said. “Where have we heard that before? How do you bind a future Congress to these promises? This bill is a debt bomb ticking. Congress can do funny math, fantasy math, if it wants, but bond investors don’t.”

Kentucky’s other Republicans in the House supported the bill.
U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers — who represents a district where 44% of residents are enrolled in Medicaid,  one of the nation’s highest rates — said he didn’t take his vote in favor of the bill “lightly” and that it’s “a comprehensive, responsible plan for the decade ahead and beyond.” 
“We must get rid of the waste, fraud and abuse, and it is our duty to secure this program, as well as SNAP benefits, for the American people in greatest need,” Rogers said in a statement. 
A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released Tuesday showed the House package tilted toward the wealthy, projecting it would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.
Rogers, R-Somerset, touted the bill’s tax cuts, especially ending the income tax on tips and overtime wages, and said “it secures Medicaid for Eastern Kentuckians living below the poverty rate by removing 1.4 million illegal immigrants from the program, along with 1.2 million ineligible recipients.”

U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, who is seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to succeed Mitch McConnell, also praised the “massive tax cut for families, workers, seniors, and small businesses” in a statement. 
“Our bill also provides unprecedented resources for the border patrol to seal the border once and for all. We are on the doorstep of the Golden Age for America,” Barr of Lexington said. “It’s time to send this bill to President Trump’s desk.”
Andy Westberry, spokesperson for the Republican Party of Kentucky, said the House passage ensures “Medicaid will remain strong and focused on the Americans it was always meant to serve.” 
“The House passage of The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act marks a major victory for working-class Kentuckians and their families,” Westberry said. “The fear-mongering, misinformation, and over-the-top pearl-clutching being peddled by Gov. Andy Beshear and other Kentucky Democrats is nothing more than a desperate attempt to prey on the fears of Kentucky families.” 
  Coleman Elridge
Meanwhile, Colmon Elridge, the chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party (KDP), called the bill “harmful.” 
“Rural hospitals will close, children and veterans will lose critical care and thousands of Kentucky families will struggle to put food on the table,” Elridge said. “Kentucky Republicans have betrayed the people they took an oath to serve. Kentuckians, and Americans, deserve better.” 
‘An untenable choice’
The measure now moves to the U.S. Senate. 
During a Thursday afternoon press conference, health and policy advocates called on  the Senate to “reverse these grievous and extreme cuts,” as Dustin Pugel, the policy director for the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, put it. 
Pugel estimates the legislation could result in 345,000 Kentuckians losing Medicaid coverage. The program in its current state covers about 1.5 million Kentucky residents.
“This House proposal would not just eliminate coverage, but could also eliminate jobs, especially in rural areas, and it would damage our progress in tackling severe problems like addiction and even cost lives in the long run,” Pugel said. 
Melissa Mather, a spokesperson for Family Health Centers of Louisville, said more than half of the 40,000 people served at her location in 2024 had Medicaid, a third of whom were children. Medicaid, she said, “keeps our doors open.” 
Mather also expressed concern that Kentucky could revert to pre-expansion realities, when some had to choose between health care or food. 
“Do we want Kentuckians to have to choose between buying groceries or their medicines?” Mather said. “Because I think that’s an untenable choice we’re asking people to make.” 
A plea to the Senate: ‘Change course’

Sarah Hill of Lexington, who joined Pugel and Mather during the Thursday press conference, credits the 2010 Medicaid expansion with helping her during a “particular low point” in her life. 
“I was unemployed and spent about a year sitting in an armchair in my mom’s house in Eastern Kentucky trying to figure out how to move forward when I couldn’t complete the most basic tasks like brushing my teeth or taking a shower,” said Hill, who said she’s struggled with mental health since the age of 14. 
After Kentucky chose to open Medicaid to low-income adults without disabilities, she applied — “a Herculean effort on my part” — and was able to access medications she needed to stabilize and get a job, she said. 
“If the proposed work requirements and regular check-ins were implemented when I had needed this assistance, I wouldn’t have received it,” Hill said. “I could not have done the paperwork needed to sign up, and then I could not have handled the stress of continually recertifying my need.” 
Dr. Edward Miller, the division director of maternal fetal medicine and high risk obstetrics at the University of Louisville and UofL Health, pointed out Kentucky’s poor health statistics: the state is one of the worst places in the country to have a baby, for example. 
  Dr. Edward Miller
“We have some of the highest rates of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, in the country, and most notably, we have one of the highest detection rates of new cancers in the country,” Miller, also on the health policy call, said. “Now, what is decreasing access going to do? Well, you don’t have to be a doctor, you don’t have to be a researcher, to know that decreasing access to those at the most risk is only going to make us plummet further down those rankings.” 
Hill, the former Medicaid participant, and others pleaded with senators to pull back on the proposed cuts. 
“Our senators have a choice to change course on this, and I fear that if we do not choose to change course, we are going to be throwing away our workforce,” said Hill. “We are going to be throwing away rural people, and we are going to be throwing away the potential of thousands of Kentuckians, just like myself. I ardently hope that we are able to change course, change the discourse around these things, because being sick one time doesn’t mean you have to be sick forever.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Thursday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt the state’s budget bill for next fiscal year setting the framework for nearly $12.6 billion in spending.
House Bill 2766, dubbed the “general appropriations bill,” outlines a budget deal struck by Republican leaders that keeps most agencies flat, but contains some increases for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
Stitt is expected to sign the measure. 
He and legislative leaders last week announced a budget agreement and a plan to cut the state’s top income tax bracket by 0.25%. It would reduce the state’s top income tax rate to 4.5% and create a path toward eliminating it. 
The 55-page budget measure passed by a vote of 27-19, only two more votes than required in the Senate.
Several Republicans joined Democrats voting against the measure.
“When it comes down to it, the challenge I see is a budget with mixed up priorities,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City.
The budget doesn’t contain enough money for education, health care, or the low income, but contains “special giveaways,” she said.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Chuck Hall, R-Perry, defended the spending priorities in the budget, calling it a “compromise.”
“This is not a perfect budget,” he said. “No budget is. There are things in this budget that I don’t like. There’s things in this budget that I like very much.”
The budget contains funding increases for education, roads, voting system upgrades, a trooper academy and rapid DNA testing, Hall said.
It also provides $200 million to build a new pediatric heart hospital and $250 million for improvements to the veterinary school at Oklahoma State University, Hall said.
“We were once on the top for veterinary schools, and we will be there again,” he said.
It leaves $3.5 billion in savings, Hall said.
“We’re prioritizing core services like education, mental health, public safety and infrastructure, while maintaining strong fiscal discipline,” said Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle.

(Provided/Holcombe, Fair and Lane)A 2,700-acre piece of land in Jasper County is slated to become South Carolina’s first new state forest in more than two decades.
The Nature Conservancy bought the property, known as Chelsea Plantation, last week for $32 million. Originally nearly 6,000 acres, parts of the property had already been sold to groups looking to develop it into homes.

That decision, which would involve annexing the property into nearby Ridgeland, is still pending. But it put the rest of the land at imminent risk of development, according to the conservation nonprofit.
“Chelsea’s fate was one of this region’s major tipping points for the future of its wildlife habitat, historical character and water quality,” executive director Dale Threatt-Taylor said in a statement. “Developing Chelsea would have ushered in a new era of expansion in an already fast-growing region. We weren’t willing to leave it to chance.”
After placing the land under a conservation easement, which will guarantee that it remains protected regardless of who buys it, the conservation group plans to sell the land to the state Forestry Commission.
From there, following a series of state-level approvals, the land is expected to open to the public as a state forest. The timeline for approvals is still up in the air, Katy McWilliams, director of land protection for the nonprofit’s South Carolina office, told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday.
The last time that happened was in 2004, when the Forestry Commission acquired 12,000-acre Wee Tee State Forest in Williamsburg and Georgetown counties.
With help from conservation groups, including The Nature Conservancy, the commission added more than 6,000 acres to the Wee Tee forest in 2023, but a new state forest hasn’t opened since, said spokesman Doug Wood.
The state’s five protected forests are funded through sales of timber sustainably harvested on the properties, according to the commission’s website. Each offers recreational activities, such as hunting, fishing, boating and hiking.

Conserving forests is one of the commission’s goals, and it is “making the greatest strides toward that end in decades,” State Forester Scott Phillips said in a statement.
“The prospect of adding Chelsea Plantation and other properties to our state forest system in the near future not only ensures these forested landscapes’ protection from development, but also their effective management for multiple uses, and hence their sustainability,” Phillips said.
Several more properties could be coming the commission’s way in the next few years, Wood said. Conservation groups are working with the commission to work out the details.
The Chelsea Plantation will be the first state forest in the state’s southern corner.
“This would give them the option to have something in that part of the state,” McWilliams said.
The Nature Conservancy has been eyeing the Chelsea Plantation since it first went on the market in 2019, McWilliams said. At the time, the nonprofit wasn’t prepared to jump into action and pay the $30 million price tag, she said.
In the years since, the nonprofit saw the loss as a missed opportunity. So, when a big chunk of the land came on the market, the group realized it had a second chance, McWilliams said.
“We were really excited to take a crack at it again and get a chance to protect Chelsea,” McWilliams said.
The land runs alongside more than 7 miles along the Hazzard Creek, which connects to the Broad River and is part of the Port Royal Sound watershed, and the tide floods and drains salt marshes on parts of the property.

That means the area is of “tremendous value for the watershed,” McWilliams said.
Longleaf pine, which has become a priority for conservationists as forests dwindle in size, grow on the property. On a recent visit, McWilliams spotted a dolphin swimming in the river and a bald eagle flying overhead, she said.
“It has many features that are very wonderful,” McWilliams said.
The Chelsea Plantation will join a network of protected properties in the area, spanning from the ACE Basin, one of the largest undeveloped swaths of land on the Atlantic coast, and the Savannah River.
Among those projects were a 7,300-acre plantation that became part of the Coosawhatchie Wildlife Management Area, which opened in September, and the 4,400-acre Gregorie Neck property, which The Nature Conservancy plans to split into six pieces and sell to private owners with the requirement they keep it mostly natural.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1481C6A2-3F79-4CFA-8DCD-7A7FF505DF5Aremote68040a512e638d1f91801e15776918fa0476b637-1-original-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612
,DC,2025-05-22 21:40:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,RFK Jr.’s ‘Make America Healthy Again’ report stresses emphasis on children’s well-being,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jrs-make-america-healthy-again-report-stresses-emphasis-childrens-well-being,,"WASHINGTON — The Make America Healthy Again commission, created earlier this year by President Donald Trump, released its first report Thursday, calling on the administration and lawmakers to improve the well-being of the country’s children.The 73-page report was published just after Trump and several Cabinet secretaries held an event highlighting their concerns with four areas — nutrition, physical activity, environmental factors and “overmedicalization.”“Over the next 80 days, the commission will build on its work in this report to develop a road map to bold and transformative public health reforms for our consideration,” Trump said.Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the report and the administration’s approach to childhood health issues is that “there is no difference between good economic policy, good environmental policy and good public health policy and good industrial policy. We can have all of them.”U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that everyone knows American farming interests need to be at the center of the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, agenda.“We have the most robust, the safest, the best agriculture system in the world,” Rollins said.Mainstream farm groups, however, were not happy. ""Farmers are identified as ‘critical partners,’ yet were excluded from development of the report, despite many requests for a seat at the table,"" American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall wrote in a statement.‘Corporatization and consolidation’ in food systemThe numerous ways that American agriculture and the food people choose to eat have evolved received considerable attention in the report.“Our agricultural system has historically focused on abundance and affordability. The progress we have made is largely thanks to the hard work of American farmers, ranchers, and food scientists,” it states. “However, the rise of (ultra processed food) has corresponded with a pattern of corporatization and consolidation in our food system. Today’s diet-related chronic disease crisis, demand a closer examination of this pattern and its broader impact.”The report mentions pesticides numerous times, but doesn’t call for them to be banned outright.“Some studies have raised concerns about possible links between some of these products and adverse health outcomes, especially in children, but human studies are limited,” the report says. “For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances.”Kennedy testified during a U.S. Senate committee hearing earlier this week that based on drafts of the report he had seen, “there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.”His comments came during an exchange with Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who specifically asked him about glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, that she referred to as “one of the most thoroughly studied products of its kind.”“We're talking about more than 1,500 studies and 50-plus years of review by the EPA and other leading global health authorities that have affirmed its safety when used as directed,"" Hyde-Smith said. ""Have you been able to review thousands of studies and decades of scientific review in a matter of months?""Kennedy responded during that Tuesday hearing that her “information about the report is just simply wrong.”Sleep, stress, social mediaThe report combines recommendations that have long been supported by research, like exercising regularly and eating a well-balanced diet, with proposals that aren’t fully supported by science.It notes that “physical activity, encompassing moderate-to-vigorous exercise, aerobic fitness, and reduced sedentary time, is critical for child health and well being.“However, American youth have seen a steady decline in activity and cardiorespiratory fitness over decades, contributing to rising obesity, diabetes, mental health disorders, and cardiometabolic risks.”The report calls out children who are unable to get enough sleep and chronic stress as health challenges, in addition to the prevalence of social media.“The near-ubiquitous presence of social media in the lives of American adolescents, with up to 95% of teens regularly using at least one or more of these platforms—is increasingly correlated with a concerning rise in mental health challenges, particularly among younger users,” the report says. “With the vast majority of teenagers engaging with these platforms, understanding the nuanced consequences and mental health impacts of social media on their developing well-being is of critical public health importance.”No mention of gun violenceThe report didn’t include any mention of gun violence, a leading cause of death in American children and teenagers, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF and a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.“The United States has by far the highest rate of child and teen firearm mortality among peer nations. In no other similarly large, wealthy country are firearms in the top four causes of death for children and teens, let alone the number one cause,” KFF’s analysis states. “U.S. states with the most gun laws have lower rates of child and teen firearm deaths than states with few gun laws. But, even states with the lowest child and teen firearm deaths have rates much higher than what peer countries experience.”The Johns Hopkins report notes that the gun death rate in children between the ages of 1 and 17 has “increased by 106 percent since 2013 and (has) been the leading cause of death among this group since 2020.”In 2022, there were 2,526 gun deaths in that age range, for an average of seven a day, according to the report.The KFF analysis shows other leading causes of childhood death include motor vehicles, cancer, suffocation, congenital anomalies, poisoning and drowning. Farm Bureau, Corn Growers criticalFarm groups were dubious about the report’s conclusions.The American Farm Bureau’s Duvall said it was ""deeply troubling for the White House to endorse a report that sows seeds of doubt and fear about our food system and farming practices, then attempts to celebrate farmers and the critical role they play in producing the safest food supply in the world.""""The report also expresses a desire to ensure farmers continue to thrive, but undermining confidence in our food system directly contradicts that noble goal,” said Duvall. “The report spotlights outlier studies and presents unproven theories that feed a false narrative and only then does it acknowledge a mountain of evidence about the safety of our food system.""Iowa Corn Growers Association Chair Jolene Riessen said the “misinformation surrounding crop protection tools is incredibly upsetting because if there's one thing all farmers have in common, it's that we care about raising safe, healthy, and affordable food that nourishes families around the world.“Agriculture is a science, and we have spent years testing and researching pesticides, like glyphosate, to reaffirm that they are a safe and vital tool farmers rely on to feed and fuel the world.”Others said the report was lacking. Lori Ann Burd, the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health director, wrote in a statement the “report’s acknowledgement of pesticides’ risks to our children’s health is a small step forward,” before rebuking Trump administration officials for not going further.“The grassroots movement of millions of Americans who trusted Trump with their votes won’t forget that RFK Jr. was cowed by the powerful industrial farming forces determined to make sure there are no U.S. restrictions on harmful pesticides like atrazine, which is banned in 60 nations,” Burd wrote. “Instead of protecting our kids, we use over 70 million pounds of atrazine each year on the corn and sugarcane crops that are making Americans sick. The fight to ban atrazine will continue.”",,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-22 21:31:28+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Amid peace initiative, Jackson fires violence prevention director",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/22/amid-peace-initiative-jackson-fires-violence-prevention-director/,"The trauma recovery specialist had spoken to the mayor’s electoral opponent at a festival to celebrate south Jackson, Coleman alleged in an email to other city officials.","Weeks before the city could conclude its “100 Days of Peace” initiative, Jackson ousted the director of its Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery.
Keisha Coleman had led the less than 3-year-old office, a key piece of outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s efforts to tamp down on crime, since January 2023. 
She was by Lumumba’s side earlier this year when he announced, weeks before losing reelection, that the office had awarded $150,000 to community-based organizations working to prevent violence. The press conference marked the beginning of 100 Days of Peace, also known as 100 Days of Action, an initiative that was to feature events like town halls, trainings and listening sessions and conclude with a sneaker ball to celebrate the Jacksonians working to reduce violence. 
But if an event required funding, it did not happen, Coleman said, and she’s doubtful it will. Just a few months later, on May 7, Coleman said she received her termination letter from Lumumba’s chief of staff, Safiya Omari.
The alleged stated reason? The trauma recovery specialist had spoken to the mayor’s electoral opponent at a festival to celebrate south Jackson, Coleman wrote in an email to other city officials obtained by Mississippi Today.

“The termination, verbally framed as a ‘loyalty’ issue, follows repeated attempts to hold the administration accountable for gross misuse of public funds and nepotism that jeopardized critical community safety programs,” Coleman wrote. 
In an interview, Omari said she could not discuss personnel matters but called Coleman’s allegations “false and misleading.” The chief of staff also said she could not discuss how the allegations are misleading, “because then that would involve me talking about her.”
Coleman alleged in a pointed May 7 email to city council members that over her time as director, Omari and the mayor’s executive assistant, Tiffany Murray, blocked her efforts to get the new office up and running by stymying Coleman’s ability to spend city funds. She wrote that they prevented her from using empty office space to host workshops and slowwalked the distribution of city funding meant to create a youth engagement center. 
“OVPTR’s mission—to reduce violence and trauma in Jackson—has been crippled by Dr. Omari’s actions,” Coleman alleged. 
The office was launched in 2023 with a $700,000 grant from the National League of Cities, a nonprofit. Despite being the office’s director, Coleman wrote that the mayor’s office did not grant her access to spend city funds until the beginning of this year, making it difficult to execute events. 
“Most of the work was done from my personal funds and people in the community who supported the work,” Coleman wrote. 
Reached at her office line, Murray said she did not have any comment at this time.
Coleman told Mississippi Today that she doesn’t want the termination to overshadow the office’s work. On June 3, Jackson will hold a General Election for mayor, in which Democratic nominee and longtime state senator John Horhn is the expected winner.
“I do want to keep a good standing in the community in the event that John Horhn does come in and I want to advocate for that office,” she said. “I don’t want to diminish what’s going on there and the importance of that work.”
Payne told Mississippi Today that while it had not been long since Coleman left the city, several applicants had already interviewed for the position. 
“Her staff is still working, and they’re still doing what they need to do,” Payne said. 
But in the email, Coleman alleged that she had recently put one of her two subordinates — Omari’s son, Kuwasi Omari — on a performance improvement plan for “chronic tardiness, absenteeism, incompetence to the role, and failure to complete tasks or submit weekly reports.” Coleman also alleged Omari used her position by “withholding staff hires in order to hire her son.”
Kuwasi Omari, listed online as the office’s community outreach specialist, did not return Mississippi Today’s messages. His 45-day improvement plan was set to end on May 8, Coleman wrote, but the city fired her on May 7.
Responding to this allegation, Omari, whose other son works as a community services coordinator in the city’s department of human and cultural services, said that Kuwasi Omari is responsible for a program the office is running that works with boys at Lanier High School, which involves plans for a community clean-up.
“Let me just say this: It was certainly her right as his director to do that, but contextually I will say that the only real work that has taken place in the office,” Omari said before pausing. “Okay, no, I won’t say that.”    
The office will be without a director until at least July 1, when a new mayor comes in, after the city council instituted a hiring freeze Tuesday. Omari said this means that events like the sneaker ball probably won’t happen. 
“Having an idea and making statements doesn’t mean that the work to make those things happen has taken place,” Omari said. 
The council’s decision to freeze hiring came after WLBT reported the city had hired Lumumba’s former election opponent-turned-campaign supporter in the 2025 Democratic primary, David Archie, a former county supervisor, as a staff assistant to the mayor. 
The city also recently brought on Tariq Abdul-Tawwab, a former employee of the third party manager over the city’s water utility, JXN Water, which reportedly fired him in 2023, as a deputy director in the city’s public works department. He was recently described as a director at one JXN Water’s staunchest critics, the nonprofit People’s Advocacy Institute founded by the mayor’s sister and where Abdul-Tawwab’s wife works.
The Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery was established as an office under the mayor’s executive branch. In response to a recent public records request, the City Clerk told Mississippi Today that the city does not have an overall organizational chart, but provided several departmental organization charts.
The mayor’s office was not among them.
One of the violence prevention office’s goals is to quantify the impact of violence prevention work in Jackson through data. In the press conference earlier this year, Lumumba cited data showing that efforts by local organizations, including credible messenger groups, have ushered in long periods without violence in some of the most troubled areas of the city.
“I don’t have access to that data, as you know Keisha is no longer with us,” Omari said, “so we’re trying to figure out how we’re gonna move forward with the data that has come in, as well as a lot of the data I’m sure is coming directly from JPD, and everybody has access to that.”   
Coleman had told Mississippi Today earlier this year that her office was developing a public-facing data dashboard making it easier to examine crime trends and patterns in the city. 
The office’s work has been supported by local advocacy organizations, and Horhn previously told Mississippi Today that he did not have plans to close the office. 
But under the current administration, Coleman wrote her efforts were not receiving adequate support. 
In one example, she alleged that she had repeatedly asked to use empty office space in a city building on North State Street to host events like youth workshops. But in front of the mayor, Omari and Murray told her “no,” Coleman alleged, because that space was going to become Lumumba’s second office.
“This directly denies community of service, support, and resources that would assist in the goal of the OVPTR,” Coleman wrote. “As of today, the space has yet to be used.” 
The $50,000 grants that Lumumba announced earlier this year, the first transfers from the office to outside organizations, represent some of its largest expenditures, according to public records obtained by Mississippi Today. As of March, the office had reported spending nearly $430,000 since its inception, the bulk of it categorized under wages and benefits and the credible messenger grants. Coleman alleged that part of the money was used to pay Murray’s salary, “despite providing no operational support.”
The records show it has spent $1,200 on office supplies, $12,000 on travel and nearly $4,000 on data processing equipment, though if the office has conducted crime stats analysis to inform evidenced-based approaches to violence interruption, it has not publicized any such reports.
Coleman urged in her email that the office has remaining sources of funds that are at risk: A little over $200,000 the city council allocated to the office for a youth engagement center, and about $270,000 left from the National League of Cities. 
“This is not an attempt to smear this administration,” Coleman wrote in the email. “This is me being proactive because there is over $470,000 of funds out there that someone will have to answer for and I will NOT be thrown under the bus because I’m no longer there to speak for myself.” 
Omari said the youth engagement center will open sometime this summer at the currently defunct Mary C. Jones Center that is being rehabilitated with funds from the facilities department. The $202,000, Omari added, will be used for programming. 
“I know when I looked a couple months ago, the money hadn’t even been set up in our budget,” Omari said. 
The city did provide Coleman with one bit of support, she wrote. But it was apparently fleeting. 
“Outside of the one time in March 2024 (that) Tiffany gave me a realm (sic) of copy paper, I’ve purchased, on my own, copy paper, office supplies, flyers, rack cards, brochures, etc. just to have an operational office,” Coleman wrote.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/30143727/Denim-Day-3.jpg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

To be honest, natural (methane) gas and coal and any combustion fuel are neither safe nor reasonable cost. Methane gas is not actually natural, it is a fossil fuel just as coal and oil are fossil fuels. There is an entire scientific article in the prestigious medical journal, the New England Journal of Medicine, titled “The False Promise of Natural Gas.” This scientific article describes many of the health harms caused by natural methane gas, from production to pipelines to end use in power plants or homes. These health harms include exposure to carcinogens, air and water pollution, earthquakes, pipeline and other facility explosions, and climate change.
We know that both coal and methane gas power plants produce many kinds of air pollution, including fine particles (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and volatile organic compounds or VOCs. Some of these pollutants are precursors for ozone, which is created every day from a chemical reaction in the air between air pollution and sunlight. In addition, there are contaminants in both coal and natural gas that affect our health. Coal contaminants include many heavy metals, including lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others. Natural (methane) gas has benzene and other cyclic aromatics. All of these kinds of pollution and contaminants harm our health and damage our economy.
In the U.S., PM2.5 from fossil fuels causes 13% of all deaths, and NO2 from burning fossil fuels causes 1.6% of all deaths. Ozone causes even more deaths, and is known to cause as much progression of emphysema as smoking a pack of cigarettes every day. Ozone also triggers asthma and COPD exacerbations. In the Southeast, all of the kinds of air pollution made by coal and gas power plants put people in the hospital.
Recently, we have learned that PM2.5 damages children’s IQ, from exposure during the prenatal period through the childhood years. We know that children exposed to air pollution are more likely to have mental health problems too, either within a few days of a PM2.5 spike or even eight years after exposure to NO2 or PM2.5. We know that the kinds of air pollution that coal and methane gas power plants produce will trigger asthma attacks and can cause children to develop asthma. And we have learned that giving air filters to pregnant women who live in polluted cities improves their children’s IQ 4 years AFTER the children are born.
In California, when coal plants closed, the rate of preterm births for those who lived near the coal plants went down by over 25%.
Here in Georgia, more than two-thirds of our rivers and large lakes are contaminated with mercury to the point that the Department of Natural Resources has to publish guidelines every year about which fish need to have limited consumption, because the fish are contaminated with mercury. The vast majority of that mercury came from coal-fired power plants.
These are some of the reasons that it is clear that both coal and natural gas are not safe sources of fuel. The PSC needs to be true to its mission, and encourage safer sources of electricity production.
In addition, even though Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Energy (an energy cost analysis) shows that methane combined cycle and utility scale solar with storage appear to be in the same price range, this ignores the economic harms of reduced crop yields, work absences, and lower work productivity caused by fossil fuels, and also the enormous health costs of all the health damage from both coal and methane. Therefore it is also clear that both methane and coal are not reasonably priced, the stated costs are artificially low because they don’t include the enormous economic and health damages. It is massive cost-shifting, and Georgia residents are paying with increased taxes, increased health insurance premiums, and with our own lives.
However, it’s not all doom and gloom. There is a good solution: we can have abundant affordable electricity without all the health and economic damages. It sounds like pie-in-the-sky, but it’s true. Solar with storage is in the same price range as methane gas combined cycle, and wind with storage is less expensive. And both are quicker to build than a new gas turbine power plant. The PSC should require Georgia Power to have much more solar with storage and much less health-damaging methane and coal.
And just this week, news came out that Georgia Power will be asking to recover costs from Hurricane Helene next year. Many scientists have shown that Hurricane Helene was more damaging and carried more moisture because of climate change. Yet, while Georgia Power is asking to recover costs of damages from a climate change enhanced hurricane, they are at the same time asking to build new natural gas power plants that will make climate change worse. It doesn’t make sense, especially when we know that for about the same cost they could build solar with storage and stop making climate change worse.
Georgia has abundant sunshine that is more direct than in much of the United States. It is an abundant natural resource we can easily use without hurting people’s health or hurting our crop yields. Georgia power has abundant opportunity for utility scale solar with storage, which is the safest and most reasonable cost form of electricity that there is.
The bottom line is this: air pollution is so bad for our health and economy, that you don’t have to care about climate to want clean energy. Solar is one of Georgia’s most abundant natural resources. The PSC should be true to its mission and require Georgia Power to use more solar and wind energy with storage so that we have safe, affordable, and reliable energy.

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Former Henderson Police Chief Hollie Chadwick, who announced Thursday she’s running against Mayor Michelle Romero in the 2026 election, said she’s not seeking retribution after being terminated earlier this year by newly-minted City Manager Stephanie Garcia-Vause. 
“I don’t have that in my heart, nor can anybody afford that, especially in the community or the employees of City of Henderson,” Chadwick said when queried about her motivation. “I’m doing this with thoughtfulness, and I care about this community, and I want to do things positive (sic).” 
The Current was first to report in February that Chadwick would be given an option by Garcia-Vause to resign or be terminated. Chadwick later said she learned of Garcia-Vause’s ultimatum from news media. 
In recent months, she says, she’s been contacted by city employees and community members who asked her to challenge Romero, who was elected mayor in 2022 after serving one term on the city council. Before being elected to the council, Romero ran the city’s redevelopment agency. 
“While my tenure as police chief unfortunately became political and did not end the way I had hoped. I know I did nothing wrong,” Chadwick said.
After 20 years on the force, Chadwick was named to the top law enforcement spot in 2023, becoming the third chief named in six years. 
She was criticized for bucking recommendations to terminate suspended officers who covered up a colleague’s 2021 DUI according to an internal investigation, and reinstated the officers after a long probe. 
In 2024, the city police supervisors’ union filed a complaint with the Nevada Employee Management Relations Board, alleging Chadwick denied overtime resulting from union leave provisions in Nevada law and the city’s collective bargaining agreement. She was dropped from the complaint after her termination in March. The complaint has yet to be resolved. 
Garcia-Vause told news media Chadwick was not terminated for cause but because their management styles were not aligned. 
On Thursday, Chadwick called for transparency and accountability from current officials, but declined to elaborate.
“We need strong, steady leadership that listens to residents, acts with accountability and transparency and prioritizes people over politics and special interests,” Chadwick said.
Asked whether she was referring to Romero’s consulting company, in which the mayor represents applicants who often have business before the council, Chadwick declined to say. 
“That’s something you’d have to ask her,” she said. 
Romero did not respond to requests for comment on Chadwick’s challenge.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/C77948AB-764B-4103-A340-388DFC41773A-e1747949050984-1024x770.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Aug. 2, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature, at least for now, has blanketly rejected four line-item budget vetoes Thursday from Gov. Jim Pillen and questioned whether his objections were constitutionally submitted and whether the vetoes count.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista announced that the Legislature was not in receipt of the actual line-itemed bills — Legislative Bills 261 and 264 — by the end-of-day Wednesday. Under the Nebraska Constitution, if the Legislature is in session, vetoes must be filed with the Clerk of the Legislature within five days, excluding Sunday.
If the Legislature is out of session when the bills are returned, vetoed bills are filed with the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office.
Pillen announces $14.5 million in vetoes from Nebraska budget, 83% of it from Supreme Court

The Legislature did not receive the line-item objections until Thursday morning, hours after the midnight deadline and a half-day after the bills had been delivered to the Secretary of State’s Office on Wednesday. However, because the Legislature has not adjourned for the year, lawmakers argue the Clerk’s Office was still the proper destination. Both offices are in the Nebraska State Capitol.
“As such, we don’t believe that we can accept these vetoes,” Arch said.
Speaking with reporters, Arch said that to his knowledge, nothing like this has happened before and that the Legislature will be gathering facts on the situation. Multiple senators said the Governor’s Office could sue the Legislature to try and enforce the vetoes. Arch said he didn’t know if that would happen but hopes it won’t.
“I’m hoping that in our discussions, we can resolve the issue,” Arch said. “But on the plain reading of the Constitution, we have concerns.”
The Governor’s Office had no immediate comment.
‘Not a problem with the budget’
The 2025-27 budget bills have faced continued twists and turns accelerated by a major projected budget shortfall of at least $630 million by the time the budget bills passed last week. Hundreds of millions of dollars were moved around to fill the hole, including $147 million from the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve fund.
Pillen’s vetoes sought to reduce state spending by $14.5 million, $12 million of which was cut from the allotment to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which court leaders said could be detrimental to various services.
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said the budget-writing process has been stressful but that he was “pleased” with ending at a balanced budget. Of Pillen’s vetoes, he said he agreed “the Constitution was not followed.”
“What happened with the delivery of the vetoes is not a problem with the budget,” Clements said.
Now in his ninth year on the committee, and in his final two-year budget, Clements said he enjoys numbers and that it is “a real relief” to have reached the end.
Multiple Appropriations Committee members were joyful at the conclusion, with some grinning ear to ear, hugging one another and pumping their fists in the air after Arch announced the conclusion. Up until that moment, lawmakers and lobbyists were abuzz that, for seemingly the first time, vetoes might have been stopped without a vote of the Legislature.
Veto overrides take at least 30 votes and often feature intense gubernatorial pressure, often behind the scenes, to flip votes on legislation that often first passes with more than 30 votes.
‘Upholding the Constitution’
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who will seek to override a veto of LB 287, a bill trying to crack down on bedbugs in Omaha and give the Omaha City Council additional oversight of the Omaha Housing Authority, took a different view.
“I wish the veto for LB 287 was invalid too, but overall it’s karma,” McKinney said.
  State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a new face on the Appropriations Committee this year, said she feels the Governor’s Office would try to make the vetoes stick anyway. She said the drama would end up in front of the people of Nebraska.
“I told everybody this morning, ‘Let’s just descend into the chaos.’ And they took me literally,” Cavanaugh told the Nebraska Examiner.
She continued: “I mean, process matters, the Constitution matters. We’re upholding the Constitution, which is our job, and that’s pretty much it.”

Despite a waitlist of thousands of Vermonters, the Vermont State Housing Authority says it won’t be able to issue new vouchers for now and will aim to trim about 489 vouchers from its existing rolls through attrition. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s largest provider of Section 8 housing subsidies will stop issuing new vouchers.","A “for rent” sign on Barre Street in Montpelier on Thursday, May 23, 2024. Photo by Natalie Williams/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.Facing a reduction in federal funding, the Vermont State Housing Authority will stop issuing new rental assistance vouchers to low-income households on its lengthy waitlist, and has begun rescinding vouchers from about 50 Vermonters currently searching for an apartment to use them.“We have a plan to curtail our spending and to protect families that are receiving rental assistance,” said Kathleen Berk, executive director of the Vermont State Housing Authority, the state’s largest administrator of the federal Section 8 program. The housing authority faces a roughly $1 million funding reduction for the remainder of 2025, Berk said, which came as something of a surprise earlier this month. That funding gap is the result of a budget cut to a specific voucher program that serves disabled individuals, along with the lack of an annual inflation increase to keep up with rising rents, which Berk said had historically been included in yearly appropriations for rental assistance. That means VSHA’s $39 million annual budget for vouchers won’t go as far. The funding loss means the housing authority must trim about 489 vouchers from its rolls, Berk indicated. That’s about 12% of the 3,897 vouchers the housing authority currently administers. Because future funding is generally tied to past spending, Berk fears this year’s reduction in vouchers could lead to a “downward spiral” in the number of Vermonters getting rental aid in years to come.As Vermont sees housing prices escalate and homelessness increase, federal housing vouchers play a key role in sustaining housing for low-income people who can’t afford market-rate rents. Voucher recipients pay a third of their income toward rent; a local agency administering the federal program pays for the rest.The need is great. At 3,379 applicants, the state housing authority’s waitlist for vouchers nearly matches the number of households who currently have them. The waitlist has been closed since late January, when the housing authority first anticipated federal cuts. READ MORE
The housing authority does not plan to take away vouchers from people who currently have them, Berk emphasized. Instead, it hopes to reduce its load primarily through attrition – by not giving out new vouchers when someone retires one. It is taking a few additional steps to hasten that process, as outlined in a memo to community partners sent out on Wednesday. The authority will stop taking referrals for special rental assistance programs for veterans, young people exiting the foster care system, and families at risk of separation because of their lack of housing. It will also pause an initiative that allows people who live in homes where a subsidy is attached to take their voucher and move elsewhere after a year. (The housing authority does plan to keep moving new tenants into these subsidized units when they become vacant).That move struck Jess Horner, program director at John Graham Housing and Services in Addison County, as particularly alarming. John Graham has 18 of these subsidy-attached apartments, which they often rent to people who are “hard to house,” she said. The organization offers wraparound support to help these renters become successful, and then the tenants can take their housing subsidy and move elsewhere.Cutting off their ability to move their voucher creates a bottleneck, Horner said.“These units are going to be occupied by the folks who are in them now until voluntary exit, death, or eviction,” she said. “Which means that there aren’t any opportunities for other people to try their hand at an affordable unit.” Some of the state housing authority’s cost-cutting measures mirror moves taken by the Burlington Housing Authority in January, after HUD first signalled a possible funding reduction. BHA acted proactively, suspending vouchers from some 70 households looking for housing and taking a staunch stance against allowing rule-breakers second chances.Now, the Burlington Housing Authority – the state’s second largest, behind VSHA – is not making additional policy changes, according to executive director Steven Murray.“I’m patting myself on the back, because we got a lot of heat for what we did,” Murray said.Berk said she does not wish the state housing authority had taken action sooner. In the past, she has secured special funding from HUD to help fill shortfalls when voucher costs have increased unexpectedly – something she might pursue again, she said.But given that the Trump administration has signalled its desire to essentially end the Section 8 program as it currently exists – cutting federal rental aid by about 40% and diverting that money to states to spend as they see fit – she isn’t sure she ought to trust the past.“There are unprecedented times,” Berk said. “To what extent prior experience helps is questionable – but we’ll continue to fall back on that.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s largest provider of Section 8 housing subsidies will stop issuing new vouchers.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/For-Rent-Housing-Montpelier-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

(Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson sat out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump Administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: the Trump Administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump Administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.



Arkansas state aid update
On Thursday, Sanders announced that the state will cover up to 35% of county and local governments’ cleanup and rebuilding costs resulting from the March storms.
State emergency management staff will coordinate with the respective local governments using preliminary damage estimates previously submitted to FEMA.
Once projects are complete, county and local governments will have to submit expense documentation, which the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management will review and inspect, the press release said.

 Cave City pushes forward

Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump Administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
  Cave City, Ark. Mayor Jonas Anderson motions toward a storm-damaged home. Cave City could be on the hook for roughly $300,000 in damages. (Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.

 

 
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”
 FEMA politics

Over the past two years, the Biden Administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump Administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.

In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.

John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: the federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for President Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.
  Cave City’s welcome sign rests against a building. It was damaged along with much of the town after a twister ripped through Northeast Arkansas in March. (Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis, Mo. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing…they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota State Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler is one step closer to joining the U.S. Department of Education.
Her nomination to be the next assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education will advance to the full Senate after members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee voted 12-11, along party lines, on Thursday to approve her nomination, according to a news release from the state Department of Public Instruction.
“I am grateful for the Senate HELP Committee’s vote and honored for the opportunity to support our nation’s students, families, and teachers,” Baesler said in a statement. “If confirmed by the Senate, I am committed to working closely with my colleagues for continued progress in serving students effectively.” 
According to the department, Baesler plans to resign as state superintendent upon her full Senate confirmation. Gov. Kelly Armstrong would then appoint Baesler’s successor who will serve through the 2026 election. That election will decide who will lead the Department of Public Instruction for the final two years of Baesler’s term, which expires in 2028.
Baesler, a native of Flasher, was first elected state superintendent in 2012 and has won reelection to the position three times, most recently defeating Jason Heitkamp in 2024 with 57% of the vote.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a lower court’s dismissal of the attorney general’s lawsuit against the state prisons board for violating the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
The ruling, written by Associate Justice Rhonda Wood for the six-member majority, sends the case back to Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox for adjudication.
Attorney General Tim Griffin filed the lawsuit on Dec. 15, 2023, alleging the Arkansas Board of Corrections violated the FOIA when it entered executive session during a pair of public meetings and improperly hired an outside attorney. Griffin also said the board failed to properly respond to a public records request from his office. 
Arkansas attorney general to appeal rulings in Board of Corrections disputes

Fox gave Griffin 30 days to work with the corrections board on an agreement with an outside attorney to represent it. Fox dismissed the case without prejudice in January 2024, ruling Griffin’s office failed to make an effort to initiate the statutory procedure that allows special counsel to represent state officials and entities.
Griffin moved to vacate the circuit court’s order, arguing his office could not certify special counsel until the board asked for legal representation, according to Thursday’s order from the state Supreme Court. 
The attorney general typically represents state entities, but according to Thursday’s order, Griffin argued his duty to represent the state corrections board depended on the board certifying its need for legal representation. 
“He is correct,” Wood wrote, noting that the attorney general has no duty to represent state agencies until a certified request for services is made. 
“[Griffin’s appeal] argues that the circuit court dismissed the action for his failure to accomplish what he legally did not have sole authority to do,” the order states. “In response, the Board contends the circuit court had authority to dismiss the action under Arkansas Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). Because we find the circuit court abused its discretion, we reverse and remand.” 
Special Justice Bud Cummins joined the decision, while Associate Justice Nicholas Bronni did not participate. The governor appointed Cummins, a former U.S. attorney, to replace Bronni, who recused himself from the case in January. Bronni served as the state’s solicitor general in Griffin’s office before Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed him to the high court in December.

Associate Justice Shawn Womack dissented. In his dissent, Womack writes that even though the circuit court was right to dismiss Griffin’s lawsuit, the dismissal should have been with prejudice and because of sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts. The case should be reversed and dismissed, said Womack, who regularly cites sovereign immunity in court decisions.  
“Obviously, in most situations when the State brings a lawsuit, sovereign immunity is not implicated because the lawsuit does not make the State a defendant,” he wrote. “But in those rare instances when the State is both the plaintiff and the defendant—as it is here—sovereign immunity applies, and the underlying lawsuit is barred.”
In a social media post, Griffin praised the high court’s decision, which allows his suit to continue.
“I sued the Board of Corrections to defend our Freedom of Information Act. I am thankful for today’s Arkansas Supreme Court decision, which will allow that lawsuit to go forward,” Griffin wrote. “I take defending the FOIA seriously, and I will not tolerate those who violate it.”  
The lawsuit is part of a dispute between the corrections board and the executive branch that started in late 2023 over who has ultimate authority over the state’s prison system. 
The board’s refusal in November 2024 to approve a request to increase prison capacity by 500 beds prompted public criticism from Griffin and Sanders. The board responded by hiring an outside attorney the following month to represent it in employment matters. 
The board voted 3-2 to hire Abtin Mehdizadegan, a labor and employment lawyer with the Little Rock firm of Hall Booth Smith. The vote came with almost no discussion after a 45-minute closed-door session.
Griffin quickly questioned the board’s authority to hire outside counsel without obtaining his office’s consent, citing state law that says the attorney general’s office represents state officials and entities.

Detachment.Major General J Peter Hronek, the Adjutant General of Montana’s National Guard, will retire on June 7, following a 40-year military career. 
Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte on Tuesday announced the leadership change at the Department of Military Affairs, and the appointment of Col. Trenton J. Gibson as the new adjutant general for the state, the highest ranking state military officer.
“I’m grateful to General Hronek for his service to the State of Montana. Under his leadership, the men and women of the Montana National Guard have had a true public servant guiding them and their efforts,” Gianforte said in a press release. “From helping Montanans recover from disasters to recruiting Montanans to serve their country as a member of the Guard, General Hronek has served Montana with steadfast dedication. I wish him great success as he embarks on this next chapter of his life.”

Gianforte appointed Hronek in December 2020 following a stint serving in Washington D.C.
Hronek began his military career as a pilot in 1985 and has been with the Montana National Guard since 1986. He served three combat tours in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
“I have been honored to lead the outstanding soldiers, airmen, and Department of Military Affairs professionals. I am so proud to see them empowered and ready to serve at the next level. They have enhanced their missions and brought on new capabilities to our nation and state. As a result of our efforts, the Montana National Guard is in a better position than ever before to recruit and retain our members,” Hronek said in a press release. 
Following Hronek’s retirement next month, Gibson will take over as the leader of Montana’s military force. 
Gibson, according to the state’s press release, began his military career with the Montana National Guard in 1995 and currently commands the 1889th Montana Army National Guard Regional Support Group in Butte. He also has served as director for the Montana National Guard Youth Challenge Academy since 2018. 
“I thank Major General Hronek for his honorable service to our state and nation and his steadfast leadership of the Montana National Guard. I appreciate Governor Gianforte offering me the honor and privilege of serving in this capacity,” Colonel Gibson said. “The Montana National Guard and the Department of Military Affairs are home to exceptional professionals, and I have been blessed to serve in both organizations for over 25 years. I also thank my family for their support and sacrifice as I step into this critical role.”
The Montana National Guard comprises 2,290 soldiers stationed in 16 different communities across Montana. 
Montana’s National Guard has been in the news recently after three Army National Guard members were cited for criminal trespassing after allegedly landing a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on private property near the Crazy Mountains. 
The Big Timber Pioneer first reported on the incident, in which the guardsmen collected elk antlers and a skeletonized head with antlers, according to the Sweet Grass County sheriff’s office. 
The Montana National Guard said the troops had been on a training flight from Billings to Helena, and turned over the antlers to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
One of the three guardsman charged with misdemeanor trespassing is also a Montana Highway Patrol trooper. 
In a statement about the alleged incident last week, Hronek said an internal investigation was underway. 
“If true, this behavior does not align with the values of the Montana National Guard. Misuse of military equipment erodes the trust we strive to uphold with the people of Montana,” Hronek said. “Every member of the Montana National Guard is expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsibility, and respect for the law.”
A spokesperson for the governor’s office said Hronek’s retirement is “in no way related to the current events of the department.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/491475940_1105423758069113_7249906776461344536_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

Senate Bill 1405, the product of mounting legislative grievances and frustrations with the State Elections Enforcement Commission, sped to passage with little debate, as happened Tuesday night in the Senate.
The difference was a bare majority of House Democrats present and voting who rejected the four-caucus deal signed off by their leaders, House Speaker Matt Ritter of Hartford and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas of East Hartford.
The House voted 92-46 to pass the bill, with 11 Democrats and two Republicans missing the vote. All the votes against were cast by Democrats. The Senate vote was 34 to 1, with one Democratic dissenter.
Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, who helped negotiate the bill as co-chair of the Government Oversight Committee, and Ritter both said the revolt among Democrats was provoked by making the appointment of the commission’s executive director subject to lawmakers’ approval.

“That was the poison pill for our folks,” Dathan said.
Ritter and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, were willing to strike that provision, but the Senate leaders were adamant it remain in the bill. 
“We were made well aware of that,” Ritter said.
Unless the bill is vetoed, the five-member elections commission, known as SEEC, will nominate an executive director, but the choice will be subject to three layers of approval by legislators: the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee and the House and Senate.
Dathan said she had proposed a compromise: the commission’s choice of an executive director be required to appear before the legislature’s Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee for an informational public hearing but not subjected to a vote.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said his caucus insisted on a legislative vote. 
Until amended Tuesday night, the bill also would have made all declaratory rulings and written guidance by SEEC subject to review and approval of lawmakers. The revised version gives lawmakers an opportunity to review and comment but not reject.
Other provisions of the bill were intended to streamline fundraising, especially for candidates who participate in the state’s voluntary Citizens’ Election Program, which imposes spending limits in return for public financing of campaigns. To qualify, candidates must raise threshold amounts that vary by office.
Lawmakers complain that the commission was slow to approve public grants in 2004, often delaying approval over small inconsistencies in reports. The commission also audits half of all campaigns, chosen at random, a burden on volunteer campaign treasurers.
“It frustrates everyone,” Rep. Roland Lemar, D-New Haven, said after the vote.
But he still voted against the bill, alarmed at making SEEC’s director subject to legislative approval.
“Your regulator should be independent of the regulated,” he said.
Rep. Michael Demicco, D-Farmington, made a similar comment during the floor debate, noting the concerns raised by the League of Women Voters, Common Cause and others about the perceived and actual loss of independence by a commission created as a post-Watergate reform.
“I’m looking at testimony that was submitted when this bill went to public hearing. And it’s very troubling, some of the testimony that I’m reading,” Demicco said.
No one replied.
He was the only lawmaker in either chamber to speak against the bill during debates.
“I wanted to raise those concerns and hopefully my colleagues become concerned as well,” he said after the vote.
It was unclear whether the unexpected opposition in the House will prompt a closer review of the measure by Gov. Ned Lamont, whose priorities in the last weeks of the legislative session have been negotiating a budget and avoiding a nursing home strike.
“The governor hasn’t made a decision as to whether he will sign SB 1405. We will review the bill more closely when it reaches his desk,” said Rob Blanchard,  a spokesman.
The Citizens’ Election Program was created in 2005 as an anti-corruption measure and an effort to create a level playing field on fundraising. It is used by the majority of lawmakers, despite the frustrations in dealing with SEEC.
In the brief floor debate, Dathan emphasized the less controversial aspects of the bill, primarily the provisions dealing with fundraising and disclosure requirements.
“It modernizes a 20-year-old program,” Dathan said. “Like everything we do in our state, we look at where it’s been successful, where things need to be updated. It ensures continued transparency in our government, and really does the objective of keeping our election program transparent.”
Dathan and Ritter said the issue of legislative confirmation could be revisited by future legislators.
“I certainly hope that it does not become political in confirming the SEEC person,” Ritter said. “I hope it is not the Democrats in power want a Democrat and the Republicans in power want a Republican. I hope we continue to find good nonpartisan people.”
“If we get something wrong and in a couple years we regret it, we can relook at it,” Ritter said. “I don’t think the confirmation process bothers me all that much.”

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)Public comment closes Friday on New Mexico’s aging department’s long-term plan, which outlines goals to address the state’s growing senior population and their needs.
The Aging and Long-Term Services Department opened public comment in April for its draft plan, which includes three overarching goals: administering home and community programs to help seniors age in place and support caregivers; responding to social determinants of health such as food and housing insecurity, access to services and social support; and reducing instances of abuse, neglect and exploitation while preserving the autonomy of seniors.
The public comment period included a survey in which participants were asked to rank how they would prioritize the three goals, how well the plan addresses their needs and how successful they believe the plan will be, along with an opportunity to provide suggestions for improving the proposed plan.
“We have received meaningful feedback from across the state—including organizations, direct service providers, senior participants, and community members—and it’s clear that New Mexicans care deeply about how we support our aging population,” ALTSD Deputy Cabinet Secretary Angelina Flores-Montoya told Source NM in a written statement.
She said the department will incorporate the feedback into the final plan, “which will influence our work now and in the years to come.”
The draft plan was informed by a needs assessment conducted by the Center for Applied Research and Analysis at the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research. The department contracted with the center in fiscal year 2023 and released a report in September 2024 identifying six key findings and six recommendations. 
Researchers gathered information from focus groups in five New Mexico communities, as well as surveys completed by service providers throughout the state. U.S. Census data and other state collected data were also used.
Findings included: New Mexico’s aging population has “grown significantly,” as have metrics of vulnerability such as poverty and disability; older adults and service providers describe service deserts without access to transportation and medical supportive services; providers note lack of funding, personnel and training are “critical barriers;” and rural and urban areas differ in vulnerabilities.
The report suggested the aging department expand services to meet growing needs; plan for a growing aging population and expanded service requirements; improve public outreach; address workforce shortages; complete a statewide services inventory; and implement a statewide consumer survey. These findings are reflected in the current draft plan, which members of the public have had a chance to comment on. 
According to the draft, the plan is set to go into effect in October 2024.

But today, that independence is under serious threat.
On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which includes sweeping cuts to Medicaid. For many in North Dakota, these cuts aren’t abstract figures. They mean losing access to critical services that make daily life possible, like bathing, commuting to work, or attending community programs, robbing them of their place within the community.
This threat to Medicaid is more than a fiscal issue. It’s a rollback of decades of hard-won progress. In 1980, six North Dakota families partnered with The Arc to challenge the inhumane conditions at Grafton State School and San Haven State Hospital. That lawsuit led to the closure of San Haven, reduced the population at Grafton, and shifted our state toward more humane, community-based care. Now, that legacy is in danger of being erased.
In addition to deep funding cuts, the legislation introduces policy changes that restrict access to care in multiple ways:

Work requirements: The mandatory Medicaid work requirements start date has been moved to Dec. 31, 2026. Although people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are technically exempt, real-life implementation often fails to protect them. Many individuals with disabilities and their family caregivers get caught in confusing eligibility rules, risking wrongful loss of coverage.
Increased costs: States can now charge Medicaid recipients up to $35 per service. Annual out-of-pocket costs could shoot up even for those near the poverty line, making necessary care unaffordable for many.
Frequent eligibility checks: Medicaid eligibility will be reviewed every six months instead of annually. For people with limited access to technology or help navigating paperwork, this change drastically increases the risk of losing coverage due to missed notices or simple errors.
Limits on provider taxes: New federal restrictions on provider taxes limit how states fund their Medicaid programs. This could reduce available dollars for crucial services, including supported employment, in-home care, and day programs. These services allow individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live and thrive in their communities.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint precisely how many North Dakotans with intellectual and developmental disabilities will be affected, the overall impact is clear: Medicaid is the backbone of their support system. Even if some individuals are exempt from specific requirements, the broader funding cuts and program restrictions will limit access, increase delays, and force many to go without the help they need.
Families are already facing long waitlists and strained service systems. These cuts will only make things worse. When services disappear, people don’t just “fall through the cracks”; they face real, lasting harm.
Consider one individual with intellectual and developmental disabilities who’s waited months for a supported employment slot. Without a job coach, they remain unemployed, despite being ready and eager to work. Medicaid cuts push that opportunity further out of reach for them and hundreds of others like them.
And the alternative? Institutional care may sound like a backup plan, but it isolates people, limits opportunities, and costs the public far more. Supporting people in their communities is the right and the fiscally responsible choice.
At The Arc, we believe people with disabilities deserve the supports they need to live full, meaningful lives. But today, families and providers are navigating a maze of shifting rules, disappearing services, and uncertain futures. The confusion alone makes it harder to get help when needed most.
To pursue this direction is to court the resurgence of systems we consciously moved beyond. Our collective experience, however, and the resources now at our disposal, equip us to forge substantive improvements rather than reenact previous failings.
North Dakotans of all abilities deserve more than just survival. They deserve a future built on dignity, inclusion, and respect.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

Kelly Ayotte signed two anti-sanctuary city bills into law in New Hampshire on Thursday, fulfilling a campaign promise she and several of her Republican colleagues in the Legislature made during the fall.
“There will be no sanctuary cities in New Hampshire,” Ayotte said. “Period. End of story.”
The bills — House Bill 511 and Senate Bill 62 — seek to prevent so-called sanctuary cities, or localities that have laws hindering local law enforcement from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or federal immigration laws. When it goes into effect in January, HB 511 will require New Hampshire municipalities to comply with ICE immigration detainers “if safe to do so,” prohibit policies ignoring federal immigration-related directives and authorities, and forbid local law enforcement from investigating whether someone in their custody is a citizen, unless that person in under investigation for violating New Hampshire law. SB 62, which also goes into effect in January (though it creates legal definitions that become law in July), will take away state or local governments’ authority to prohibit their affiliated law enforcement entities from entering into voluntary agreements with ICE.
Speaking to reporters at the bill signing ceremony, Ayotte invoked comparisons to neighboring Massachusetts. Bay State Gov. Maura Healey has denied that her state is a sanctuary state but the Center for Immigration Studies includes it in their list of 13 sanctuary states.
“This is something we ran on to make sure that New Hampshire would not go the way of Massachusetts,” she said, “and their billion-dollar illegal immigration crisis.”
Ayotte also boasted that New Hampshire is “the safest state in the nation” and said “we’re going to continue to be that and this is a big step forward.” U.S. News and World Report ranked New Hampshire No. 1 among all states for public safety. It ranked reported sanctuary states Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut in the top 10 as well.
Ayotte’s fellow conservatives praised her at the ceremony for tackling the right’s priorities.
“I look at the governor and I think, wow,” state Sen. Bill Gannon, a Sandown Republican, said. “She made promises. She kept them. She did that with bail reform. Check. Sanctuary city bills today. Check.”
Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican and House Majority Leader, who has been aggressive in pushing for legislation addressing undocumented immigration said: “We are sending a clear message to the state of New Hampshire today that if you’re in this nation illegally, you are not welcome in the state of New Hampshire.”
This comes amid a controversial immigration agenda for the federal government led by President Donald Trump. That includes a slew of deportations and detainments of student activists protesting Israel’s war in Gaza, a group of Venezuelan migrants sent to a notoriously brutal El Salvador prison, and Europeans, including a Nashua German-American man and a number of tourists, being detained for weeks.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AyotteSigningMay222025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

Residents will have access to green spaces, an outdoor play space, a patio and a community room.Rutland City Mayor Mike Doenges said the 30 units, built by Cornerstone Housing Partners and Evernorth, are part of 220 permitted housing units now in the works toward his goal of 1,000 new units in the city by 2028. Mary Cohen, executive director of the recently merged Cornerstone Housing Partners, said at the groundbreaking that the project might seem like a “drop in the bucket” but is an important step forward in addressing the city’s housing needs. The project was expedited with help from the Rutland City Mayor’s Office to locate the project in a “neighborhood designated area.” That helped avoid some regulatory requirements of Act 250, a state law for land use and development review, Cohen said. Maura Collins, executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, said the agency helped the partners secure funds for the project because of the “clear vision” articulated by the city’s leadership and the community’s significant need for housing.“We were really impressed by the location of this property and how it was going to improve the neighborhood by taking down the buildings that were there and replacing them with beautiful, high-quality housing that could serve the Rutland community,” Collins said in an interview. A partnership with the Rutland Housing Authority will provide rental assistance through 10 housing vouchers to those exiting or at risk of homelessness, she said. That means “this property is going to help folks who need it the most,” Collins said.The project has come to fruition through a variety of private and public state and federal funds, totaling $14.6 million.Evernorth President Nancy Owens said at the event that the groundbreaking is an “important milestone” because it invests in strengthening a neighborhood near downtown Rutland. But, she said, the fate of funding for other affordable projects down the line is unknown as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Donald Trump works to dismantle some programs. The federal department has faced staffing cuts and funding freezes, including the withholding of $60 million in affordable housing and community development contracts through the department in recent months, according to reporting by the Associated Press. She noted the Maplewoods Commons project included $5.6 million of federal funding allocated from the American Rescue Plan Act State Fiscal Recovery Fund and National Housing Trust Funds. That money was administered through the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board.“Some of the threats that we’re seeing in Washington around the budget process” are “very tangible to the people and communities of Vermont,” Owens said. The development partners in Rutland and around the state will search to secure new financial resources to allay the potential loss of federal funds, she added.Collins said at the groundbreaking event that there was a “little glimmer of good news coming out of D.C. this week.” The Vermont delegation’s advocacy to expand Low Income Housing Tax Credits has gained traction and is included in the current iteration of the budget reconciliation bill, she said. These tax credits, which developers sell to private investors to obtain funding, “are the largest source of funding to create affordable rental housing,” Collins said in an interview. Federal Tax Credit Equity funding provided by Evernorth through private banks and administered through the Vermont Housing Finance Agency comprised $6.6 million, the bulk of funding for the Maplewoods Commons project.Affordable housing projects are typically sourced through a patchwork of funds, Collins said. The loss of federal funding sources, including federal American Rescue Plan stimulus money the state budgeted toward housing during the Covid-19 pandemic, makes the financial landscape for affordable housing in Vermont uncertain, she said. “If Vermont got an increase in tax credits, it means that we could have more resources to create more affordable housing,” Collins said in an interview. “At the same time, the federal government is slashing HUD’s budget, and there’s less state money for housing, and so I don’t really know what the impact will be.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  30 new affordable housing units underway in Rutland City as federal funding causes uncertainty.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/maplewood-commons.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-22 20:42:42+00:00,CT Mirror,"As House passes ‘big beautiful bill,’ CT delegation joins opposition",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/22/trump-big-beautiful-bill-ct-lawmakers/,"The bill, designed to carry out Trump’s agenda on taxes, immigration and energy, could have several implications for Connecticut.","Connecticut’s congressional delegation joined other Democrats Thursday in uniform opposition to House Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” designed to carry out President Donald J. Trump’s agenda on taxes, immigration and energy. 
Republicans had been divided on the best strategy to get the bill passed for weeks and were in nonstop negotiations up until the bill’s passage. Last week, committees held marathon markups, with some lasting over 24 hours. In the final stretch, Trump came to Capitol Hill Wednesday to pressure remaining moderate and conservative holdouts.
After an all-night session, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” narrowly passed, 215-214, just before 7 a.m. Thursday. The bill’s name came from Trump, who wanted Congress to pass a wide array of priorities all at once instead of breaking them up into separate packages. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., touted sticking with the swift timeline of passing the bill out of the House before Memorial Day weekend.
“The reason we did that was not because out of pride of authorship or because we were trying to raise some banner. We did it because we need to get this relief to the American people as soon as possible,” Johnson said during a press conference after the bill passed. “President Trump made these promises on the campaign trail, and we did as well. The time table’s important. The sooner they feel that relief, the better.”
The legislation, among many other things, extends the tax cuts passed in 2017 during Trump’s first term. Those expire at the end of the year if they’re not renewed. As the bill stands, some of the relief would be immediate but temporary, while some of the spending cuts and proposed work requirements would kick in a few years later.
Democrats, meanwhile, are fiercely opposed to the legislation, arguing it would benefit wealthier Americans and big businesses at the expense of safety net programs that would see significant cuts. They also point out that it would add to the national debt.
“While you slept, Republicans robbed you,” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, said in a statement. “In the dead of night, House Republicans passed legislation that hands over a trillion dollars in tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations while gutting the very programs that help everyday Americans survive.”
The reconciliation bill could also have a significant impact on states and their own budgets as the federal government seeks to shift more costs over to them. If enacted, Connecticut could be on the hook for the first time ever in helping to cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.
That has Connecticut preparing for what’s to come, with the possibility of wide-ranging cuts to federal funding as well as new cost-sharing plans in the tax bill.
“Congress should be working on a budget that strengthens our nation and lowers costs, but instead, the bill passed by House Republicans overnight does the exact opposite — it explodes the national debt and imposes deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance that will devastate millions of Americans, including thousands of Connecticut families,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement Thursday.
All of these provisions, however, are subject to change as the bill makes its way to the upper chamber. Senators will go through their own process to see what can remain in the bill and can tweak it through an all-night amendments process. The House and Senate would need to work out any differences that emerge and pass it again. The party wants to get it to Trump for his signature by the July 4 holiday.
Republicans are leaning on a process known as budget reconciliation to avoid the 60-vote threshold normally required to advance legislation in the Senate. This will allow them to bypass a filibuster and pass a bill without needing support from Democrats. Both of Connecticut’s senators, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are opposed.
“I encouraged our Senate colleagues to think of this as a one-team effort as we have and to modify this as little as possible, because it’ll make it easier for us to get it over the line ultimately and finished and get it to the president’s desk by July 4, and that’s a big thing,” Johnson said.
A look inside the bill
On the tax front, the legislation extends the expiring tax cuts for individuals and businesses and adds in a number of Trump’s campaign promises. That includes no taxes on tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans. But those exemptions would only last until 2028, which coincides with the end of his second term.
Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $4,000 deduction. And the bill would create new savings accounts for children — called a “Trump Account” — with a one-time infusion of $1,000 from the federal government.
One of the biggest sticking points during negotiations was over raising the cap on deductions for state and local taxes, otherwise known as SALT. Blue-state Republicans were pushing for bigger concessions on SALT because of its effect on high cost-of-living states like Connecticut, New York and California.
While Connecticut Democrats aren’t supportive of the GOP bill, they have pushed to lift the cap in the past. Under the 2017 Trump tax law, SALT deductions were capped at $10,000 for filers who itemize deductions.
The original offer increased the cap to $30,000. When Trump came to Capitol Hill, he told moderate Republicans to take the deal, arguing that SALT benefits Democratic-led states. But they were able to negotiate new terms: a $40,000 cap for married couples, which would get phased out for those making over $500,000. Both caps would increase by 1% through 2033.
In 2022, Connecticut taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, over 11% of the state’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
The $2,000 maximum federal child tax credit is also set to expire at the end of the year without any action. Under this bill, it would get a modest boost, albeit temporary.
Through 2028, it would increase to $2,500. After that, it would go back down to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation. 
Democrats like DeLauro have pushed for the restoration of the expanded child tax credit included in the 2021 pandemic relief bill, which has since expired. That enhancement increased the rebate up to $3,600 per child under age 6 and $3,000 per child between 6 to 18 and was fully refundable.
Critics of the GOP bill say it disadvantages the lowest-income families who don’t owe federal taxes and can’t claim the full credit. The proposal also requires parents who file taxes jointly to both have Social Security numbers.
The legislation would also give a significant bump in spending for defense and border security. That includes more money for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as well as new border patrol agents and workers at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The bill also includes a $1,000 fee for migrants applying to seek asylum.
And on energy policy, the bill would end clean energy-related tax breaks that would be in place for years through former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which included credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient home appliances.
Bill could overhaul Medicaid, SNAP
To pay for the legislation, Republicans have proposed generating billions of dollars in savings by making steep cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
Republicans say they are seeking changes to these programs to root out waste, fraud and abuse and ensure that those who need it are covered. But Democrats and advocates of these programs are raising concerns that an overhaul could leave out vulnerable individuals and families who rely on the programs.
Changes to Medicaid have been the biggest obstacle, in terms of both policy and politics, throughout the negotiations of this bill and the requirement to cut $880 billion from a number of programs.
The bill would require 80 hours of work, volunteer or educational requirements a month for certain enrollees and freeze the hospital tax, a mechanism that enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government.
Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, covers about 1 million people, or about 25% of the state’s population, according to the Department of Social Services. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projects Connecticut will spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year. The federal government contributed roughly $6.9 billion, or 59%, of that funding.
“In eastern Connecticut, I’ve heard directly from hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers about the real-life impacts of this bill’s cuts to Medicaid,” U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd, said in a statement. “Non-partisan budget analysts determined that 13 million Americans will lose their health coverage. Locally, thousands of people in Connecticut’s 2nd District will become uninsured, which will hurt our hospitals and primary health networks, too.”
The GOP measure would also significantly restructure SNAP and place a new financial commitment on states. The federal government has always fully covered benefits and shares the administrative costs of running the program equally with each state. Under the new proposal, Congress would institute a cost-sharing program with states and increase state contributions for administrative expenses to 75%.
The new expectations that states may need to start covering benefits in 2028 could place a new burden on Connecticut’s finances and state budget. State officials don’t yet know how exactly that might affect the administration of the program but anticipate that a “redesign” is inevitable if the state cannot cover the costs, according to state Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves.
In Connecticut, nearly 400,000 people, or 1 in 9 state residents, got those benefits in 2024, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children. That same year, Connecticut received a total of $885 million in SNAP benefits.
The GOP plan would also impose stronger work requirements for certain able-bodied adults without dependents. For older adults, it would raise the age limit from 54 to 64. The same would also apply to adults with children age 7 or older. They would be required to work or participate in related training for at least 80 hours a month.
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, estimated that if Connecticut takes on the cost of covering 10% of the state’s SNAP benefits, it would need to spend $89 million. But that percentage would likely be higher based on an analysis from the GOP-led House Agriculture Committee. Based on 2023 error rate data, the committee estimates Connecticut’s cost-share would be 20%.
“It pushes enormous costs onto already financially strapped state governments, forcing them into impossible choices between cutting essential services like public safety and education, raising taxes, or most likely, slashing food benefits for their residents,” said Hayes, who is ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Foreign Agriculture, and Horticulture.
“As Connecticut food banks, already struggling to meet the current demand that saw them distribute an estimated 46 million meals last year, have made clear,” she continued, “any reduction in food assistance, especially with persistently higher grocery prices, will lead to more families facing hunger. They simply lack the resources to fill the gap created by these federal cuts.”

But that is likely where the effort will end given that Democrats control the Michigan Senate and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s steadfast support for the LGBTQ+ community.
The House voted to advance House Bill 4066 and House Bill 4469, sponsored by Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell) and Rep. Rylee Linting (R-Wyandotte), respectively. 
HB 4066 passed 58-46, with all Republican members of the House voting in favor of the bill. HB 4469 passed 59-45, with Democratic Rep. Amos O’Neal (D-Saginaw) jumping sides to join Republicans in advancing the legislation.

The bills would collectively ban transgender girls from joining interscholastic girls’ sports and would protect schools from legal liability for excluding transgender girls, as well as amend the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to greenlight the move in statute.
Multiple Republicans rose to support the package, including controversial Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford). He claimed there was a commonsense motive for the bill, alleging without evidence that there were “B-team boys sports players” who “jump over to the A-team girls team” and were disrupting the fabric of school sports in Michigan. His wife was a soccer player throughout her collegiate career, and he said she helped “counsel” him on his vote for the bill.
While the Michigan High School Athletic Association has a policy allowing transgender girls to play sports on girls teams on a case by case basis with a waiver, association officials say very few high school students inquire about or utilize it. The MHSAA previously told lawmakers there are typically two inquiries each year out of about 180,000 athletes. 
GOP lawmakers urge MHSAA to ban transgender girls from female sports teams in Michigan

Additionally, Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Qunicy) said that the bills mirror the conservative religious belief that men are men and women are women, basing that belief on the tenets of the Christian Bible. She also said that girls would have no way to reasonably compete if “biological men” were allowed to be included in girls’ sports, and that it was a matter of women’s civil rights.
Several Democrats rose to speak against the bills, including Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth), a former teacher and girls and boys cross country coach, who said these bills stand to ostracize a community that is already subject to bullying and increased risk of youth suicide.
Koleszar said he recently visited the high school he taught in, and was able to speak with a coach there. The representative was asked if the House was still considering its ban on transgender inclusion in school sports. When he told the coach that it was likely coming up for a vote this week, the coach told Koleszar that his colleagues should “stop wasting your time and do things that actually help us.”
“I can’t agree more,” Koleszar said. “Multiple studies have shown us that the transgender community is at a dramatically increased risk of suicide. This legislation will further isolate and ostracize a group of children and adolescents that are at an already increased risk of suicide. Make no mistake, this legislation and the rhetoric that surrounds it could get somebody killed.”
Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) said the bills move the state backward, and questioned the civil rights aspect of the bills considering they aimed to dismantle the civil rights of an entire community.
“These bills tell the children of our state that some can have civil rights, but not all,” Rheingans said.
Equality Michigan decried the vote in a news release, which condemned House Republicans and highlighted the fact that O’Neal voted in favor of the ELCRA rewrite.
“Kids shouldn’t have to worry about opposing team’s coaches, fans, or politicians requiring them to prove their gender just because they look tall, have short hair or broad shoulders, or because they have a good serve,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, in a statement. “The MHSAA has already said there are zero trans girls with waivers to compete in winter and spring sports right now. But that isn’t stopping 59 Michigan Representatives from playing dangerous political games that hurt Michigan families.”
Knott said her organization was calling on the Legislature to take up commonsense legislation that supports the safety and well-being of all Michiganders – like providing funds for free school meals, protections against gun violence and tax credits for working parents – instead of subjecting young athletes to gender inspections.
“[The bills] will now head to the Michigan Senate, but they are unlikely to pass,” Knott said. “In the meantime, EQMI will continue to advocate for the rights of transgender students and their families in our state. Full stop.”

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)A federal court hearing held Thursday to determine the fate of Florida’s strict new law on ballot initiatives veered into culinary criticism as an attorney compared the measure to “sausage.”
 Attorneys for the DeSantis administration insisted that sausage is edible while those on the other side called it “rancid.”
Florida legislators passed the law after citizens’ initiatives to allow abortion and recreational pot nearly passed last November. Critics contend that the new law — with all of its restrictions on groups and who can collect signatures — will make it nearly impossible for outside organizations to ever place an initiative on the ballot in the future.
Groups have challenged the new law — which was a top priority for Gov. Ron DeSantis — on grounds that it violates their rights to free speech and due process.
During the hearing, Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker listened to about three hours of testimony on Florida Decides Healthcare’s and Smart & Safe Florida’s request that he block certain provisions of the law while the legal challenge moves ahead — including a requirement that sponsors turn in completed petitions within 10 days after the voter signs the petition, as well as stepped up fines and criminal penalties.
Walker, who posed pointed questions to both sides, asked everyone to “please be patient,” as he considers his ruling.
Florida Decides is behind a campaign to put a Medicaid expansion on the ballot in November 2026. Smart & Safe Florida is behind a renewed initiative to make recreational marijuana legal for adults in Florida. 
Both groups need to collect and certify 880,000 voter signatures before Feb. 1 of next year to make the November 2026 ballot.

Tallahassee attorney Glenn Burhans Jr. said that, prior to the new law taking effect, Smart & Safe Florida was collecting 78,000 signatures per week. Since the law took effect, he said, the group is collecting between 12,000 and 15,000 signatures per week.
He said that 1,100 petition circulators who were out in the field have been “lost” due to the law with its felony penalties.
“That places the ability to get this on the ballot in peril,” he said.
Burhans noted that the law not only condenses the time to submit a petition, it doesn’t allow for the period to be extended to account for office closures or holidays — the Legislature, he noted, rejected such extensions. That means petition collectors could have as little as seven days to turn in the forms, he said. 
Burhans used the coming Memorial Day Weekend as an example, noting that supervisors of elections offices will be closed from May 24-27. If Smart& Safe Florida collected 1,700 signatures on May 16 but didn’t deliver them before an office closed, it could face fines of upward of $255,000 ($85,000 a day times three days).
“Your honor, that’s real life. That’s impact,” he said. 
Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, representing Secretary of State Cord Byrd, said that the timeline was condensed from 30 days to 10 days to give the supervisors of elections more time to review the petitions and sniff out fraudulent forms.  
The state intends to keep language in its rules and regulations that would allow sponsors to deliver petitions outside the 10-day time frame for holidays and office closures, Jazil said.
Is the sausage edible or rancid?
Walker pressed Jazil on some points, such as what constitutes personal identifying information that must be placed on the petitions. Jazil defended HB 1205 and at one point noted that legislation being made was like watching sausage get made — a famously distasteful process. Jazil joked that this sausage, HB 1205, was edible.
“Sometimes the sausage aren’t real tasty, that’s why we have challenges here,” Walker replied.
In his rebuttal, Burhans said the law bans supervisors from reviewing ballots between July 1 and September 1. That, he said, doesn’t give supervisors more time, but instead creates a 90-day log jam. 
Additionally, Burhans stressed that HB 1205 specifically removed language from statute allowing for extensions for holidays and office closures. Agencies cannot promulgate rules contrary to law, he said.
“The sausage is not only bad, it’s rancid and filled with maggots,” Burhans said.
Mitch Emerson, executive director of Florida Decides Healthcare, told reporters following the hearing that he was optimistic.
“We had the opportunity to make it very clear why this law is unconstitutional and un-American. This isn’t just about one campaign. It’s about protecting every Floridian’s right,” he said. Blocking the law, he continued, would return the state to the existing rules that petition gathers have relied on for years.
 “This means giving people back the ability to organize, gather signatures, and bring issues directly to the ballot without fear, confusion.”

File photos by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe Vermont Supreme Court is weighing in on a rare case in which one elected statewide office holder filed a lawsuit against another.State Auditor Doug Hoffer, a Democrat/Progressive, filed a lawsuit against Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, a Democrat, and her office more than a year ago.In the legal action, Hoffer contended that the Attorney General’s Office had failed to provide him with legal opinions that he sought while the Auditor’s Office was conducting an audit related to the city of Burlington. The attorney general’s office is statutorily required to provide legal advice to public officials.Hoffer also requested that the judge permit him to hire an outside attorney for the lawsuit. Clark had challenged Hoffer’s claims, and was granted dismissal of Hoffer’s lawsuit in Chittenden County Superior civil court in Burlington where it was first filed. Hoffer later refiled the case in Washington County Superior civil court in Montpelier where it was again dismissed. In the case brought in Washington County, Judge Timothy Tomasi also denied a request by Hoffer that the state pay more than $100,000 in attorney fees racked up by his lawyer in both cases, Matthew Byrne, and Byrne’s firm, Gravel & Shea. Hoffer appealed the matters to the Vermont Supreme Court, prompting a hearing Wednesday where attorneys for both offices presented competing arguments. “Right now, the office of the auditor cannot do its job,” Byrne said as he began his arguments to the justices.READ MORE
“The attorney general has said that it will no longer respond to any request for legal advice from the auditor,” Byrne added. “The attorney general has also taken the position that the auditor cannot challenge that position in court. Those decisions cannot stand.” Byrne pointed to state law, which states that “the Attorney General shall advise the elective and appointive State officers on questions of law relating to their official duties and shall furnish a written opinion on such matters, when so requested.” “The language of the statute is ‘shall’ and it is mandatory, so the AG has no discretion about whether to issue an opinion,” Byrne argued.The dispute arose when Hoffer’s office sought legal opinions from the attorney general’s office on three questions related to an audit of a Burlington tax increment financing project, also known as a TIF.The attorney general’s office, Bryne told the justices, “has conceded that it has not answered the first two questions.”Justice Karen Carroll then interjected.“She explained why she wasn’t answering the questions — because other groups in Vermont are the ones that make those decisions about that TIF issue,” Carroll said to Byrne, asking him, “Isn’t that advice to the auditor?”Byrne replied that the response from the attorney general’s office still did not answer two of the three questions for which the auditor’s office requested legal advice.“The statute says that they shall answer the questions of law and shall furnish a written opinion on such matters,” Byrne said.Justice Nancy Waples then replied to Byrne that the attorney general appeared to have referred the auditor’s office to other state entities on the two other questions. “Under the statute the attorney general has to advise or give advice,” Waples said to Byrne. “Doesn’t mean you have to like it, right? And maybe that’s the issue here.”Jonathan Rose, a lawyer in the attorney general’s office, said during his argument that it was an “unusual case” but not necessarily a complex one.The attorney general’s office did respond to three questions from the auditor’s office, he said. For two of the questions, though, staff referred the auditor’s office to administrative state agencies responsible for implementing TIF law. Rose said, in response to a question from Waples, that there were checks on the attorney general when it came to whether the office was meeting its statutory requirements.“We have two elected officials. If we allowed one elected official to sue the other one every time the first one thought the second one wasn’t doing their job properly, that wouldn’t be a very efficient recipe for government,” Rose said.“The second point is that the attorney general is not without constraints in this situation,” he added. “The first, as I mentioned, is political. If the attorney general is not doing her job, she’ll presumably be held accountable for that through the political process.”Rose also disputed the allegation that the attorney general would no longer provide legal advice to the auditor’s office.  “The attorney general’s response was limited to policy issues which fall under the rationale that those issues should be more appropriately addressed at the administrative agency responsible for them,” Rose said. “The attorney general never said she would stop providing legal advice to the auditor.”The high court took the arguments under advisement and is expected to issue written rulings in the coming weeks.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Supreme Court hears legal spat between state auditor and Vermont attorney general .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Doug-Hoffer-Charity-Clark-1024x762.png,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

SPRINGFIELD — A bill creating an interdisciplinary commission to study the interplay between animals, the environment and infectious disease within the Illinois Department of Public Health passed the House unanimously Wednesday.

Senate Bill 291 aims to establish the One Health Commission to aid in communication and collaboration between the state’s physicians, veterinarians, scientific professionals and state agencies on the topics of public health and safety, particularly when it comes to diseases that originate or mutate in animals.

“I think it gives us an advantage so that we have a little bit to be prepared, hopefully there will never be another COVID or another avian flu, but it does give us kind of a leg up in how to plan and how to prepare for that,” bill sponsor Sen. Julie Morrison, D-Lake Forest, told Capitol News Illinois after the bill passed.

The bill’s passage comes after federal action in 2021 and 2023 instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create One Health framework in collaboration with other federal agencies. In February, the CDC launched the National One Health Framework in an effort to protect the people, animals and environment across America from zoonotic diseases, which are viruses or bacteria passed from animals to humans.

Although the term “one health” has been used by scientists since the 1800s, the CDC says it only gained public traction in the 20th century and even more so after the COVID-19 pandemic. Current attention on the issue comes amid concerns about the avian flu, which the IDPH director deemed not an “active risk” in February.

“A One Health approach is important because approximately 60% of known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate from animals,” the bill language reads. “Animals can serve as early warning indicators of potential public health threats, and robust agricultural and environmental health systems are integral to public health preparedness and response efforts.”

Two other states have enacted One Health frameworks. After a 2021 Congressional report, New Jersey created a One Health Task Force, and after a 2023 Congressional act, the state of Washington started a One Health Needs Assessment Report.

Some of the issues these One Health frameworks deal with include “zoonotic diseases, neglected tropical diseases, vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, food safety and food security, environmental contamination,” according to the CDC.

SB291 tasks the One Health Commission with providing feedback and support to state agencies and local governments on zoonotic disease outbreaks in both humans and animals. Also, the bill directs the commission to develop and integrate new reductions of hazards to humans, animals and the environment into current public health strategies.

It will also improve health surveillance tools used by multiple agencies and organizations, as well as provide further education to public health and agricultural health professionals who prescribe antibiotics, including recommending the use of antibiotic alternatives.

Currently, Morrison said agencies and organizations lack the proper communication between their fields that is needed to tackle public health threats. SB291 aims to increase those communications by bringing public health experts together.

One Health Commission members will include the IDPH director, the president of the University of Illinois, the directors of six other state agencies, and the director of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, who will be an advisory, non-voting member. Others on the commission will include two licensed veterinarians, two licensed physicians – one of which must have expertise in infectious diseases surveillance – and four academic experts appointed by the director of IDPH.

Commission members would be unpaid.

Why veterinarians?

“Veterinarians are not just people who take care of dogs,” Morrison said. “We purchase the beef that veterinarians treat and care for. I mean, it's even things like hormones, its antibiotics, it's things that go into the animal population that we then end up consuming one way or the other.”

The commission will provide the General Assembly and governor with a report by Jan.  1, 2028. Among other things, the report will include an assessment of One Health surveillance and response systems as well as policy recommendations to increase public health and safety in the state.

And although the original bill language labeled the congregation of state officials and experts as a “task force,” the bill sponsor changed the language to a “commission” after the House committee hearing in March.

“You know, a task force is usually really short, and it has a report to the General Assembly and then it goes away,” Morrison said. “I think this speaks to a more permanent organization that's going to be put in place.”

SB291 now awaits the governor’s approval to become law after passing both chambers without opposition.

Utility and interconnection officials have cited power-hungry data centers as a major cause of growing demand for electricity. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)A Senate panel approved another series of bills meant to reduce the impact of electricity prices that are set to soar on June 1.
The bills, which cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee in divided votes Thursday, would raise data centers’ share of electricity costs, boost construction of energy storage, and create an automatic approval process for residential solar projects, among other things.
Environmental groups hailed the data center legislation, which would create a separate rate-setting process within the Board of Public Utilities for data centers with maximum monthly demands of at least 100 megawatts, forcing them to pay for increases in energy costs as a result of data center load.
“This bill would not only provide an incentive for data centers to drive consumption down, but it would also protect ratepayers from shouldering the unfair burden of the cost,” said Jay Weisbond, a policy assistant for the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.
It would also require rates for data centers to include cost recoveries for transmission or distribution infrastructure needed for their operation. The separate rate-setting process contemplated in the bill would take effect one year after its passage.
Utility and interconnection officials have cited power-hungry data centers as a major cause of the growing demand for electricity.
Electricity prices are spiking as demand that had been largely level for decades surges, and New Jersey’s in-state generation has faced stumbles as offshore wind projects set to deliver thousands of megawatts fail or are blocked by federal regulatory authorities.
Republicans have blamed Gov. Phil Murphy’s wind-heavy renewable energy agenda and the shuttering of existing fossil plants for auction-driven price spikes set to arrive June 1, while Democrats have sought to lay the increases at the feat of PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states. Assembly Democrats are particularly anxious about rising utility bills, as all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot this year (Democrats hold a majority in the chamber).
Separate legislation would require quarterly reporting on data centers’ energy and water usage.
Business groups opposed both bills, warning they would push data centers into other states, including those on the same grid as New Jersey,
“We can’t entice data centers to locate in New Jersey if we’re going to continually be putting roadblocks in the way or making it more expensive or problematic to develop here in New Jersey,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
Murphy and legislators have sought to encourage AI development in New Jersey, including through tax credits, hailing it in July 2024 as a “transformative industry that will change lives and grow our economy.”
The state would be better served by boosting electricity supply than by targeting large energy users, Cantor said, adding that manufacturing plants and even hospitals could run similar loads.
Though some suggested expansions, witnesses were broadly supportive of a bill requiring the Board of Public Utilities to procure and incent large-scale energy storage projects, which store energy produced at times of low demand to ease strains on production when demand is high.
Storage projects could start operating in the short term and would more quickly affect prices than other types of generation, they said.
“It doesn’t have to wait in line for PJM Interconnection, which we know takes years. It can be interconnected locally. It can be permitted locally, so it’s the fastest way to build,” said Lyle Rawlings, CEO of Advanced Solar Projects Inc. “These projects, we’re not talking about 2029 or 2030, we’re talking about 2026 that these can be brought online.”
Separate legislation would require the Department of Community Affairs to create an online permitting platform to algorithmically approve residential solar projects. Municipalities could use the platform or set up their own automated solar approval system.
Supporters saw it as another method of quickly standing up new energy supply.
“Local solar can be a critical tool in meeting our energy needs, but only if we need it. While large-scale solar projects are important, they are often facing multi-year delays in the PJM interconnection queue. Local solar, on the other hand, can be rapidly deployed,” said Elowyn Corby, mid-Atlantic regional director of the Vote Solar Action Fund.

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.

“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.

New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.

Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-22 19:47:31+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge blocks Trump’s orders to dismantle the Education Department and fire employees,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/22/trump-dismantle-education-department-judge/,A federal judge blocked Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Education Department and ordered it to reinstate employees who were fired.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Education Department and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs. The administration said it would challenge the ruling.
U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump’s goal to shut down the department. It marks a setback to one of the Republican president’s campaign promises.
The ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits that said Trump’s plan amounted to an illegal closure of the Education Department.
One suit was filed by the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts along with the American Federation of Teachers and other education groups. The other suit was filed by a coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general.
The suits argued that layoffs left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including duties to support special education, distribute financial aid and enforce civil rights laws.
In his order, Joun said the plaintiffs painted a “stark picture of the irreparable harm that will result from financial uncertainty and delay, impeded access to vital knowledge on which students and educators rely, and loss of essential services for America’s most vulnerable student populations.”
Layoffs of that scale, he added, “will likely cripple the Department. The idea that Defendants’ actions are merely a ‘reorganization’ is plainly not true.”
Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the ruling.
“Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,” spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement.
Joun ordered the Education Department to reinstate federal workers who were terminated as part of the March 11 layoff announcement.
That announcement led to the firing of about 1,300 people. Some Education Department employees have left through buyout offers and the termination of probationary employees, which combined with the layoffs have reduced the staff to roughly half the 4,100 the department had when Trump took office.
“Today’s order means that the Trump administration’s disastrous mass firings of career civil servants are blocked while this wildly disruptive and unlawful agency action is litigated,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which represents plaintiffs in the Somerville case.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called the decision “a first step to reverse this war on knowledge and the undermining of broad-based opportunity.”
The administration has said the layoffs are aimed at efficiency, not a department shutdown. Trump has called for the closure of the agency but recognizes it must be carried out by Congress, the government said.
The administration said restructuring the agency “may impact certain services until the reorganization is finished” but it’s committed to fulfilling its statutory requirements.

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)The chief justice of the Nevada Supreme Court on Thursday announced plans to pursue the creation of a dedicated business court, saying a resolution currently under consideration by the state legislature is not necessary.
Chief Justice Douglas Herndon intends to file a petition next month with the Nevada Supreme Court to approve the creation of a Commission to Study the Adjudication of Business Law, according to a media release. That commission will work out specific details, like how judges will be selected for the business court.
The expectation is that the dedicated business court will be operational “within a year.”
Why some think Nevada should challenge Delaware as premier destination for corporate lawsuits

Herndon’s announcement comes on the heels of Assembly Joint Resolution 8, a proposal to amend the Nevada State Constitution to establish a dedicated business court. That resolution passed the full Assembly last month and needs to pass the full Senate by Friday or be declared dead. Then, AJR8 would have to pass the 2027 Legislature before appearing before voters in the 2028 general election for final approval.
Herndon in a statement said the court has been “closely following” legislative discussions on AJR8.
“I’m confident that within our own court system we can enhance our existing approach to business law cases and create a dedicated court where district court judges hear only business cases and do it without any additional fiscal impact on the state,” he said. “In addition, we can address the timeliness and efficiency of judicial review of business cases, eliminate the need to amend the constitution and the uncertainty associated with waiting years to see if the resolution gets approved.”

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)A federal judge has denied Florida’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit against a 2021 law punishing social media platforms for alleged censorship of conservatives.
U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida issued an order Thursday denying the state’s motions to toss the suit brought by two trade associations representing social media giants and to compel those companies to turn over information about their internal policies.
The order came weeks after Hinkle held a hearing in Tallahassee in which he said he’s still perplexed about what the Legislature meant to accomplish by trying to limit social media content moderation. Hinkle wrote that neither the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit nor the U.S. Supreme Court had questioned the plaintiffs’ standing to sue Florida.
NetChoice and co-plaintiff Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) argue that the law violates the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague. The two groups represent a number of the biggest social media companies, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Apple, and Pinterest.
“Once again, a judge has confirmed the importance of the First Amendment, rejecting Florida’s attempts to evade review of its unconstitutional statute,” wrote Stephanie Joyce, director of CCIA’s Litigation Center, in a press release Thursday. “This law tries to force websites to speak as the state commands, which strikes at the heart of free discourse and democracy. We now move forward with demonstrating why this law must be struck down.”
Hinkle is revisiting the case after the country’s highest court punted it back to the Eleventh Circuit because the justices found that the appellate court had not conducted a proper analysis of the groups’ First Amendment challenges, which in turn sent the case back to Hinkle.
Trump’s banishment
The law the Legislature passed following then-former President Donald Trump’s banishment from social media platforms after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol prohibits deplatforming any candidate for statewide political office. Additionally, SB 7072 granted the Florida Election Commission authority to fine platforms with gross revenues of more than $100 million or more than 100 million monthly users $250,000 per day for banning statewide candidates and $25,000 per day for candidates for other offices.
In his order Thursday, Hinkle wrote that provisions in the law, such as one banning platforms from placing candidates’ posts or posts about them in a less prominent position, would give candidates a statutory right to flood users’ feeds.
“The defendants have not attempted to explain what these provisions really mean or how they would be applied. Nor have the defendants offered any theory under which a state can preclude this kind of curating without violating the First Amendment,” Hinkle wrote.
Still, Hinkle, who originally issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the law, leaned toward a belief that provisions of the law are unconstitutional as applied to some of the companies rather than considering the law unconstitutional on its face. He used that reasoning to deny the state’s motion to force the plaintiffs to turn over more information about specific companies.
“The plaintiffs’ facial challenge to SB 7072, and perhaps even to its various provisions viewed in isolation, is likely to fail — and the disputed discovery, if allowed, would almost surely make no difference,” Hinkle wrote.

Management also sent out emails to the staff offering pride-themed T-shirts for workers to purchase, the lawsuit claims.
That day, Cunningham alleges, he began wearing T-shirts at work that displayed or referred to Bible verses. According to the lawsuit, he did this to “express his sincerely held religious belief in Jesus Christ and the Bible.”
One shirt read, “Pride goes before destruction, an arrogant spirit before a fall. Proverbs 16:18.” Another shirt read, “Taking back the rainbow. Genesis 9:13.” A third read, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. James 4:6.”
Over the next eight weeks, Eaton managers allegedly held a series of meetings with Cunningham to express their concern that his actions were perceived by others as inflammatory and that they might violate company policy.
According to the lawsuit, management refused Cunningham’s requests for a religious accommodation to wear the T-shirts, threatened him with dismissal, and sent him home on at least two occasions for refusing to stop wearing the shirts. On Aug. 23, 2023, the company fired Cunningham, the lawsuit alleges.
In his lawsuit, Cunningham stated that he believes “homosexual conduct is sinful” and that he had been called upon to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others. Doing so, he claimed, required him to share with others even those biblical teachings that are offensive to those who don’t share such beliefs.
In its response to those claims, lawyers for the Eaton Corp. argued Cunningham was not entitled to any damages because any actions taken by the company against him “were legitimate and non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory,” and were based on legitimate business reasons.
In his lawsuit, Cunningham was represented by Robert Anderson of Atlantic, an attorney for the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative organization that said it works to promote religious freedom and parental rights. The Southern Poverty Law Center has characterized the Pacific Justice Institute as “an anti-LGBT hate group” whose founder has “compared legalized gay marriage to Hitler and the Nazis’ ascent in Germany.”
Anderson said Thursday he’s not at liberty to comment on the specifics of the settlement that was reached last month. Attorneys for the Eaton Corp. did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the matter.

As President Trump seeks to fast-track uranium mines in the Southwest, experts said a robust state review processwill stand in the way. (Photo by Jack Delano via Library of Congress website)Recent federal activity suggests the Trump administration has two long-stalled uranium mines near New Mexico’s Mount Taylor on its radar.
Earlier this month, a federal infrastructure agency included Roca Honda and La Jara Mesa uranium mines on a new list of 20 projects nationally that advance “the President’s directive to take immediate action to facilitate domestic production of America’s vast mineral resources,” according to a statement from the council.
Then last week, the U.S. Interior Department announced that a proposed uranium mine in Utah would be subject to only a 14-day federal review period, shortening what is commonly a years-long process.
Source New Mexico spoke with state officials, outside experts and longtime anti-uranium advocates about what defense New Mexico will have against the federal government’s efforts to restart uranium mining here for the first time in 50 years. While experts said hard-fought cultural protections are unlikely to present much of an obstacle, they expressed confidence that state regulations will hold up against federal encroachment.

“I think that the realities weigh against the administration’s ignorant and uninformed policies that suggest to the public that these kinds of projects will happen overnight,” said Christopher Shuey, a public health researcher closely monitoring uranium developments here. “They won’t.”
 Holding the line

Private companies have sought to develop the La Jara Mesa and Roca Honda mines for more than a decade, though interest heated up with Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production. Soon after, Cibola National Forest leaders named both mines priority projects, and then uranium company Energy Fuels then struck a controversial deal with the Navajo Nation that would allow it to transport ore from Roca Honda across the reservation. Meanwhile, Laramide Resources indicated on its state permitting application a desire to expedite the next step of its La Jara Mesa project.
DJ Ennis, program manager for the state’s Mining Act Reclamation Program, confirmed to Source NM there’s been a “renewed interest” from uranium mining companies seeking to break ground in New Mexico.
But even if the federal government tries to fast-track mining here, Ennis said the state will take its time and fully review both mine proposals, which it is empowered to do under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act, and in lieu of a federal law.
Trump administration expedites permitting for Utah uranium mine to a two-week process

“The feds are going to do what the feds are going to do,” Ennis told Source. “It does affect us, in that it would be good if the state and the feds were on the same pace and page of permitting. But if that is not the case, the default then becomes the state’s permitting process, and we have a robust permitting process.”
At the federal level, new uranium mines are subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, which Trump’s recent orders have accelerated. But that has no bearing on the state’s ongoing review, Ennis said.
If it came down to it, Ennis said, the state could issue daily fines and potentially even deploy state police officers to stop uranium extraction at the Roca Honda or La Jara Mesa sites if the companies did so without a state permit.
So if Trump were to order a truncated federal review of the La Jara Mesa mine like he did the Velvet-Wood mine in Utah last week, and then the Forest Service issued a rushed environmental impact statement that selected its preferred alternative of extracting uranium, and then company proceeded to break ground, the state would step in and stop it, Ennis said.
“I’m not sure what that looks like, if it involves state police to enforce the order or courts,” Ennis said. “But it is a state law that we are enforcing.”
Eric Jantz, attorney with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, said the state’s permit review should offer the public some reassurance that nothing will happen immediately. He also suggested that his organization would consider suing if the federal government sought to fast-track New Mexico uranium mines.
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

“I suspect that if the Forest Service either ignores its obligations under NEPA because of this executive order or its own regulations, that litigation will probably ensue,” he said.
That’s because, Jantz said, he sees little basis for an “energy emergency” that Trump claims is the reason to fast-track the mines.
“If there’s one thing to impart, it’s that this whole notion of premising expedited environmental reviews on some sort of emergency is preposterous,” he said. “No emergency exists, and there’s no reason why the usual environmental reviews can’t continue.”


 What will TCP designation mean?

While experts and observers expressed confidence in the state’s capacity to hold off a federal push to expedite mining, they said it remains unclear whether efforts by local Indigenous tribes and pueblos to protect Mount Taylor as a cultural and religious site will add another layer of protection.
In 2007, as several mining companies moved forward with plans to extract uranium from the Mount Taylor area, five tribes made the unusual step of sharing stories about their ancestral and spiritual connections to the mountain. 
That rare disclosure of tribal creation myths marked an early milestone in a multi-year battle to create a 400,000-acre Traditional Cultural Property, drawing a line around Mount Taylor recognized by the state of New Mexico. Among other things, the designation aimed to give Indigenous people a voice in opposing uranium or other mining interests. After mining companies sued in 2009, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the designation should stay intact.
Since then, the  pueblos have maintained opposition, with the All Pueblo Council of Governors in December issuing a resolution to state regulators that “Mount Taylor, known by various traditional names is a sacred landscape, central to the cultural identity, traditional practices, and religious activities of numerous Pueblos and other tribal nations.”
Even though the Navajo Nation agreed to let uranium eventually be transported from Roca Honda across the reservation, it has also long opposed any new mines in the Mount Taylor area, Stephen Etsitty, the Navajo Environmental Protection Agency director, said recently.
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Designation of Mount Taylor as a traditional cultural property has yet to emerge as an issue in the state permitting process, Ennis said. The designation requires federal and state parties to consult with tribes, but a collision awaits between private mining interests and cultural protections, Ennis said.
“The intersection of those two is a difficult question to answer,” he said. “I don’t know that we’ll know until we get to the end of the process.”
Shuey, who has advocated against the mines since 2009 as a researcher with the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the recent federal fast-tracking prompted him and colleagues to review what the TCP designation actually meant for protecting Mount Taylor.
“We’ve been asking this question for the last several weeks,” he said. “My understanding is that the impact of the TCP would be more of a, ‘Pay attention to this site from the standpoint of cultural resources, and make provisions to mitigate any types of impact to cultural resources’ type of thing.”
Even without an outright ban on mining or around the TCP, Shuey said, he expects greenlighting the mines to take years, during which time opponents will watchdog the process.
“A lot of these folks have lived through the 80 years of the uranium legacy. They’ve learned across generations of the impacts of mining,” he said. “And so I think there’s a lot of not only institutional memory but institutional knowhow of evaluating mining proposals and offering intelligent and compelling comments and testimonies.”
He likes their odds against a Trump administration that seems to “not be particularly interested in understanding or knowing the impacts of mining,” he said, but instead has a “weird, visceral notion that we just need more of these minerals for a variety of purposes, and we’re going to go get them.”

May 21, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday evening that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives’ budget bill – which passed Thursday morning – would have disastrous consequences for 2.6 million Michiganders.
The dire message came during a virtual press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association on Wednesday. Whitmer was joined by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
The call was meant to highlight the potentially damaging effects of making deep cuts to Medicaid, which has been a part of ongoing negotiations among Republican appropriators in the U.S. House of Representatives. Each member of Michigan’s Republican congressional delegation voted for the bill, while the Democratic members of the delegation voted against it.
Whitmer said that among the 2.6 million Michiganders who could lose access to their coverage if the cuts go through, nearly one million were children.

“They’re our neighbors. They’re people who are battling cancer, veterans who served our country, who are disabled, the family next door, and the GOP is rushing to terminate Medicaid coverage for millions of Americans as fast as possible,” Whitmer said. “They don’t want us to see all that is contained in that bill, and blasting through these cuts is going to hurt those who can least afford care, and won’t do anything to lower our health care costs. In fact, they’ll rise for everyone.”
Whitmer said the Republican U.S. House budget currently in the works would make some of the largest cuts to Medicaid in the country’s history. She added that the cuts would cause providers to close their doors, a potential lack of available rural health care and a reduction in the quality of medical service in Michigan – on top of the possibility of terminated coverage for children and post-partum women.
“Make no mistake, families in Michigan and all across the country are going to feel the effects of this bill in our day-to-day lives,” Whitmer said. “I’m talking to Michiganders every day. I’m hearing their stories. … We should be working across the aisle to make health care better and easier to afford, kind of like we’ve done here in Michigan.”
Whitmer touted the bipartisan effort to enact the Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid to more than a million people. Last year, the state also codified portions of the Affordable Care Act into Michigan.
“We wanted to protect Michiganders with pre-existing conditions and let kids stay on their parents’ insurance until they’re 26, and we wanted to guarantee essential services and insurance plans,” she said.
If Republicans in Congress truly wanted to see improvements in health costs and help for more families to get coverage, Whitmer said she was all for it and was willing to work with them. But that’s not what the budget bill does, she noted.
“It does the opposite,” Whitmer said. “Families in my state and all across the country are going to pay the price for it, and that’s why we’re together, united, fighting for the people in our country and our ability to get health care.”
Whitmer was asked about U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), one of the front runners on the Michigan Republican side of the 2026 gubernatorial race to replace her. James voted to move the bill out of committee and voted for the bill on Thursday. The congressman has been steadfast in his belief that the bill and its cuts to Medicaid would help reduce fraud, waste and abuse.
Michigan’s governor was asked if voters from her state were willing to accept that argument.
Whitmer said that she worked with Republican former Gov. Rick Snyder to expand the state’s Medicaid program when she was the Michigan Senate minority leader before running for governor herself. She said Snyder, a self-professed “nerd” for details, understood the math involved and what it meant to have access to these types of programs.
“It motivated him to work across the aisle. Almost a million people in Michigan got health care because of that work,” Whitmer said. “It is shocking to me that we are in this moment where if there was one [Republican] congressperson with a backbone from each of our four states, they could single handedly stop this from happening by working together.”
In that vein, she called on James to stand up to his caucus and be a hero.
“He says he wants my job. Well, you know what? I guarantee he doesn’t want it if he’s throwing 700,000 people off of health care in the state, running hospitals into the ground,” Whitmer said. “He could be a hero here. … Michiganders expect and want leaders who are going to put their interests first. And so this talking point about fraud, we’re all against fraud; 100 percent of us are against fraud, and we know there’s always more ways that we can help find some savings and make government work better. But that’s not what this bill is all about. This bill is about terminating healthcare for Americans in order to pay for a tax break for the ultra wealthy.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-21-at-4.53.42 PM-1024x666.png,,,2025-05-22 16:06:46.390412

Phil Scott speaks during his weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, May 14. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott signed lawmakers’ state budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year into law Wednesday. The plan lays out $9.01 billion in state spending for the yearlong period starting July 1 — and includes a handful of new measures designed to limit the impacts of potential cuts to the state’s federal funding. Scott, a Republican, was notably complimentary of the House and Senate’s budget bill in a letter to legislators that accompanied his signature. Democratic leadership in both chambers, knowing they almost certainly could not override a budget veto this year, trimmed tens of millions of dollars in proposed “base” spending — money expected to be appropriated year-over-year — from the legislation after Scott insisted on cuts. The governor had proposed an $8.99 billion state budget in January.“I appreciate that this budget makes important affordability investments,” Scott wrote, pointing to lawmakers’ use of about $75 million from the state’s general fund that’s expected to help reduce the property tax bills people pay to support education. Scott also complimented how lawmakers set aside about $13 million in the budget to offset a slate of proposed tax credits that would benefit low-income families, workers and veterans, as well as retirees and people receiving military pensions.The credits are included in a separate bill, S.51, over which House and Senate leaders still need to work out their differences in a joint conference committee.While the state budget is typically lawmakers’ last act before adjournment every year, this year, there are still several major bills working their way through the Statehouse that deal with some of the headline issues from last fall’s election. In his letter, the governor urged legislators to pass a version of this year’s landmark education reform bill, H.454. The bill is being debated on the Senate floor Thursday as school district leaders — and a number of senators themselves —  have panned the language that several of the chamber’s committees drafted in recent weeks.Senators were weighing to what extent they should revise their version of the bill to be more in line with what passed out of the House last month. That version appeared to have more support among the members of the Senate’s Democratic majority. Scott has threatened to use his power to summon lawmakers back to the Statehouse if they adjourn for the year without reaching agreement on an education bill. “While not perfect, (the budget bill) makes critical investments in affordability, housing, education and public safety,” the governor wrote Wednesday. “But we must focus on the policy bills that fix what’s broken so the funding can have its intended impact.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Gov.

May 22, 2025 | Screenshot from Kent County's YouTube ChannelGRAND RAPIDS — An ex-Grand Rapids police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist following a 2022 traffic stop will not face a retrial after a first proceeding ended in a mistrial earlier this month.
Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker announced Thursday that he didn’t think another trial for Christopher Schurr, 34, would produce a new outcome.
“I did not arrive at (the decision) lightly,” Becker said. “Basically, what it boils down to is I don’t think we reach a different verdict if I do do a retrial in this case.”
Schurr was tried for second-degree murder for the shooting death of 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant.

Over the course of the six-day trial, the jury heard testimony from 22 witnesses, including several experts who gave conflicting testimony on whether Schurr’s decision to use deadly force was justified.
The trial ended May 8 with jurors unable to reach a verdict after deliberating for nearly four days on whether to convict Schurr of second-degree murder, manslaughter or to acquit him.
“This is an extremely difficult decision,” Becker said. “I looked at everything: I looked at our case. I looked at the defense case. I looked at the arguments that were made. I looked at the jury selection process, because I think that’s one of the biggest things that, going into this, we were thinking about getting a good jury. I even went over and watched more of the trial.”
Becker said he spoke to jurors after the trial and said they were evenly split with four wanting to convict, four wanting to acquit and four undecided. As deliberations continued, the vote evolved to 10-2 in favor of acquittal, although Schurr’s attorney, Matt Borgula, has said the it was 11-1 in favor of acquittal after his own discussions with jurors.
“I thought we presented a good case. I presented everything I wanted. All the facts were out there that I had. It’s not like I can change anything,” Becker said.
Schurr pulled Lyoya over on April 4, 2022, for having a license plate that didn’t match the car he was driving. When Lyoya couldn’t produce a driver’s license, Schurr attempted to place him under arrest, but the motorist ran. Schurr tackled Lyoya to the ground and attempted to use his Taser, but was too close and the motorist deflected the probes. The two then wrestled briefly over the device when the officer pulled out his handgun and fatally shot Lyoya in the back of the head.
Schurr was fired from the Grand Rapids Police Department after he was charged in the shooting in June 2022.
Becker said Thursday he spoke with Lyoya’s father, Peter Lyoya, after reaching the decision this week.
“Obviously, he’s very disappointed in that decision. I know there are many members of the community that are disappointed in the decision.”

Attorney Ven Johnson, who represents the Lyoya family, issued a statement shortly after Becker’s announcement Thursday.
“The Lyoya family has not only lost Patrick, but now the hope that former officer Christopher Schurr will ever be held criminally accountable for taking Patrick’s life,” the statement read. “With today’s decision, what was once a pause in justice has now become a permanent reality. This is not a verdict nor the outcome the Lyoya family sought.”
In December 2022, Lyoya’s family filed a $100 million civil lawsuit in federal court against the city of Grand Rapids and Schurr. In August 2023, a judge dismissed the case against the city, but allowed the litigation to proceed against Schurr.
“We will continue to stand with the Lyoya family in their pursuit of truth, accountability and justice for Patrick, and are awaiting our day in civil court,” Johnson said.

Byron Donalds, a GOP candidate for Florida governor, wants to repeal the ""red-flag"" law.Byron Donalds says “job one” for him if elected governor of Florida next year would be the repeal two provisions of the gun-safety package passed by the Florida Legislature following  the shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.
However, so does Ron DeSantis, and the two measures in question — the state’s “red-flag” law and the ban on individuals under the age of 21 from purchasing a long gun — very much remain the law of the land in Florida.
Donalds appeared Thursday on the Bob Rose Show in Gainesville, where he was asked if he would push for Florida to legalize the open carrying of firearms, another idea the governor has said he supports but which the Legislature has not enacted.
“I would support and push for that, but I think that the bigger thing that we need to get done is really unwinding the red flag laws in our state,” Donalds said.
“When I was in the Legislature, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas bill came through the Legislature. I was a freshman at that time and I opposed that legislation. And I opposed it because I thought that red flag laws really did take away your Fifth Amendment rights as a citizen, and I also felt that there should not be a two-tier system for adults between the ages of 18 and 21.
“I felt that was wrong then, and I still feel that way, so I would tell you that making sure that those two provisions — those constitutional rights are actually restored will probably be job one.”
Formally known as risk-protection orders, the red flag law allows courts to order someone to surrender their firearms if they pose a threat to themselves or others. Former Panhandle Republican Joel Rudman filed a measure to repeal that law late last year, but he resigned to run for Congress in January, and his legislation was never picked up by any of his colleagues during this session.

After a bipartisan vote of 31 to 5 in the Senate, the legislation now moves to the House for final passage.
Among its many provisions, the bill would allow the state insurance commissioner to limit rate increases for insurers that have a track record of hiking costs, and fine those that don’t comply with a state law requiring insurers to offer mental health coverage that’s as robust as coverage for medical services.
Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, co-chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, said the measure includes changes that residents have been demanding for years. 
“This bill is an attempt to help our constituents all throughout Connecticut navigate an ever complex and moving health care system,” Cabrera said during the floor debate on Wednesday. 
The bill also contains measures directly responding to high-profile public scrutiny of the insurance industry over the past year on issues including prior authorization and proposed time limits on the use of anesthesia. 
Sen. Tony Hwang, R-Fairfield, a ranking member of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, called the bill “a reflection of compromise” that incorporated feedback on the original draft passed out of committee. The amended version narrowed the scope of certain affordability and prior authorization regulations on the industry.
Susan Halpin, executive director for the CT Association of Health Plans, said she appreciated Cabrera’s willingness to negotiate, even if she doesn’t agree with much of the bill. 
“We appreciate the considerations that were made based upon the feedback we provided, particularly around the fiscal impact of various sections. While the bill still has a lot of problems, it’s certainly better than it was. And like any good compromise, everybody is a little unhappy,” Halpin said.
Affordability, mental health parity 
The package aims to tackle insurance affordability through a provision granting the insurance commissioner power to limit proposed rate increases on state-regulated plans for certain insurance carriers.
Under the bill, beginning January 1, 2027, if an insurer’s rate increases exceed the state’s “cost growth benchmarks” for the previous two consecutive years where data is available, the commissioner can reduce the carrier’s proposed rate increase by up to two percentage points.
Passed first via executive order in January 2020 and adopted by the legislature in 2022, the state’s cost growth benchmarks program requires the Office of Health Strategy to come up with an annual baseline for growing costs of health care. It also requires providers, insurers and others in the industry to report annual price increases.
This year’s insurance omnibus bill also attempts to give some teeth to a 2019 Connecticut law requiring “mental health parity,” meaning insurance providers cannot place greater restrictions on access to mental health services than on surgical or medical care. It also required insurers to submit reports to the state regarding parity.
The bill would allow the Insurance Commissioner to fine insurers up to $625,000 annually for noncompliance with the mental health parity law. It also would require the parity reports submitted by insurers, including the names of each company, to be made public.
Several supporters of the measure said the 2019 legislation didn’t go far enough because it didn’t include sufficient penalties for noncompliance. During a March public hearing on the bill, mental health providers testified they often hear from patients who can’t access treatments they need because payers are less likely to provide adequate coverage for mental health treatment. 
Cabrera said the insurance bill passed on Wednesday would strengthen existing law.
“Mental health parity has been the law in this state for half a decade, but in many instances it’s a law in name only. This bill provides some much-needed bite in instances where insurers are skirting the law to the detriment of our citizens,” Cabrera wrote in a statement following the bill’s passage.
Access to care
Over the past year, the insurance industry has come under strong criticism, and two measures in the bill attempt to rein in some of the practices that have elicited the most public outrage. 
In December 2024, the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson sparked renewed public contempt for prior authorization, the process by which doctors must obtain approval from insurance companies before providing certain services. 
The bill passed by the Connecticut Senate prohibits “step therapy,” a form of prior authorization, for certain diagnoses, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
“Step therapy” refers to a strategy used by insurers to contain costs, where patients first try a less expensive treatment option for a given condition before “stepping up” to a more expensive treatment option if the initial treatment is ineffective. Critics say the practice often delays patients’ access to the most effective and appropriate treatments. 
State law already prohibited step therapy for stage 4 metastatic cancer. In addition to multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, the proposal passed by the state Senate would permanently extend an existing law prohibiting step therapy for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, which was set to sunset on January 1, 2027. Additionally, it reduces the permitted period for step therapy for any diagnosis from sixty to thirty days. 
The measure also prohibits insurers from placing limits on general anesthesia coverage, a direct response to a proposal from Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield last year to institute time limits on anesthesia services, which the company almost immediately reversed following public outcry.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0521_SR_TeacherArrests_017-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

OKLAHOMA CITY — A deadlocked U.S. Supreme Court has upheld an Oklahoma ruling that struck down the nation’s first religious charter school.
The Court announced Thursday it voted 4-4 with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. It did not disclose how each justice voted, nor did it issue written opinions.
The tied vote affirmed last year’s Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that the concept of a publicly funded Catholic charter school is unconstitutional.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to offer a government-funded online education to students in all parts of the state. St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and operated according to church teachings.
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board voted in 2023 to approve opening the school. Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, calling the school unconstitutional and a threat to religious liberty.
Both the school and the statewide board appealed the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up the case and heard oral arguments April 30.
Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the statewide board contend charter schools are not truly public schools but rather private entities contracting with the state, who therefore should be free to adopt a religion. Excluding faith-based groups from charter school funding is religious discrimination, they said.
In light of the court’s decision, St. Isidore’s Board of Directors said it will continue exploring other options to deliver a virtual Catholic education for all in Oklahoma.
“Families across the state of Oklahoma deserve the educational opportunities presented by St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School,” the board stated. “We are disappointed that the Oklahoma State Supreme Court’s decision was upheld in a 4-4 decision without explanation.”
During oral arguments in Washington, D.C., the Court appeared to be divided on the case. Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson made their doubts clear on St. Isidore while some of the conservative majority, particularly Justice Brett Kavanaugh, signaled support.
Drummond has long contended the Catholic charter school would create a “slippery slope” toward taxpayers having to fund schools of any religious faith, including belief systems Oklahomans might find objectionable.
“The Supreme Court’s decision represents a resounding victory for religious liberty and for the foundational principles that have guided our nation since its founding,” Drummond said in a statement Thursday.
The Statewide Charter School Board, which dropped the word “virtual” from its name in the year since it appealed the case, issued a statement pledging its commitment to all students and the rule of law.
“The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board respects the Court’s authority and appreciates its willingness to hear complex and deeply significant legal questions,” the board’s statement reads. “The split decision of the court affirms this was indeed a complicated matter with a wide spectrum of views on the appropriate relationship between education, public funding, and religious institutions in our state and country.”
While the attorney general led the legal fight against the school, other Republican leaders in the state, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, advocated for giving religious groups access to charter school funds.

Stitt said the matter is “far from a settled issue.”
“This 4-4 tie is a non-decision,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday. “Now we’re in overtime. There will be another case just like this one and Justice Barrett will break the tie.”
Barrett is a former faculty member of the University of Notre Dame Law School, which aided Catholic officials’ case for the school. She did not participate in the decision to consider the Oklahoma appeal nor did she hear oral arguments.
The court’s deadlock could impact a separate lawsuit challenging St. Isidore in Oklahoma County District Court. That case has been on hold while the Supreme Court appeal was ongoing.
A coalition of Oklahoma parents, faith leaders and education advocates filed the lawsuit in 2023 while represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, along with other national legal organizations.
They contend St. Isidore would discriminate against LGBTQ+ students and employees, fail to adequately serve children with disabilities and unlawfully teach religious indoctrination.
Oklahoma City Archdiocese officials said students of all backgrounds and beliefs would have been welcome at St. Isidore. The school promised in its charter contract that it would abide by nondiscrimination laws and other state regulations to the extent that Catholic doctrine permitted.
Americans United is discussing next steps for the Oklahoma County case with the plaintiffs and co-counsel, spokesperson Liz Hayes said.
A religious charter school would be “an abject violation of religious freedom,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United.
“The Supreme Court’s stalemate safeguards public education and upholds the separation of church and state,” Laser said. “Charter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students.”

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A central Iowa dentist involved in an operation that ended with the patient’s death has been fined $7,500 by the Iowa Dental Board.
On April 30, the board entered a final order in the disciplinary case against Jonathan Karch of the Iowa Dental Studio in Johnston. This week, that decision was made public by the board, although some of the contents have been redacted from public view.
The order stipulates that Karch shall not be issued a permit to administer patient sedation until Sept. 13, 2025, and that he shall pay a $7,500 civil penalty and complete some unspecified amount of additional continuing education, with some of that education related to professional ethics. The order also states that should Karch be issued a sedation permit, it will be placed on probationary status for three years during which a practice monitor must be physically present in the treatment room for any sedation procedures handled by Karch.
Last fall, the board issued an emergency order restricting Karch’s practice after a patient who underwent a dental-implant procedure in January 2024 died. The order coincided with a civil lawsuit filed against Karch and others who were involved in the surgery. That lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court by the family of Joseph Daniels, alleges that on Jan. 26, 2024, the 50-year-old Daniels underwent a dental-implant operation that began at 7:15 a.m. and was completed at 3:15 p.m.
Around 3:30 p.m., paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa with a report of an “unconscious person.” According to the lawsuit, the paramedics arrived at 3:40 p.m. and found Daniels in a dental exam chair “pale, cyanotic, cool and unresponsive.” Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center where he died at 5:51 p.m.
According to the board’s findings of fact, “R.W.” — identified in other board records as dentist Robert Wolf of Swisher — was the primary surgeon for the procedure, but did not have a sedation permit at the time. Karch did have a sedation permit but, by all accounts, he was only in the operatory sporadically and spent most of the time 10 to 15 feet away in an adjacent room working on the fabrication of temporary implants.
Wolf “nevertheless proceeded with the surgery, with a certified registered nurse anesthetist contracted by The Dental Studio of Iowa to administer and monitor” the sedation, the board determined.
Karch argued before the board that state regulations require a “dentist” and not a “permit holder” to be present for the entire procedure, and he noted that Wolf was the dentist performing the surgery.
The board rejected that argument, stating that “the rule does not make sense if interpreted to not require the permit holder to remain. In fact, no matter how (the rule) is viewed, its structure and language required a dentist with a sedation permit participating in the dental procedure to remain in the room, which did not occur when Dr. Karch left.” The rule, the board concluded, “required Dr. Karch, as the permit holder, to be present for the entire surgery, which he was not.”
The board added that “while it is true no evidence in the record exists that (Karch’s) presence outside of the surgery suite in a nearby room caused any adverse outcome, it is equally true this rule is critical for providing a high level of safety for patients.”
In its decision and order, the board also noted that Karch had “presented significant evidence about himself, including [redacted from public view] that caused him to be bullied as a child and his efforts to overcome this.”
The board noted that its disciplinary action has no impact on Karch’s general dentist license, as his alleged conduct relates only to his actions as the holder of a sedation permit.
In its decision against Karch, the board stated that a third dentist, publicly identified only by the initials “M.K.,” was present for Daniels’ surgery and assisted with patient care despite not having an Iowa license. The involvement of this third dentist would later become an issue for Wolf.
In September 2024, the Iowa Dental Board notified Wolf that it intended to deny his application for a permit to administer  moderate sedation on patients. At the time, the board alleged that Wolf had participated in the operation that resulted in Daniels’ death and that he had “facilitated the practice of an unlicensed dentist and supervised the administration of anesthesia without having the proper credentials.”
The board document detailing that allegation was made public in error, according to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, and it has since been pulled from the board’s website. The Iowa Dental Board has not charged Wolf with any wrongdoing in the Daniels case.
The civil lawsuit filed by the Daniels family is scheduled to be tried on Sept. 28, 2026.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DENTAL-.jpg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

McWhorter, 63, of Awendaw, admitted he took a cash kickback to steer a construction contract to a local businessman for a $35.5 million, rail-served plastic pellets warehouse adjacent to port-owned property.
While the scheme occurred while he was president of the state railroad, the case didn’t come to light until after he retired.
“It was a horrible decision I made, one that I will regret for the rest of my life,” McWhorter tearfully told the court. “This act does not reflect the person I’ve tried so hard to be all my life.”
The U.S. Attorney’s office had sought a prison sentence of between eight and 14 months, saying McWhorter “abused his position of trust” as a public official.
“His conduct was serious, the fraud offense is a serious offense, and a period of incarceration is appropriate,” Bryan Stirling, U.S. Attorney for South Carolina, said in a court document.
However, McWhorter’s friends, family members and business associates said the kickback scheme was out of character for the former police officer turned railroad executive, and they asked the judge in testimony and letters of support for leniency.
In the end, Norton opted for a sentence of supervision rather than incarceration.
“This was a very serious offense,” Norton said. “It’s stealing for the lack of anything else. What he did was a betrayal of everything he stood for his whole life.”
In addition to probation, McWhorter must pay $90,000 in restitution, a $4,000 fine and perform 300 hours of community service. McWhorter has already put the $90,000 in an escrow account for repayment.
Hatching a kickback
Recent court documents and testimony have shed new light on how the kickback scheme took place, outlining who else was involved, how they arranged the fraud and the name of the victimized business. Previously, court documents did not identify the co-conspirators.
Texas-based Frontier Logistics in 2018 was looking for a place near Charleston’s port to build a warehouse where plastic pellets — also known as nurdles — could be transferred from rail cars to cargo containers for export to foreign markets.
Charleston’s port is the East Coast’s busiest export hub for plastic pellets and chemicals, and Frontier has played a key role in the growth of those exports at the Port of Charleston.
Kevin Newkirk, a vice president at Frontier, had discussed the warehouse project with McWhorter because the facility would need railroad access. McWhorter then introduced Newkirk to Tony Berenyi, the founder of Charleston contractor Berenyi Inc., who wanted to build the warehouse.
The three men discussed how the construction contract could be steered to Berenyi.
“At one point, Berenyi offered Newkirk and Jeff a commission on the contract,” court records state. “However, Newkirk decided that a kickback payment was more appropriate and approached Jeff about it.”
Newkirk and McWhorter initially considered asking for a $2 million kickback but later settled on $1 million. Berenyi ultimately agreed to pay the men $420,000, with the money coming from his business profits. McWhorter’s lawyers — Bart Daniel and co-counsel Nathan Williams — stressed no taxpayer money was involved.
Frontier was not aware of the kickback scheme but eventually chose Berenyi to build the warehouse on land it bought from Palmetto Railways.
Berenyi is incarcerated in a federal prison in Florida after a jury found him guilty in 2023 of a similar but unrelated kickback scheme for construction at a Nucor Steel plant in Kentucky. He is scheduled to be released later this year.
Things start to unravel
Newkirk and McWhorter were supposed to split the $420,000 but Berenyi never finished making all of the payments. All told, Newkirk received about $84,000 in addition to the money that went to McWhorter.
Investigators learned of the kickback scheme while investigating Berenyi’s actions in the Kentucky case. That eventually led to charges against Newkirk and McWhorter.
Newkirk was sentenced in April to five years of probation for filing a false federal tax return related to the scheme.
“Unfortunately, this discussion of payment came at a point in Jeff’s life where he was struggling, and that struggle, combined with the opportunity presented to him, was more than he could resist,” McWhorter’s lawyers said in a court document.
“At the time, Jeff was going through a difficult divorce with high attorney’s fees, needed to pay for a daughter’s wedding, and was in the process of having to find a new place to live,” they wrote.
McWhorter, a state employee, was being paid $200,000 a year to lead Palmetto Railways at the time the scheme took place. He also received bonuses in 2020 totaling $133,000.
In 23 letters of support submitted to the court, supporters said McWhorter’s conduct was the opposite of the integrity he had shown throughout his career.
“Jeff’s guilty plea stunned his colleagues throughout South Carolina,” wrote Ron Brinson, a former North Charleston councilman. He added McWhorter’s actions are “so uncharacteristic and inconsistent” with his reputation.
Bobby Hitt, the state’s former Commerce Secretary, wrote that he had “developed a trust relationship” with McWhorter and others at Palmetto Railways, “both professionally and personally.”
He added McWhorter played a role in some of the state’s biggest economic development announcements.
The felony McWhorter pleaded guilty to is called honest services fraud — a type of white-collar crime in which a company or individual offers something of value to another person, usually a public official, in exchange for special or preferred treatment.
McWhorter retired from Palmetto Railways in 2022 after 37 years with the railroad — a so-called short line railroad that connects Port of Charleston customers and other businesses to bigger, long-haul services.
Following his retirement, McWhorter started a consulting business that includes Frontier among its clients.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/court-money-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

In March, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced plans to relocate six of the agency’s regional offices based in cities “that do not comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” The SBA’s Region 10 Office, based in Seattle, covers four states: Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska.

Our state has enacted a statewide ban on sanctuary cities, and the Idaho Congressional Delegation has repeatedly worked to prevent illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities from abusing federal funding.”
The SBA is a federal government agency that helps small businesses get loans.
“By relocating the regional office to Idaho, the SBA would ensure its services align with President Trump’s priorities, directly benefitting law-abiding business owners,” the Idaho congressmen continued.
The SBA has district offices across the U.S. Idaho’s counties are split between being managed by the Boise District and the Seattle District.

Celeste Maloy tries to reason with an unruly crowd during a town hall event at the University of Utah on Thursday, March 20, 2025. (Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy’s proposal to sell off nearly 11,500 acres of public land in southwestern Utah was shot down this week after receiving bipartisan pushback in Congress.
The proposal, which identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George, was included by Maloy as part of Congress’ budget package. 
But on Wednesday evening, Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross, rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip Maloy’s proposal from the budget bill during a House Rules Committee meeting.
Maloy’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning.
Officials eye airport expansion, reservoirs and new roads under Maloy’s proposed public land sale

Maloy, in an earlier statement, said the land would help the southwest corner of the state expand water, transportation and housing infrastructure, as the region deals with rapid population growth. St. George was eying an airport expansion; the Washington County Water Conservancy District had plans to build a new reservoir; Washington County was looking to widen some existing roads. 
Maloy’s amendment identified a total of 70 parcels to be sold in Utah. The proposal had a far greater impact on Nevada, with Republican Rep. Mark Amodei earmarking nearly 450,000 acres for disposal in his state. 
The proposal received broad criticism from environmental groups and public land advocates, who said the bill lacked language mandating what the land would be used for. They argued there was nothing stopping the governments from purchasing the land, then using it for something other than the originally stated purpose. And some of the land abutted rivers and popular recreation areas, including Zion National Park, prompting concerns over access and environmental harm. 
The proposal also had its critics in Congress, on both sides of the isle, including Zinke, who called it his “San Juan Hill,” referring to a famous Spanish-American War battle. 
“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a news release on Wednesday.

Environmental groups celebrated the decision, issuing a flurry of statements and reactions. 
Travis Hammill, the Washington D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said Maloy is the “latest in a long list of politicians with the bad idea to try and sell off public lands.” 
“The through line of those failed efforts is this: love of public lands transcends geography and political party. Americans don’t want to see these lands sold off and time and time again have risen up to make their voices heard,” Hammill said. 
Kyle Roerink executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, said Zinke’s move to tank the disposal “sends a strong message to lawmakers of all stripes: We can never break the public trust and the Colorado River for billionaire tax breaks.” 
Others noted the bipartisan opposition to the amendment, including Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who called the attempt “appalling” and “Gilded Age-level stuff.” 
“Republicans’ public lands fire sale was so greedy even their own caucus wouldn’t support it,” Donnelly said in an emailed statement. “I hope people remember it the next time Republicans try to pretend they care about public lands.”
According to the amendment’s text, about 70 parcels were identified to be sold off to four entities, at market value. Consider:

Washington County would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels covering about 6,492 acres. 
The Washington County Water Conservancy District would have been allowed to purchase 22 parcels amounting to about 4,375 acres.
St. George would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels amounting to about 520 acres.
Beaver County would have been allowed to purchase three parcels amounting to roughly 62 acres.

The amendment was a small part of what President Donald Trump has called the “big, beautiful bill” that has been in the works for months. The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax law, cuts steps out of the energy permitting process, increases defense and border security spending, and makes substantial changes to Medicaid. 
The bill cleared the House early Thursday and is headed to the Senate.

May 21, 2025 | Submitted photoWith funding cuts being pursued by the Trump administration, which is looking to cut what it determines is unnecessary spending in the federal budget, the Michigan Community Action, or MCA, implored lawmakers during its annual Legislative Day to invest in local solutions.
Advocates from Community Action Agencies affiliated with the MCA association, implored state lawmakers in the Michigan State Capitol Wednesday to invest in Community Services Block Grants, or CSBG’s, which allow Community Action Agencies as non-profits to facilitate poverty solution programming, a news release from MCA said.
Michigan receives on average about $23 million a year in CSBG federal funding, the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services reports.
MCA would like to see a 50% state match to the federally funded CSGBs which helps fund programming to fight against poverty through nutritional and health care-related programs, housing solutions and emergency assistance programs. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Many nonprofits in Michigan were sent into a panic in January after a memo from the United States Office of Management and Budget instructed that there would be widespread freezes on federal funding to ensure spending aligns with the will of President Donald Trump’s administration.
“In a time when the future of federal funding for critical community action programs is uncertain, our work on the ground is more important than ever,” Executive Director of MCA Brian McGrain said in the news release Wednesday. “Today, we elevated the voices of those who are too often left out of national debates. Our agencies continue to deliver results, and our Legislative Day is a chance to ensure policy makers see both the needs and the solutions we have right here in Michigan.”
In Michigan, CSBG’s allow nonprofit groups to respond to the needs of their community with speed and flexibility, the MCA asserted, and further investment in the program would unlock new resources in decreasing poverty and increasing self-sufficiency in the state.
However, in a letter sent in early May to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, from Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, the Trump administration said it is not confident CSBG funds are being used appropriately.
The letter says programming using CSBG funds in California have focused on diversity equity and inclusion efforts as well as green energy initiatives, while programming in Wisconsin used funds to “combine clean energy with affordable housing in the pursuit of both economic and environmental justice”.
“Americans in need of job-training and a helping hand would be better served by programs funded at the Departments of Labor and Agriculture,” the recommendation for cutting the $770 million program in the letter said. “The Budget proposes to eliminate dollars that flow to Community Action Agencies who carry out their own agendas.”



Wednesday’s Legislative Day also honored clients, volunteers, and state lawmakers who stepped up to advocate both for MCA and Community Action Agency operations:

Jim Pillen sits in his office in the Nebraska State Capitol. April 29, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen line-item vetoed $14.5 million in general fund appropriations from Nebraska’s legislatively approved budget for the next two years late Wednesday, 83% of which was earmarked for the Nebraska Supreme Court.
In his veto letter returning Legislative Bill 261, the general spending budget bill, and LB 264, a bill allocating various state cash funds, Pillen thanked lawmakers for closing a major projected budget deficit for the next two years while making investments in education, developmental disability support and national security.
He returned four items he said are “necessary to honor our commitment to fiscal restraint,” and that the small number of objections reflects “the depth of fiscal conservatism” in the budget.
“It is critical that we continue to treat nickels like manhole covers, and I urge you to sustain four additional reductions to improve our fiscal position,” Pillen wrote.

If the vetoes are sustained, the Legislature would still finish the budget with a positive balance of $1.1 million, because Pillen’s approach would reduce spending instead of using as much money from the “rainy day” cash reserve fund. His approach reduces by about $14.5 million a transfer from the cash reserves. The lawmaker-approved state budget calls for transferring $147 million from cash reserves to help close a half-billion-dollar projected budget deficit.
The final balance includes $1.55 million in anticipated spending to raise judges’ salaries by 1.5% in each of the next two years, via LB 513. Pillen’s office has said those salaries are already competitive nationally. His staff has declined to say whether he would veto the raises if passed.
Specific vetoes
Three of Pillen’s four line-item vetoes are to the state’s general fund, Nebraska’s main pocketbook that will cover a total of $11 billion in spending through June 2027:

$11.99 million reduction of an increase to the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
$2 million cut from public health departments, zeroing out COVID-19 pandemic-era increases because the “pandemic is over” and “spending must be shrunk to pre-pandemic size.”
$511,972 from the State Fire Marshal for salary and health insurance premium increases because he argues the agency has “sufficient funding” already.

The fourth veto aims to prevent an $18 million diversion of cash funds for Lake McConaughy recreational upgrades. Pillen said the project scope has changed over many years, and further discussion is needed about how local casino revenue could support road improvements.
‘Every branch must contribute’
For the Judicial Branch, Pillen seeks to have the Legislature limit spending growth to 0.625% in fiscal year 2025-26 (a $4.16 million smaller bump) and 1.25% growth in fiscal year 2026-27 (a $7.83 million smaller bump). Pillen said those percentage increases are the same as were afforded to the University of Nebraska.
Pillen said the Legislature approved bumps of 2.7% in the first fiscal year and 4.8% in the second year. He said court spending had grown by 36% over the past five years and blamed Supreme Court administrative leadership for not taking “necessary steps” to reduce spending.
In his original budget proposal, Pillen sought to keep the Supreme Court flat at $232.82 million. He proposed cutting the university’s budget by 2%, down to $676.99 million in general funds.
“Every branch of government must contribute to balancing our state budget,” Pillen said.
In contrast, Pillen said the budget included no growth for the Governor’s Office budget, as Pillen requested, and less than 1% spending growth for the Legislature. 
In a last-ditch effort last week, State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue successfully preserved $3 million of a then-$5 million proposed cut to the Supreme Court, which court officials said could jeopardize certain problem-solving courts or other court services. Holdcroft said he was disappointed in the larger cut.

Problem-solving courts are intensive court programs bringing individuals and families together with one-on-one interactions with judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys, law enforcement, court officials and more, often to help Nebraskans receive intervention or avoid imprisonment.
This includes Adult Drug and DUI Courts, Veterans Treatment Courts, Reentry Courts, Juvenile Drug Courts, Young Adult Courts, Mental Health Courts and Family Treatment Courts.
Cuts would end ‘vital’ court services
Corey Steel, state court administrator for Nebraska, said in a memo to lawmakers Thursday that the funding reduction would lead to the elimination of:

A DUI Problem-Solving Court in Lancaster County.
A Mental Health Problem-Solving Court in Sarpy County.
A Veterans Treatment Court in Sarpy County.
A Drug Court in Platte County.
All transition living reimbursements for adults on probation, post-release supervision or for those leaving problem-solving courts.
Non-statutory services for juveniles on probation and a reduction in the reimbursement of many vital placements.

Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, whom Pillen elevated to the top role last fall, also pleaded with the Legislature to increase the court’s budget. He listed a litany of items in his first State of the Judiciary address in January, in part because while the Legislature had increased the number of services the courts provide but had not always directed new funds specifically for those services.
Funke said existing dollars would soon run out, telling lawmakers that court officials “have done what you have asked.”
“It is essential that the Judicial Branch receive adequate funding for the next biennium to sustain the progress we have made,” Funke said.
Those funds would be “exhausted” at the end of the next biennium, Steel confirmed, and impact the sustainability of services such as judicial and guardian or conservator training.
Steel attributed spending increases largely to legislative action responding to more Nebraskans in the judicial system, particularly high-need, high-risk individuals who require supervision. He said employees in all branches of government also received funding for salary increases.

Steel said the Judicial Branch has also returned more than $30 million in unspent funds over the last six years, while, unlike other agencies, the court can’t increase fees to offset any reductions.
“I urge the Legislature to override the governor’s veto and again ensure these vital services, that save state and counties dollars by reducing incarceration, increasing community safety and rebuilding the lives of individuals and families,” Steel wrote.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a defense attorney, said the 2025 session has seen a “systematic wind back” of funding for essential services and those to make Nebraska better. He said cutting Supreme Court funding would hurt veterans, those struggling with mental health and other public safety initiatives.
“If you actually want to make Nebraska safer, you’d be funding those programs,” Dungan said.
Property tax relief ‘failure’
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, a former longtime firefighter, said he was concerned that the veto of the Fire Marshal could possibly impact training for volunteer firefighters or in maintaining current services, which go toward keeping Nebraskans safe.
Pillen also used his veto letter to voice disappointment in the failure of LB 170 on Monday to provide additional property tax relief and mirror the success in 2024 of decreasing property taxes statewide, the first time in 26 years. It was an exception to two earlier years of nearly $300 million increases in property taxes that came largely because the state increased spending to take on the portion of property taxes that would have been paid to community colleges.
  State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Multiple senators said the vetoes appeared targeted at specific lawmakers, such as freshman State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, who represents Ogallala and Lake McConaughy. Strommen was one of seven Republicans who opposed the latest property tax proposal.
“The Legislature’s failure this session means Nebraskans will not enjoy a repeat of this success,” Pillen said.
Strommen said he was surprised and a little confused at the veto of Lake McConaughy funding. He said he would continue fighting for his western Nebraska constituents and hopes to override the veto.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, the Appropriations Committee chair, had no immediate comment on the vetoes.
Pillen’s letter did not acknowledge that LB 170 largely mirrored the same doomed special session approach from last fall on property tax relief — a session called at Pillen’s request. 
The Pillen proposal in that session, too, tried to raise sales taxes and shift or use the revenue to offset property taxes. Pillen is 0-3 for such proposals. He pledged to hold property taxes flat this year and has said that without “a shadow of a doubt,” he and allies would find additional property tax relief this year.
The budget the Legislature passed will direct $57 million for more property tax credits and about $11 million for homestead exemption increases. There is no similar takeover of a taxing authority like the community colleges.
Sales tax, tobacco tax push doom Nebraska’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ for property tax relief

Some opponents of Pillen’s cuts to public health departments said they would impact new and essential services and that local communities might choose to fill the hole using property taxes. State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said it was particularly damaging as measles continues to spread.
Pillen said that as “stewards of the public’s resources,” lawmakers must prioritize needs over wants and be “conservative in good times as well as during fiscally challenging times.”
“Reducing spending is hard work, but Nebraskans expect us to exercise common sense and discretion in achieving a balanced, fair and operative budget,” Pillen wrote. “Together we can reduce government growth, invest in our kids, provide tax relief to hardworking Nebraskans and remain true to our conservative values to make sure our state is the greatest state in the union to live, work and raise a family.”
Appropriations Committee overrides
The Appropriations Committee on Thursday afternoon will get first crack at which of the vetoes, if any, to try and override. Doing so would require at least 30 votes.
Dungan said he would “anticipate absolutely” an override attempt for the courts.
“I don’t know who’s going to file it,” Dungan said, “but yes, we’ll have it.”

(Photos by Parker Michels-Boyce and Mechelle Hankerson for the Virginia Mercury)Former congresswoman and Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger fared better with voters than current lieutenant governor and Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, according to a Roanoke College poll released Thursday showing Spanberger leading Earle-Sears 43%-26%. This follows another poll published this week showing Spanberger with a 4-point lead over Earle-Sears.
The Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College interviewed 658 Virginia residents between May 12 and May 19 to determine that Spanberger leads Earle-Sears by 17 percentage points. Meanwhile, another new poll commissioned by business organization Virginia FREE conducted between May 9 and May 13 shows independent voters favoring Spanberger by 53%-47%. That poll included 1,000 participants. 
While the sample sizes of the polls is much smaller than the number of people who are likely to participate in November’s statewide election, polls conducted sporadically leading up to elections can point to partisan tides. 
The Roanoke College poll also explored key issues that could affect both campaigns such as the national deficit and debt, political anxiety and the job approval of the current president and governor. 
More than half of polled voters, 51%, think “ things in Virginia have gotten off on the wrong track,” while 66% held the same sentiment about the country as a whole. Voters also had mixed feelings about leadership in the state and country, with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s job approval rating coming in at 46%, which Roanoke College noted as “his lowest and down seven points since November.” President Donald Trump’s job approval rating, 31%, was low but not his lowest.  
Participants also weighed in with their approval and disapproval of Youngkin’s successor. Spanberger rated 41% favorable/40% unfavorable, similar to how polled voters rated her last November, while Earle-Sears’ favorability dropped from her previous rating and stands at 32% favorable/48% unfavorable. About one-fifth of respondents did not offer opinions on either candidates’ favorability.
The voter anxiety index from the Roanoke poll is 89.41, and reflects big shifts in how Virginians in both parties perceive the current state of government. Democratic voters’ anxiety skyrocketed from -10.39 in May 2024 to 101.77 last November, with a current anxiety index of 153.35. Meanwhile, Republican voters’ anxiety index decreased last year, from 166.59 in May to 13.52 in November 2024, and now stands at -30.10. These figures reflect that political anxiety correlates closely with partisan control of the White House and Congress. 
With Virginia’s gubernatorial election falling the year after a presidential election, the past two decades have shown that voters typically elect a governor who is the opposite party of the one who won the White House the year prior. 
On national debt perceptions, a large majority of Virginians, 42%, are very concerned, while 40% said they are somewhat concerned. When it comes to the cause of the national deficit, a majority, 61%, thinks  it is a result of spending too much, while 34% think it’s from not raising enough money through taxes. 
When asked how to address the deficit, 74% of respondents favor raising taxes for people earning more than $400,000 annually, while 82% oppose across-the-board tax raises for everyone. Seventy-one percent of respondents oppose wholesale spending cuts. 
“Six months in a gubernatorial election season is an eternity in politics, but one would prefer to be ahead by 17 points,” said Dr. Harry Wilson, interim director for IPOR and professor emeritus of political science at Roanoke College. 
He added that more than a quarter of Virginians are still undecided voters — which could be good news for both candidates. 
“Spanberger is obviously leading at this point, and she leads among independents, but a large number of Republicans are undecided, and they will most likely end up voting for Earle-Sears,” Wilson said. “The favorable rating for Earle-Sears, however, should be cause for concern.”

As President Trump seeks to fast-track uranium mines in the Southwest, experts said a robust state review processwill stand in the way. (Photo by Jack Delano via Library of Congress website)Recent federal activity suggests the Trump administration has two long-stalled uranium mines near New Mexico’s Mount Taylor on its radar.
Earlier this month, a federal infrastructure agency included Roca Honda and La Jara Mesa uranium mines on a new list of 20 projects nationally that advance “the President’s directive to take immediate action to facilitate domestic production of America’s vast mineral resources,” according to a statement from the council.
Then last week, the U.S. Interior Department announced that a proposed uranium mine in Utah would be subject to only a 14-day federal review period, shortening what is commonly a years-long process. 
Source New Mexico spoke with state officials, outside experts and longtime anti-uranium advocates about what defense New Mexico will have against the federal government’s efforts to restart uranium mining here for the first time in 50 years. While experts said hard-fought cultural protections are unlikely to present much of an obstacle, they expressed confidence that state regulations will hold up against federal encroachment.
“I think that the realities weigh against the administration’s ignorant and uninformed policies that suggest to the public that these kinds of projects will happen overnight,” said Christopher Shuey, a public health researcher closely monitoring uranium developments here. “They won’t.”
Holding the line
Private companies have sought to develop the La Jara Mesa and Roca Honda mines for more than a decade, though interest heated up with Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production. Soon after, Cibola National Forest leaders named both mines priority projects, and then uranium company Energy Fuels then struck a controversial deal with the Navajo Nation that would allow it to transport ore from Roca Honda across the reservation. Meanwhile, Laramide Resources indicated on its state permitting application a desire to expedite the next step of its La Jara Mesa project.
DJ Ennis, program manager for the state’s Mining Act Reclamation Program, confirmed to Source NM there’s been a “renewed interest” from uranium mining companies seeking to break ground in New Mexico. 
But even if the federal government tries to fast-track mining here, Ennis said the state will take its time and fully review both mine proposals, which it is empowered to do under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act, and in lieu of a federal law.
Trump administration expedites permitting for Utah uranium mine to a two-week process

“The feds are going to do what the feds are going to do,” Ennis told Source. “It does affect us, in that it would be good if the state and the feds were on the same pace and page of permitting. But if that is not the case, the default then becomes the state’s permitting process, and we have a robust permitting process.”
At the federal level, new uranium mines are subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, which Trump’s recent orders have accelerated. But that has no bearing on the state’s ongoing review, Ennis said.
If it came down to it, Ennis said, the state could issue daily fines and potentially even deploy state police officers to stop uranium extraction at the Roca Honda or La Jara Mesa sites if the companies did so without a state permit. 
So if Trump were to order a truncated federal review of the La Jara Mesa mine like he did the Velvet-Wood mine in Utah last week, and then the Forest Service issued a rushed environmental impact statement that selected its preferred alternative of extracting uranium, and then company proceeded to break ground, the state would step in and stop it, Ennis said. 
“I’m not sure what that looks like, if it involves state police to enforce the order or courts,” Ennis said. “But it is a state law that we are enforcing.”
Eric Jantz, attorney with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, said the state’s permit review should offer the public some reassurance that nothing will happen immediately. He also suggested that his organization would consider suing if the federal government sought to fast-track New Mexico uranium mines. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

“I suspect that if the Forest Service either ignores its obligations under NEPA because of this executive order or its own regulations, that litigation will probably ensue,” he said.
That’s because, Jantz said, he sees little basis for an “energy emergency” that Trump claims is the reason to fast-track the mines. 
“If there’s one thing to impart, it’s that this whole notion of premising expedited environmental reviews on some sort of emergency is preposterous,” he said. “No emergency exists, and there’s no reason why the usual environmental reviews can’t continue.”
What will TCP designation mean?
While experts and observers expressed confidence in the state’s capacity to hold off a federal push to expedite mining, they said it remains unclear whether efforts by local Indigenous tribes and pueblos to protect Mount Taylor as a cultural and religious site will add another layer of protection. 
In 2007, as several mining companies moved forward with plans to extract uranium from the Mount Taylor area, five tribes made the unusual step of sharing stories about their ancestral and spiritual connections to the mountain. 
That rare disclosure of tribal creation myths marked an early milestone in a multi-year battle to create a 400,000-acre Traditional Cultural Property, drawing a line around Mount Taylor recognized by the state of New Mexico. Among other things, the designation aimed to give Indigenous people a voice in opposing uranium or other mining interests. After mining companies sued in 2009, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the designation should stay intact.
Since then, the  pueblos have maintained opposition, with the All Pueblo Council of Governors in December issuing a resolution to state regulators that “Mount Taylor, known by various traditional names is a sacred landscape, central to the cultural identity, traditional practices, and religious activities of numerous Pueblos and other tribal nations.”
Even though the Navajo Nation agreed to let uranium eventually be transported from Roca Honda across the reservation, it has also long opposed any new mines in the Mount Taylor area, Stephen Etsitty, the Navajo Environmental Protection Agency director, said recently.
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Designation of Mount Taylor as a traditional cultural property has yet to emerge as an issue in the state permitting process, Ennis said. The designation requires federal and state parties to consult with tribes, but a collision awaits between private mining interests and cultural protections, Ennis said. 
“The intersection of those two is a difficult question to answer,” he said. “I don’t know that we’ll know until we get to the end of the process.”
Shuey, who has advocated against the mines since 2009 as a researcher with the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the recent federal fast-tracking prompted him and colleagues to review what the TCP designation actually meant for protecting Mount Taylor. 
“We’ve been asking this question for the last several weeks,” he said. “My understanding is that the impact of the TCP would be more of a, ‘Pay attention to this site from the standpoint of cultural resources, and make provisions to mitigate any types of impact to cultural resources’ type of thing.”
Even without an outright ban on mining or around the TCP, Shuey said, he expects greenlighting the mines to take years, during which time opponents will watchdog the process. 
“A lot of these folks have lived through the 80 years of the uranium legacy. They’ve learned across generations of the impacts of mining,” he said. “And so I think there’s a lot of not only institutional memory but institutional knowhow of evaluating mining proposals and offering intelligent and compelling comments and testimonies.”
He likes their odds against a Trump administration that seems to “not be particularly interested in understanding or knowing the impacts of mining,” he said, but instead has a “weird, visceral notion that we just need more of these minerals for a variety of purposes, and we’re going to go get them.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-mexico-rez-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

LOUIS — Kevin Hines has been living in a house without a roof in the days since a tornado devastated his community. He has seen some of his neighbors sleeping in their cars. A different man has spent untold hours on a bench.
In the aftermath of the May 16 tornado, Hines, 60, has a blue tarp covering his home. Still, rain came in three days later — an expected problem in a house without a roof. But he didn’t think wildlife would be an issue. Then a bird landed on his television. He spotted a squirrel on the sofa.
He already has enough to handle. He’s not sure when his home will be repaired. A toppled tree destroyed the purple Jeep he bought only months ago. His job told employees not to come into work because the building was damaged.
The tornado cut a 23-mile-long path, touching down in the affluent suburb of Clayton before ripping through the north side of the city of St. Louis then across the Mississippi River through communities in western Illinois. At least five people were killed, 38 more were injured, and about 5,000 structures were damaged, according to St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer. The twister caused more than $1.6 billion in estimated property damage.
While the impact was felt throughout the area, it will take some neighborhoods longer than others to recover. Kayla Reed, a community activist who runs the Action St. Louis nonprofit, which is coordinating help for storm victims, said residents in the predominantly Black area known as North City especially face a long set of challenges in the days ahead.
“A natural disaster met a created one and a systemic one,” Reed said. “They’ve sort of been in a long-term storm all of their lives. If you live in this footprint, you know this is where infant mortality is highest. This is where incarceration rates are highest. This is where poverty rates are highest.”
Food and water aid provide some relief, Reed said, but the community needs more than that. “I can’t put into words how long it’s going to take to stabilize some of these families and how much trauma they are navigating,” she said.
A possible source of major aid is the federal government, which can unlock resources at the president’s discretion. But Missouri is already waiting for President Donald Trump to approve federal assistance for damage left by three sets of storms in March and April that killed 19 people in the state. Trump has denied major disaster requests from West Virginia and Washington this year, and initially denied one for storm and tornado damage in Arkansas before reversing course and approving the request May 13.
Black families here in North St. Louis are worried that their community will not be prioritized.

On May 19, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, requested that Trump issue a federal emergency declaration, which would authorize about $5 million in federal assistance for cleanup efforts. Kehoe also requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency conduct a preliminary damage assessment, a necessary step to securing a “major disaster declaration,” which would provide federal resources for homeowners and renters, reimburse local government efforts, and pay for damaged public infrastructure.
FEMA was on the ground two days later helping conduct damage assessments. But a disaster declaration could take weeks, if it comes.
“Bringing FEMA in, it’s my understanding, is not going to be a quick process,” the mayor said at a May 21 press conference. “All elected officials at every level here are doing everything they can to make that process as quick as possible.”
That includes Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who asked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during an oversight hearing May 20 to help expedite the pending aid requests from Missouri’s three previous storms and for the recent tornado. “Yes, absolutely,” she responded.
 
While the city waits, thousands of volunteers have shown up to the parking lot of the YMCA’s O’Fallon Park Rec Complex in North St. Louis in what they are calling the “People’s Response” to help residents in need. So far, they’ve helped more than 5,000 families. Volunteers have collected more than 17,280 pounds of food, according to Action St. Louis.
The last time such an outpouring occurred around here, according to locals, was in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson. Rasheen Aldridge, an alderman who represents part of the storm-affected area, said some of the same activists who showed up then made it a point to help now.
Hines, too, looked for ways to help his neighbors. He became an unofficial traffic director at the YMCA as thousands of cars streamed into the area to get help — or provide it.
“It’s not about me,” Hines said. “I’m staying until no one is here because there’s nothing to do at my house. I have no power.”
Residents in North City described the moments after the storm as chaos: trees down everywhere; power lines damaged; limited cellphone service, making it hard to connect with loved ones. Then the sun went down, cloaking corners of the city in complete darkness.
Five days after the tornado, people still needed candles, flashlights, and batteries to make it through the night. Piles of debris filled street corners. Exterior walls were ripped off homes, exposing the inside of closets, bedrooms, and living rooms to passersby on the street. Some buildings were leveled. The downed trees in the tornado’s path left a scar in the city’s canopy visible from miles away.
The tornado flipped a semitrailer outside a new gas station and strip mall that had been scheduled to open this fall. One evening, Charles Stanford, a security guard for the property, sat in the parking lot to make sure no one tried to enter what remained of the building. Stanford said the project had been nearly complete. Now, it is surrounded by rubble and debris.
A giant tree crashed into the house of one of Hines’ neighbors. He said the woman recently had heart surgery and had been recovering at home. But then she went back to the hospital, and he thinks stress after the tornado may be why. Hines was planning to bring her a few Hershey’s Kisses, her favorite candy, to lift her spirits.
Shannette BoClair, 52, said she found her infirm father, Albert Noble, on the floor in the fetal position after the tornado passed her parents’ home. A window had imploded and strong winds knocked him down. BoClair called 911 but, she said, first responders were overwhelmed by calls for help and tree-blocked streets. Her father needed medical attention right away, she said, so his family helped him hobble a mile to his grandson, who drove him to a triage station that had been set up for tornado victims.
They learned he had broken his hip, she said. He had surgery within days.
  Thousands of volunteers have shown up there in what they are calling the “People’s Response” to help residents in need (Cara Anthony/KFF News).
BoClair, who works as a health and wellness director at the YMCA, said she’s helping care for her mother, who remained at home after the storm. BoClair is depending on meals provided by volunteers and staffers at the YMCA but said she had also spent about $500 on DoorDash meals to feed her family since the tornado hit.
As far as federal aid goes, BoClair said she hopes it comes soon. The community needs dumpsters for the debris, reconstruction, and more.
But the outpouring of support from volunteers amazed her. The People’s Response drew so many volunteers that lines of cars snaked outside of the YMCA parking lot in North City. The smell of barbecue wafted through the air as residents without electricity grilled food for one another before it spoiled.
“I’m so proud of our community,” BoClair said. “They say we don’t care. We do care.”
Reed said volunteers would be stationed in the YMCA’s parking lot for a few more days. But, she said, that doesn’t mean the job ends there. The community will need more help to rebuild.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)The House unanimously approved $464 million in new relief for western North Carolina on Thursday, swiftly sending a package that includes money for small business grants to the Senate.
The aid bill sets out $60 million for a long-requested grant program, allowing western businesses already saddled with loans to build back from damages. And it sends $50 million to local governments to help rebuild infrastructure.
It comes in at about half of the level Gov. Josh Stein requested earlier this week, but earned broad bipartisan support as lawmakers push for investment in a disaster region that has seen a slow trickle of federal aid.
“We didn’t stop with looking at what needed to be funded, what might not have been funded before,” said Rep. Karl Gillespie (R-Macon). “We took a deep dive into what had been funded, and was it on the mark? Was that money doing the job we intended for it to do?”
Much of the money in the House package comes from NCInnovation, a private research nonprofit that Republicans have sought to claw back money from. And $65 million is clawed back from other programs deemed unsuccessful or unsatisfactory, redirected elsewhere for recovery.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle praised the bill during floor debate Thursday.
“Our people in certain places are still really hurting,” said Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe). “This bill’s going to really help.”
The business grants, Ager said, would “keep businesses rolling and really help our economy not fall off a cliff.”
Republicans have previously been hesitant to approve grants for businesses, wary of fraud and large companies taking advantage. They have instead opted for loans — a more fiscally conservative option, but one that many businesses have said they cannot afford to take on.
Budget writers’ solution was to require businesses to document revenue loss in order to receive a grant.
“I think if we have some standard that we can measure those things, our folks are much more comfortable with it,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) said Wednesday evening. “We’re not the federal government, we can’t print money like they did for [the Paycheck Protection Program].”



Although the money for local governments to repair infrastructure was necessary, one Democrat said, those municipalities need further aid. Many governments are facing budget shortfalls due to lost tourism revenue in the fall busy season.
“I hope that as we move forward, we can provide more flexible funds,” said Rep. Lindsey Prather (D-Buncombe).
Also included in the bill is $70 million to continue earning federal reimbursement, $30 million for private road and bridge repairs, $30 million for debris removal, and $25 million to repair destroyed schools.
The regional airport infrastructure is also set to see improvements from a bundle of $25 million. Western North Carolina’s mountainous terrain meant that almost all aid in the weeks after the storm came by air.
If the House package is approved by the Senate and signed into law, it would bring the legislature’s total spending on Helene recovery to more than $1.8 billion.
But the bill’s immediate future is uncertain. The Senate has proposed allocating money for Helene within its budget proposal; the House has approached relief as a separate bill.
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said his caucus was “open to negotiating” on Helene relief.
“We’ve not had those conversations,” Berger told reporters Thursday. “It’s clear that the House has taken a different approach on that. We’ll see if we can come to an agreement.”
“That may argue for us to actually include it in the budget,” he added, of concerns that prolonged negotiations could delay storm relief. “Because I think everybody wants that to go forward.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

The tied vote allows the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling against the school to stand. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY — A deadlocked U.S. Supreme Court has upheld an Oklahoma ruling that struck down the nation’s first religious charter school.
The Court announced Thursday it voted 4-4 with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. It did not disclose how each justice voted, nor did it issue written opinions.
The tied vote affirmed last year’s Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that the concept of a publicly funded Catholic charter school is unconstitutional.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to offer a government-funded online education to students in all parts of the state. St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and operated according to church teachings.
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board voted in 2023 to approve opening the school. Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, calling the school unconstitutional and a threat to religious liberty.
Both the school and the statewide board appealed the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up the case and heard oral arguments April 30.

Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the statewide board contend charter schools are not truly public schools but rather private entities contracting with the state, who therefore should be free to adopt a religion. Excluding faith-based groups from charter school funding is religious discrimination, they said.
In light of the Court’s decision, St. Isidore’s Board of Directors said it will continue exploring other options to deliver a virtual Catholic education for all in Oklahoma.
“Families across the state of Oklahoma deserve the educational opportunities presented by St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School,” the board stated. “We are disappointed that the Oklahoma State Supreme Court’s decision was upheld in a 4-4 decision without explanation.”
During oral arguments in Washington, D.C., the Court appeared to be divided on the case. Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson made their doubts clear on St. Isidore while some of the conservative majority, particularly Justice Brett Kavanaugh, signaled support.
Drummond has long contended the Catholic charter school would create a “slippery slope” toward taxpayers having to fund schools of any religious faith, including belief systems Oklahomans might find objectionable.

“The Supreme Court’s decision represents a resounding victory for religious liberty and for the foundational principles that have guided our nation since its founding,” Drummond said in a statement Thursday.
The Statewide Charter School Board, which dropped the word “virtual” from its name in the year since it appealed the case, issued a statement pledging its commitment to all students and the rule of law.
“The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board respects the Court’s authority and appreciates its willingness to hear complex and deeply significant legal questions,” the board’s statement reads. “The split decision of the court affirms this was indeed a complicated matter with a wide spectrum of views on the appropriate relationship between education, public funding, and religious institutions in our state and country.”
While the attorney general led the legal fight against the school, other Republican leaders in the state, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, advocated for giving religious groups access to charter school funds.
Stitt said the matter is “far from a settled issue.”

“This 4-4 tie is a non-decision,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday. “Now we’re in overtime. There will be another case just like this one and Justice Barrett will break the tie.”
Barrett is a former faculty member of the University of Notre Dame Law School, which aided Catholic officials’ case for the school. She did not participate in the decision to consider the Oklahoma appeal nor did she hear oral arguments.
The Court’s deadlock could impact a separate lawsuit challenging St. Isidore in Oklahoma County District Court. That case has been on hold while the Supreme Court appeal was ongoing.
A coalition of Oklahoma parents, faith leaders and education advocates filed the lawsuit in 2023 while represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, along with other national legal organizations.
They contend St. Isidore would discriminate against LGBTQ+ students and employees, fail to adequately serve children with disabilities and unlawfully teach religious indoctrination.
Oklahoma City Archdiocese officials said students of all backgrounds and beliefs would have been welcome at St. Isidore. The school promised in its charter contract that it would abide by non-discrimination laws and other state regulations to the extent that Catholic doctrine permitted.
Americans United is discussing next steps for the Oklahoma County case with the plaintiffs and co-counsel, spokesperson Liz Hayes said.
A religious charter school would be “an abject violation of religious freedom,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United.
“The Supreme Court’s stalemate safeguards public education and upholds the separation of church and state,” Laser said. “Charter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students.”

At least for now. 
A bill that would have required movie theaters to publish more accurate start times — or include a notice stating the picture would begin after 10 or more minutes of trailers and advertisements — was amended Wednesday, and now calls only for a study of the issue to be undertaken. The amended bill received a favorable vote from the Senate. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 797, attracted global attention earlier this year after it was put forward by Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. Looney said the idea came at the behest of multiple constituents. 
“I have received complaints from constituents who note that they incurred additional baby-sitting costs, or were late for a dinner reservation and had to wait a half hour for a table,” Looney said in written testimony on the bill. He also mentioned “the case of a couple who went to see the Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, [and] were subjected to a string of trailers for violent/horror films in which they had no interest.” 
The original bill would have fined theaters up to $500 for failing to post accurate notices about start times. 
Quickly, however, the theater industry in Connecticut pushed back on the idea. Business owners argued that advertisers would pull their business if they knew people were not going to arrive in time to sit through their ads, cutting into the theater’s bottom line. About one-third of the state’s theaters have closed since the pandemic, according to Connecticut Association of Theatre Owners.
The unusual subject of legislation appeared in news coverage across the country, as well as abroad. In February the bill — and Looney himself — became the butt of several jokes on the NPR comedy show ‘Wait Wait… Don’t Tell Me!’
Some Connecticut lawmakers questioned the concept and why it was worthy of the legislature’s attention.
“I hear a lot of concerns, a lot of ideas, but this was never one,” said state Sen. Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven. “So this is a new one for me.”
Speaking from the Senate floor Wednesday, Looney rejected the notion that the bill was taking away time from more important issues. He also pointed out the amended bill would create a working group to study larger issues affecting the theater industry. 
“The purpose of the original bill has already been accomplished because of the publicity that the issue has been given,” he said. 
In addition to start times, the working group will review policies to support “family entertainment venues” in Connecticut, including through the use of tax credits. The group will file a report by Jan. 1, 2026.
The Senate voted 27 to 9 to pass the amended measure, with all of the opposition coming from Republicans. The bill now heads to the House for further consideration.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MovieTheaters_AP-20210305-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-22 14:15:43.667817

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced Thursday that he accidentally vetoed part of a bill that set aside $35 million for a state housing development fund.
Senate Bill 2014 is the budget for the North Dakota Industrial Commission. On Monday, Armstrong announced two line-item vetoes for the bill. His office said a “staff markup error” led to the unintentional veto of $25 million for housing projects and programs and $10 million to combat homelessness. 
Staff from the governor’s office met with Legislative Council Thursday to discuss options for correcting the error.
“If necessary, we will call the Legislature back to ensure the appropriate funding is delivered, but we hope to avoid the expense of a special session. This was an honest mistake, and we will fix it,” Armstrong said in a Thursday statement. 
North Dakota governor issues 7 line-item vetoes, including lawmaker ‘immunity’ provision

According to his veto message, Armstrong had intended to veto a $150,000 one-time grant for a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. The veto markup also crossed some surrounding language, axing the full $35 million appropriation in the section.
Legislative Council staff will advise on options to fix the error, but it will be up to the governor and legislative leaders to decide how to proceed, said Legislative Council Director John Bjornson. At this point, a special session is the only obvious legal remedy, he said.
“I think we all want the easy solution, but sometimes the easy solution has consequences down the line that you need to consider,” Bjornson said.
Legislators have six days remaining of the 80-day legislative limit. If the governor calls them back into session, it would not count against that limit.
Bjornson estimated it would take about a half day for lawmakers to consider overriding the governor’s veto. But there is no mechanism for lawmakers to consider overriding part of a veto, he said.
Lawmakers could also consider a standalone bill that restores the $35 million in funding. But Legislative Council estimates it typically takes three days to pass a bill.
A special session is estimated to cost $65,000 a day, Bjornson said.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ chief financial officer on Thursday attributed a $374.2 million decrease in net available revenue for the current fiscal year to a tax deadline extension due to severe weather and tax cuts in recent years.
Members of the Arkansas Legislative Council questioned Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson about a revised general revenue forecast released Wednesday that projects Fiscal Year 2025 net available revenue will reach $6.526 billion, a 5.4% decrease from FY 2024. 
The FY 2025 surplus is expected to be $214.8 million, more than three times less than the $698.4 million surplus in FY 2024.
Because the governor issued executive orders authorizing the extension of the deadline for individual and corporate income tax payments to July 31, some of the revenue originally expected for FY 2025, which ends on June 30, will now shift to FY 2026, Hudson said. 
“It’s not a net loss of revenue, it’s just more of a timing effect of it. So we’ll see some leakage of revenue both on the personal side and the corporate side out of FY 25 into FY 26,” Hudson said. “We’ve done some estimating on that, but we really don’t know how many people will take advantage of that yet.”
Arkansas governor signs tax, appropriation bills after special legislative session ends

In a May 21 letter to the ALC chairs, Hudson said the revenue decline compared to FY 2024 is also expected because of the impact of individual and corporate income tax rate reductions passed in two special sessions of the 94th General Assembly. 
State lawmakers in September 2023 approved legislation to cut the top corporate income tax rate from 5.1% to 4.8% and the top individual income tax rate from 4.7% to 4.4%. The rate changes took effect on Jan. 1, 2024.   
The General Assembly approved another round of cuts in June 2024 that lowered the top corporate income tax rate from 4.8% to 4.3% and the top individual income tax rate from 4.4% to 3.9%, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024. The tax cuts went into effect immediately upon the governor’s signature. 
Year-to-date, net available revenues have declined by $224.7 million from the same time last year, resulting in collections that are $52.2 million over forecast at that point, according to the new DFA report. 
Sales and use tax collections have also been marginally below forecast and individual income taxes have been above forecast primarily due to estimated payments. Corporate income tax collections are below forecast, according to the report. 
“Corporate collections are notoriously volatile, they’re even more so I’d say right now just given the number of tax cuts that we’ve done with some retroactive effect, so there could be a forecasting component to this,” Hudson said. 
DFA’s report, which was released Wednesday as required by state law, included revised forecasts for FY 2026 and FY 2027. Net available revenues are expected to reach $6.679 billion, an increase of 152.8 million above FY 2025. The projected FY 2026 surplus is $185.1 million.
FY 2027 net available revenue is expected to reach $6.88 billion, an increase of $201.3 million above FY 2026. 
The revised projections are lower than the Nov. 14, 2024 forecast, which predicted $6.794 billion in net available revenue for FY 2026 and $6.997 billion for FY 2027. The adjustments are “largely attributable to shifts in economic conditions,” according to the May 21 report. 
The revenue forecast is based on S&P Global Market Intelligence’s baseline economic forecast, according to the report. The S&P, one of three major stock market indexes, has had a volatile year as the market reacts to threats by President Donald Trump to levy steep tariffs.

“There’s a lot of speculation about the impact of tariffs, where the economy’s going,” Greenbrier Republican Rep. Stephen Meeks said Thursday. “…is any of that driving the need and is there anything looking forward that we need to be concerned about revenues coming into the state?”
Hudson responded that reductions made to the revenue forecast were “almost entirely driven by macroeconomic considerations.” Tariffs are a big component of forecasting, but Hudson noted it’s more the perception of the potential impact of tariffs that’s affecting the market instead of actual tariffs because many have been paused, he said. 
Earlier this month, the United States and China agreed to lower steep tariffs for 90 days, States Newsroom reported. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods dropped to a universal 10% baseline from the 145% Trump imposed in April. A 20% emergency tariff announced in February on all products because of illicit fentanyl chemicals in China remained in place. 
The back and forth on tariffs has caused uncertainty, which the market hates, Hudson said. However, the state’s chief financial officer said he believes “the potential upside from tariffs could be significant” for Arkansas if the result is trade agreements that are more favorable to the U.S. than they are today.  
“I think particularly for Arkansas, if our agri exports — we get access to certain foreign markets that we’re currently closed off to, that could be a significant benefit to the state,” he said. “But at this point, we don’t know what the actual long-term benefits will be. Because of the uncertainty, analysts have reduced the projected growth; we’re following suit.”

(Courtesy of Sierra Toomey/Natural Resources Council of Maine)While legislative committees are winding down their work for the session, the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee has yet to decide what it will do with a slew of proposals aimed at reforming or outright eliminating the state’s clean energy credit program. 
The committee is still holding several work sessions this week on the matter, though it has voted on some of the proposals to tweak or toss the program, known as net energy bill, which many agree needs reform.
Meanwhile, clean energy advocates, including representatives from the Natural Resources Council of Maine, Maine Youth for Climate Justice, Maine Conservation Voters, and Maine Community Power Cooperative, gathered at the State House Thursday morning asking lawmakers to reject any attempts at rolling back or making retroactive changes to the net energy billing program.
Activists, solar customers and laborers also roamed the halls talking with lawmakers about continued support for solar energy.
The group also highlighted three specific measures it would like to see passed, including a proposal to develop a cabinet-level Maine Department of Energy. They are also backing a bill to codify the goal of 100% clean, renewable energy by 2040 into state law, and another proposal to establish new energy fairness and affordability standards. 
Multiple speakers, including Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, underscored the importance of considering investor confidence when contemplating changes to net energy billing
“Businesses like ours can adapt to small changes in a program, but we can’t plan around uncertainty or volatility,” agreed Dale Knapp of Portland-based Waldon Renewables. “We at least need to know the playing field.”
Knapp went on to say that “the policy signals we send right now to the industry can determine whether Maine remains a place where energy companies like ours continue to want to invest.” 
That investment goes beyond new energy sources, Knapp said, calling them a “strategic investment in our economy.” For example, a 20-megwatt project his company is working on in Sanford employs 125 people and the vast majority of them live in Maine. So, he said, they are using local gas stations, grabbing lunch at local restaurants and buying supplies from local hardware stores. 
During the public hearings for some of the proposals, the Governor’s Energy Office also cautioned the committee against proposals that would change the way people are compensated for existing projects. 
“Broad retroactive modifications to the core mechanisms in determining compensation under the program as these bills propose and others will have a dramatic effect on 16,000 projects in the state, more than 114,000 customers,” said Caroline Colan, legislative liaison for the Governor’s Energy Office, testifying before the committee in April. 
The committee has already rejected one such proposal, LD 1317, which would have adjusted the tariff rate over the next few years to eventually reach 12 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2028. Solar companies testified that such a rate would not be sufficient.
Similarly, the committee killed two proposals to repeal net energy billing entirely: LD 257 and LD 450.

Free.,Court order blocks Trump from eliminating U.S. Education Department,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/court-order-blocks-trump-eliminating-us-education-department,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education must temporarily reinstate the hundreds of employees laid off earlier this year and cannot follow through on an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to dismantle the agency, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Thursday. The ruling stems from a pair of March lawsuits — one from a slew of Democratic attorneys general, another from a coalition of advocacy and labor groups — and blocks three Trump initiatives, marking a major blow to the president’s education agenda as his administration seeks to dramatically reshape the federal role in education.The lawsuits challenge some of the administration’s most consequential education initiatives so far: a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump’s executive order calling on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and Trump’s proposal to rehouse the student loan portfolio in the Small Business Administration and special education services in the Department of Health and Human Services.“A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,” U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun wrote in his 88-page memorandum and order granting a preliminary injunction.“This court cannot be asked to cover its eyes while the Department’s employees are continuously fired and units are transferred out until the Department becomes a shell of itself,” wrote Joun, whom former President Joe Biden appointed.Joun’s preliminary injunction took effect immediately and will remain until the merits of the consolidated case are decided.A department spokesperson said the administration would immediately appeal the ruling.Win for Democratic statesOne of the cases comes from a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.The other lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.The department’s reduction in force plan prompted concerns from education advocates and leaders over how the agency would be able to carry out its core responsibilities after roughly halving its workforce, including major cuts to key units including the Office of Federal Student Aid, Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers unions in the country, celebrated the ruling in a Thursday statement.“Today, the court rightly rejected one of the administration’s very first illegal, and consequential, acts: abolishing the federal role in education,” Weingarten said.“This decision is a first step to reverse this war on knowledge and the undermining of broad-based opportunity. For America to build a brighter future, we must all take more responsibility, not less, for the success of our children.”Joun’s order also bars the agency from carrying out the president’s directive to transfer the student loan portfolio and special education services out of the agency.Trump announced the proposal, which had no accompanying executive order, at the opening of an Oval Office appearance with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The department had told States Newsroom earlier this week that it had nothing new to share at this time regarding the proposed transfer. Judge ‘dramatically overstepped’Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said the agency “will immediately challenge this on an emergency basis.”“Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,” she said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.“President Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families.”Thursday’s ruling came just a day after McMahon took a grilling from U.S. House Democrats over the drastic cuts and proposed changes at her department during a hearing in a panel of the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations.McMahon appeared before the lawmakers to outline Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request, which calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the department.",,,,2025-05-22 14:15:43.667817

The budget passed with a bipartisan 86-20 vote. Some Democrats who spoke Thursday said they hoped House negotiators would be able to keep the items they liked in the final version in negotiations with Senate Republicans.
The House and Senate budgets are marked by glaring differences that must be resolved before both chambers vote on a compromise that will go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein for his consideration.
The chambers are far apart on how much to raise teacher pay and on future cuts to individual income tax rates.
“Do we have a long road? Absolutely. We all know this is a process and this is a first step,” said Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a House senior budget writer.
“We will not be intimidated,” he said. “We’re going to hold strong.”



The state’s 2023 budget built in up to three automatic personal income tax cuts in tax years 2027 to 2034 that depend on the state meeting revenue targets.
The House budget changes those revenue targets, meaning the state would need to bring in more money to trigger a reduction in the personal income tax rate, likely delaying a cut. The Senate budget goes in the opposite direction, adding more future cuts.
Talking with reporters Thursday, Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said it seems that the House wants to reopen negotiations on a tax policy that was settled in 2023.
“We had an understanding and an agreement in 2023 as to what the progression of tax policy would be over the years and the House budget goes in a completely different direction than that,” he said.
Earlier this week, the conservative Club for Growth threatened House members who voted for the budget, based on the tax changes. All House Republicans who were present voted for the budget.
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said he felt good voting for a budget with big teacher raises. The House budget proposes to increase new teacher pay from $41,000 a year to $48,000 for the next school year, and to $50,000 the following year.
Jones said he wanted to strengthen the House negotiators’ position when members sit down with senators.
“I wanted our team to go in with a strong hand,” he said.  “Y’all defend what we’ve done here. I hope we can come out strong with most of what we have painfully, thoughtfully put in. It deserves to be defended.”
Meanwhile, Democrats who voted for the budget said it contained good ideas but could have been better.

The sums Republicans have socked away to pay for private school vouchers continued to come in for pointed criticism.
Rep. Lindsey Prather (D-Buncombe), who voted for the budget, said the state could do more if it stopped prioritizing private schools and corporations instead of people.
The legislature is phasing out the corporate income tax. It will hit zero by 2030.
“I hope that this budget gets much, much better in conference,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gettyimages-StateBudget-iStock.jpg,,,2025-05-22 14:15:43.667817

Some Kentucky school districts had already committed the funding to projects and services. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education denied a $10.6 million request to extend COVID relief funding submitted by the Kentucky Department of Education on behalf of school districts for nine projects. 
However, the federal department did extend COVID relief funding for two Boone County projects amounting to about $44,000. That includes $26,000 for an interactive online learning platform and another project to fund a year of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. 
School districts and states previously had until March of 2026 to spend COVID-19 relief funds that had been approved. However, in a March 28 letter, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told state education departments that the federal government was immediately halting nearly $3 billion in relief fund reimbursements.
McMahon wrote in her letter that the U.S. Education Department would consider extending the pandemic relief money on a case-by-case basis. 
Altogether, Kentucky was hoping to preserve $38 million in expected federal funding for projects and services in local districts and $18 million for the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE). The state has not yet received a federal decision on the rest of the projects it submitted for reconsideration, a KDE spokesperson said.
Kentucky earlier this month had asked the U.S. Department of Education (USED) to approve a deadline extension for Kentucky school districts to use the COVID relief funds for planned projects that would be in jeopardy without the dollars. Some have signed contracts or incurred other obligations and must now re-examine their district budgets. 
Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher expressed disappointment at the decision and said the state would appeal it. “We expect the federal government to honor its promises to states and to our students,” he said.

“While I am pleased that USED will allow for Boone County to continue spending money on these two projects that were previously approved by the department last year, it is unfortunate that Kentucky has been denied more than $10 million – so far – to provide resources and improve the learning environment of our students,” Fletcher said in a Tuesday press release. 
“While we hope for more good news in the coming days, we stand ready to appeal the projects that have been denied,” he continued. “We will continue to fight for the resources our schools and districts have been promised by USED to continue their mission of providing the best education possible to Kentucky’s students.”
The KDE request that was denied included projects for school districts in Boone County, Christian County, Clinton County, Covington Independent, Jefferson County and Knox County. Christian County Public Schools had the most projects in the request — five — including about $7.9 million to construct a new high school. 
A spokesperson for the Christian County schools said in a statement that it will continue to focus on its mission to “provide a high-quality education and celebrate student success” and work with legislators “to advocate for the return of these funds to support the construction of the new Christian County High School.” 
“Our focus, as always, is on supporting our students and staff,” the statement said. “At this time, we are especially committed to celebrating the accomplishments of our seniors as they prepare for graduation and the next chapter of their lives.” 
Jefferson County Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, requested about $340,000 to provide students experiencing homelessness with wraparound services. 
Mark Hebert, a spokesperson for JCPS, said in an email that the district is “disappointed that the U.S. government is cutting funds that support the needs of our extremely fragile homeless student population.” The school district had signed a grant contract with the federal government and was using the funding for: 

Case management services for students who are homeless
Food and hygiene items for students who are homeless
Emergency short-term, or under five days, hotel vouchers for families in dangerous situations without shelter
Transportation to ensure students who are homeless have stable schooling even when their families move from place to place

Three key Michigan House Republicans on Thursday said they will request a resolution to hold Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in contempt for bucking a subpoena request for unredacted election training manuals.
Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), chair of the Michigan House Oversight Committee, announced the plan at a news conference with Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, and Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), chair of the House Election Integrity Committee.
The move could result in litigation against the department, presumably with a request for the court to order Benson to hand over the information.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, the Department of State said their concerns for safety of election information were valid given the fact that the House gave DeBoyer authority to disclose confidential information to anyone he chooses at his discretion. 
Smit, when she was the minority vice chair of the House Elections Committee, requested access to the Bureau of Elections’ e-learning portal, which holds education and training materials for the state’s local clerks. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When she became chair of the now-renamed Election Integrity Committee, Smit brought the matter to DeBoyer’s oversight committee, which then issued a subpoena to the Michigan Department of State for any materials that had not already been provided to DeBoyer by May 13.
The department said multiple times that it was working to fulfill Smit’s and DeBoyer’s individual requests, but the department was wary of releasing the materials without review or redaction for security reasons.
On Thursday, Bollin, DeBoyer and Smit called foul on that position and said enough was enough.
“[Our] olive branch was that we said … we’ll give you until 11 a.m. today to sit down and have an opportunity to discuss some of the items that they believe are privileged or protected items,” DeBoyer said. “Whether we agree or disagree with the theory, we believe in professionalism. So we did that, and the response to us, essentially in a letter that was returned to us this morning, said now they’re not providing us with anything further with regard to that.”

That included declining the offer to sit down and hash it out, DeBoyer said.
“That’s a pretty disappointing thing,” he said. “After all, the Legislature is the body that determines how elections are run, the time, the manner, the place, the laws by which they are implemented. [Smit] has not only the right but the duty in that role to request the information that is used to train local clerks with regard to how they administer elections.”
That said, in the letter sent Thursday the department did agree to sit down for a meeting with House legal counsel, but indicated that it would like to have an independent third-party mediator present to resolve questions about disclosing confidential information. It also questioned the scope and purpose of the committee’s inquiry.
“The Committee’s generalized purpose of investigating how every election law is implemented by DOS is so broad as to emit no purpose. But even if that purpose were assumed to be legitimate, the Committee has made no effort to explain why the sensitive information is pertinent to or necessary for its investigation,” the letter said.
A spokesperson for the department said it would have additional comment on the issue later.

But, given the perception that the House was being stonewalled, DeBoyer said House Republicans had no choice but to ask the full chamber to support a resolution holding Benson in contempt.
The next steps could include litigation.
“I think that’s a strong possibility, but what a sad day for Michigan,” DeBoyer said. “I happened to be a local clerk, as well, in 2020 when [Benson] told local clerks to not worry about signature verification on returned absentee ballots. … This is a continual problem, and the fact that we have to perhaps go to court is a shame for the people of the state of Michigan.”
Smit, who also served a clerk prior to serving in the Legislature, said she could not fathom the security risks cited by Benson and the department as reasons to not release the documents or to spend excess time redacting and reviewing them.
“it just makes us [ask]: What is it that the Department of State is hiding [in] the training materials? If there is such sensitive and protected information, then why can’t Secretary of State Benson explain to us what that is and sit down?” Smit questioned. “I have been asking to have this since November 7, 2023. It is nearly seven months. We are still here without the information.”
Bollin, also a former clerk, said many of these documents are available on the secretary of state’s website under the election administrator tab. She wondered what was so secretive about the e-learning portal as opposed to that front-facing information.
The cadre of representatives was asked if it appeared as though Benson was trying to run out the clock on the request. DeBoyer said he didn’t want to speculate on her thinking, but said that has been a tactic he’s seen play out in Lansing before.
Bollin added that the people of Michigan deserved transparency and confidence in their elections, and that Benson’s unwillingness to comply with requests from the Republican-controlled House did not instill confidence.
DeBoyer went a step further and called Benson’s action lawless.
Benson is one of several names in the race to seek the Democratic nomination for governor. Her campaign has stumbled a bit out of the gate, with the pending contempt resolution adding to headaches over the disastrous rollout of the Michigan Transparency Network campaign finance system and the Department of Attorney General finding her in violation of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act for holding her announcement event in the lobby of the building that houses her department.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250522_110854-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-05-22 13:11:44.633321

(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)LAWRENCE — The leaders of a Jewish center at the University of Kansas joined a chorus of sorrow and outrage over the killing of alumna Sarah Milgrim and her partner Wednesday night outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.
Milgrim, 26, was shot and killed alongside Yaron Lischinsky, 30, at an American Jewish Committee event for young diplomats. A suspect who was taken into custody shortly after the shooting shouted “free, free Palestine.” Officials said the attack appeared to be targeted.
Milgrim, a Kansas native and KU graduate, and Lischinsky had planned to leave Sunday to visit his family in Jerusalem, where he planned to give her an engagement ring.
Rabbi Zalman and Nechama Tiechtel, directors of Chabad Center for Jewish Life at KU, mourned their deaths. In a statement, they said Milgrim was “a proud Jewhawk” and “an active, deeply loved member of our KU Jewish community.”
“She joined us often for Shabbat dinners, holiday celebrations, and countless Jewish programs, always bringing her warm smile, gentle spirit, and deep passion for her Jewish heritage,” the Tiechtels said. “She was not only a joy to be around but a true embodiment of grace, empathy, and purpose.”
They said Milgrim had recently joined the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., to continue her mission of “bringing light into a world that too often feels dark.”
“Her life was a beacon of hope and humanity,” they said. “Her loss is a devastating blow to all who knew her and to the values she stood for.”
Milgrim’s father, in an interview Thursday with KCUR, said she graduated from Shawnee Mission East High School and then from KU with a degree in environmental science. She earned master’s degrees in international studies from American University in Washington, D.C., and international sustainable colonial development from the United Nations University for Peace in Costa Rica. She had worked for an organization that connected young Israelis and Palestinians before joining the embassy.
The couple planned to leave Sunday for their trip to Israel. Her parents learned after her death that Lischinsky had purchased a wedding ring to give to her during the trip.
“There just needs to be something done to make people realize that we’re many different people living in the U.S., but there’s no reason to hate one another,” Robert Milgrim said in the radio interview. “This hate cannot divide us. We need to overcome it.”
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly in a statement Thursday called for “those responsible for this vicious crime” to be brought to justice. Antisemitic violence is not theoretical, she said.
“In my role as governor, I will continue to call out antisemitism and be active in pushing back against it,” Kelly said. “As Kansans, we value peace over violence, dialogue over destruction, and dignity for all people, regardless of faith or background.”
Authorities identified the suspect as Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago. Deputy FBI director Dan Bongino said on social media that the “act of terror has the full attention of your FBI.”
American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said the couple were killed as they left an AJC event at the Capital Jewish Museum. He condemned the “shocking act of violence”
“While we wait for the conclusion of the police investigation — and urge all our friends and allies to do the same — it strongly appears that this was an attack motivated by hate against the Jewish people and the Jewish state. This senseless hate and violence must stop.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his “heart grieves for the families of the young beloveds, whose lives were cut short in a moment by an abhorrent antisemitic murderer.”
Kansas House Republicans in a statement said “the evil rot of antisemitism has been allowed to fester far too long.”
“The poison of extremist ideologies that lead to this type of violence and are peddled by radicals has no place here,” their statement said. “And while it is most certainly not enough, we offer our heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families, friends, and the entire Jewish community and stand with you through the heartbreak of this horrific tragedy.”
Kansas Senate Republicans condemned “the heinous attack on two Israeli diplomats.”
“Let’s be clear — this is antisemitic and anti-American terrorism that cannot be tolerated,” their statement said. “This vile act underscores why we must continue to be vigilant in our fight against antisemitism at every turn and why this past session, we passed legislation to define antisemitism and declare any form of it will not be tolerated in Kansas.”
The new law, which was inspired by pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, codifies an International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism that considers criticism of Israel to be antisemitic. The one-page bill declares antisemitism to be against public policy but contains no enforcement mechanism.
“This act of terrorism underscores our need to continue to do more to ensure antisemitism has no place in our state,” the Senate Republican leaders said. “We stand with Israel, the Jewish community, and all who are impacted by this unfathomable atrocity.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2216486658.jpg,,,2025-05-22 13:11:44.633321

In January 2024, the Washington Medical Commission restricted Cole’s medical license in the state of Washington after state regulators concluded that he knowingly shared disinformation about COVID-19 and broke medical standards by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID-19 patients, against medical evidence, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Ryan Cole ends after legal agreement reached

In the state of Washington, Cole’s medical license is active with restrictions, the Washington State Department of Health’s website shows. He is still licensed to practice medicine in Idaho, the Idaho Board of Medicine’s licensing records website shows.
Cole serves on the Central District Health Board of Health, which directs Idaho’s largest regional public health district.
In April, an Idaho medical malpractice lawsuit against Cole was dismissed following a private legal agreement, months after six doctors disagreed with Cole’s severe cancer diagnosis that led a woman to undergo major surgery, the Sun previously reported.
Cole and his attorney, Nancy Garrett, could not be immediately reached for comment. The Idaho Board of Medicine also could not be immediately reached for comment.

 Cole still denies Washington allegations, but understands Idaho could pursue disciplinary action against his medical license, agreement says

The Idaho agreement, formally called a stipulation, says Cole still “denies the allegations underlying the Washington Order” and has appealed it. But the agreement says Cole “understands the allegations and acknowledges that the (Idaho Board of Medicine) has sufficient evidence to establish the allegation for purposes of disciplinary action against (Cole’s) Idaho license.”
The Idaho Board of Medicine can adopt another jurisdiction’s order when that licensed provider is disciplined elsewhere on grounds that apply under Idaho law. The Idaho Board of Medicine can also choose not to pursue disciplinary action in response to discipline in other states.
In a 40-page response to the Washington Medical Board to complaints against him, Cole and his attorney argued that he did not violate any rules when he prescribed drugs to patients over telehealth and claimed COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous. But some of the arguments in the response to the Washington Medical Commission do not match Cole’s public comments, investigations by the Sun found.
In public appearances, Cole has said the complaints are politically motivated attacks.
The new agreement appears to be the first public move in Idaho related to disciplining Cole. The Idaho Board of Medicine previously closed a complaint into Cole’s Idaho medical license without looking into patient records, the Sun previously reported. 
 How Idaho agreement works: Cole to comply with Washington order, waives rights with Idaho Board of Medicine

The Idaho agreement says Cole and the Idaho Board of Medicine “mutually agree to settle the matter expeditiously in lieu of formal administrative hearings before the Board.”

The agreement says Cole will “fully and timely comply with the terms and conditions” of the Washington Medical Commission’s order. And within two weeks, Cole will submit a status report to the Board of Medicine about his compliance with the Washington order, the agreement says.
In its order last year, the Washington Medical Commission set several conditions for Cole to keep his Washington medical license, including completing medical education courses and writing an essay focused on honesty in medicine. 
The Washington Medical Commission couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. 
As part of the Idaho agreement, Cole waived his right to a full disciplinary hearing with the Idaho Board of Medicine, including the right to call witnesses, testify, present evidence, confront witnesses, and for reconsideration or judicial review of the board’s orders.

Chellie Pingree outside the U.S. Capitol. (Rep. Chellie Pingree via Facebook) Citing Maine Morning Star’s reporting, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine pressed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on conflicting statements about why it cut grants for forever chemical research in Maine. 
Earlier this month, the EPA terminated all of the grants it had awarded for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in the food supply, including to three Maine-based teams led by the Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and the University of Maine. The three grants for Maine projects amounted to almost $5 million. The termination notices read, “The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, the EPA Press Office equated the grants to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures. However, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin publicly stated the grants were important and already congressionally appropriated when questioned by Pingree. Overall, the agency has highlighted combating PFAS contamination as a priority in recent weeks. 
Despite saying PFAS contamination is a priority, EPA cut millions in funding for research in Maine

In a letter to Zeldin on Thursday, Pingree requested he address these inconsistencies and clarify EPA priorities by May 30. 
“Do you and the EPA consider tribes – which are sovereign governments to which we have trust and treaty responsibilities – ‘DEI?’ If so, under what basis do you make that claim?” one of Pingree’s questions to Zeldin in the letter reads. 
When asked why the grants no longer aligned with agency priorities, the EPA Press Office sent a statement on May 16 to Maine Morning Star, which read:, “As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities. Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”
Pingree and several of the researchers pushed back on this response, pointing out that the research objectives do not involve DEI or environmental justice and are about protecting public health. PFAS have been linked to long term adverse health outcomes, such as cancers and weakened immune systems, and their pervasiveness in agriculture is not fully understood. 
The statement is also directly at odds with the response Zeldin gave to Pingree about the grant terminations during an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 15. 
After Zeldin told the subcommittee that addressing PFAS contamination is a priority for the agency and him personally, Pingree asked, “Since these grants are consistent with the EPA priorities, do you know why they were terminated?” 
Zeldin responded, “It’s an important program. It’s something that’s congressionally appropriated. The agency’s going through a reorg, so the way that the program and these grants are administered are going to be different going forward. But these are important grants. I look forward to working with you, and your team as we’re able to continue that good work going forward.”
In light of these conflicting responses, Pingree asked Zeldin in her letter to confirm that addressing PFAS is a priority for the agency. 
“If PFAS is a priority, which I believe you have stated many times, please provide more
information about why the above listed grants were terminated,” the letter reads. “They are not ‘DEI’ grants and they meet a key priority of the Agency so I would like some clarity as to the exact reasoning for these grant terminations.”
The grantees have 30 days from their termination notices to make the case that their work is in compliance with the EPA’s priorities. If the agency determines the grants are in line with agency priorities, Pingree also requested information on how and when the awards will be reinstated. 
Referring to the agency’s work as a whole, Pingree additionally pressed Zeldin about the agency’s plans for PFAS research beyond these grants. 
“Without grants that fund research and scientific advancement for PFAS remediation, how will the EPA make determinations about effective remediation for PFAS in agriculture, water systems, and contaminated lands?” she wrote in the letter.

Sullivan Sr., and grew up with her older sister, Maureen, and younger brother, Jack, in nearby West Springfield, MA.Carolyn met the love of her life, Joseph S. Pieciak Jr., in 1962 after being set up on a blind date by her best friend, Maureen Doody O’Donnell. Carolyn and Joe married on June 12, 1965, in West Springfield, MA, and began their family shortly thereafter. Their daughter Jennifer was born in 1970, daughter Elizabeth in 1975, and son Michael in 1983.Carolyn and Joe moved to Brattleboro in 1970. They were welcomed to the Vermont community with open arms and formed a deep love for the town and its people. Carolyn was not only the heart of the Pieciak family but also a thoughtful, kind “Mom” to many.At a young age, Carolyn was called to serve others, saying, “God wanted me to work with the poor.” Deeply dedicated, she volunteered with Habitat for Humanity and Meals on Wheels. She and her husband served as United Way campaign co-presidents, and when she stepped down as leader of the Windham County Humane Society, he succeeded her in the post.Carolyn’s biggest life passion was born on St. Patrick’s Day 1982 when she helped open one of the region’s largest soup kitchens, St. Brigid’s Kitchen and Pantry of Brattleboro. At the time, Carolyn was head of the St. Michael’s Catholic Church peace and justice committee when the pastor noted a growing number of visitors requesting food.Carolyn, working with fellow volunteers, raised money and ordered, obtained and cooked food at the church’s former convent for four decades before retiring as director last year. Originally serving a few dozen people, St. Brigid’s now provides more than 45,000 meals annually.To Carolyn, there were no strangers, only friends she hadn’t yet met. True to her Irish spirit, she built a community with love, laughter and unshakable loyalty. She had a heart big enough to hold the whole world and a circle of loved ones that just kept expanding. Whether it was traveling, spending time on the golf course, enjoying her garden club or celebrating at a friend’s birthday lunch, Carolyn loved her friends, and they loved her.Carolyn was a lifelong learner of her faith. She attended The Elms College in Chicopee, MA, and regularly participated in spiritual retreats throughout New England. Through these retreats and her ongoing personal spiritual journey, she sought not only to deepen her relationship with God but also to grow and improve herself as a person. Her devotion to nurturing her faith was a cornerstone of her life, inspiring those around her to do the same.Carolyn’s illness never dampened her spirit nor dimmed the light of love in her eyes. Her family grieves her loss but is comforted knowing she is at peace and in the arms of God.Carolyn leaves behind her husband of nearly 60 years, Joseph S. Pieciak Jr.; her two daughters, Elizabeth Lawyer and her husband, Travis, of Brattleboro, and Jennifer Rau of Chicopee, MA; her son, Michael Sullivan Pieciak and his husband, William Holder, of Winooski, VT; siblings Maureen Sullivan-Iannitelli and her husband, Richard, of The Villages, Florida, and John R.

(Photo: North Carolina Department of Commerce HUD CDBG-DR Helene recovery Action Plan)The firm that will run North Carolina’s Hurricane Helene recovery program in the western mountains, as it sought to win the critical contract, described itself as the only one up to the task.
“Only the HORNE Team has the system, expertise, and experience required to deliver this mission quickly and bring thousands of North Carolinians back home,” wrote one of the firm’s partners to the state.
Mississippi-based Horne LLP won the $81.5 million bid earlier this month. It will implement a $1.4 billion federal housing grant, overseeing an array of other contractors as western North Carolina looks to rebuild from the deadliest storm in state history. Horne’s bid, which won out over four other firms, was first reported by Inside Climate News.
Horne’s successful application for the contract, obtained by NC Newsline through a public records request, details the company’s extensive prior work and contracts: $31.5 million to rebuild in Florida in 2020, and $190 million in Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina.
Mentioned just once in the redacted version of the 350-page plan is the N.C. Office of Recovery and Resiliency, the state office that tapped Horne as prime contractor from 2019 to 2022. The state did not renew the contract amid complaints of poor case management and communication across eastern North Carolina.

Three years later, Horne will once again be at the helm of disaster recovery in the Tar Heel State. And the firm has pledged top-flight customer service, robust in-person staffing and expansive outreach to survivors.
In a hearing Thursday morning, Republican lawmakers said Horne’s return to North Carolina disaster work raised a red flag.
“This is a process that promised to learn from past failures, but it’s already raising some serious concerns,” said House Majority Leader Brenden Jones (R-Columbus), who co-chairs the General Assembly’s committee on hurricane recovery.
A spokesperson for Horne declined to comment, saying the firm was not authorized to speak for the program.
The NC Department of Commerce, which is overseeing the federal grant money and Helene recovery program, provided materials to NC Newsline showing that Horne scored the highest of all bidders in grading by the state’s contract review committee.
Horne’s plan: Local partners, WNC offices & job fairs
The state’s offer with Horne is set to span three years. After that period, the state can choose to re-up the contract for one year, up to six years total.
In the first year, the firm projects the largest cost to be assessing damage and conducting an environmental review. That will cost an estimated $15.6 million. Outreach and intake for survivors and homeowners in the first year is expected to cost around $11 million.
Key to Horne’s outreach plan is partnering with local nonprofits and organizations. Patriot Relief, a North Carolina-based hurricane relief nonprofit, is set to knock on doors and use data tracking to find survivors who may be eligible. And the firm plans to blast out materials online, in local media and even by mail in both English and Spanish.
“Outreach efforts will have intentional focus to reach the unreachable and offer aid to those most in need,” Horne writes in its application.
Among the other local groups Horne has tapped as partners: Endeavors, a Christian crisis care organization with offices in Jacksonville and Fayetteville; and SWCA, an environmental consulting practice with offices in Cary and Charlotte.
The firm plans to set up three offices in western North Carolina — in Boone, Weaverville and Marion. The Marion intake center would remain open for the entire recovery process; Boone and Weaverville offices would be open for at least six months.
Horne plans to source staff locally — outlining a series of three job fairs, including in Buncombe and Watauga counties. The state has required the contractor to have at least 25% of their staff locally hired; Horne wrote that it aims to “hit or surpass 75%.”

Details on how exactly Horne will oversee construction are scant. Portions of its application outlining the timeline, inspections, diagrams, warranties and more have been redacted. But the firm has pledged to work quickly, “without sacrificing the homeowner’s experience in the process.” In the bid, Horne included photos of rebuilt homes in Florida that remained sturdy under two hurricanes.
“Speed is no longer a goal; it is an expectation,” the firm wrote. “When it comes to housing programs, speed is service. We know your homeowners have one goal in mind, and that is to return home as quickly as possible.”
Horne has recently faced legal action in other states over disaster recovery projects. Last month, the company paid $1.2 million in a settlement agreement with the federal government in West Virginia. A spokesperson told Inside Climate News the company had not admitted any wrongdoing.
State officials said Thursday that they learned of the West Virginia settlement after the contract window had closed. Horne provided the state with a copy of the settlement agreement.
Horne taps three veteran employees to lead Helene rebuild
Included in Horne’s application were three top staffers it planned to deploy to lead the Helene project.
Kelly Huck is set to be the program director. Huck, who will be based in Raleigh, is the firm’s director of government services. He previously led a project in Florida using the same federal grant money, serving as construction director after Hurricanes Ian and Michael.
Milena Caterino, who served as a senior manager and deputy construction manager on the Florida contract after Michael, is the proposed construction manager. And Bob Harland, who has served as Horne’s tech director on a number of disaster projects, has been put forward as tech manager. Both would be based in North Carolina.
Gov. Josh Stein’s advisor for western North Carolina, Jonathan Krebs, worked for Horne until April 2024, Inside Climate News reported. Krebs was last paid by the firm in December, the governor’s office said. He was not involved in the review committee and “will not financially benefit from it,” a spokesperson said.
“I do not participate or particularly care who they picked to do the work,” Krebs told state lawmakers Thursday.
Jones, the House majority leader, argued that Krebs’ role in drafting the state solicitation was a “blatant conflict.” Krebs pushed back on that accusation, saying that “recusing myself from that activity would nullify my role.”
Another lawmaker viewed his prior work for the firm as a plus.
“[He could] understand some of their processes, identify red flags,” said Sen. Warren Daniel (R-Caldwell).

How North Carolina graded, awarded Horne
Horne’s bid earned 184 out of 200 possible points from the state’s five-person committee, according to a recommendation memo provided to NC Newsline.
The committee noted the firm’s experience with single-family housing, as well as “glowing references” from South Carolina, Florida and Mississippi. Its technical plan was “well-researched and planned.” And Horne’s recommended leaders were qualified, the committee noted, but lacked experience building housing “in places with characteristics similar to western NC.”
“Horne was by far the best vendor selection,” said Stephanie McGarrah, who is leading the new Commerce division tasked with overseeing Helene operations, on Thursday.
Horne’s price for the contract fell in between the other two bidders, according to the state.
Hunt, Guillot & Associates, LLC, another bidder, earned the next-highest score at 161 points. That firm offered the highest price, at $87.1 million. And it was docked for its lesser experience in specific services, as well as key leaders not relocating to North Carolina.
A third bidder, Tidal Basin, provided the lowest price but had “significant weaknesses” in qualifications. Its recommendations were also lacking — the city of Brunswick, Georgia told the committee “they would not recommend” hiring the group. Tidal Basin earned 140 points.
Two other bidders were deemed non-responsive. McGarrah said Thursday she was “personally very disappointed” that one of those bidders, IEM, did not submit a qualifying offer. They did not provide required financial documents.
“You need to understand, this is a very small group of companies that do this kind of work,” McGarrah said.
The state review committee for the contract included McGarrah, Tommy Clark, the executive director of the NC Pandemic Recovery Office; and Konrad Wisniewski, public information officer for the Department of Commerce.
Allan Sandoval, who is CIO at Commerce, and Mark Poole, who leads the Commerce Finance Center, served as subject matter experts. They did not have voting power.
Asked by Rep. Mark Pless (R-Haywood) whether she would redo the bidding process knowing what she knows now, McGarrah said she would not. The housing process is already expected to take three to four years, she estimated.
“I do think we made the right decision,” she said. “I also think that it just slows the recovery down. It’s slow already. It’s so frustrating.”

Read this story in English.
Si ha revisado detalladamente su factura de electricidad de Connecticut durante el último año, probablemente haya notado que se divide en cuatro secciones: suministro, transmisión, distribución local y, para confusión e ira de muchos, una sección denominada “beneficios públicos”.
Si bien los tres primeros cargos representan el costo de compra y distribución de electricidad que los clientes esperan de su compañía eléctrica, el último cargo es menos conocido para muchos, a pesar de existir de alguna forma durante más de dos décadas.
La existencia de este cargo se ha vuelto más conocida debido al reciente debate sobre las tarifas de electricidad de Connecticut, que se encuentran entre las más altas del país.
Desde los cambios más recientes en las tarifas eléctricas que entraron en vigor el 1 de mayo, los cargos por beneficios públicos representan aproximadamente el 20% de la factura típica de un cliente de Eversource. Para los clientes de United Illuminating, representan poco más del 18% de la factura total.
¿Qué incluye el cargo?
En pocas palabras, el cargo por beneficios públicos es un conjunto de iniciativas estatales y federales que incluyen programas de eficiencia energética y electrificación, asistencia para clientes de bajos ingresos y contratos para la compra de energía de fuentes específicas, como centrales nucleares. También incluye los costos asociados con las operaciones de ISO-New England, la organización sin fines de lucro encargada de supervisar la red regional.
El precio de cada uno de estos programas lo pagan las empresas de servicios públicos, quienes luego trasladan los costos a sus clientes a través del cargo por beneficios públicos.


Las gráficas anteriores muestran los costos relativos de todos los componentes del cargo por beneficios públicos en 2024. Las tarifas actuales se determinan tanto por los costos del año pasado como por las estimaciones para 2025.
El proceso para determinar cuánto debe pagar cada cliente de las dos empresas de servicios públicos estatales, propiedad de inversionistas, por estos cargos es más complejo.
Los cargos por beneficios públicos se calculan por kilovatio-hora, lo que significa que un cliente terminará pagando más a medida que consume más electricidad. 
Cada primavera, las compañías presentan una declaración ante la Autoridad Reguladora de Servicios Públicos (PURA por sus siglas en inglés) que muestra sus costos reales para ofrecer la programación del año anterior, junto con sus estimaciones de los costos de dichos programas para el año siguiente. La tarifa, que debe ser aprobada por los reguladores, se calcula utilizando estas estimaciones, junto con cualquier sobrecobro o subcobro de costos del año anterior.
“Una parte significativa del cargo por beneficios públicos en las tarifas vigentes a partir del 1 de mayo proviene de las recuperaciones insuficientes del año pasado, que ocurren cuando los costos reales que las compañías eléctricas gastaron no coinciden con lo esperado, por lo que las tarifas se ajustan para cubrir esa diferencia”, declaró la Oficina de Asesoría al Consumidor en un comunicado esta semana. “Si bien las compañías registran los costos en detalle, no miden estas diferencias por programa. La Oficina de Asesoría al Consumidor considera importante que los consumidores puedan identificar con precisión qué impulsa tanto los costos como las recuperaciones excesivas o insuficientes por programa. Actualmente, en PURA estamos abogando por mejoras tanto en las metodologías contables de las compañías como en el proceso [del mecanismo de ajuste de tarifas] en su conjunto”. 
El año pasado, la mayor parte del cargo por beneficios públicos provino de un conjunto de programas para personas con dificultades económicas, como Operation Fuel y la tasa de descuento para personas de bajos ingresos, que buscan ayudar a ciertos clientes a pagar sus facturas de servicios públicos. Otra parte del cargo proviene de facturas impagas que las empresas de servicios públicos han considerado “incobrables”, y que pueden recuperar del resto de sus clientes.
Las facturas impagas pueden acumularse durante el invierno, cuando la ley de Connecticut prohíbe a las empresas de servicios públicos cortar el suministro de calefacción a clientes de bajos ingresos. Los reguladores estatales también suspendieron los cortes durante la pandemia de COVID-19.
En conjunto, el costo de los programas para personas con dificultades económicas y las facturas impagas representaron casi una cuarta parte del cargo total por beneficios públicos de Eversource y más del 45% del cargo de United Illuminating.
¿Qué hay de Millstone?
Otra parte del cargo por beneficios públicos que ha sido objeto de un intenso escrutinio es el contrato estatal, de una década de duración, para adquirir energía de la central nuclear de Millstone en Waterford. En virtud de dicho acuerdo, las empresas de servicios públicos están obligadas a comprar la mitad de la producción de Millstone al precio establecido hasta 2029. El acuerdo se cerró después de que Dominion Energy, propietaria de la planta, amenazara con cerrarla debido a la competencia de plantas de gas natural más económicas.
Cuando el precio del gas natural sube, como ocurrió al inicio de la invasión rusa de Ucrania en 2021, las empresas de servicios públicos pueden revender la energía a la red con una ganancia que se traslada a los clientes mediante un crédito en la tarifa de beneficios públicos. Sin embargo, cuando el gas es más barato, esa energía se vende con pérdidas que terminan costando más a los clientes.
Eversource ha declarado previamente que el contrato de Millstone fue responsable de la mayor parte del aumento repentino en el cargo por beneficios públicos que afectó a sus clientes el verano pasado. Sin embargo, desde entonces, las condiciones económicas más favorables han reducido el impacto de Millstone en las facturas de los clientes.
A finales del mes pasado, PURA aprobó un ajuste al cargo por beneficios públicos y otros cargos relacionados con la transmisión que se espera que reduzcan colectivamente las facturas en aproximadamente $13 al mes para el cliente promedio de Eversource y $3 para el cliente promedio de United Illuminating.
¿Por qué tan poca gente era consciente del cargo de utilidad antes?
El cargo por beneficios públicos se mantuvo prácticamente en el anonimato, incluido como parte del componente de entrega más amplio de la mayoría de las facturas, hasta 2023, cuando los legisladores aprobaron una ley que exige a las empresas de servicios públicos desglosar el costo de los cargos por beneficios públicos en una partida en las facturas de los clientes.
Como era habitual, el rediseño de la factura entró en vigor justo antes de un aumento repentino en el cargo por beneficios públicos el verano pasado, y una posterior ola de calor que disparó las facturas de los clientes. La indignación se extendió rápidamente por las redes sociales, los editoriales de los periódicos y los pasillos del Capitolio estatal, donde algunos políticos aprovecharon el tema en un año electoral.
Los Republicanos en la legislatura presentaron un plan para trasladar el costo del cargo por beneficios públicos a las arcas estatales, calificándolo de “impuesto oculto” para los usuarios de servicios públicos.
Los demócratas y el gobernador Ned Lamont han rechazado mayoritariamente esta idea, argumentando que los costos de esos programas —casi mil millones de dólares en 2024 — serían difíciles de incluir en el presupuesto sin aumentar los impuestos ni recortar el gasto en otros programas.
El copresidente del Comité de Energía y Tecnología, el Senador Estatal Norm Needleman, Demócrata por Essex, declaró esta semana que está redactando una legislación que propondría pedir prestado dinero para pagar una parte del cargo por beneficios públicos, como cuentas incobrables e inversiones en eficiencia energética, mientras que el resto del cargo se mantiene. Una copia de esa legislación aún no está disponible para el público.
¿Qué dicen las empresas de servicios públicos sobre el cargo?
Debido a que obtienen ganancias mínimas de los programas incluidos en el cargo por beneficios públicos, la postura de las empresas de servicios públicos ha variado desde la ambivalencia hasta la frustración de que la ira de los clientes se dirija hacia ellas, en lugar de hacia los legisladores que crearon los programas inicialmente.
“No nos corresponde decidir si los costos de los beneficios públicos deben incluirse en la factura de energía del cliente”, declaró Jamie Ratliff, portavoz de Eversource, en un comunicado. “Esa es una decisión de política pública”.
Ratliff añadió que la empresa apoya los esfuerzos de descarbonización de Connecticut, muchos de los cuales se financian a través del cargo por beneficios públicos, y que otros programas “ofrecen un valor crucial” a los clientes. 
“Sin embargo, reconocemos que incluir los costos de estos programas estatales en la factura de energía es regresivo para los clientes de bajos ingresos, y eliminar ese cargo de las facturas de electricidad y pagarlo a través de un sistema más progresivo reduciría la factura de un cliente residencial promedio hasta en $43 al mes”, dijo Ratliff, refiriéndose a la cantidad que paga un cliente de servicio estándar que consume 700 kilovatios-hora al mes de electricidad.
Sarah Wall Fliotsos, portavoz de United Illuminating, envió una declaración similar esta semana, señalando que el cargo por beneficios públicos proviene de programas implementados por legisladores.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A proposal to let Providence exceed Rhode Island’s tax levy cap cleared a Rhode Island House of Representatives committee Tuesday, moving the city one step closer to  the 7.5% increase city officials are seeking in total tax revenue for fiscal year 2026.
The House Committee on Municipal Government and Housing voted to move bill H6162, led by Rep. Rebecca Kislak and three other Providence Democrats, to the House floor. The bill authorizes the capital city to exceed Rhode Island’s 4% property tax levy cap. The levy comprises owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied residential properties, commercial properties, tangible properties and natural growth, or increase in value, of real estate. 
But not everyone was on board. Five committee members voted against the bill’s passage — a third of the 15-member committee. 
Kislak predicted as much. “I don’t know that it’s going to be unanimous on committee,” she said in a conversation Tuesday in the House chamber before committee meetings began. 
Providence Democratic Reps. David Morales and José Batista have previously expressed their deep dissatisfaction with the bill and voted to block its passage. Rep. Cherie Cruz, a progressive Pawtucket Democrat, and two Republicans, Rep. Richard Fascia of Johnston and Rep. Robert Quattrocchi of Scituate, resisted the bills alongside Morales and Batista.
The only Providence delegate to vote in support of the bill in committee was Democratic Rep. Raymond Hull. Anthony DeSimone, another Providence Democrat, was absent for the vote Tuesday.
Kislak’s bill would allow an increase up to 8% over the previous year. Mayor Brett Smiley and the Providence City Council have shared their plans to increase by 7.5% the total tax levy for the upcoming fiscal year to help the city weather a court-mandated public school funding settlement from November 2024. 
Smiley said in April that the next year’s budget hinges almost entirely on the tax levy hike. The city’s budgeting process is set to end in June, ahead of the new fiscal year’s start on July 1, and the City Council will need to review and revise the current spending plan if the levy hike falls through.
But the Senate Committee on Finance has yet to schedule a hearing on Sen. Sam Zurier’s companion legislation S1041, as of Thursday. The Providence Democrat introduced the bill on May 9.   
“I was not able to gain any cosponsors from the PVD Senate delegation,” Zurier wrote in a Wednesday night email. “I expect the Finance Committee to hear the bill in the next couple of weeks. I am optimistic about its chances, but there is still uncertainty.”
The mayor’s office is staying calm, said spokesperson Josh Estrella in an email Wednesday. “We do not have any concerns — we expect the bill to be heard within the next couple of weeks,” he wrote.
Estrella called the bill “critically important” to the city in order to avoid cuts to city services. He noted that similar measures have passed recently for Middletown, Warren, and New Shoreham.
Helen Anthony, chair of the City Council’s Committee on Finance, shared that view in an email Tuesday.  
“Without action by the General Assembly, the mayor’s budget cannot move forward,” Anthony wrote. “That’s why the city council passed a one-year exemption to the 4% levy increase cap.” 
Kislak said she expects House passage. “When a mayor and a unanimous City Council request something of the General Assembly, we should give it to them,” she said before the committee vote Tuesday.
A number of Providence legislators, residents and landlords feel the tax increase will disproportionately affect both owners and occupants of smaller, multifamily homes. Critics like Morales and Batisita have argued the city has not fully explored other revenue sources, such as Providence’s industrial waterfront or its myriad of tax-exempt nonprofits both big and small. 
While Smiley’s proposal would actually lower direct tax rates for fiscal year 2026, the sharp increase in Providence real estate pricing during a recent evaluation means that most properties citywide would see increases in their tax bills regardless. Single-family and condo homeowners could see a 4% tax increase. Multifamily homes with between two and five units, owner-occupied or not, could face hikes up to 16%. 
In her email message, Anthony underlined that the budget process has not yet concluded. 
“The City Council is doing our job of vetting the proposed budget in detail, but the city needs flexibility,” she wrote. “I urge the General Assembly to pass this exemption and to work with us in the months and years ahead to find creative, fair and balanced ways for our state’s cities to raise revenue without overburdening residents.”
Council spokesperson Marc Boyd said in an email Thursday that the City Council will hold a second public hearing on the budget on Monday, June 9, at 5:30 p.m. at City Hall. Residents can also discuss their concerns with their ward’s elected councilor during regularly scheduled ward meetings, Boyd said.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A coalition of groups opposing a multi-state carbon dioxide pipeline celebrated the removal of controversial language from the budget reconciliation bill passed Thursday by the U.S. House.
Last week, the groups raised alarms about a provision they said would have allowed federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law.
South Dakota passed a law earlier this year that bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines. Eminent domain is a legal process for gaining land access from unwilling owners, in exchange for compensation determined by a judge.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

Chase Jensen, a senior organizer for Dakota Rural Action in South Dakota, was among the activists who called for the provision’s removal.
“Within days of being introduced, Congress heard loud and clear that seizing federal siting authority for oil and CO2 pipelines was a nonstarter all across the nation,” Jensen said in a news release.
The groups are also calling for the repeal of a federal tax credit for carbon sequestration, but have not succeeded in getting that repeal inserted in the legislation. And they remain opposed to a “fast-track” provision in the bill that they say would allow potential gas pipeline operators to pay a fee of $10 million for expedited federal environmental reviews within a year’s time.
The proposed $9 billion, five-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline does not require that type of federal review, but it does need eminent domain for its proposed route. The project, which would transport ethanol-plant carbon emissions to an underground sequestration site in North Dakota, remains in limbo in South Dakota after the passage of the state’s eminent domain ban and two permit rejections by the state’s Public Utilities Commission.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)NEWPORT — The public can enjoy free rides to Newport’s top attractions on the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) “hop-on, hop-off” trolley service, which returns Friday, May 23.
The free rides will run through Oct. 31 on Routes 67 and 68, thanks to a total of $85,000 in funding from Discover Newport and the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island. 
About $80,000 provided by Discover Newport allows for waiving the $2 fares on Route 67, which stops at a number of the city’s tourist destinations including the Gilded Age mansions, Cliff Walk, Audrain Automobile Museum, and International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
“By providing an easy and sustainable option to get around the city we are able to help divert cars from the road during the busy summer and fall seasons,” Victoria Cimino, president & CEO of Discover Newport, said in a statement.
Cimino said the free-fare program saw record ridership of 178,000 passengers in 2024, according to Discover Newport.
A $5,000 payment from the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island covers fares on Route 68, which connects Newport’s North End to the city’s beaches.
“Making it easier for visitors to leave their cars behind while they tour the city helps improve the experience for everyone,” Rt. Rev. W. Nicholas Knisely, bishop of the diocese, said in a statement. “It helps us set an example of being good citizens in our changing climate.”
Riders can park at the Newport Transportation Center at 23 America’s Cup Avenue and pay $5 if they present a same-day trolley voucher provided by the bus operator. 
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand said he was grateful for the ongoing sponsorship, which began in 2022.
“This program significantly reduces traffic congestion, supports local tourism, and provides accessible transit for tourists, as well as residents living and working in Newport,” Durand said in a statement.
Additional information on RIPTA’s summer service in Newport can be found on the agency’s website.

Ron DeSantis signs the ""Pam Rock Act"" on May 21, 2025. (Photo via Rep. Judson Sapp's X account)Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law Wednesday bringing harsher penalties and restrictions for owners of dogs that severely injure or kill people.
The bill, known as the “Pam Rock Act,” honors a mail carrier who was mauled to death by five dogs in Putnam County in 2022. Starting July 1, owners of dogs that have attacked humans, severely injured or killed pets, or menacingly chased people will have to carry liability insurance of at least $100,000.
“This legislation is not just a policy change; it’s a proclamation to every Floridian that their safety matters,” Green Cove Springs Republican Rep. Judson Sapp, who introduced HB 593, said in a press release. “Pamela’s tragic death was a preventable loss, and with this act, we aim to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.
Additionally, owners of such dogs must present current certificates of rabies vaccinations, have an enclosure with warning signs, microchip, and spay or neuter the dog.
Animal control gains authority to confiscate dogs pending investigations of incidents and humanely euthanize dogs deemed dangerous that are surrendered.
Owners who don’t comply could face fines of up to $1,000 per violation.
If a dog that has already been classified as dangerous severely injures or kills a person, the owner commits a felony of the second degree. However, for dogs that haven’t been officially deemed dangerous, owners would still face first-degree misdemeanors if they showed disregard for their dogs’ behavior.
Rock’s family and the family of Michael Millett, an eight-year-old boy from Volusia County who was killed by a dog in January, attended the bill signing ceremony, according to the press release from Sapp’s office.

The decision was expected after  a ruling in March by a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel which determined that there was insufficient evidence that two school employees of Oxford Public Schools acted in such a way as to increase the immediate risk of danger leading up to the 15-year-old student opening fire on his classmates. 
U.S. District Court Judge Mark Goldsmith dismissed the lawsuits Tuesday with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled.
The lawsuits asserted that Shawn Hopkins, then a counselor at the school, and Nicholas Ejak, dean of students at the time, acted “recklessly” in the hours leading up to the shooting, showing “indifference” towards the impending danger that worsened the risk of tragedy.
But the judicial panel ruled that Hopkins and Ejak displayed the “opposite of callous indifference” towards concerning behaviors by the shooter and concluded their actions were geared towards mitigating risk.
The shooter, who killed four fellow students – Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Justin Shilling, 17, and Madisyn Baldwin, 17 – was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in December of 2023. 
The parents of the shooter were sentenced to 10-15 years in prison in April 2024 on four counts of involuntary manslaughter for their role in the killings.

The lawsuits stated that on the morning of the shooting, Ejak and Hopkins had been alerted that the shooter had drawn pictures of guns and bloody bodies, and had written concerning messages on a math worksheet.
The teen was promptly removed from class and Hopkins called his parents in for a meeting, where they declined to take him home for the day and Hopkins informed them that if they didn’t get their son into counseling within 48 hours, he would call Child Protective Services.
The judicial panel said that while the lawsuits contended the school was placed at greater risk because the warning had been made in front of the shooter, the actions instead showcase a concerted effort to mitigate risk by getting Child Protective Services involved.
One related lawsuit Another lawsuit that remains active was filed by Molly Darnell, an Oxford teacher who stood face-to-face with the shooter and survived. Darnell, who filed her lawsuit nearly two years after the original set which were dismissed, also alleges school officials saw clear and repeated warning signs that the shooter posed a threat to the school community and repeatedly disregarded the violence that was to come.

When asked for comment, Oxford Community Schools Executive Director of Communications Christine Smith sent Michigan Advance the following statement:
“We are aware of the federal court’s decision and understand that it may bring a range of emotions for our community. As always, our focus is on our students, staff, families, and the Oxford community as we are dedicated to fostering a safe, compassionate, and supportive environment for all.  We remain deeply committed to supporting all who were impacted by this tragedy and want to remind our community that mental health resources and support are available for anyone who needs them at oxfordschools.org/support,” Smith said.

The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month. 
And Libby won’t be the only candidate with recent experience in the Maine Legislature’s upper chamber. Former Senate President Troy Jackson announced his run for the Democratic primary earlier this week.

Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.
Among the bills Libby introduced this legislative session are measures to add political affiliation as a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act and reinstate the failed Property Tax Stabilization Program.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a major proposal to advance President Trump’s agenda on Thursday, with all Florida Republicans voting for the measure and all Democrats opposing it.
The bill will cut taxes, provide more money to the military and border security, and cut spending on Medicaid, food assistance, education, and clean energy programs. It will also add trillions to the federal deficit.
So is it good for Floridians, or a disaster?
Obviously, it depends on who you listen to. Democrats will focus on the cuts to Medicaid. The proposal will save at least $625 billion and cause 7.6 million Americans to lose their health insurance over the next 10 years, according to initial estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Those cuts include new work requirements for adults enrolled in the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion beginning in December 2026, more frequent eligibility checks, and disincentives for states to cover unauthorized migrant children.
It’s that part of the bill regarding undocumented immigrants that Republican Party of Florida chairman Evan Power focused on in a statement issued before the final vote took place.
“Time and time again, Florida Democrats choose criminal illegal migrants over American citizens,” he said. “From Darren Soto to Jared Moskowitz, they’ve all revealed themselves as radical leftists who are more interested in appeasing the open-borders crowd than protecting Floridians.”
The bill was urgent, Republicans argued, because the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which lowered income tax rates for all income groups but disproportionately benefitted the highest earners — is set to expire at the end of this year.
That allocation is why Democrats like Tampa’s Kathy Castor are calling the bill the “Billionaire Boondoggle.”
“The billionaire tax giveaway will hit Floridians particularly hard, as 3.9 million rely on Medicaid and 4.6 million rely on Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage,” she said in a statement.
“The GOP bill takes health care away from children, seniors, pregnant and postpartum women, and people with disabilities to fund a massive tax break for billionaires and corporations. This is fiscally irresponsible and morally wrong. This bill is chock full of special interest side deals and carveouts that Republicans tried to hide by having most debate in the wee hours of the morning.”
‘Promises kept’
Sarasota-area Republican Vern Buchanan, vice chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the bill is the definition of “promises made, promises kept.”
“I’m proud to have helped lead efforts on the Ways and Means Committee to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and increase the [Section] 199A small business deduction to 23% for 30 million small businesses across the country,” he said in a statement.
“Our bill includes my longtime priority to secure no tax on tips so workers can keep more of what they earn. We also eliminate taxes on overtime, increase the child tax credit for working families and provide an additional $4,000 for seniors living on a fixed income. This is a commonsense, pro-growth, pro-family, America First bill. We will not stop fighting until we get this bill across the finish line and to the President’s desk.”
Southwest Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube on X listed the provisions in the bill that he champions, including that it “[f]unds the border wall & boosts deportation of illegal immigrants.” The measure includes $46.5 billion to renew construction on the president’s border wall and billions more for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, personnel, and technology upgrades.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has already announced that it is targeting Florida Republicans Cory Mills, Anna Paulina Luna, and Maria Elvira Salazar in next year’s elections. In a statement, DCCC chair Susan DelBene said the three had “broken their promise to help the people they were expected to serve.”
“Their vote to pass a singularly devastating piece of legislation that will hurt millions of working people, all to pay for hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy, is the latest example of their complete abandonment of everyday Americans in favor of billionaires,” she said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOnly two Republicans in the House voted against the bill. One of them was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who endorsed Ron DeSantis for president in 2023. DeSantis has sounded skeptical about the proposal leading up to Thursday’s vote.
Speaking with Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia in a video posted on his X account on Tuesday night, DeSantis said the bill was “pealing back what Trump did in 2017,” referring specifically to the $10,000 cap in the state and local tax deduction (known as SALT). The bill passed on Thursday raises that deduction to $40,000 (up from $30,000 in a prior plan).
“They’re trying to put that back in so New York and California, they get a break if they have high taxes. They get to write it off on their federal taxes. That is not good policy,” the governor said, adding “that the spending levels – really, the Green New Deal is not eliminated. Most of the spending cuts are four or five years into the future, and I think it’s just different how Florida does it versus how they do it in D.C.”
If approved in the U.S. Senate, the bill would increase the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over 10 years, according to the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Budget Model.

Today’s decision could upend California’s phaseout of gas-powered cars and its decades-long battle against air pollution. Some experts say Congress’ move is illegal and is likely to trigger a legal battle.



The U.S. Senate voted today to block California’s landmark mandate phasing out gas-powered cars, dealing a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles.
The decision to revoke a waiver that the Biden administration granted to California could upend the state’s decades-long efforts and authority to clean up its air pollution — the worst in the nation — and reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
The move by the Senate — following a vote in the House last month — sets the stage for what is likely to become a high-stakes legal and political battle between California and the Trump administration. 
Republicans in the Senate and some Democrats in the House who voted in favor of blocking California’s electric car mandate said it’s costly and impractical, and prevents consumers from making their own choices. 
But Democrats in the Senate who voted against it, including California’s Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, said the tactic used by Senate Republicans is illegal and that the state’s mandate is vital to cleaning up polluted air.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has made the adoption of zero-emission cars and trucks a top priority, has denounced the move by Congress, vowing that “zero-emission vehicles are here to stay.”
“The United States Senate has a choice: Cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” Newsom said in a statement on Tuesday, before the vote.Under California’s mandate, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.
California officials may now have to rely, at least temporarily, on voluntary efforts to clean up cars and trucks in order to meet federal health standards for smog and soot. For instance, state officials could offer financial incentives or rebates to persuade manufacturers to make electric cars and consumers to buy them. The state, however, faces a $12 billion deficit.
Culminating a late-night, marathon session on Wednesday, the Senate vote highlights the growing political division over electric vehicle and air pollution policy as concerns over cost, charging infrastructure and accessibility prevent many consumers from buying them, even in California, which leads the nation in sales.
For almost 60 years, California’s standards for vehicle emissions have been central to cleaning up its air, particularly in the smoggy Los Angeles basin and San Joaquin Valley. Vehicles are still the largest sources of smog-forming gases and fine particles of soot, which can cause respiratory disorders, heart attacks and other serious and deadly health problems.
Because of its highly polluted air and large population, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards under the 1967 Clean Air Act. But before those standards can take effect, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must grant the state a waiver for each one.
Before today, over the past six decades, the EPA and Congress have never blocked any of California’s dozens of car and truck rules. Eleven other states and Washington, D.C. have already adopted a version of California’s electric car mandate, according to the Air Resources Board. 
“This is a major blow to the decades-long public health protections delivered under the Clean Air Act,” said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association’s senior director for nationwide clean air advocacy. “It is more important than ever that California and all other states…continue to cut tailpipe pollution through homegrown, health-protective policies.”
Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, of Wyoming, said Republicans reversed a highly unpopular move by the Biden administration.
“They were losers going out the door and they said ‘we’re coming after you — the American people — with our leftist dreams,’ ” Barrasso said. “This is a whole new meaning in California of fantasy land…America can’t meet these impossible standards, not next year, not in 10 years, and the American people don’t want to meet those standards.”
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, called California’s zero-emission standards for both cars and diesel trucks extreme and a threat to the economy. “I want to be clear, I have no problem with electric vehicles. Consumers should be able to purchase the vehicle of their choice, but I do have a big problem with electric vehicle mandates that replace the will of the consumer and the will of the government,” she said on the Senate floor on Wednesday night.
The Senators mostly voted along party lines. Fifty-one senators voted to rescind the electric car mandate waiver, while 44 voted against it.

“I wonder if any other member of this chamber grew up like I did, where on a pretty regular basis, we would be sent home from grade school because of the intensity and dangers of smog that settled over the San Fernando Valley, the city of Los Angeles,” Padilla said during a Senate session on Tuesday, ahead of the vote.
Schiff said on X Wednesday night that Senate Republicans are “doing the bidding of the oil industry” after Donald Trump promised to help them if they donated $1 billion to his campaign. He said it will mean “Californians and others will be breathing dirtier air, as will others around the country.”

The Senate today also plans to vote on blocking two other California rules approved by Biden’s EPA. One is the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which was enacted in 2020 and requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. The other is a 2020 regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses.
President Donald Trump has long opposed California’s unique authority to set its own limits on emissions from cars and trucks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that aimed to eliminate federal and state electric car regulations and subsidies and restore “consumer choice in vehicles.”
“Trump and his congressional allies have declared war on the environment and this is the first major legislative battle,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. 
The Senate action follows an April 30 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives that shocked environmentalists because 35 Democrats joined Republicans to block California’s electric car mandate.
Included were two California House Democrats, both of whom represent districts in the smoggiest part of the state: Rep. Lou Correa of the 46th District in northern Orange County, and newly elected Rep. George Whitesides, from the 27th District in northern Los Angeles County.
“As Americans, we all want to do our part to protect the environment. As a lawmaker, my primary job is to listen to my neighbors and respect their choices to do what is best for their families and their circumstances. That means protecting consumers’ rights to drive whatever vehicle makes sense for them and their pocketbooks,” Correa said in an emailed statement.
California’s mandate has come under fire from auto dealerships and some car manufacturers who once were more in line with the goals of aggressively requiring more sales. Sales of electric cars have undergone a bumpy road, taking off in the post-pandemic years, but they did not increase last year.
About 23% of all new cars sold in California were zero emissions during the first three months of this year, compared to 25% for all of 2024 and 2023, mostly because of a drop in Tesla sales. Californians own 2.2 million zero-emission cars; about 150 models are now sold in the state, 40% more than a year ago, according to the California Energy Commission.
John Bozzella, CEO of an alliance of automakers, in a statement earlier this month welcomed the move by Congress, saying it would “prevent the inevitable jobs and manufacturing fallout from these unachievable regulations.” 

The Biden administration’s EPA granted the waivers for California’s electric car mandate and nitrogen oxides truck rule late last year, and for the zero-emission truck rule in March 2023. Under the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA can only legally reject a waiver if it’s “arbitrary or capricious,” unnecessary for addressing air pollution or technologically infeasible due to inadequate lead time.
“Congress voted decades ago to allow California, with the nation’s most smog-choked cities, to adopt stronger vehicle air pollution standards,” Becker, a clean-air advocate, said. “This vote will set a dangerous precedent of overturning state law protecting tens of millions in California and 11 other states that have adopted its strong clean air protections.”
The Senate’s votes are likely to set up a legal challenge from the Newsom administration. Experts say the state could sue claiming improper use of the Congressional Review Act.
That law is meant to allow Congress under a new administration to revoke rules recently enacted by the previous administration. But it applies only to regulations, and experts say the waivers are not regulations so they cannot be revoked by Congress. In addition, the three waivers are already in effect, and the diesel truck one was issued more than two years ago, outside the time limits of the review act. 
The U.S. Senate’s Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office said Congress cannot review Clean Air Act waivers. The Senate voted to evade their Parliamentarian’s ruling in a 51-46 party line, procedural decision on Wednesday night.
“We’re just in a completely new territory…Congress seems to be willing to use a statute that doesn’t apply, which is highly unusual. We’ve never seen this before.”ANN CARLSON, UCLA LAW PROFESSOR
UCLA law professor Ann Carlson said Congress is violating its longstanding practices. She called the decision “totally norm-busting.”
“We’re just in a completely new territory,” she said. Congress “seems to be willing to use a statute that doesn’t apply, which is highly unusual. We’ve never seen this before.”
Carlson said by using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers are seeking to move fast —  bypassing the courts and a potential filibuster.
During the first Trump administration, California sued to reverse other actions that blocked air pollution regulations for cars.

Combined, the three regulations are designed to eliminate tons of soot and gases from cars and diesel trucks that pollute California’s air by requiring manufacturers to switch to cleaner vehicle technologies.
The stakes are high: The state still has some of the worst air pollution in the country, and failure to meet federal health standards for smog and soot could trigger economic penalties, including the loss of highway funding. People in low-income communities of color are particularly exposed to the unhealthiest air.
California is also considered a leader on climate policy, and zero-emission trucks and cars are critical to meeting its targets to phase out nearly all fossil fuels to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2045, which are mandated by state law.
Congress’ repeal of the rules follows an earlier blow to California’s efforts to clean the air. Days before Trump’s inauguration, the state Air Resources Board abandoned two of its groundbreaking standards because Trump’s EPA was unlikely to grant waivers for them.
One of them would have amped up California’s earlier zero-emission truck rule by ending the sale of new diesel trucks in 2036 and requiring large companies to convert their fleets to electric or hydrogen models by 2042.
The other abandoned rule would have required railroads in California to transition new diesel locomotives to ones powered by electricity. Under that rule, only locomotives less than 23 years old could operate in California after 2030 unless they were zero emissions.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/092523-EV-Fast-Charging-Event-LE-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 12:18:28.365788

It was the first time she had seen the lights out at the now relocated Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center’s adult medicine clinic – a harbinger of changes to come at the former shopping mall turned medical center. 
The transfigured shopping mall finds itself on the cusp of change as the University of Mississippi Medical Center, long one of the medical mall’s key stakeholders and largest lessee of space in the facility, readies itself to move many of its clinical services and reduce its square footage at the mall by about 75% in the next year. 
And with UMMC goes Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, a federally qualified health center and one of the largest providers of primary health care services to poor and uninsured people in central Mississippi. The center has subleased space at the mall from UMMC for over a decade and is one of the last providers to offer primary health care services at the mall. 
“It was just very overwhelming when I walked in the clinic,” said Reed, who began working at the medical mall as a housekeeper in 2010 and rose through the ranks to become chief operating officer of the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation. “I had never seen the lights out. And so to see the lights out, you know, it was kind of a day like, ‘this is real.’” 
UMMC declined to answer any of Mississippi Today’s questions about its decision to leave the mall, future involvement at the mall or the impact that the changes will have on patients. 
Since the late 1990s, the medical mall has stood as an access point to health care and an economic anchor in a majority-Black neighborhood in Jackson with a high concentration of people living in poverty. People from across Jackson and Mississippi have also come to the mall to receive care. 
Jackson lawmakers argue that the loss of health care services will negatively affect patients who rely on the mall for health services and on the neighborhood as a whole.

“The impact is going to be very severe on that area,” Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, told Mississippi Today. “Not only just in the face of the residents who need medical services, but in the whole aspect of an empty medical mall with no cars, or very few vehicles in there, which shows no life, which adds opportunities for crime.” 
As Reed walked through the medical mall, she greeted each person she saw: patients, shop owners and fellow staff members. She picked crumpled receipts off the floor and threw them in the waste bin. The mall has grown into a home for her, she said. 
She has watched the mall adapt before, but the loss of primary care, pediatrics and other clinical services at the medical mall is one of the most significant adjustments the medical mall has yet faced. 
“We will persevere,” she said. “… One closed door is an opportunity for another open door.” 
A long history
When Jackson Mall opened its doors in 1970, it was the first shopping mall in Mississippi, drawing customers from across the state. But it didn’t take long for business to falter with the opening of Metrocenter Mall in 1978 and Northpark Mall in Ridgeland in 1984.
By the 1990s, the mall was largely vacant, with only a few tenants left. 
“The mall was but a skeleton of its onetime glory, surrounded by a decaying neighborhood,” wrote journalist Bill Minor in a 1998 column for the Clarion-Ledger. “For more than a decade it stood as a sort of elephant’s graveyard, a gargantuan relic of urban blight and a breeding ground for crime.”
Legislators and local leaders considered a range of failed proposals to revitalize the property in the late 1980s and 1990s. Plans proffered included a public arts school, an office building for state agencies, a federal Department of Defense accounting center, a latex glove plant and a temporary jail to ease prison crowding.

But the idea for Jackson Medical Mall, Executive Director Primus Wheeler recounted, was devised in an unexpected manner: drafted on a Piccadilly cafeteria napkin during a lunch meeting of Dr. Aaron Shirley, the first Black UMMC resident and then director of Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, and Ruben Anderson, the first African American Supreme Court Justice in Mississippi. 
Anderson said it didn’t exactly happen that way, and he doesn’t remember the napkin. But a lunch at Picadilly’s – which has remained a tenant at the mall since 1970 – did launch the vision: a multi-institution medical and commercial facility that would bring together UMMC, Jackson State University and Tougaloo College. Shirley passed away in 2014.
Jackson Medical Mall Foundation – a collaborative nonprofit helmed by board members from each academic institution – purchased the crumbling mall property for $2.7 million and its first health clinic opened its doors to patients in 1997. 
Members from each academic institution remain on the foundation’s board today. The property is now worth $77 million, said Wheeler. 
The mall addressed UMMC’s urgent need at the time for additional space to expand its outpatient clinics, and gave it room to open additional services, including a diabetes center, an adult day care center and a prevention and wellness program. When UMMC clinics opened at the mall, it was the hospital’s largest presence away from its main campus on North State Street. 
UMMC has invested a total of $200 million in the medical mall over the years, according to the medical center. 
The medical mall foundation has also redeveloped the area surrounding the mall by creating affordable housing, bringing a grocery store to the area and selling an old pawn shop to a local bank aiming to help low-income people access banking services. 
The mall has served as a model for similar facilities across the country. In 2013, researchers estimated that there were 28 such facilities in the U.S. 
“It is something that wasn’t supposed to happen, wasn’t supposed to be successful, but with all the partners working together, it became a great success story,” said Wheeler.

Health clinics’ departure
When Joey Goodsell began receiving cancer treatment at Jackson Medical Mall in 2023, he was impressed by the convenience of having all of his medical appointments housed at a single location. He was also struck by a palpable sense of community at the medical mall.
“It just felt like a neighborhood,” he said. 
But he has begun to notice changes. There are fewer cars in the parking lot, he said, and he recently received a notice that he will now have to go to UMMC’s main campus for certain health services.
UMMC has leased about half of the mall’s approximately 900,000 square feet of space since 2010. After May 2026, the medical center will maintain just 100,000 square feet of space at the mall, which will include renal and dialysis, dental, infectious disease, pharmacy, addiction and HIV services.
UMMC has shared little information publicly about their decision to leave the medical mall, but a February memo distributed to legislators outlined its plans to exit the mall in phases. 
UMMC will vacate unused, storage, administrative, education and subleased spaces in the mall by the end of this year, including clinic space subleased by Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center. The comprehensive health center has already removed adult medicine, cardiology, podiatry and social services from the mall. Its pediatrics clinic will leave in June and women’s health services by October.
UMMC will relocate the cancer center, OB-GYN and pain management services to its main campus by May 2026. 
In the memo shared with legislators, UMMC said that ongoing building infrastructure challenges at the mall have resulted in disruptions to UMMC business practices, and that the medical center has experienced challenges with city services including water, crime and aging roads and bridges in the surrounding area. 
Wheeler refuted these claims, saying that the building is in “great condition” because it was gutted in the late 1990s when the medical mall was created and has undergone constant renovations since then. The facility pumps in water delivered by tanker trucks when needed and crime is “basically nonexistent.” The mall has its own full-time security staff. 
“The place is just as solid and new as when it was first built in 1970,” he said. 
Mississippi Today spoke to patients from across the state who received health care services at Jackson Medical Mall. Many said they appreciated the convenience of the medical mall’s location and parking, clean facilities and the feeling of safety at the mall. But they also said some clinical services were crammed in areas that were too small, slowing patient visits, and that the roads around the facility are in disrepair. 
Goodsell said beyond a loss of convenience, he worries that the mall’s community will be lost once health services leave. 
“There’s this community that’s built up there, and people that have invested in putting a restaurant there,” he said. “And if all these people, if all the places move out of there, their livelihood is just evaporated.”
A ‘troubling trend’
At the same time that UMMC is scaling back services at Jackson Medical Mall, it is expanding outpatient clinical services in Ridgeland – a move that reflects a trend of UMMC outpatient clinics moving to wealthier, whiter areas in the Jackson suburbs. 
UMMC opened its Grant’s Ferry clinic in Flowood, which offers primary and specialty care, in 2010.

Earlier this year, UMMC opened Colony Park South, another clinic offering primary and specialty care services, in Ridgeland. The movement of services to the new location allowed medical mall clinics to move to UMMC’s main campus, said LouAnn Woodward in an email to UMMC faculty staff and students in April. UMMC plans to open another clinic in Ridgeland next year. 
Census tract data shows that the area Jackson Medical Mall is located in has a median household income of $22,500 and that 93% of residents are Black. By comparison, Grant’s Ferry and Colony Park South have median household incomes of $92,665 and $169,844, respectively, and over 70% of residents are white.
The movement of health care services out of Jackson and into the city’s suburbs is a “very troubling trend” and will make it more difficult for Jackson residents to access health services, said Sen. John Horhn, D-Jackson, who won the city’s Democratic primary race for mayor last month.
“We’re seeing a hollowing out of health care providers … being available in Jackson, and patients are feeling the brunt of that hardship upon them,” said Horhn.
UMMC provides a free shuttle every 30 minutes to Colony Park clinic locations from its main campus in Jackson, and many outpatient clinical services are offered at UMMC’s main campus in Jackson. 
The Legislature sought to limit UMMC’s expansion outside of Jackson this year by restricting the medical center’s exemption from requiring state approval to open new educational medical facilities. The bill would limit this exemption to areas around its main campus and the Jackson Medical Mall. Gov. Tate Reeves vetoed the legislation, saying he opposed another unrelated provision in the bill.
Bringing primary health care to the mall is a priority, said Wheeler, who envisions new health services opening in the mall, the space being transformed into senior or dormitory housing and the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation implementing more of its own programs. The foundation will soon open a 500-seat auditorium in the space that formerly housed UMMC’s conference center. 
Horhn said he hopes to see the medical mall house a workforce training facility. 
The future of the medical mall remains uncertain, but whatever comes next, the foundation’s goal is to remain an anchor in the community, said Reed, the foundation’s COO. 
“We don’t want to let Dr. Shirley’s vision die,” she said. 
But it is clear the medical mall will look different than it has for the past 25 years. 
“It will not be a medical mall,” Wheeler said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/03134337/3X0A2300.jpg,,,2025-05-22 12:18:28.365788

But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”
Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”The root cause? Teacher attrition.Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.” How best to credential Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.Plagued by teacher shortages, some states turn to fast-track credentialingIn West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.” Low pay A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that South Carolina’s minimum teacher salaries will rise for next school year.

TOPEKA — “Total bunk” is what Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, called the notion from federal lawmakers that states can backfill potential cuts to public programs, which are part of a Republican budget proposal.
“We don’t have the money,” Kelly said on a press call Wednesday with Democratic governors from Colorado, Michigan and New Mexico.
The call came ahead of a determinative U.S. House vote expected this week on what’s been dubbed “one big beautiful bill.”
The budget bill could drastically cut public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kelly called the proposed bill “deeply unpopular.” Kelly, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham presented a united front of opposition to the bill.
“It is literally a tariff on every American, so that mega — the ultra rich — mega-billionaires and corporations get to have yet another tax break for many folks who already don’t pay taxes,” Lujan Grisham said.

The most recent version of the bill proposes around $700 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid subsidies, the largest in U.S. history, and $267 billion less in SNAP spending. A preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that states will have to increase spending by a combined $78 million to offset cuts. It also offers complicated tax code modifications and an elimination of taxes on tips and overtime.
The budget office wrote Tuesday that the bill increases resources for households in the highest 10% of earners, while household resources would decrease for those in the lowest 10% of earners.
SNAP in Colorado benefits 584,500 Colorado residents, or about 1 in 10 people in the state, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Most of those people are in families with children.
Lost Medicaid access would cause citizens to choose between which bills to pay and which medications households can afford, Whitmer, the Michigan governor, said.
“We should be working across the aisle to make health care better and easier to afford,” Whitmer said.
Polis, the Colorado governor, said each proposal this year to cut Medicaid has been “dangerous.” Echoing Kelly, he said states don’t have the money to mitigate cuts and rollbacks to health care.
“They’re basically asking states to do their dirty work for them,” he said.
The Republican Governors Association, in a Tuesday letter signed by 20 governors and addressed to President Donald Trump, remained in support of the bill.
“This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival,” the letter said. “It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
 Medicaid ‘a lifeline’

Staff with Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, a statewide Medicaid advocacy organization, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to urge the state’s congressional delegation to expand Medicaid access. Kansas is one of 10 states in the country that have not expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act to include low-income adults. The state’s lack of expansion has been billed by Republicans as a benefit in the face of Congress’ drastic cuts.
“That is just false,” Kelly said. “The fact of the matter is we have left $8 billion Kansas taxpayer dollars back in Washington, D.C., that’s been distributed to 40 other states that did expand Medicaid for them to take care of their people and for them to expand their economies, while we sit here in Kansas trying to make do on what we’ve got.”
Millions across the country will lose coverage as a result of Medicaid cuts, said April Holman, executive director of the alliance.
The alliance visited with people in each of Kansas’ five congressional districts, speaking with more than 200 Kansans who informed a 12-page booklet that alliance staff gave to each federal representative.
“Medicaid is not just a budget line — it’s a lifeline,” Holman said in a news release. “We came to Washington to ensure that the voices of Kansans are being heard by federal lawmakers. The proposed House cuts will undermine Medicaid and put lives at risk.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling striking down a religious charter school will stand after the nation’s highest court deadlocked on the issue.
The U.S. Supreme Court announced Thursday its justices voted 4-4 with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. A tied vote affirms the lower court’s ruling.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court decided last year that the concept of a publicly funded Catholic charter school is unconstitutional. St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would have been the first of its kind in the nation.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open the school to offer a free Catholic education to students in all parts of the state. St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and operated according to church teachings. 
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board voted in 2023 to approve opening the school. Attorney General Gentner Drummond asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, calling the school unconstitutional and a threat to religious liberty.
Catholic officials appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case April 30.
Attorneys representing the school and the statewide board contend charter schools are not truly public schools but rather private entities contracting with the state, who therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
During oral arguments in Washington, D.C., the Court appeared to be divided on the case. Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson made their doubts clear on St. Isidore while some of the conservative justices, particularly Justice Brett Kavanaugh, signaled support.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Davids' livestream)
TOPEKA — The Kansas congressional delegation split along party lines on the narrowly passed U.S. House budget bill delivering tax breaks endorsed by President Donald Trump while stripping health care and food assistance from lower-income families.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat who serves the 3rd District in the Kansas City area, said Congress and Trump should be focused on making life more affordable for families rather than lining pockets of “billionaires and big corporations” with more than $1 trillion in tax giveaways.
“I support responsible government spending. We should be cracking down on things like waste and fraud and abuse,” Davids said. “This budget is not just out of touch. It’s dangerous, irresponsible and means higher costs for hardworking Kansans.”
Specifically, Davids said the House Republican budget package would sever health coverage to 16,000 people in her congressional district by altering the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. She said a decline in the reach of Medicaid dollars would echo through communities and erode quality of life, especially in rural areas of the state where half of hospitals were at risk of shutting down.
A provision in the House bill would drop an estimated 8,000 households in her district from emergency food assistance, Davids said.
“People shouldn’t have to choose between putting food on the table and seeing a doctor,” the congresswoman said. “Folks shouldn’t have to drive hours just to get basic care because their local hospital shut down.”
 
GOP applauds vote
The bill sent to the U.S. Senate had backing of Republican U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann of the 1st District running from Dodge City to Lawrence, Derek Schmidt of the eastern Kansas 2nd District and Ron Estes of the 4th District encircling Wichita. On Thursday, the legislation passed 215-214.
Trump and GOP House leadership struggled to appease conservative holdouts who sought to pair tax cuts with deeper spending reductions along with investments in border security and the military. Democrats objected to reductions for energy, education and food assistance programs as well as Medicaid.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the deal could add $2.3 trillion to the national debt in the next decade.
Estes said the “one big, beautiful bill,” which combined 11 different pieces of legislation, was significant because it would extend tax cuts initiated during Trump’s first term as president. The legislation addressed wasteful federal spending and poured money into border security, he said.
“It’s a bill that meets the mandate provided to this Congress by the American people last November,” Estes said. “It’s a bill for the American people, and my friends on the left have only empty talking points to try and paint this legislation as something that it’s not.”
Estes said it was wrong for a “cast of deceivers” to “dupe Americans by promoting the extension of the law as a tax giveaway for millionaires and billionaires, which it isn’t.” He said Americans earning $30,000 to $80,000 annually would pay 15% less in federal taxes in 2027. That’s nearly double the percentage reduction for individuals earning more than $1 million per year, he said.
Mann said the package invested $60 billion to expand crop insurance for farmers, supported trade promotion programs in response to the agricultural trade deficit and cut $295 billion in “wasteful and fraudulent spending” within the agriculture budget.
He said the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, would be reformed to make certain able-bodied adults were working or volunteering to qualify for food aid.
“On November 5, 2024, 77 million Americans gave Washington, D.C., a mandate to get our country back on track,” Mann said. “I am hopeful the Senate will move quickly to get this bill over the finish line and look forward to President Trump signing it into law.”
 
Personal perspectives
During a news conference Wednesday hosted by Davids, Kansans explained how they would be impacted by the bill’s reduction in Medicaid funding by an estimated $625 billion during the next decade.
Lenexa residents Mark and Patty Hink, parents of 49-year-old son Brian with intellectual disabilities, epilepsy and diabetes, said Medicaid was essential to providing him around-the-clock care due to the threat of seizures. Services provided Brian under Medicaid were a lifeline to the community, Mark Hink said.
“Otherwise, these disabled adults would be homebound with parents who are aging and can’t provide the level of care that is needed,” he said.
Corey Craig, chief executive officer of Monarch Hospice & Palliative Care, said he was anxious reductions to federal spending on Medicaid would “marginalize a group that is already kind of marginalized, especially in rural communities.”
“I’m here to advocate for, at least at the minimum, keeping things the same because we are doing our best out here to try to service our rural communities,” he said. “They do deserve care, just like anyone else.”
Samantha Armistead, an Overland Park resident, has an adult sibling with intellectual disabilities enrolled in Kansas’ Medicaid program. He receives funding for adult day services that allow him to engage in meaningful work and interact with people in the community.
“Connor currently lives with our parents, and this arrangement works well for now,” Armistead said. “However, our parents are getting older. We know this arrangement is not sustainable long term. He deserves the opportunity to live a meaningful life with dignity and connection. I’m heartbroken, terrified and angry that many of our representatives in D.C. are working to deny basic care for our most vulnerable populations.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Davids-and-kansans-on-medicaid-cuts-1024x592.png,,,2025-05-22 11:03:55.131210

Thirty percent of the Massachusetts population (2.1 million residents out of 7.1 million) are on Medicaid. 
The post ‘Pay now or pay greater later’: Mass. health centers CEO warns Medicaid cuts will lead to higher costs and strain to health system  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE CROWD, gathered inside the Omni Boston hotel in the city’s Seaport district on Tuesday night, represented the various sectors of the Massachusetts economy, from health care and academia to financial services and real estate. As the attendees of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting mingled, talk inevitably turned to what’s happening in Washington, DC. They are “trying to figure out the impacts of the executive orders, the direction of the tariffs, and the wide range of decisions coming out of Congress and out of the White House, what the implications are for their various sectors,” said Michael Curry, who was among three people honored that evening by the chamber as a “Distinguished Bostonian.” Curry, 56, has spent nearly 30 years walking around Capitol Hill, Boston City Hall, and the State House on Beacon Hill. He rose through the ranks of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, becoming the president and CEO of the group in 2021. The organization represents 52 health centers that serve more than one million patients. His economic sector, health care, is affected like all the others by congressional chainsaws and White House whipsawing, and community health centers are considering partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions, with implications for their patients. “I can tell you who our patients are,” Curry said. “These are people who need access. They’re disproportionately poor. Up to 60 percent of our patients are people of color. They’re immigrants.” It’s a population in need of MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid health insurance program geared towards low-income residents. The largest program in the state’s annual budget, MassHealth is also heavily dependent on money coming from the federal government. Thirty percent of the Massachusetts population (2.1 million residents out of 7.1 million) are on Medicaid. Forty-eight percent of Massachusetts children are covered by MassHealth, according to a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation report.  With Medicaid on the chopping block as House GOP lawmakers advanced a spending bill, potentially leading to millions of people across the country losing coverage, Curry sat down with CommonWealth Beacon to delve into what’s happening in DC and how it could affect Massachusetts. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. COMMONWEALTH BEACON: Can you describe the issue at a 30,000-foot level? MICHAEL CURRY: I have to remind people I don’t care if you’re a Republican, Democrat, MAGA, super liberal, whatever the polar opposites of that spectrum would be, the bottom line is, if you don’t have health insurance, you don’t get care. Not until it’s critical to get care, which means that you have less chance of survival, which means you suffer longer. And as human beings, we should want that for no one. So our goal should be to make sure that people have a primary care provider, that they can get their cancer diagnosed at stage one instead of stage four, that they can manage that diabetes or that heart disease or that asthma, and you can’t do that without a card in your pocket, without insurance. The quote that I often say is, “Pay now or pay greater later.” The whole notion of that is, we can keep the cost down, you can get care at a health center. It’s saving by keeping you out of the emergency room or inpatient in a hospital for weeks and days, weeks and months, for your illness. Paying now or pay greater later is not just about money, but labor productivity. It’s also about the lives of the folks that we expect to be in our labs, to be driving our trains, or picking our fruit and vegetables, and teaching our classes. CWB: President Trump met with House Republicans and said basically don’t mess with Medicaid. But it seems like there are moves to still cut or touch it. How do you interpret that? CURRY: We have to all come to a common definition on what “touch” means. I think there’s a fundamental disagreement on what would be undermining and disruptive to Medicaid as we know it today, in a way that is not in the best interest of Americans. And part of that is work requirements, any administrative complexities that drive people off coverage, that they’ll get lost and again, pay now or pay greater later. We’ll see them elsewhere, at higher cost settings, or they’ll prematurely die. CWB: What’s the issue with work requirements? CURRY: Most people on Medicaid already work. Many jobs don’t pay you well enough to afford insurance. We know that there is a pervasive problem in this country of underinsurance or employers who avoid providing health coverage because there’s a pretty high cost to provide health insurance for your employees. And then you add the average employer, there’s a 10 percent increase for employers every year on insurance coverage that you offer your employees. To some degree that’s not even sustainable, right? So more and more of your overall budget, nonprofit and for-profit, is health insurance coverage. The concern is that if you start tightening the requirements, and you start adding too many administrative complexities, like work requirements, people churn off of Medicaid, and now they’re uncompensated care. So the worst scenario is that a person no longer has Medicaid, and now we’re still paying for it anyway, because now they’re showing up more sick and in settings where states end up having to – as our state has the health safety net – to cover that care through that mechanism, which is already underfunded and in financial distress. Now you’re driving more people to episodic and emergency care, which is not what we want to do as a system. And work requirements, it won’t increase employment, it’ll just decrease coverage.  CWB: What would the federal cuts mean for Massachusetts if they go through? CURRY: It would be unsustainable without the federal partnership, the federal funds. So, you cut programs, right? You might cut benefits, right? Oral health under Medicaid is an optional program, optional coverage. And states like Massachusetts could choose to not cover oral health, which means that that’s an implication for health centers [which also provide dental care], because now our patients couldn’t go and get coverage or care, then have their insurance provide the health center with reimbursement for their oral health.The post ‘Pay now or pay greater later’: Mass. health centers CEO warns Medicaid cuts will lead to higher costs and strain to health system  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Michael-Curry-MassGovernor-Flickr-feed.jpg?fit=1024%2C662&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 11:03:55.131210

In April, the Trump administration paused funding to the center, which is the nation’s largest and longest-running training program for early-career scientists and hub for research on heart disease in African Americans. 
In total, 36 college students lost their scholarships. Five staff members, including White, lost their jobs. As a result of the cuts, the center planned to end its undergraduate training program later this summer. 
Then came the whiplash. The administration reversed its decision in May. Relief. 
White is “cautiously optimistic” about the $1.7 million grant’s renewal and the future of this program that has been the crown jewel for this small, private, historically Black liberal arts college in Jackson, Mississippi. 
“It’s been a roller coaster of emotions ranging from gratefulness to frightening,” White said. 
Since January, federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation have slashed millions of dollars in grants and contracts to comply with federal directives to end research on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the study of misinformation. 
Some colleges have lost federal funds in President Donald Trump’s first 100 days of office. Others are trimming already lean budgets and launching fundraising campaigns to prepare for the worst, according to Inside Higher Ed.  
While Trump has signed executive orders supporting HBCUs to “promote excellence and innovation,” the cuts to federal agencies and programs have had a chilling effect at these schools, which are already dealing with decades of underfunding. HBCU professors and graduates say the losses have greater potential for harm and eliminate professional opportunities for students. 
Millions of dollars are potentially at risk. This year, Jackson State University received $7.2 million in federal research from NIH. Tougaloo College received $10 million.  
Low hanging fruit
White and other professors believe their grants were pulled because of words like  “race” or “gender” in the award’s abstract. 
“[These federal agencies] are going for the low-hanging fruit,” Bryon D’Andra Orey, political science professor at Jackson State University, said. “Our grants are on the chopping blocks simply because they are under this umbrella of D.E.I.”

Orey received an email in late April from JSU’s Office of Research that his $510,000 National Science Foundation Build and Broaden (B2) grant was terminated. In 2021, the grant was awarded to study the emotional and psychological toll of racial discrimination and trauma on African Americans participating in democratic and political activities such as voting and activism. 
The research produced new insights on understanding racial disparities in the United States. It has also led to collaborations with prominent research institutions such as the University of Michigan. The collaboration brought resources, professional development, staffing and support that JSU lacked. 
Since the grant was awarded four years ago, 21 students have taken the seminar and graduated. It has provided exceptional learning opportunities and exposed students to new career possibilities, Orey said. 
“I’ve had students who have taken my classes apply to law schools, competitive Ph.D.  programs at Ivy leagues and get into congressional public policy and advocacy work,” Orey said. “They get to see career avenues other than federal government jobs.” 
A whole new world 
Michael J. Cleveland, a graduate of Tougaloo College, benefited from these types of programs and mentorship. Cleveland trained as an undergraduate from 2014-2017 through the Jackson Heart Study program. He had opportunities to shadow medical professionals at hospitals and clinics.

In his sophomore year, he decided becoming a doctor wasn’t for him. Cleveland received guidance from his professors to pursue apprenticeships in community and public health research in Jackson. 
The course work and curriculum as an undergraduate set him apart from his peers at Morehouse School of Medicine when Cleveland applied to get his master’s degree in public health. It eventually led him to become the first African American healthcare executive administrative fellows at Salem Health Hospital and Clinic System in Oregon. 
The need for public health professionals of color in healthcare and medical settings is more important than ever, Cleveland said. 
“Being a JHS scholar opened me up to a whole new world,” said Cleveland, who is now the chief operating officer of Care Alliance Health Center, a community health center in Cleveland, Ohio. “I’ve accomplished all of who I am at 30 because of this program.”  
Future of research
Last month, Trump signed a new executive order that pledged to continue two existing White House efforts to support HBCUs during his first term in office. 
The White House Initiative on HBCUs aims to increase funding, improve infrastructure and provide access to professional development opportunities for students in fields such as technology, healthcare and finance. And the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs will include appointed members who will sit in the U.S. Department of Education and is meant to guide the administration’s efforts on supporting these institutions. 
“[The administration] is saying something on paper and in theory, but their actions aren’t aligned,” White said. “You can’t say you support [HBCUs] when you are cutting student loans, financial aid, research and other programs that support these students and institutions.” 
While the future of this program remains unclear, she warned of the larger, overlooked impacts of potential cuts to this undergraduate program: It could mean the end to a unique collaboration between two HBCUs and a predominantly white institution in the state. 
When the Jackson Heart Study began in the late 90s, it brought Jackson State University, a public HBCU, Tougaloo College and University of Mississippi Medical Center, a predominantly white medical school, together to create a first-of-its-kind partnership. 
The goal was to provide funding in research for the colleges, and promote careers in public health to students. Eliminating this partnership could undermine NIH’s credibility and a symbol of racial progress in Mississippi, White said. 
“We’ve spent more than two decades focusing on overcoming that legacy of medical mistrust for people in this city,” White said. “A move like this could set back decades of science and health research for this country. I just want us to ask, what are we doing about this?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/06160710/Wendy-White-3.jpg,,,2025-05-22 11:03:55.131210

But both were in Nevada when Las Vegas was an epicenter for the wildly irresponsible mortgage backed derivatives market that did so much to cause the Great Recession that hit Nevada harder and longer than any other state.
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act is what deregulated and hence led to the explosion — and then implosion — of the  derivatives market.
Which is to say of all the U.S. senators, the two from Nevada should be especially wary of approving weak federal regulations that promote the growth of exotic financial instruments because an industry told them to.
And yet here we go again.
Stable genius
Early this week, Cortez Masto and Rosen were among 16 Senate Democrats voting with all the Republicans to advance the GENIUS Act, a Trump-endorsed gift to the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto-folk are eager to see the bill enacted in the current Congress because they fear Democrats will regain control of the U.S. House in next year’s midterm elections, the industry’s window of opportunity will close, and the legislation will never make it to Trump’s desk. 
(The industry may be underestimating congressional Democratic inclination to curry favor with, or at least try not to upset, extremely deep-pocketed industry political action committees, but I digress).
The legislation will promote the growth of a particular strain of cryptocurrency, stablecoin, by accelerating its integration with the U.S. financial system, while exempting it from regulatory requirements and consumer protections administered by (what’s left of) the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Earlier this month, all the Senate Democrats, joined by two Republicans, temporarily blocked the legislation. At the time, Democrats cited the bill’s failure to rein in the ongoing and unprecedented level of White House corruption made possible by Donald Trump and his family’s entry into the cryptocurrency industry, including stablecoin, enabling billionaires, dictators, and unsavory characters worldwide to enrich Trump in exchange for favors right there on their phones.
Yet the slightly revised version of the legislation Cortez Masto, Rosen and 14 other Senate Democrats accepted Monday “does nothing—nothing—to rein in the President’s crypto corruption,” said Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in a floor speech rallying a majority of her fellow Democrats to vote against the legislation.
“This is not the first time Congress listened to the financial industry and created a weak regulatory regime for a new, innovative financial product,” Warren warned her colleagues. “We’ve seen this story before, and we know how it ends.” 
Warren, whose sharp critique of policies that led to the Great Recession heightened her national profile in the late aughts, reminded the senators of the Commodities Futures Modernization Act which passed during the last year of the Clinton Administration. 
At that time people said “surely some kind of regulatory framework was better than nothing,” Warren noted, “so Congress created a weak set of rules that was loaded with loopholes – just as the industry wanted. The result was a disaster: derivatives moved from the edge of the financial system to the center of it.”
“Now we are back, doing the same thing yet again,” Warren said.
As if underscoring Warren’s point — that people are yet again saying something’s better than nothing — Cortez Masto said in a statement provided by her office Wednesday that Congress needs “to do more to regulate cryptocurrencies” and the GENIUS Act is “the first step to ensure stablecoins issued in the United States are not used to scam or defraud people or facilitate illicit finance, while also providing regulatory clarity our domestic industry needs to innovate here at home.”
Similarly, Rosen’s office provided a statement Wednesday saying cryptocurrency “is an emerging industry that is in urgent need of regulation” and Rosen  “voted to advance bipartisan legislation to open the door for regulating cryptocurrency. This bill is not the only action Congress should take on crypto regulation, but it is an important step to protect consumers and support America’s innovation.”
Both statements from Nevada’s senators echo the industry narrative, also fully embraced by Trump, that stablecoin and other variations of crypto are a vital innovation that must be promoted in the name of the national interest.
And both statements, again echoing the industry narrative, fail to clearly explain why that is.
All hype, no pulp
Cryptocurrency is undoubtedly a growth industry. But as it increasingly integrates into the financial system, one signature characteristic it brings along is extreme volatility. (Related note: Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange, became the first exchange to be added to the S&P 500 this week, so there’s a good chance crypto is now in your retirement fund.)
In addition to volatility — and of course crypto bros, who will be convening in Las Vegas next week for the Super Bowl of crypto — cryptocurrency is also famous for money laundering and fraud schemes. (On comparably rare occasions it also serves its long ago originally advertised use, as a legitimate alternative form of payment for a product or a service.)
But far and away its largest use is as just another speculative investment, like, oh, orange juice futures, except with no correlation to anything that exists in the material world; for breakfast, nobody orders a glass of fresh squeezed hype.
When members of Congress talk about innovation and, as Rosen put it, “an emerging industry,” they are implying there is some magical but practical and immensely useful economic function only crypto can do.
Meanwhile, the wider world awaits clearly articulated instruction on what indispensable (yet legal) thing crypto can do that oldy timey money can’t, and why it isn’t doing it already. 
To be fair, there is one function that, while not new or unique — every industry does it — is something the crypto industry has proven it can do uniquely well: Raise money to spend against candidates that don’t support the industry’s agenda.
As many of you will recall, the cryptocurrency industry’s PAC raised more money during the 2024 election cycle than any other industry in the U.S.
A common critique is that congressional Democratic support for the cryptocurrency industry’s political and regulatory agenda, which is also Trump’s agenda, is driven not by a vision of crypto playing a beneficial role in the economy and making the world a better place, but fear of the industry’s campaign spending. 
Cortez Masto and Rosen were asked to respond to that critique. In their statements provided by their offices, the request was ignored.
The GENIUS Act still needs to survive another Senate vote. Cortez Masto and Rosen are obviously voting for it. Maybe they think there’s no way playing laissez faire footsy with investment erotica could upend the entire financial system and crash the economy yet again, let alone so soon. What are the odds?
Maybe they’re right.
But that still leaves another disturbing matter, a broader concern that isn’t crypto-specific. 
People who didn’t vote for Trump (a majority of voters and a supermajority of the population) have been wondering if and when Democrats might start standing up to him in an effective way. Democrats have sworn repeatedly they will do that, but have also lamented that they have been presented precious few opportunities to actually thwart Trump because Republicans control all the things.
The GENIUS Act needs to pass the Senate with 60 votes. It’s an outstanding chance for Democrats to block a Trump/Republican agenda item that most Senate Democrats think is not in the nation’s best interest. 
But some Senate Democrats are going to vote for it and give Trump the win anyway. That includes both senators from Nevada, who more than any other U.S. senators should know better.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-5-22-25-at-5.51-AM-1024x603.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 10:11:45.440832

New Mexico put forward draft rules for its clean fuels program, and officials hope hearings will begin later this year. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)As the Trump administration attacks states’ efforts to combat climate change, New Mexico pushes ahead with its plans to create a market place for clean fuels.
Last week, the New Mexico Environment Department proposed the Clean Transportation Fuel Program to the state’s Environmental Improvement Board, which, if approved, would be the fourth one in the country.
A public comment period on the 112-page draft rule is expected to start in mid-June, according to an NMED news release, with a request to schedule the required hearings this fall.
The draft rule follows the New Mexico Legislature’s 2024 passage of House Bill 41, which mandated the environment department create a market to incentivize less vehicular pollution and the state reduce emissions by 20% by 2030 and 30% by 2040. The law sets a deadline of July 1, 2026 for the adoption of rules creating the marketplace.
Officials and proponents say the program is meant to reduce pollution over time by allowing cleaner fuel companies — using electricity or diesel made from refined plants like corn or soybeans — to sell credits to sellers of more polluting fuels. In its proposed rule, NMED created an objective measure, called the clean fuel standard, to determine the total greenhouse emissions of a fuel.
The standard measures the “well-to-wheel” intensity, said Michelle Miano, who leads NMED’s Environmental Protection Division.
“It includes the drilling of the well, taking up petroleum or fossil products from the well, what it takes to refine, take to market and go to sale,” she said. “We are calculating the carbon intensity of that entire lifecycle and we’re doing that for all the different kinds of fuels.”
Miano said the marketplace meets the goals of diversifying the economy; working to curb pollution; and incentivizing fuel producers to reduce their carbon footprints.
New Mexico would be the fourth state to adopt this kind of program, behind California, Washington and Oregon. Miano said the program will be entirely state-run, and doesn’t require federal input.
“This is a state program and state law, so no matter what happens at the federal level, this program will remain in place so that the economic benefits are received by New Mexico, regardless of federal movements,” Miano said.
Transportation ranks as New Mexico’s second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions behind oil and gas production, according to Travis Madsen, the transportation program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a nonprofit that advocates for electrification across the intermountain West.
“Most of that is burning petroleum in cars and trucks,” he told Source NM. “And in order to reduce those emissions, we need to move our transportation and energy supplies towards less emitting, or zero-emitting energy sources — that’s what the clean fuel standard aims to do.”
Madsen said the efforts to use renewables on the electrical grid and the further adoption of electric cars at home could translate to cost-savings.
“Using electricity instead of gasoline can provide some major savings on fuel costs for residents or businesses, and I’m expecting that the net effect of this policy is going to be that New Mexicans save money,” he said.
Madsen referenced recent proposals from House Republicans to gut clean energy tax credits and pollution rules as a driving reason for New Mexico to create the program.
“I think the federal government is definitely not moving toward emission reductions and is probably moving away. That would push things in the wrong direction and make it harder for New Mexico to achieve those pollution reduction goals that it set out,” he said. “I think it’s even more important now that New Mexico pursues actions that it can take on its own without the help of the federal government — the clean fuel standard is a prime example of that.”

In support of this, The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), along with state, county and local agencies are helping communities mitigate against threats to public safety posed by hurricanes and other tropical storms.
The World Meteorological Organization confirmed 2024 as the warmest on record, capping ten straight years of record-breaking rising land, ocean and sea surface temperatures. The continued impact of climate change, above normal temperatures and precipitation along with rising sea levels, places the low-lying state of Delaware at particular risk for potential loss of life and significant damage to property and infrastructure. Heavy rains and storm surges, gale-force winds and flooding from severe weather events can have a devastating impact on coastal and inland communities. Water poses the biggest risk for loss of life, and storm surge is the leading cause of all hurricane-related fatalities, followed by inland flooding due to excessive rainfall.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that the 2025 Atlantic Hurricane season will deliver higher than average activity with an above average likelihood of major hurricane landfall along the Eastern Coast of the United States. With increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, there also remains the possibility of a named storm developing ahead of the official start of the season. In seven of the last 10 years, at least one named storm has formed before June 1. By way of comparison, there were only three years with early named storms between 2005 to 2014. This year Colorado State University predicts 17 named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes (category three or higher) which is greater than the 30-year average for hurricanes and storms.
As hurricane activity increases in both frequency and intensity, related storm surges and flooding threaten public safety, homes and businesses. DEMA urges everyone to visit www.PrepareDE.org for resources on how to successfully weather this year’s hurricane season.

“The time to mitigate against storm-related damage is before Hurricane season begins,” said A.J Schall, Delaware Emergency Management Agency Director. “PrepareDe.org empowers everyone to plan for all potentialities by being informed and storm ready. While the fallout from extreme weather can be unpredictable, there are simple ways everyone can plan for the unexpected – have a meetup plan for families that kids understand; shore up your home, windows, and landscaped environments; review, print and back up insurance documents, and make a go bag with basic necessities. Always follow evacuation orders and check in with your neighbors and the elderly who may need assistance in emergency situations.”

MAKE A PLAN: preparede.org/make-a-plan
• Information is power. Find your evacuation zone at Know Your Zone or flood risk with the Flood Planning Tool.
• Protect your family and home with flood insurance. Most homeowner policies do not cover flooding, and a policy can take up to 30 days to go into effect. Learn more at Floodsmart.gov.
• Hurricane housekeeping means decluttering drains and gutters; inspecting and trimming trees and dead limbs in addition to securing loose items.
• Plan what to do if a hurricane is coming, how to contact and reunite with family, and know your county emergency plans (see Resources).
• Practice makes prepared! Once you have a plan, review it to ensure everyone knows what to do. Include children in your plan and help them practice it. Read Prepare with Pedro at ready.gov.
• Account for seniors and those with special needs with the DHSS Office of Preparedness and its Preparedness Buddy. The University of Delaware has additional resources at allreadyde.org/
• Because Pets are our family, access resources at the Office of Animal Welfare and Delaware Animal Response Program.
BUILD A KIT: preparede.org/build-a-kit.
• Gather supplies for at least one week for each family member of non-perishable food, water, medications, infant formula, and diapers for small children. This includes Pet supplies like extra food and water, carriers, pet meds and other items they may need.
• Include a first aid kit, flashlights, radios, matches in a waterproof container, and batteries.
• Keep a small amount of cash, in the event that ATMs are not working.
• Consider a generator or other backup. Only use a generator OUTDOORS and away from windows.
• Have a cell phone power bank or portable car charger and charge phones beforehand.
• Make sure gasoline tanks are filled and replenish propane tanks for outdoor grills.
• Check on neighbors to ensure they are safe, prepared and have the necessary supplies.
• Review insurance coverage and document property with photographs in case of an insurance claim.
• Make secure digital copies of all documents and keep original documents in a safe, waterproof container in case of power and communication outages.
STAY INFORMED: preparede.org/stay-informed.
• Sign up for emergency alerts through the Delaware Emergency Notification System (DENS). If an evacuation notice is issued, it will be sent by text, phone call, email, and social media.
• Download the FEMA app to receive National Weather Service alerts for up to three locations.
• Tune in to Local TV or radio to learn about storms and potential evacuations for your specific zone.

In its complaint against the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, the Mackinac Center points to a provision in the state constitution barring lawmakers from allocating state funds for “local or private purposes” unless the provisions receives support from two-thirds of the members in each chamber of the Legislature. 
With the Fiscal Year 2025 budget, which runs through September 30, receiving support from 56 of the 110 members of the House of Representatives and 21 of the 38 members of the state Senate, the budget did not reach the two-thirds mark in either chamber. 
While the lack of support should bar the budget from including appropriations for public or private purposes, the budget contains earmarks for Jimmy John’s Field in Utica, which is owned by a private company, and Jackson Field in Lansing, which is owned by the city. 
The complaint argues these grants are unconstitutional and illegal, and asks the court to declare them null and void. It also requests an injunction to block the funds from being distributed. If any of the funds have been disbursed, the complaint asks for the money to be recalled and placed in the state treasury. 
As an alternative, the complaint says the court could craft its own remedy to right the situation and prevent “future evasions of constitutional requirements.”
A LEO spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

A new bill introduced on the last day of the Alaska Legislature's 2025 session would bar hard-rock metals mining in the Bristol Bay watershed. (Photo provided by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency)Mere hours before he banged his gavel to adjourn this year’s session of the Alaska House of Representatives, Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, introduced a bill to bar metals mining from the Bristol Bay watershed.
The measure, House Bill 233, would expand on the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 decision prohibiting permitting of the controversial Pebble Project in the region. The Biden administration action, which followed up on a process started in the Obama administration, invoked a rarely used provision on the Clean Water Act to prevent development of the huge open-pit copper and gold mine planned for the region upstream from salmon-rich Bristol Bay.
Edgmon’s bill would ban all metallic sulfide mining in the area designated as the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve, which encompasses state land in the Bristol Bay watershed.
Metallic sulfide mining, also known as hard-rock mining, is the type of mining that extracts elements like gold and copper from acid-generating rocks classified as sulfides. When these sulfides are processed, they commonly cause acid to drain out. It is a method distinct from placer mining, which sifts out metals from loose sediments. The copper and gold that would be produced at the Pebble project is held in sulfide ore and would be extracted through hard-rock mining.
The Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve was established by the Legislature in 1972 to prevent oil and gas development in the region. The effort was led by Jay Hammond, who was president of the state Senate at the time. He later became governor.
Under House Bill 223, the Hammond-championed prohibitions on petroleum development would be expanded to mining. The justifications for the 1972 action “also warrant new protections to prevent hardrock mining activities that would risk polluting the region’s river systems, ground water, aquifer systems,” as well as any drainages that connect to Bristol Bay’s surface water, the bill’s text says.
Edgmon is from the Bristol Bay region.
The bill will be considered next year, along with other measures still pending in the 34th Legislature.
Alannah Hurley, executive director of a consortium of Native tribal governments in the Bristol Bay region, said the bill would provide extra protection for EPA’s action. That protection is needed because of “the uncertainty that we’re continuing to face” from litigation pressed by Pebble’s sponsors, Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. and the Pebble Limited Partnership it owns, said Hurley, who is with United Tribes of Bristol Bay, an organization that has long opposed the Pebble project.
Northern Dynasty and the Pebble Limited Partnership have sued to overturn the 2023 EPA determination, and the case remains active. The state of Alaska, at the direction of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, has also sued the federal government over the action.
Hurley said that beyond upholding the EPA determination, the bill would prevent the development of other metals mines in the region, Hurley said. There are about 20 active claims that could be developed into large metals mines, though not as large as the proposed Pebble project, she said.
If the bill passes, “we wouldn’t have to face 20 other mining claims piecemeal over who knows how many decades,” she said.

	While the bill is new, the effort behind it goes back a long time, Hurley said.
“This is something the tribes have been talking about for years. We need the EPA protection, but we also need legislation to really protect the watershed,” she said.
A legislative effort similar to House Bill 233 was mounted on the federal level by former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska. She introduced the Bristol Bay Protection Act a year ago to codify the EPA’s Clean Water Act determination barring a Pebble-type mine from being permitted in the Bristol Bay watershed. The act died in committee, and Peltola lost her seat in November to current Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska.
The tribes and other Pebble opponents have thus turned their attention to the Legislature now that Peltola is no longer in the U.S. House, Hurley said.
“The fact that she wasn’t reelected has frustrated expectations that we can make any progress with Congress,” Hurley said.
There have been previous efforts in the Alaska Legislature, as well. In 2015, Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, introduced a measure, House Bill 119, that would require legislative approval for any large-scale metallic sulfide mine in the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve. It failed to reach the House floor.  Josephson introduced a similar bill, House Bill 14, in 2017. It also died in committee.
Josephson is a co-sponsor of Edgmon’s new bill.
Representatives of Northern Dynasty and the Pebble Limited Partnership were not available to comment on the new bill.
Dunleavy, who has been supportive of the Pebble project, has not taken a position, said his spokesperson, Jeff Turner. The bill was just introduced, so the governor has not had time to review it, Turner said.
“As a general rule, the Governor’s office does not comment on legislation until it has passed and been transmitted to his office,” he said by email.

California’s ambitions to phase out gas-powered cars and curb air pollution will likely hit a major roadblock today.
CalMatters’ climate reporter Alejandro Lazo reports that the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote this morning on halting California’s electric vehicle mandate, following approval by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month. If the Senate revokes California’s waivers as expected, it could kick off a high-stakes legal and political battle between the state and President Donald Trump’s administration. 
The Senate debated the measures late into the night but put off their vote until this morning. At stake are three waivers California secured last year from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden. The most controversial one allowed the state to implement its requirement that all new cars sold in California must be zero-emissions by 2035; nearly all zero-emission cars are electric. The two others phase out new diesel trucks and clean up smog-forming emissions from trucks and buses.
Trump has repeatedly denounced the state’s mandate phasing out gas-powered cars, and tried to void California’s authority to limit car emissions during his first term. Even before Trump returned to the White House, the prospect of the waivers being blocked prompted state regulators in January to walk away from their plan to phase out diesel trucks.
Republican lawmakers from both Congress and California oppose the mandate, citing high costs to consumers, a lack of charging infrastructure and an unrealistic timeline. Some House Democrats, however, joined their GOP colleagues in opposition to the policy, including two from California.
But some experts, including the independent, nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian, say that Congress’ tactic — using the Congressional Review Act to rescind the waivers — is not allowed under the law. That could lay the groundwork for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration or others to sue.
For over 50 years California has set its own stricter auto emissions standards because of carve-outs in the federal Clean Air Act. The arrangement is essential for the state — which has some of the worst air quality in the country — to combat air pollution. These exclusions are granted through federal waivers, which California must obtain before implementing each of its own standards.

Can a $10 fee stop community college fraud?

California community colleges have struggled for several years with scammers who use artificial intelligence bots to pose as students in order to obtain millions of dollars in financial aid. The issue has only grown worse in the last year, so colleges are considering a new tactic: Charging an application fee, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
On Tuesday the board of California’s community colleges voted to require all applicants to now verify their identities, which is currently just an option. The board also directed staff to look into an application fee policy — which many say should not exceed $10 — while stopping short of approving a fee altogether. 
California community college leaders face increased scrutiny from state and federal lawmakers to address fraud. California Community Colleges Chancellor Sonya Christian cited an April CalMatters story as part of the reason the system is ramping up its efforts.

Judge halts fed’s efforts to deport laborers without hearing

Following a court ruling, the Trump administration signaled it would back off its efforts to fast-track the deportation of three Guatemalan day laborers who were detained in California.
As CalMatters’ reporters explain, last month Border Patrol agents arrested the day laborers during an immigration raid in Pomona — about 200 miles north of the Mexico border. The administration planned to deport the workers quickly by retooling an existing policy that enables expedited deportations near the border and for those who recently arrived in the U.S.
But a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order last week, prohibiting the federal government from deporting the workers.
On Monday the feds said the workers were no longer being processed for rapid removal. The workers still haven’t been released from custody, but are now expected to have the opportunity to argue their case before a judge.
Last week’s ruling comes nearly a month after another judge temporarily barred Border Patrol agents in El Centro from conducting warrantless immigration sweeps.

California students who want to be scientists,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/05/nih-science-research-california/,"At least 24 University of California and California State University campuses lost training grants that provided their students with annual stipends of approximately $12,000 or more.","In summary
At least 24 University of California and California State University campuses lost training grants that provided their students with annual stipends of approximately $12,000 or more.


This spring, the National Institutes of Health quietly began terminating programs at scores of colleges that prepared promising undergraduate and graduate students for doctoral degrees in the sciences. 
At least 24 University of California and California State University campuses lost training grants that provided their students with annual stipends of approximately $12,000 or more, as well as partial tuition waivers and travel funds to present research at science conferences. The number of affected programs is likely higher, as the NIH would not provide CalMatters a list of all the cancelled grants.
Cal State San Marcos, a campus in north San Diego County with a high number of low-income learners, is losing four training grants worth about $1.8 million per year. One of the grants, now called U-RISE, had been awarded to San Marcos annually since 2001. San Marcos students with U-RISE stipends were often able to forgo part-time jobs, which allowed them to concentrate on research and building the skills needed for a doctoral degree.
The cuts add to the hundreds of millions of dollars of grants the agency has cancelled since President Donald Trump took office for a second term.
To find California campuses that lost training grants, CalMatters looked up known training grants in the NIH search tool to see if those grants were still active. If the grant’s award number leads to a broken link, that grant is dead, a notice on another NIH webpage says. 
The NIH web pages for the grants CalMatters looked up, including U-RISE, are no longer accessible. Some campuses, including San Marcos, Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Los Angeles and UC Davis, have updated their own websites to state that the NIH has ended doctoral pathway grants. “We’re losing an entire generation of scholars who wouldn’t have otherwise gone down these pathways without these types of programs,” said Richard Armenta, a professor of kinesiology at San Marcos and the associate director of the campus’s Center for Training, Research, and Educational Excellence that operates the training grants.
At San Marcos, 60 students who were admitted into the center lost grants with stipends, partial tuition waivers and money to travel to scientific conferences to present their findings.
From loving biology to wanting a doctoral degree 
Before the NIH terminations, Marisa Mendoza, a San Marcos undergraduate, received two training grants. As far back as middle school, Mendoza’s favorite subjects were biology and chemistry. 
To save money, she attended Palomar College, a nearby community college where she began to train as a nurse. She chose that major because it would allow her to focus on the science subjects she loved. But soon Mendoza realized she wanted to do research rather than treat patients.
At Palomar, an anatomy professor introduced her to the NIH-funded Bridges to the Baccalaureate, a training grant for community college students to earn a bachelor’s and pursue advanced degrees in science and medicine.
“I didn’t even know what grad school was at the time,” she said. Neither of her parents finished college.The Bridges program connected her to Cal State San Marcos, where she toured different labs to find the right fit. At the time she was in a microbiology course and found a lab focused on bacteria populations in the nearby coastal enclaves. The lab was putting into practice what she was learning in the abstract. She was hooked.
“It just clicked, like me being able to do this, it came very easily to me, and it was just something that I came to be very passionate about as I was getting more responsibility in the lab,” Mendoza said.

From Palomar she was admitted as a transfer student to San Marcos and more selective campuses, including UCLA and UC San Diego. She chose San Marcos, partly to live at home but also because she loved her lab and wanted to continue her research. 
She enrolled at San Marcos last fall and furthered her doctoral journey by receiving the U-RISE grant. It was supposed to fund her for two years. The NIH terminated the grant March 31, stripping funds from 20 students. For a school like San Marcos, where more than 40% of students are low-income enough to receive federal financial aid called Pell grants, the loss of the NIH training awards is a particular blow to the aspiring scientists. The current climate of doctoral admissions is “definitely at a point where one needs prior research experience to be able to be competitive for Ph.D. programs,” said Elinne Becket, a professor of biological sciences at Cal State San Marcos who runs the microbial ecology lab where Mendoza and other students hone their research for about 15 hours a week.
San Marcos doesn’t have much money to replace its lost grants, which means current and future San Marcos students will “100%” have a harder time entering a doctoral program, Becket added. “It keeps me up at night.”
Research is ‘a missing piece’
In a typical week in Becket’s lab, Mendoza will drive to a nearby wetland or cove to retrieve water samples — part of an ongoing experiment to investigate how microbial changes in the ecosystem are indications of increased pollution in sea life and plants. Sometimes she’ll wear a wetsuit and wade into waters a meter deep. The next day she’ll extract the DNA from bacteria in her samples and load those into a sequencing machine. The sequencer, which resembles a small dishwasher, packs millions or billions of pieces of DNA onto a single chip that’s then run through a supercomputer a former graduate student built.  “Once I found research, it was like a missing piece,” Mendoza, a Pell grant recipient, said through tears during an interview at Cal State Marcos. Research brought her joy and consumed her life “in the best way,” she added. “It’s really unfortunate that people who are so deserving of these opportunities don’t get to have these opportunities.”

The origins of the San Marcos training center date back to 2002. Through it, more than 160 students have either earned or are currently pursuing doctoral degrees at a U.S. university.
The grant terminations have been emotionally wrenching. “There had been so many tears in my household that my husband got me a puppy,” said Denise Garcia, the director of the center and a professor of biological sciences.Garcia recalls that in March she was checking a digital chat group on Slack with many other directors of U-RISE grants when suddenly the message board lit up with updates that their grants were gone. At least 63 schools across the country lost their grants, NIH data show.In the past four years of its U-RISE grant the center has reported to the NIH that 83% of its students entered a doctoral program. That exceeds the campus’s grant goal, which was 65% entering doctoral programs. 
Mendoza is grateful: She was one of two students to win a campus scholarship that’ll defray much, but not all, of the costs of attending school after losing her NIH award. That, plus a job at a pharmacy on weekends, may provide enough money to complete her bachelor’s next year.Others are unsure how they’ll afford college while maintaining a focus on research in the next school year.

“You work so hard to put yourself in a position where you don’t have to worry, and then that’s taken away from you,” said Camila Valderrama-Martínez, a first-year graduate student at San Marcos who also earned her bachelor’s there and works in the same lab as Mendoza. She was in her first year of receiving the Bridges to the Doctorate grant meant for students in master’s programs who want to pursue a biomedical-focused doctoral degree. The grant came with a stipend of $26,000 annually for two years plus a tuition waiver of 60% and money to attend conferences.She can get a job, but that “takes away time from my research and my time in lab and focusing on my studies and my thesis.” She relies solely on federal financial aid to pay for school and a place to live. Getting loans, often anathema for students, seems like her only recourse. “It’s either that or not finish my degree,” she said.
Terminated NIH grants in detail
These grant cancellations are separate from other cuts at the NIH since Trump took office in January, including multi-million-dollar grants for vaccine and disease research. They’re also on top of an NIH plan to dramatically reduce how much universities receive from the agency to pay for maintaining labs, other infrastructure and labor costs that are essential for campus research. California’s attorney general has joined other states led by Democrats in suing the Trump administration to halt and reverse those cuts. 
In San Marcos’ case, the latest U-RISE grant lasted all five years, but it wasn’t renewed for funding, even though the application received a high score from an NIH grant committee.Armenta, the associate director at the Cal State San Marcos training center, recalled that his NIH program officer said that though nothing is certain, he and his team should be “cautiously optimistic that you would be funded again given your score.” That was in January. Weeks later, NIH discontinued the program.He and Garcia shared the cancellation letters they received from NIH. Most made vague references to changes in NIH’s priorities. However, one letter for a specific grant program cited a common reason why the agency has been cancelling funding: “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research programs related to Diversity (sic), equity, and inclusion.”
That’s a departure from the agency’s emphasis on developing a diverse national cadre of scientists. As recently as February, the application page for that grant said “there are many benefits that flow from a diverse scientific workforce.”
Future of doctoral programs unclear
Josue Navarrete graduated this spring from Cal State San Marcos with a degree in computer science. Unlike the other students interviewed for this story, Navarrete, who uses they/them pronouns, was able to complete both years of their NIH training grant and worked in Becket’s lab.But because of the uncertain climate as the Trump administration attempts to slash funding, Vanderbilt University, which placed Navarrete on a waitlist for a doctoral program, ultimately denied them admission because the university program had to shrink its incoming class, they said. Later, Navaratte met a professor from Vanderbilt at a conference who agreed to review their application. The professor said in any other year, Navaratte would have been admitted.The setback was heartbreaking.

“I’m gripping so hard to stay in research,” Navaratte said. With doctoral plans delayed, they received a job offer from Epic, a large medical software company, but turned it down. “They wanted me to be handling website design and mobile applications, and that’s cool. It’s not for me.”
Valderrama-Martinez cited Navarrate’s story as she wondered whether doctoral programs at universities will have space for her next year. “I doubt in a year things are going to be better,” she said. 
She still looks forward to submitting her applications.So does Mendoza. She wants to study microbiology — the research bug that bit her initially and brought her to San Marcos. Eventually she hopes to land at a private biotech firm and work in drug development.“Of course I’m gonna get a Ph.D., because that just means I get to do research,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM_56.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 09:08:59.969448

A Salinas schoolteacher whose husband accrued major debt after a cancer diagnosis says a bill requiring hospitals screen patients for financial aid eligibility could help families like hers.,"Guest Commentary written by

Veronica Olea
Veronica Olea is a high school teacher in Salinas.


In our early 30s, my husband and I were working hard to build our future in Salinas, honing our skills as schoolteachers and saving to buy our first house. We thought we had our priorities in order. 
Everything changed when my then-33-year-old husband was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer.
Three years later, his lymphoma is in remission, but our finances still haven’t recovered. We are among the more than 1 in 3 Californians who live under the weight of medical debt.
We now know that hospitals are required to provide financial assistance to patients that meet certain income requirements, but patients need those options and help navigating the complex forms and criteria before the bills start piling up. 
California lawmakers have an opportunity to protect patients from being saddled with preventable but crushing medical debt by passing Assembly Bill 1312. This legislation, authored by Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, a Santa Clarita Democrat, faces a big hurdle on Friday in the Assembly Appropriations Committee, as deep-pocketed hospital associations mobilize against it. 
My husband and I are the “lucky” ones, with health insurance through our jobs and an extra cancer insurance plan that covered many of the expenses from his life-saving treatment. As teachers, we don’t qualify for state disability insurance but we wisely paid into an optional plan that covered his time off. 
Yet I feel heartbroken, not fortunate, when my husband asks me if he should skip his next MRI because of the cost. With his cancer in remission, insurance no longer covers tests intended to catch any recurrence early. His latest screenings added $3,000 to our pile of debt.
AB 1312 would require hospitals to screen patients to see if they are eligible for existing financial assistance programs and help those who qualify before they start amassing debts that can feel impossible to repay. Hospitals say the available tools to do this are too costly and not accurate enough, but these arguments are belied by the fact that hospitals already use information patients provide to have third-party vendors assess our ability to pay. 
This bill simply requires hospitals to use that information for the benefit of patients. 
In the weeks after we began receiving my husband’s medical bills, the hospital’s billing agency called us repeatedly. Not once did they offer us financial assistance or even suggest a payment plan. It’s no wonder that scores of Californians are unable to pay for necessities because of medical debt, as a recent L.A. County analysis found. 
The rate of medical debt is also an equity issue. Among Black and Latino Californians, rates of medical debt are 48% and 52%, respectively, compared to 28% for white Californians. 
Like many first-generation Latino families, my husband and I didn’t come from parents with money. We worked for everything we’ve gotten. Cancer put it all at risk. 
I used to pick up summer school classes to put away extra savings for retirement. I taught extra courses to help support my younger sisters with college expenses. Now I do that extra work, teaching at 120% of full time, just so we can keep the heat on in the winter while we pay down our hospital debt. 
Anyone could find themselves in our shoes, but that doesn’t stop my husband from feeling guilty that his care has cost us so much. I hope that my assemblymember, Robert Rivas, and other state leaders will use their power to support families like mine before they’re overwhelmed with medical debt.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/07262022_MLKHospital_PU_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 09:08:59.969448

Does that chill free speech?,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/05/lapd-report-complaint-form/,Californians who file complaints against police officers see a warning against making a false report. A dispute over the LAPD's form reached the California Supreme Court.,"In summary
Californians who file complaints against police officers see a warning against making a false report. A dispute over the LAPD’s form reached the California Supreme Court.


In 1991, in the months after four Los Angeles Police Department officers were filmed beating motorist Rodney King, a number of California cities created easier pathways for the public to file complaints about police officers. 
But the Legislature was concerned with “less ethical citizens (who would) maliciously file false allegations of misconduct against officers in an effort to punish them for simply doing their jobs,” according to a federal court decision years later.  
So the Legislature instituted a new requirement: Anyone filing a complaint against an officer could face criminal charges if they knowingly signed a false report.
At the LAPD, officials went further, demanding that complainants affirm, in bold font and all capital letters, that they understand the potential penalties. 
 “IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO MAKE A COMPLAINT THAT YOU KNOW TO BE FALSE,” the LAPD form reads. “IF YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER KNOWING THAT IT IS FALSE, YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED ON A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE.” 
More than 30 years later, the city and the union representing its police officers are still fighting over that language, and the argument has reached the California Supreme Court. 
The city of Los Angeles says the warning is a deterrent to people who would otherwise file a complaint, and violates the First Amendment by chilling free speech. The city also asserts that the form constitutes “viewpoint discrimination” — that is, it punishes false complaints against police officers, but not false statements made by police officers or witnesses in the same situation. 
The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing LAPD officers, argues the form is constitutional and necessary to prevent false complaints that would tie up an officer’s career. 
The LAPD was under a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department from 2001 to 2013. During that time, people could make complaints anonymously, either in-person, by phone, by mail, by fax or in an email. They would not be compelled to sign anything. 
But in 2017, four years after the consent decree ended, the police officers’ union filed a lawsuit that demanded the reinstatement of the signed complaint form. 
The matter went to both state and federal courts. The California courts mostly agreed with the officers’ union. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly agreed with the city. 
This, the city said in a brief filed with the California Supreme Court, left it in an “impossible position” where it had to violate one court’s decision to enforce the others. 
“Guidance from this court is urgently needed,” city attorneys wrote in their petition. 
The majority of California Supreme Court justices appeared to take a dim view of the city’s argument that the warning is unconstitutional. Associate justice Goodwin Liu said other, similar warnings are a rote part of the justice system. 
“Do perjury laws deter witnesses?” he asked a lawyer for the city of Los Angeles, referring to the law that prohibits people from lying under oath.
The lawyer, Michael Walsh, responded that other factors like negative publicity could deter witnesses from coming forward, but Liu replied that that’s not the fault or issue of the perjury laws. 
The California Supreme Court justices also posed hypotheticals. What if, associate justice Joshua Groban asked, a person complained to the LAPD that an officer did not refer to them politely. That, he said, could be a truthful complaint, but the conduct isn’t a violation of LAPD rules — could that complainant be prosecuted? 
No, said police union lawyer Michael Morguess. 
“If the person utterly believes this to be true, then it can’t knowingly be false,” Morguess said. 
“I think the statute needs to be crystal clear,” Groban said. “If it’s not, we’ve got a real chilling problem.” 
Other arguments from the city of Los Angeles focused on that potential chilling effect. 
“It takes enormous bravery for Californians who have experienced police misconduct to go forward and speak truth to power,” said Matt Nguyen, a lawyer representing a coalition of groups that filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of the city of Los Angeles. “And yet when they go to do so, every single member of the public is forced to confront this all-caps warning that virtually screams at them.”
Liu interrupted, questioning whether that argument held water. 
“Even if that is the case,” he said, “is that very discouraging, do you think?” 
A ruling from the Supreme Court is expected sometime this year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/120724_LA-Code-6_MA_CM_33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 09:08:59.969448

The frame then cuts to a sexy montage of the Kaysville Fire Department set to “Eye of the Tiger” by the band Survivor. Spraying confetti while posing on one of their engines, firefighters hold signs saying “I-15 is closing” overnight in Farmington. The video urges Utahns to read more details in the caption.
The short clip posted on UDOT’s Instagram page is just one of many silly, trendy yet informative posts the department’s small social media team has become known for. The page’s follower count has now grown to more than 177,000, and some of the videos have been viewed by millions. 
The page isn’t loved just by Utahns. This week, the UDOT social media team was recognized nationally for best social media team of the year as part of the Golden Post Awards by the Government Social Media network, a group that helps government agencies improve communications strategies. The awards were announced Wednesday during a conference in Orlando. 
Aimee Colton, UDOT’s social media manager, told Utah News Dispatch that UDOT hadn’t applied for the best social media team award, but they were nominated by surprise. “It was really sweet,” she said. “We’re very honored.” 
Who’s the mastermind behind all of UDOT’s memes and videos? Colton didn’t take all of the credit, though she’s in charge of execution, planning and strategy. “We have great team members who contribute in many different ways,” she said, also crediting UDOT director of  public relations and spokesman John Gleason for being “very supportive.”

Though Colton said her social media team is “pretty small,” made up of about four or five people, and they don’t have a ton of resources at their disposal, she said they try to inform Utahns of things like road closures, construction, maintenance and other transportation projects in fun, relatable ways. 
“Because, you know, through social media, you could be sharing the most important information in the world and people are not going to pay attention unless you convince them,” she said. “We try to deliver in a fun way.”
There’s some fancier content like footage of snow plow drivers set to heroic music. But for the most part, UDOT’s posts are rudimentary. Spongebob memes make more than one appearance. As recently as this week, UDOT posted a 15-second clip made with Microsoft Paint about an I-15 closure at Shepard Lane in Farmington set to “A Thousand Miles” by Vanessa Carlton. That clip “got like 2 million views,” Colton said. 
“It was so low-key and quick, but it was really impactful and a lot of people loved it,” she said, laughing. “For us, that was a really cool sign of success because a freeway closure is important, and we want people to be able to plan ahead and plan around those types of things. So that was a fun one.” 
Colton said UDOT was also a finalist for the “best organic campaign” award, saying they submitted another fan favorite — posts advertising “BridgeFest” last year, when crews spent the summer working on 62 different bridge projects.

The King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks in Seattle ended up winning this year’s best organic campaign award for its “Salmon SEEson” campaign. The National Park Service also won the overall best social media presence award. 
But when competing with other government agencies across the nation — including state, city, county and federal agencies with a much bigger footprint than Utah — Colton said she was proud to see UDOT’s ragtag social media team get some recognition. 
“It really does mean a lot, we try to be scrappy,” she said. “We want people to know what we’re up to.” 
It’s not the first time UDOT has been recognized nationally for its social media use. Last year, it won best Instagram presence at the Golden Post Awards. 
Colton said her team’s strategy is to be relatable. Even though construction, traffic and other transportation issues can be mundane and frustrating, she said it helps to not only inform, but also remind Utahns that UDOT workers are people too. 
“We’re not trying to be this unreachable government organization who doesn’t understand and relate to people,” she said. “We are also people and we know what it’s like to have some of the same concerns. … So we want to communicate to them in a way that makes sense but is also fun and relatable.” 
Plus, she said people don’t tend to remember information if it’s “given to you in a boring way.”

(Alex Cochran for Alabama Reflector)Note: This story contains a discussion of sexual assault.

Since 2020, Alabama has paid settlements in at least 124 lawsuits filed against correctional officers in the state’s overcrowded and violent prison system.
But the legal bills for defending the officers have far outpaced what incarcerated people and their families have received in settlements.
A review of data obtained from the state Department of Finance on yearly transactions from the General Liability Trust Fund between 2020 and 2024 found legal expenses associated with defending Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) officers accused of excessive force and failure to protect prisoners from harm or death amounted to $12.9 million.

May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


Settlement payments totaled $4.4 million in the same time period. ADOC’s total use of the trust fund since 2020 was over $17 million, by far the most of any state agency.
“The General Liability Trust Fund certainly expends more resources for ADOC than any other agency,” Daryl Masters, an assistant attorney general with the Department of Finance, wrote in an email, adding that Alabama’s Department of Human Resources, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Alabama Department of Public Health follow ADOC in terms of costs.
Between these individual complaints, plus defending ADOC in several class-action cases and the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit over prison conditions, ADOC has spent over $57 million on legal expenses since 2020. State records on Alabama Checkbook report that the majority of the money comes out of the General Fund.
The Attorney General’s office represents ADOC, and directs the defense of state employees who are sued on the job. In 2023, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall stripped ADOC’s legal staff of its ability to represent ADOC employees in legal matters.
The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

When ADOC employees are sued, they are now represented either by attorneys from the AG’s Office, or increasingly, by private lawyers hired by the AG’s Office through contracts that do not require a formal competitive bidding process.
The AG’s Office must inform the Joint Legislative Contract Review Committee, which meets once a month, about the contracts. The committee can place a 45-day hold on a contract but cannot permanently block or prevent a legal services contract from going through.
Some members of the committee have expressed concern over ADOC’s increasing use of outside attorneys and the mounting costs of litigation.
“It’s fair to ask, how long is this supposed to go on?” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. “Are we ever going to get out from underneath this stuff? What kind of statement does it make about our prison system that all these cases are filed and we never hear about results?”
Attorneys who represent plaintiffs suing officers with the Department of Corrections cannot directly bill the liability trust fund for their legal services. Some represent clients at no charge as pro bono work, or others establish an agreement with the client to collect payment through a percentage of any settlement.
Several attorneys who have represented prisoners said the process has become increasingly adversarial as more outside lawyers represent correctional staff and drag litigation out.
“Using outside law firms billing by the hour can make the GLTF (liability trust fund) more of a pot of gold for law firms than a fund to compensate victims,” said Hank Sherrod, who has represented incarcerated people and their families in civil litigation against officers. “These outside attorneys have every incentive to bill the shit out of the fund and sometimes do, getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and depleting the fund.”

Wrongful deaths and failure to protect

The vast majority of lawsuits in this time frame involved claims of excessive force, but cases connected to sexual assaults and deaths from violence have proven much costlier to the department, both in legal expenses and settlement amounts.
Some of the wrongful death and failure to protect complaints contain details of horrific assaults.

2019 sexual assault at Bullock Correctional Facility. According to the complaint, the plaintiff was placed in a dorm with a man who had threatened him. The plaintiff said that he informed the warden that he was in danger, and the warden laughed at him. Another officer allegedly told the plaintiff, “maybe they will kill your retarded cracker ass.” The plaintiff was later dragged to his bunk and raped by the man who had threatened him. He reported the assault and was taken to an outside facility for treatment where the rape was confirmed. ADOC then brought him back to Bullock and placed him in the same dorm with the same assailant, who raped the victim a second time. According to a lawsuit, the victim “suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, chronic depression, rips and tears in rectum, scars from stabbing, scarred pupil from assault, hearing loss from being kicked in his right ear, chronic pain, flashbacks, embarrassment, blood clots, passing blood clots, nightmares, has been required to undergo surgery and mental health treatment. He continues to fear for his life.” A settlement payment for $10,621.70 in this case was issued in March 2024.
2017 killing of Joseph Wood at St. Clair Correctional Facility two months after he arrived at the prison. The complaint was originally filed by Wood’s mother, who wrote that other prisoners were extorting her son inside the prison, and he was afraid officers were involved. “No one has ever told me who was responsible for killing my son,” she wrote. “I learned the most about his death after ADOC released the body to me for burial. I saw that he had been beaten, stabbed and strangled. The Department of Corrections failed to protect my son… I would like them to be held accountable for my loss and how they’ve treated my family.” After five years of litigation, a settlement payment was issued in 2024 for $125,000. Attorneys representing ADOC officers and staff named in the lawsuit collected over $400,000 for their legal work defending the officers.

The largest settlement amount from the last five years came from a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the mother of 28-year-old Travis Sessions, who died from bronchopneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs, while incarcerated at Red Eagle Community Work Center in 2018.
The complaint stated Sessions was sick for days with worsening symptoms, experiencing shortness of breath and coughing up blood, but at least three officers ignored his requests for help for days, until he was dying.
“He basically drowned in his own blood when Red Eagle personnel refused to get (him) the medical help he needed,” the complaint stated.
Attorneys representing the three officers in the lawsuit authorized a $600,000 settlement payment to a lawyer representing the man’s family, effectively ending the lawsuit. The family received half of the settlement, and the attorney received the other half.
The Sessions litigation lasted over 22 months, with lawyers from the Attorney General’s Office representing the named officers. But other complaints that attributed deaths or assaults to prison understaffing led to more protracted litigation and higher legal expenses.










He basically drowned in his own blood when Red Eagle personnel refused to get (him) the medical help he needed.


– Lawsuit over death of Travis Sessions


One such case was filed by the mother of 29-year-old Terry Pettiway, who was stabbed to death by another prisoner at St. Clair Correctional Facility in 2018. Attorneys from two firms, Sidley Austin LLP in New York, and White Arnold & Dowd P.C. in Birmingham, agreed to represent the mother at no charge, and filed the complaint in 2020.
According to the complaint, Pettiway was repeatedly stabbed in the back and neck after trying to break up a fight, and “left to bleed out while the housing block and the common areas around it were effectively left completely unattended by prison staff.” Fellow prisoners attempted CPR but were unsuccessful, according to the complaint.
The complaint accused 13 prison officers, supervisors and ADOC commissioners of enabling Pettiway’s killing “by their reckless or intentional failures to take actions to reasonably protect from violence.” The complaint also alleged that on the day of Pettiway’s death, a single prison guard was responsible for supervising a general population yard, in use by prisoners from eight separate cell blocks. The guard was unaware of the fight that Pettiway tried to break up, and when Pettiway was stabbed 14 to 17 times, “the guards were nowhere to be found.”
The Attorney General’s Office hired private attorneys to defend the ADOC employees in the lawsuit over Pettiway’s death. After more than two years of litigation, ADOC settled the case in 2023 for $250,000.
But according to Alabama Department of Finance data, the state spent $502,930 on legal bills from two law firms hired to represent the ADOC defendants, Maynard Nexsen PC in Huntsville and Capell & Howard PC in Montgomery.
Masters said the state’s Division of Risk Management encourages parties to settle a case as early as they can, but that’s not always possible. Masters acknowledged that ADOC’s use of the trust fund has gone up in recent years, but did not provide details about any actions Risk Management has taken to prevent future complaints in ADOC, saying those discussions would be considered privileged.
“The agencies themselves are the ones who are responsible for dealing with any particular type of claim,” he continued. “It would be up to them to make some change or do what they could, within the confines of their own responsibilities, to make corrections or changes to cause those numbers to go down.”
When asked what, if any, corrective actions have been taken inside the prisons to prevent future complaints, ADOC spokesperson Kelly Betts provided few details.
“It varies depending on the incident,” Betts wrote. “ADOC follows the corrective action policies listed in the Administrative Regulations.”

Transparency and accountability

Alabama’s General Liability Trust Fund is a public resource, funded with taxpayer dollars, although not under the same level of scrutiny as the state’s General Fund budget. The Alabama Attorney General’s Office and the Division of Risk Management make the decisions about how to use the fund, on behalf of the public.
Beginning in 2022, ADOC has been required by law to publish active litigation in its quarterly statistical reports. The reports indicate the number of complaints filed against ADOC continues to increase — 199 new lawsuits were filed in 2024, the highest annual number since the agency began publishing the information in 2022. Previous quarterly statistical reports showed 149 new complaints filed in 2023, and 128 in 2022.
But the information published in these quarterly reports — name of lawsuit, date filed, case number — tells a limited story. The reports do not include the allegations, the nature of the lawsuits, the names of officers or the extent of the alleged injuries.
Another deficient aspect is ADOC’s own accounting of legal expenses in these reports. The prison transparency law requires ADOC to include the amount paid to defend litigation against the department, but a review of all available ADOC quarterly statistical reports found no such figures on legal spending.
Under costs, the reports include the same entry for every lawsuit— “$0 – all monies paid to defend are paid by the Department of Finance, Division of Risk Management, via the coverage provided to State employees through the General Liability Trust Fund.”
What the reports don’t say is that ADOC’s premiums to participate in the trust fund have tripled in the last decade, from $1.1 million in 2015 to $4.4 million in 2024, according to data provided by the Department of Finance. ADOC’s rate increase has occurred while the agency’s overall staff has shrunk by 20%.

All state agencies pay an annual fee to the trust fund, and this participation rate is determined by the Department of Finance, which bases it on the number of covered employees, and also an evaluation of each agency’s use of the fund and number of claims year to year, Masters said. ADOC’s rate increase has occurred despite the decrease in staffing in Alabama prisons.
The decisions on how to use money from the liability trust fund include whether to settle lawsuits against ADOC officers, for how much, and also the choice to defend officers accused of excessive force, sometimes through years of litigation.
Richard Rice, an attorney based in Birmingham who has represented incarcerated people in excessive force lawsuits, questioned the ethics of such decisions when the allegations in the 124 complaints the state has settled are so widespread and damning.
“Are you complicit in perpetuating this type of behavior when it’s such an ongoing pattern, and you’re defending them at all costs?” he asked. “Our common values tell us this type of behavior is reprehensible. How do we not have those same common values for prisoners?”

(Photo Illustration by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Tens of thousands of Nevadans could pay less each month for insulin if lawmakers approve a proposed out-of-pocket cap on commercial insurance plans, according to the state Division of Insurance.
Assembly Bill 555, sponsored by Speaker Steve Yeager, would prohibit private insurance companies from charging people more than $35 for a 30-day supply of a prescription insulin drug. The Senate and Assembly committees on commerce and labor in a joint meeting heard the bill Wednesday and immediately advanced it.
Currently, no such cap on out-of-pocket insulin costs exists for private insurance companies, resulting in “outrageous and unpredictable” prices for many Nevadans, according to Yeager. The Las Vegas Democrat told the committee he has heard of people paying up to $500 per month for insulin.
Adam Plain from the Nevada Division of Insurance estimated there could be 70,000 Nevadans who have diabetes and are on private insurance plans regulated by the state. Private insurance makes up 18.6% of health care plans in the state, he said. Just under 11% of the adult population in the state has diagnosed diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.
More broadly, the association estimated that nearly 270,000 people in Nevada have been diagnosed diabetic and an additional 70,000 have it but haven’t been diagnosed.
Twenty-six states, as well as the District of Columbia, have capped out-of-pocket insulin costs for commercial insurance plans, according to the association. Caps range from $25 in Connecticut to $100 bucks in Alabama and Delaware for a 30-day supply.
With AB 555, Nevada policy would align with President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which established a $35 out-of-pocket insulin cost cap for people on Medicare.
Yeager referenced research finding that the number of fulfilled insulin prescriptions rose after the cap provision went into effect, suggesting that fewer people are skipping or rationing their medications because of their high costs.
Yeager called his legislation a “partial answer” and acknowledged it would not help uninsured cash payers. The legislation also does not affect health care plans offered by public employers.
During the hearing, Republican state Sen. John Ellison of Elko commented that President Donald Trump recently said he would lower the cost of all prescriptions.
“I thought that was so amazing,” Ellison added.
Trump signed an executive order on May 12 aimed at lowering drug prices by pressuring pharmaceutical companies to align their U.S. pricing models with those in similarly wealthy countries. It has been panned by Democrats as unserious.
Yeager did not comment on the executive order but said he generally “would be all for” any federal action that goes beyond what he is proposing at the state level. At the same time, “there is no reason” Nevada shouldn’t do what it can while it can, he argued.
AB 555 will provide financial relief to Nevadans feeling the effects of “disastrous economic policies at the national level,” he’d said at an earlier point in the hearing, an obvious dig at Trump. “It is incumbent on us at the state level to find solutions for them.”
Groups supporting AB 555 include the Nevada State Medical Association, Nevada Women’s Lobby, Retail Association of Nevada, and Battle Born Progress.
The bill’s only public opposition came from Americans for Prosperity, which believes the bill would interfere with “the natural price mechanisms of the market” and comes with the risk of “creating a cascade of unintended consequences.”
The Nevada Association of Health Plans has taken a neutral position on the bill, but lobbyist Shelly Capurro said some of its 11 members had concerns about unintended consequences.
After the hearing, during the meeting’s general public comment period, Plain, the insurance regulation liaison for the state, addressed lawmakers  as a private individual with diabetes. He thanked them for taking on the subject.
He said that with the “pretty good insurance” he gets as a state employee he pays $320 for a 90-day supply of insulin and three other medications, pen needles, and glucose monitoring.
“The list price for those four meds is $4,000 for a 90-day supply,” he added.
Another Nevadan, Lisa Lynn Chapman, testified that when she first started taking insulin for her Type-2 diabetes, her needles and insulin were free. Then, her employer changed insurance and “suddenly, my two different insulins cost $60 each, and my needles were $35 a month.”
The cost, she added, was difficult to absorb.
High costs are not what the three men who discovered and secured the patent rights for insulin wanted, Yeager told the joint committee in his closing. One of them, Frederick Banting, is famously quoted as saying, “Insulin does not belong to me. It belongs to the world.”
They sold their patents for $1 each to the University of Toronto in 1923. 
“Somehow we are here in the year 2025 and people are paying $500 a month for something that was assigned patent rights for a dollar over a hundred years ago,” said Yeager. “To me that is not and never will be acceptable.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1470812515-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 08:04:19.549961

Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is one of only a few Republican governors who didn’t sign a letter sent to Donald Trump offering heaping praise and “united” support of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
House Republicans early Thursday passed their version the massive budget reconciliation bill that would slash Medicaid, food assistance and other programs while extending 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on immigration enforcement. 
The Republican Governors Association announced 20 governors around the country signed onto a letter May 20 offering “strong support” for the bill.
Lombardo didn’t respond to requests for comment on why he didn’t sign the letter.
Republican governors from Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Vermont also didn’t sign the letter.
In the letter, governors assured Trump the “landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival.” 
“It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation,” they wrote.
The governors praised the proposed significant increase in spending on deportation and $150 billion in new money for defense and national security. 
The governors declined to mention the significant cuts being proposed in the bill, including reducing food aid by $267 billion over 10 years and Medicaid spending $700 billion Nor did they note that the Congressional Budget Office projects Trump’s tax cuts will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over a decade.
Trump’s budget request also proposed $33 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which social services providers and local officials warn would devastate Nevada. 
Lombardo has expressed reservations about some of policies that are now featured in the Trump budget bill, including deportations and Medicaid cuts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lombardo-bendnarksi-close-crop.jpg,,,2025-05-22 08:04:19.549961

Maj. Josh Heinen, from the Kansas City Police Department fiscal division, responded that the $3.5 million the department budgeted for legal settlements was “a reasonable amount”[...]","A Kansas City police van sits outside a patrol station on Linwood Boulevard (Allison Kite/Missouri Independent).At the end of February, during a public budget hearing, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas asked the police department whether it had requested enough money to manage lawsuit expenses.
Maj. Josh Heinen, from the Kansas City Police Department fiscal division, responded that the $3.5 million the department budgeted for legal settlements was “a reasonable amount” for this year.
So the Kansas City Council voted to approve the department’s $343 million budget, which set aside $3.5 million for settlements.
The council didn’t know then that two months later, KCPD would announce two lawsuit settlements that were five times the amount the department budgeted for — totaling $18.1 million.
Lucas believes that KCPD leaders knew during the budget process that expenses of that size were possible but chose not to disclose them.
When councilmembers and city staff read about the settlements in the news, they were worried that KCPD would be back to ask for more money to cover that unexpected expense.
But Capt. Jacob Becchina, a spokesman for KCPD, told The Beacon in an email that the department plans to pay the settlements out of its own general fund. It won’t affect personnel, he said, but it could cut contracts and equipment for the next fiscal year.
Members of the City Council — including Lucas — are not happy that the $18.1 million expense was never disclosed when the city was laying out the $343 million police budget for this year.
“It makes anyone who’s sitting here in government-land say, ‘What the hell are we doing here?’” Lucas told The Beacon.
 How KCPD pays for lawsuit settlements

Unlike nearly every other major city in the United States, Kansas City does not have control over its own police department. Instead, the police are governed by a five-member Board of Police Commissioners, which includes the mayor of Kansas City and four people appointed by the governor.
The City Council is required to give KCPD a quarter of its annual budget, which the department has near-exclusive authority to spend as it pleases. Lucas, who sits on the police board, and other top city leaders have unanswered questions about how that money gets spent.
KCPD maintains a “Self-Retention General Subsidiary Fund” that it uses to pay legal settlements when they come up. Money in that fund comes from a few sources. In this year’s budget, $2.5 million was allocated to that fund by the City Council. Another $1 million came from the state of Missouri.
Lucas has called on the state to contribute more for lawsuit settlements given the governor’s oversight of the police board. He called the current $1 million yearly contribution “woefully inadequate.”
The finer details of that lawsuit fund are tough to find. When The Beacon submitted a records request in 2022 to understand why that fund had $5.6 million in accounting inaccuracies over the previous 10 years, KCPD asked for $1,700 in research fees.
On April 22, the department agreed to pay $4.1 million to the family of Cameron Lamb, a Black man shot to death in 2019 by a KCPD detective. One week later, the department announced that it would pay another $14 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Ricky Kidd, a man who was incarcerated for 23 years for a murder he did not commit.
This year’s $18.1 million in lawsuit settlements are far more than the $3.5 million in that fund. If the City Council had known the expenses were coming, Lucas argues, it could have helped KCPD plan around them.
But instead, the police board voted to approve a budget that would need to be revised.
That money will not be paid out all at once. The $14 million settlement with Kidd will be paid out over the next four years. If Kidd’s settlement is divided evenly, that puts this year’s bill at $3.5 million, plus another $4.1 million to the family of Lamb, totaling $7.6 million.
 KCPD will not ask the City Council for more money — this time

When legal settlements exceed the money in its self-retention fund, KCPD has a couple options to make the payments.
One option is for KCPD to ask the City Council to take money out of the city’s budget to help pay for the settlements. That’s what KCPD has done in the past.
“If they did that,” said Assistant City Manager Melissa Kozakiewicz, “then they’re coming before the council to say, ‘Can you pay this amount?’ And the council then can say ‘yes’ or ‘no.’”
By way of comparison, this year’s estimated cost for the police’s recent legal settlements approaches the $8.5 million that Kansas City spent to distribute 162,000 trash carts last year.
The other option is for KCPD to pay the settlement entirely out of its own budget. That’s the route that department is taking in this case.
That means transferring money from other parts of the police budget, such as equipment, consulting fees or building repairs.
 Council was never told that an $18.1 million expense could be coming

Many city officials expected KCPD to ask the City Council to cover most, if not all, of the $18.1 million legal bill stemming from the Lamb and Kidd settlements. It came as a surprise when they learned from The Beacon that wouldn’t be the case.
City officials including Lucas and Councilman Johnathan Duncan have grown frustrated that KCPD does not treat the council or city staff as partners in navigating substantial budget decisions like recent lawsuit settlements.
KCPD plans to pull that money from the general fund, which totals $299 million for this fiscal year. Excluding personnel costs, which Becchina said will not be used for the settlements, there is only $23 million available in the general fund.
Lucas said he was frustrated that KCPD leadership chose not to be forthcoming with city officials when they outlined their budget two months before the settlements were announced.
A lawyer himself, Lucas has taught courses on this subject at the University of Kansas Law School.
“Hell, I’ll go on the record as your lawyer expert on this,” Lucas said. “You don’t settle a $14 million case in one day.”
When cases like this are filed — in this case, several years ago — there’s often a settlement demand from the start, he said. The defendant (in this case, KCPD) was probably told years ago that if they paid that sum, the plaintiff was willing to settle out of court.
“If Disney is facing a $1 billion dollar suit from the Trump administration,” he said. “No matter how valid it is or not, you put that in your list of things that could have some material impact on what’s going on.”
As the court date got closer, Lucas said, the lawyers — and leadership at the police department itself — would have been fully aware by February that a lawsuit settlement of this size was not only possible, but likely.
“You don’t have to speculate,” he said, “to at least know that there was someone in leadership, and perhaps many someones … knew that there was high potential that this would have an impact in this fiscal year.”
Becchina, from KCPD, declined to make Chief Stacey Graves available to comment on this story.
Duncan, who represents the 6th District in southwestern Kansas City on the City Council, said he learned about the police settlements the same way everyone else did — by reading it in the news.
The same goes for Kozakiewicz and other staff at City Hall, including the people in charge of the budget.
 Who’s actually being held accountable?

Over the past several years, Lucas has encouraged the other members of the police board to look into a liability insurance policy for the department.
That insurance, he said, would make the cost of litigation less burdensome for KCPD and City Hall.
The board has researched policies, but Lucas said that the department has cited a $5 million deductible as a reason not to obtain liability insurance. But in the past several years, Lucas said, police settlements have become more and more expensive, and the department has exceeded that amount.
This year’s $14 million settlement with Ricky Kidd was $1 million away from breaking the city’s record for its most expensive lawsuit settlement ever.
If the police department had liability insurance, even with a $5 million deductible, it would have already saved Kansas City taxpayers millions of dollars this year.
In a statement, the Board of Police Commissioners wrote that the $14 million settlement with Ricky Kidd was a rational decision.
“The Board of Police Commissioners of Kansas City, Missouri and Ricky Kidd have amicably resolved the ongoing litigation between Mr. Kidd and the Board for $14 million, payable over the next four fiscal years,” the board said in the statement. “The board resolved this litigation out of a desire to avoid the expense, uncertainty and risk of litigation, and the resolution of the matter is not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by anyone.”
The statement went on to say that the board “takes seriously its obligation to manage litigation in a way that serves not only the interests of the Kansas City Police Department, but, most importantly, those of the community it serves. This resolution is no different. Mr. Kidd’s lawsuit involved former personnel and events of nearly 30 years ago. The Department will take the benefit of the lessons learned throughout the course of this litigation and embed those lessons in its ongoing and continuous efforts to ensure Kansas Citians receive the highest level of police service. The board appreciates Mr. Kidd’s reasoned and sincere efforts in arriving at this resolution and wishes him and his family well.”
 Concerns with transparency

Duncan said the latest lawsuit settlement saga is emblematic of his long-standing frustrations with the police department.
“The fact that we do not manage KCPD leaves us in an untenable position,” he said, “where we are liable for any mistakes they make or any lawsuits that arise due to their conduct or misconduct. And we have absolutely zero authority to actively look to correct their practices and procedures.”
And the lack of transparency when these issues arise makes it even more difficult to find a path forward, he said.
“I often feel like the city is held hostage by KCPD,” he said, “in terms of the fact that we are … not made an active partner — not for lack of trying — in how to curb future litigation.”
Lucas said that the system of state control, where all of the police policies and procedures are set by an unelected board appointed by the governor, means the city is unable to hold KCPD accountable for the money that lawsuit settlements cost the taxpayers every year.
The biggest challenge with the police, he said, is a lack of accountability — not just to the taxpayers of Kansas City, but “really their lack of accountability to anyone.”
“We settled the case with Cameron Lamb, right?” he said. “What’s changed? What is the new step that people take? Is there any new discussion? Is there any new thing about how you de-escalate? Is there anything on it at all? Regrettably, at least in terms of what becomes publicly known, there is not.”

Puskar)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.
North Dakota House kills final Education Savings Account bill of session

In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Armstrong vetoes North Dakota private school voucher bill, but signals support for competing bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
U.S. House Republican plan would force states to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits

In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Riven by years of municipal departures, soaring premiums, and surging prescription drug use, the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program is on a path to complete collapse, and New Jersey’s gubernatorial hopefuls differ on how to fix it.
The plan, which in January provided health coverage to 56.2% of the state’s local government employers and has repeatedly seen double-digit premium hikes in recent years, faces even sharper increases and will collapse absent wholesale changes to benefits, entry and exit rules, and governance, the Treasury warned in a report released Tuesday.
Plans that provide coverage to local government face cumulative premium increases set to exceed 60% over the next four years and will likely collapse as more towns, authorities, and counties flee, the Treasury said. That collapse could leave towns with small or sickly workforces facing high rates in the private market.
Because premiums under the local part of the State Health Benefits Program are paid largely by local revenue like property taxes — whether through withholdings from local government workers’ salaries or directly from public coffers — spiking premiums stand to raise tax burdens at the local level.
There are 11 candidates running in the June 10 gubernatorial primaries (Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, can’t run for a third term this fall). They presented disparate paths on how to control escalating costs under the state’s public health plans, with some favoring increased competition, new drug pricing rules, or thinner plan requirements.
“We need more competition,” said former radio host Bill Spadea and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, both Republicans.
On top of boosting competition, Republican candidates want to lower the number of public plans’ coverage requirements as a method of controlling costs.

Murphy in late 2023 signed a law to allow the state’s public health plans to have more than one third-party administrator.
Aetna has since joined Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey in administering the state’s self-funded public health benefits, but its entry was not expected to generate savings in the current fiscal year, with benefits unclear for out years, according to budget documents.
It’s not clear any other New Jersey insurers have the capacity to administer health benefits across the breadth of state. Aetna and Horizon were the only two bidders for contracts to administer the public health plans, a Treasury spokesperson said.
Spadea and Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) suggested reducing plan coverage requirements, allowing the state to offer cheaper, less fulsome coverage in a bid to lower premiums.
“Right now, we have insurance policies that mandate a whole bunch of different services. I want to bring in companies that have options where you can choose policies that have less mandated requirements than we require in New Jersey,” Bramnick said.
In its report, the Treasury listed high-cost health care services among the primary driver of cost increases, alongside surging use of expensive medications, especially new weight loss drugs.
It’s not clear what services candidates would seek to limit or whether their plans would include a winnowing of existing health care plans. Treasury’s report notes that most local government workers remain on older plans with generous benefits and high costs.
Most candidates provided answers on how to control escalating costs in public worker health plans before the release of the Tuesday report that warned the plan had entered a death spiral. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and teachers union chief Sean Spiller — all Democrats — provided responses after its publication.

Democrats’ proposed solutions were more varied than their Republican counterparts. Some, like Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, backed increased competition, though Fulop also wants limits on hospital mergers.
“You have an increase in costs for New Jersey because you have this hospital monopoly as well, which has put a stranglehold on doctors,” Fulop said. “I think that Trenton needs to be more aggressive in not allowing that consolidation within hospitals or them acquiring medical practices downstream.”
Others favored boosting oversight of plan spending, targeting certain insurance middlemen, or broader changes like those the school workers’ public health plan saw in 2020.
Gottheimer and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11) both suggested increased plan oversight, her through audits of the State Health Benefits Program and him through compliance reviews. The two also said they want greater regulation of pharmacy benefit managers, third-party firms that negotiate prescription prices on behalf of insurance providers and have been blamed for rising prescription drug prices.
“They’ve driven up pharmaceutical costs up to 10 times,” Sherrill said.
Baraka backed reference-based pricing, which would tie prices for some services or drugs to those charged by Medicare. He also supports shifting some regulatory authority over the public plans to the Department of Banking and Insurance.
“We need reference-based pricing to bring costs down and increase transparency in this state and we need to lay the foundation for a true public option — one that prioritizes people, not profit,” the mayor said.
Treasury’s report partly blames the structure of plan design committees for rising costs within the State Health Benefits Program, saying those bodies, whose membership is split evenly between management and labor, had entrenched the status quo of expensive benefits. Ceding some authority to Treasury could lower costs, the report says.
At present, only the committees or the Legislature can change plan designs by, for example, changing copay levels, shifting reimbursement rates, or eliminating specific insurance plans within the program. The State Health Benefits Commission and its schools counterpart set premium levels.
Spiller and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney highlighted past reforms to state plans, including the 2020 changes that moved most school workers enrolled in the School Employee Health Benefits Program to cheaper public plans. They also suggested reverse auction rules that see pharmacy benefit managers bid each other down for state contracts.
“When I did the reverse auction on pharmaceuticals, it saved half a billion dollars a year, so that’s one of the lower-hanging fruits,” Sweeney said. “The other one is sitting down with the unions to see where we can negotiate and reduce healthcare costs like we did with the (New Jersey Education Association).”
The 2020 changes, which came when Spiller was the teachers union’s vice president, succeeded in providing some relief to public school plans, but Treasury’s report warns the dynamics that sent the local part of the State Health Benefits Program into a death spiral could do the same for the school workers’ plan.
Multiple Democrats, including Gottheimer and Baraka, said they want more transparency over hospital pricing, while Spiller blamed hospitals’ political heft for public plans’ present distress.
“We’ve seen it where we can make changes to some of the plan’s structures. They refuse to do it. Over and over, they refuse,” he said. “And let me tell you, I am sure it is because the biggest donors in New Jersey politics are the hospitals, the insurance companies, their brokers, all the other folks. We never get the change we need.”

Do we really need these costly insurance companies to do what we could easily do ourselves if we possessed the moral courage and the political will to do it?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Walter Carpenter: Health insurance déjà vu.","Dear Editor,The recent VTDigger article about the financial struggles of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont was déjà vu. It reminded me of another time in the past when we were at this point where Blue Cross Blue Shield was petitioning the Green Mountain Care Board for huge rate increases to prevent their potential insolvency.  It was in 2019, the last year before Covid-19 changed our lives, when the GMCB granted  a 12.4% and a 10.1% rate increase for BCBSVT and MVP, respectively. After that decision, the board’s chair, Kevin Mullin, said, “We acknowledge they are not affordable. But at the same time we can’t put a company out of business.” This year, Senator Ginny Lyons (D-Chittenden Southeast), chair of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, said, “We can’t let Blue Cross and Blue Shield go under.”READ MORE
Well, why not? Do we really need these costly insurance companies to do what we could easily do ourselves if we possessed the moral courage and the political will to do it? As the former vice president of corporate communications at Cigna, Wendell Potter — now an advocate for universal health care — said of his former industry: “Health insurers have been successful at two things: Making money and getting the American public to believe they’re essential.” They are absolutely not essential and we know it.  This is the broader question that we must ask ourselves yet again as we contemplate even heftier rate increase requests from BCBSVT to keep it afloat: How much longer will it be before we have nothing left to give to it? How many more of these déjà vus will BCBSVT have in the upcoming years while our wages stay flat?  Once again, it’s time to think about it.  Walter Carpenter MontpelierRead the story on VTDigger here:  Walter Carpenter: Health insurance déjà vu.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letters-to-the-editor_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

We can handle it, and we will find the right solutions together.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Peter Conlon: Gov. Scott needs to speak frankly on education and health care.","This commentary is by Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall. He is chair of the House Education Committee.When it comes to two of the biggest issues facing Vermonters, Gov. Phil Scott has gone silent. I am sure he is out there, checking his enormous political capital, then deciding not to spend a penny of it leveling with Vermonters that making the changes our state needs in education and health care — to name the two I will focus on — is going to require a new reality.Vermont’s decades-long demographic change — found in many other places in the U.S. and the world — has come home to roost. We are growing old; our birth rate is low; young people are back to their pre-Covid-19 ways of choosing to live in diverse, walkable cities with more economic opportunity; and our housing crisis continues.This is changing the face of Vermont, particularly rural Vermont. We have far fewer students in our schools, and our aging demographic means higher demand on our health care system with fewer young, healthy Vermonters paying into the system.Gov. Scott says nothing about Vermont’s health care system, which is on the brink of collapse, and very little about education since he floated the concept of sweeping changes, but has never been clear with Vermonters that we must have fewer schools, especially middle and high schools, to keep our system affordable.Health care may be the most immediate and important crisis, and it doesn’t even make Gov. Scott’s list of top issues. The state’s main — really only — insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, is on the verge of insolvency unless it gets a 20% rate increase or a helluva bailout.READ MORE
Most of our 14 hospitals are in a similar situation. Our insurance premiums are anywhere from twice to four times as expensive as our border states. A 20% will drive small businesses and individuals who buy on the exchange out of Vermont far faster than taxes.Gov. Scott has a road map to bending the cost curve sitting on his desk gathering dust. It is a commissioned study of Vermont’s system with clear recommendations to stabilize it and control costs. But it requires leveling with Vermonters, because we can no longer afford to maintain 14 hospitals all providing the same services. We can’t, and he needs to make that clear.It is the same with public education. With fewer students, we can no longer afford to maintain all of the schools we operate today. We can’t, and Gov. Scott needs to make that clear.No one else in Vermont has his megaphone, no one else has his clout, no one else has his political capital. It is time for Gov. Scott to give the volunteers who govern our education and health systems an assist. He needs to speak honestly, clearly and directly with Vermonters that our state has changed, and we need to adjust to those changes now, or watch our state slowly decline.Of course there are other big issues. Solving homelessness and our housing crisis is going to take more than his solution of just relaxing Act 250 regulations. It is going to take a sustained level of support from the government. He would never say that.We are ready to listen, Governor. Are you ready to speak frankly about what we really need to do? We can handle it, and we will find the right solutions together.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Peter Conlon: Gov.

(Photo via FWC.)Dear Gov. DeSantis,
Congratulations! You’ve achieved something rare in our deeply divided country. You’ve once again united a lot of people from disparate backgrounds and beliefs. 
Of course, you’ve united them against you and one of your agencies — but that’s a price you’re apparently willing to pay, over and over, and I salute you for it.
Last year, you brought people together to stop your plan to put golf courses, 300-room hotels, and pickleball courts in state parks. 
Then they united to protest your proposal to swap some state forest land with a golf course developer.
Because of the public outcry, the golf course developer withdrew its request for the state forest land. Meanwhile, the Legislature unanimously passed a bill to prevent you or any other governor from ever again trying to ruin state parks with golf courses, a bill you’ve promised to sign into law.
With these two crises mostly resolved, this would be the point at which public enthusiasm for protecting our state lands would begin to wane. People would stop protesting and go back to more mundane pursuits, such as binging episodes of “Poker Face.” (I hear there’s one set in Florida!)
Fortunately, Gov. D, that didn’t happen — thanks to your new scheme to keep people engaged. Good job! 
Last week, word got out that the state was considering a land swap with a mysterious private company that wanted 600 acres of the Guana River Wildlife Management Area. In exchange, the company, identified only as The Uplands LLC, offered to hand over 3,000 acres of less desirable land scattered around St. Johns, Lafayette, Osceola, and Volusia counties.
  Eric Draper. when he was Florida State Parks director, via Eric Draper
“It’s just a way to swap jewels for junk,” former Florida State Parks director Eric Draper told me.
Suddenly, boom! People were out protesting again, waving signs that said things like “We’re not Guana take this!” which I thought was a nice shout-out to Twisted Sister.
Your land swap was so unifying, it was roundly condemned by everyone from 1000 Friends of Florida to the White House. Even legislators from your own party began clamoring for answers. 
It was a brilliant move, sir, like something you’d see in 3-D chess. 
But then Uplands LLC chickened out. 
In the face of such widespread public outrage, the company’s attorney announced Monday that his client would withdraw its proposal. The vote on the land swap, scheduled for Wednesday, was canceled.
It’s a shame, really. Everyone sure was spoiling for another big showdown.
It’s also too bad that one of Florida’s best state employees lost her job over your scheme.
Wile E. Coyote goes boom
For seven years, you’ve made it clear that you’re no fan of Florida’s outstanding Government in the Sunshine Law. But in this case, Mr. D, you apparently used the Sunshine Law the way you’d use your favorite putter to drill one straight into the hole.
Nobody knew about this Guana land swap until it suddenly popped up on the agenda of a somewhat obscure government group last week. That means the owners of that Guana River property, namely the Florida taxpayers, had no more than seven days’ advance notice about what you were up to. 
Oh, sir, I applaud the way you played that one! It made people even MORE suspicious that this was some sleazy payback for a campaign contributor.
The legal requirement that this little-known group review the land swap in an open meeting appeared to be the only thing that flushed this secret deal out into the open. The best comment about this happening is one I heard from Albert Gregory, former chief of Florida’s park planning division.
“It’s like Wile E. Coyote is getting the public comment tool out of the Acme box,” he told me, “and it blows up in his face.”
Here’s how it worked out: On May 14, your Florida Department of Environmental Pro — er, what are we calling it now, sir, Providing Cover for Developers? Professing One Thing While Pursuing Another? Proving They Put Politics First? 
Anyway, your DEP posted a notice that there would be a meeting of the Acquisition and Restoration Council, or ARC for short, in exactly one week. As I’m sure you recall, that’s a group of 10 people you appointed.  Some ARC members are from state agencies, some from scientific institutions such as Tall Timbers Research Station, and some are from private concerns such as ranches and timber operations.
  Julie Wraithmell via Audubon Florida
According to Julie Wraithmell, executive director of Audubon Florida, that ARC meeting notice waved a big red flag. ARC doesn’t meet that often, and this meeting was not one of their regularly scheduled ones. Why hold a special session? 
The Audubon folks requested DEP send them the agenda, she said, but no one did. Finally, a link to the agenda showed up on the DEP website sometime after 6 p.m. the day the notice was posted, she said. That’s when Audubon learned about the land swap proposal and sounded an alarm for all the state’s environmental groups. 
But that’s about all they learned. The agenda item was “really light on details,” Wraithmell told me. “It’s not clear who the applicant is.” 
Also unclear: What the applicant intended to do with the state’s property. All the other items on the ARC agenda concerned adding to state lands. This was the only one that would take some away.
Finding the land mines
Once everyone began studying this bare-bones agenda item, they discovered other fatal flaws. Oh, sir, you were so clever the way you planted all those land mines!
For starters, the report for the ARC said the Guana River property had no historically significant sites. But Wraithmell pointed out that Guana River’s official state management plan names more than seven historic sites covered by the property.
The land is managed by a different state agency, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The DEP report on the proposed land swap says the FWC concurred with the agency’s recommendation to approve handing over the taxpayers’ property to a private entity.
But that’s not the way the FWC report reads to me. It simply says it “acknowledges the authority” of ARC and the governor and Cabinet to do what they want with the land. That sure sounds like that agency is far from sold on the idea.
Perhaps the biggest land mine of all is what the law says about how the state can’t get rid of any preserve property until it does one thing.
  Clay Henderson, provided by subject
For finding this one, I have to credit Clay Henderson, a longtime environmental activist who’s literally written the book on Florida land preservation programs (“Forces of Nature” — you should read it, sir). The law, he pointed out, says the state must first establish that the land is no longer needed for conservation purposes.
Henderson, in a letter to the ARC members, pointed out that Guana River contains everything from coastal strands to maritime hammocks to pine flatwoods to estuarine wetlands. There are rookeries for wood storks and ancient shell middens. 
All of that is important to preserve in our fast-growing state.
Henderson remarked that one of the state’s top land managers called the Guana River property one of the “crown jewels of American conservation.” In other words, not one you’d want to give away to somebody.
So Gov. D, if you were looking for one park parcel to dangle over a dangerous chasm to make a point, I think it’s clear you picked the perfect one.
This Gate is closed
The other big mystery was who wanted the Guana River land so badly. 
Good job keeping everyone guessing, governor! The lack of any information made it even more infuriating. It also ensured people would get mad at you and the DEP, not some private entity that might in fact be one of your campaign contributors.
When some nosy Tampa Bay Times reporter asked you point blank to identify your co-conspirator in this effort, you pretended you didn’t understand the question, then dodged any follow-up. You sidestepped as deftly as Charles Durning in “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.”  Pretty fancy footwork for a guy who sometimes wears white go-go boots.
The newspaper noted that “the Upland LLC’s business filings with the state don’t list anyone other than a general business services firm as its leader, making the true identity of the entity unclear.” Maybe a better name for the company would have been “Obfuscation Inc.”
There was some speculation that Upland LLC was somehow connected with Gate Petroleum, the company that owns the Ponte Vedra Inn & Club. I contacted Gate and received the quickest “no!” I’ve heard since my long-ago dating days.
  Horses riding on trails in Guana River WMA via FWC
A spokeswoman told me the company’s founder and chairman, Herbert Hill Peyton, is the person who first sold the land to the state in 1984. She said he opposes any effort to undo that preservation effort. 
The Guana River “is the finest land in Northeast Florida and no portion should be sold, swapped or developed,” Peyton said in a written statement. “This land belongs to the people of Florida and should be preserved forever.” So I guess this Gate is closed.

  Gary Hunter via Holtzman Vogel Law Firm
The only clue we have to the identity of company is the attorney who called off the vote. His name is Gary Hunter, and he’s also a Tallahassee lobbyist whose clients include major developers such as Neal Communities and Alico, not to mention the powerful Association of Florida Community Developers. 
Hunter, in his letter, claimed his client had no plans to “develop the acquired land for commercial or community development purposes” and blamed “misinformation” for stirring up all the public anger. He didn’t explain what he meant by “misinformation,” nor did he exclude such development amenities as golf courses.
I tried contacting Hunter to ask about that, but he didn’t respond. 
I’m assuming that including Hutner was all part of your plan to keep people conscious of how fragile our state parks, forests, and wildlife management areas are.
Callie DeHaven knew that fact already.
Principles over politics
Callie DeHaven worked her way up to become the director of the DEP’s Division of State Lands in 2017. The division has done some wonderful things, such as adding to the size of the award-winning state park system. That’s why lots of people liked her and liked the job she did.
“Callie was one of the few people left at the agency who had scruples,” Gregory told me.

“I’ve known Callie for many years and she’s one of the good guys,” said Dana Bryan, who spent 30 years in the Florida Park Service, most of it as chief biologist.
On May 6, though, DeHaven submitted a single-page, handwritten letter to her bosses. “To whom it may concern,” it said. “I hereby resign my position.”
The letter doesn’t explain what happened. Draper, who has fond memories of working with DeHaven, told me she’s not the kind of person to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation. She must have been pushed pretty hard to quit so abruptly.
“There is no doubt she objected to the Guana land swap and resigned rather than give in to developers,” Draper said.
So Gov. DeSantis, if you were trying to find which DEP employees would put principles over politics, I guess your plan worked a little TOO well. 
You need to find Ms. DeHaven and bring her back into the DEP. Maybe even promote her to a position of even greater authority.
Callie DeHaven Resignation Letter
Calls to Mom
To show you how well your scheme worked, Gov. D, let me tell you about a woman I met this past weekend in St. Cloud.
  Rep. Paula Stark via Florida House
I gave a talk about Florida, and afterward several people came up to me and told me THEIR Florida stories. One of them was state Rep. Paula Stark, who represents the St. Cloud area. She became interested in politics long before she was first elected in 2022. Not her kids, though.
“They are not political at all,” she told me.
What her two adult sons care about is Florida’s environment. They have backyard cameras and love watching wildlife cross from one fenceline to the other, she told me.
But then they found out about the Guana River land swap. Suddenly they were keenly interested in talking to her about politics. They were calling her up and asking, “Mom, why are they doing this?”
And they were ready to do whatever they could to stop it.
The point of this story, Gov. D, is to show you how passionate people are about our wonderful state lands. Even people who don’t care about politics care about saving our dwindling natural resources. 
An estimated 50,000 folks signed petitions to oppose the land swap before Uplands gave up. Meanwhile, state Rep. Kim Kendall has vowed to sponsor a bill to make sure this never happens again.
Anyway, congrats on pulling off such an elaborate and clever scheme to make sure Floridians remain vigilant about threats to our state lands. 
You better hurry up and find another one, though. Otherwise, they’re liable to start talking about your Hope Florida scandal again.

The Columbia River Fish Mitigation program attempts to balance out significant harm inflicted by the Columbia River hydropower dam system on endangered salmon and steelhead runs.
The 46 percent cut to the program’s yearly budget comes amid tens of billions of dollars in cuts to the federal government that have hit scientific and regulatory agencies in Southwest Washington hard. It also follows months of speculation about what President Donald Trump’s Columbia Basin fish policy would be.
“It is outrageous that President Trump is ripping away critical funding to protect our fish populations in the Columbia River, which are so important to our economy, culture and tribes in Washington state,” U.S. Sen. Patty Murray wrote in a statement emailed to The Columbian.
The Corps did not directly respond to The Columbian’s request for comment on the cuts. In a brief statement, a spokesman instead highlighted the importance of the salmon recovery program moving into the future.
“Columbia River Fish Mitigation funding is an important source for many projects in the basin,” said Tom Conning, spokesman for the Corps’ Northwestern Division. “As is typical during the federal budget process, we will work with our partners in the region to prioritize projects depending on how much funding we actually receive from Congress.”
Six Columbia Basin salmon recovery policy experts and biologists who work with the program said the cuts stand to unravel the program’s work in coming years — harming salmon recovery across the basin at a make-or-break time.
“With these cuts to salmon recovery programs, (Corps officials) are going to have to halt many important actions in their track,” said Tom Iverson, regional coordinator for Yakama Nation Fisheries.
Iverson also said the cuts are “inconsistent with the U.S. government’s commitments” to restore salmon populations under the binding Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement.
Salmon advocates made compromises in that agreement to get the government to agree to spend more on Columbia River hydropower system infrastructure and fish passage — not less.
Murky origins of a cut

	
Two Trump administration actions have affected Corps funding.
The first is a nearly $1.5 billion reduction in funding for the Corps’ civil works between fiscal year 2024 and the current federal fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
The second is a move by the administration to shift hundreds of millions of previously committed dollars from civil works projects in Democratic-controlled states to Republican-controlled states, according to an analysis by Murray’s office that was shared with The Columbian.
“Trump is stealing funding from blue states for no other reason than political retribution, and he’s playing politics with critical water infrastructure — it’s absolutely despicable,” Murray said. “This is not how things should ever work in America.”
In fiscal year 2024 — which ran from Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, 2024 — the salmon-restoration program was allocated $66,670,000.
But newly released Corps itemized funding documents show the Corps received only $35,983,605 for this fiscal year.
That’s despite Congress’ March continuing resolution funding the Corps at the same level for fiscal year 2025 as the previous year, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.
The cuts are even more drastic when the new $36 million funding level is compared with the $75.2 million the Corps was slated to get for Columbia River fish mitigation efforts for 2025 in the draft budget that the Biden administration submitted to Congress in March 2024 based on the Corps’ funding request.
The program’s funding has significantly varied over the past 15 years, according to The Columbian’s analysis of publicly available Corps funding levels.
The program routinely received more than $100 million in the early 2010s. But that was cut by about two-thirds during Trump’s first term, dipped lower still during the first half of former President Joe Biden’s term and finally rose to the past fiscal year’s recent high during the latter half of Biden’s presidency.
Legal requirement

	
The program evaluates how different parts of the hydropower system impact salmon stocks in the Columbia Basin and then addresses those problems through construction, habitat restoration and other means.
The Corps’ 2025 budget says the program’s work is “required” to minimize “lethal take” (killing) of Endangered Species Act-listed salmon and steelhead by the federal hydropower dam system.
Government reports released during the Biden administration acknowledged the hydropower system’s harm to salmon stocks and Native nations, as well as the ways removing four lower Snake River dams would benefit them.
Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead returns were between 10 million and 18 million fish before the dams. Recently, they’ve numbered about 2.3 million.
Wild fish in particular have suffered. A 2022 assessment by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found the number of “raw natural spawner(s)” in Columbia River tributaries declined substantially for nearly every run in nearly every river measured between 1990 and 2019.
Overfishing, climate change, habitat degradation and a rise in predators have also harmed runs.
All that has pushed 13 Columbia Basin salmon runs to the brink of extinction, placing them under Endangered Species Act protections.
Impacts

	
The Columbia River Fish Mitigation program will be partly protected from the immediate impacts of the cut, according to an email obtained by The Columbian that was sent by Columbia River Fish Mitigation program manager Ida Royer to about three dozen Columbia Basin salmon-restoration policy experts and biologists.
The email states that because of leftover money from the 2024 fiscal year, the program will end up with only a few million dollars less than last fiscal year.
But six Columbia Basin salmon recovery policy experts and biologists who work with the program said the cuts will create uncertainty that snowballs into future years, disrupting the program’s continuing operations.
That stands to further delay the long and ever-growing list of deferred maintenance biologists say the Corps must do — not just to support fish passage but for navigation and flood-risk management.
And even the limited cuts appear to be impacting the required program’s operations already, because they came so late in the fiscal year.
“There will need to be more discussion about the work remaining for the year, refined costs and program priorities,” Royer wrote. “More to come.”

It ensures access to basic healthcare for low-income individuals and families who would otherwise go without. But Medicaid does more than support individuals; it is a vital public health tool that strengthens entire communities.
In Missouri, Medicaid plays a particularly critical role for women and children. Over 40% of women who give birth in the state are covered by Medicaid during pregnancy, and consequently, about 40% of children are utilizing this program. It also provides healthcare to more than 500,000 children.
And yet, despite this extensive coverage, Missouri ranks 44th in the nation for maternal mortality rates.
During my time working on a maternal-fetal medicine ward, I witnessed firsthand how fragile and inconsistent healthcare access can be for pregnant patients. Many women came in with undiagnosed, unmanaged conditions like high blood pressure—problems that could have been treated early with regular care. But for many, pregnancy is the only time they qualify for Medicaid and thus the only time they see a doctor.
When Medicaid coverage ends postpartum, so does their access to care. These untreated conditions worsen over time, making subsequent pregnancies more dangerous. Missouri’s extension to cover Medicaid postpartum for 12 months is an incredible step towards creating healthier mothers, healthier pregnancies, and ultimately healthier children.
This issue extends beyond pregnancy. Preventable conditions like diabetes and hypertension often go undiagnosed and untreated due to lack of access to routine care. As a result, emergency rooms are flooded with patients seeking non-emergency care — like prescription refills — that should be handled by primary care providers. This misuse of emergency care drives up healthcare costs, increases ER wait times, burns out physicians, and frustrates patients.
Medicaid is not just important—it’s essential. Without it, millions would lose access to the care they need, leading to worse health outcomes and skyrocketing costs across the system. And yet, Missouri ranks dead last in state health spending, contributing just $7 per person in state funds and $92 per person when including federal support. Now, with federal Medicaid funding facing potential cuts, Missouri stands at a crossroads.
Will our lawmakers act to protect and expand Medicaid access, or will they allow more than a million Missourians to fall through the cracks? The health and future of our state depend on their funding.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stethoscope-chart-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

Indiana has recently experienced record-setting rains, causing disastrous flooding in some areas of the state. Our state also has historically relied on coal as an energy source.
You might be asking: What does coal have to do with all that rain falling from the skies into our water supply? It turns out quite a bit. As we burn coal, we generate coal ash, which has serious implications for our water. It needs to be part of Indiana’s current discussion of water resources.
Coal ash contains toxic heavy metals, like arsenic, which contaminate water whenever the ash gets wet. Most of Indiana’s coal ash sites have contaminated the underlying groundwater, making it unusable for drinking water.
Indiana’s coal ash is also a spill risk because most of it is currently stored in the floodplains of the Ohio, Wabash and White rivers and Lake Michigan. When flooding happens, it could damage the disposal sites causing release of the ash. The recent high-water events are a stark reminder that the floodplain is one of the worst locations for coal ash disposal.
The current groundwater contamination and spill risk are from the many millions of tons of coal ash left over from past decades of burning coal. Unfortunately, Indiana still has coal-burning power plants that continue to produce about five million tons of coal ash each year, putting more of our water at risk.
New EPA rules will force fossil fuel power plants to cut pollution

Our state needs less toxic coal ash, not more. Coal generation itself and the byproduct of coal ash it produces pollutes our air and water. Spills and leaks in other states have validated the dangers of coal ash.
In 2014, a drainage pipe burst at a retired Duke Energy facility in North Carolina, releasing approximately 39,000 tons of coal ash and 27 million gallons of contaminated water into a nearby river.
This spill, one of the largest in U.S. history, contaminated about 70 miles of the river with toxic substances including arsenic, selenium and lead, posing significant risks to aquatic ecosystems and communities relying on the river for drinking water and recreation. The incident exposed regulatory failures and led to federal investigations into Duke Energy’s practices and its relationship with state regulators.
In 2022, the Hoosier Environmental Council estimated that Duke Energy Indiana was burning enough coal to generate more than 1.4 million tons of coal ash per year, adding to the millions of tons already being stored across the state.
The good news is that lawmakers and Gov. Mike Braun have prioritized water planning in the coming years, both via recently passed legislation and a new executive order.
The bad news is that those same policymakers seem infatuated with keeping coal as an energy source for decades to come despite overwhelming economic and health reasons to move away from coal toward cleaner, more efficient energy sources.
Burning coal is bad for our state. Storing coal ash in floodplains that could overflow in a heavy rain creates yet another unfair burden and health threat to local communities. To protect our water resources, we need to stop burning coal and adopt a responsible approach to coal ash disposal as soon as possible.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. It was just a matter of time before the prospect of President Donald Trump pardoning Minneapolis Police Department Officer Derek Chauvin for violating George Floyd’s civil rights became a reality.
When White House reporters asked him in March about pardoning Chauvin, President Trump replied, “No, I have not heard about that.” 
That’s hard to believe, since right around that time Ben Shapiro led a conservative chorus of commentators and politicians raising a hue and cry on that very thing, egged on by Trump henchman Elon Musk. 
As investigative reporter Radley Balko pointed out for MSNBC, Shapiro once said Chauvin should be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law” and should “go to jail” and that “everyone should be on the same side of this.” 
But that was then. 
Despite a trial in which nearly all the defense’s theories were heard and rejected by a jury of Chauvin’s peers, and despite Chauvin pleading guilty to his federal crimes, Shapiro and his ilk have changed their tune. 
Chauvin’s conviction, Shapiro writes, “represents the defining achievement of the Woke movement in American politics. The country cannot turn the page on that dark, divisive and racist era without righting this terrible wrong.” 
Terrible wrong? We all saw Chauvin impassively kneeling on Floyd’s neck while Floyd pleaded, “I can’t breathe.” 
Now we can be sure Trump has heard about it, and we’re all waiting, bracing for some middle-of-the-night bathroom tweet. U.S.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now in on it: “I strongly support Derek Chauvin being pardoned and released from prison, George Floyd died of a drug overdose.”  
Yes, Floyd was on drugs. But let’s recall the words of Dr. Martin Tobin at trial. He is one of the world’s foremost pulmonologists, the man who literally wrote the book on the subject and testified in a criminal trial for the first time, refusing his usual expert witness fee. Then-Reformer reporter Deena covered his testimony:  
“Basically on the left side of his lung, it was… almost to the effect as if a surgeon had gone in and removed the lung — not quite, but along those lines — so there was virtually very little opportunity for him to be able to get any air to move into the left side of his chest,” Tobin said. 
“So he was going to be totally dependent on what he’d be able to do with the right side.”
But Floyd’s ability to expand his chest was also impaired on the right side, Tobin said. Floyd’s respiration rate had been 22 breaths per minute, a normal rate, which Tobin said was “extremely significant” because if fentanyl caused his respiration to go down, you’d expect it to drop to about 10.
Tobin said he could mark the moment the life went out of Floyd: 8:25:16 p.m. The officers continued to hold him down on the street for another three minutes.
In short, what killed Floyd was Chauvin’s disregard for human life.
Chauvin’s lawyers argued their client was denied a fair trial in 2021 due to pretrial publicity and concerns about violence in the event of an acquittal.  True, there was plenty publicity.  And there were quite reasonable concerns about violence ensuing if Chauvin walked.  
None of that altered the medical examiner’s findings. He testified during the trial that his cause of death finding hadn’t changed since he filled out Floyd’s death certificate in June 2020: He blamed “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual restraint and neck compression.” 
“I would still classify it as a homicide today,” he testified.
Not that the facts faze Greene or the rest of the MAGA mob presently riding to Chauvin’s rescue in the media.  
You can bet they have Trump’s ear. 
But think of the irony: Just about the first thing he did after taking his hand off the Bible on Inauguration Day was grant clemency to rioters for storming the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, handing a literal get-out-jail-free card to upwards of 1,500 charged, including 15 ring leaders and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.  This despite that roughly 140 police officers were injured during the attack, more than a dozen hospitalized. 
Trump held forth: “This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.”  
Falling from the south end of a northbound bull, what the proclamation did was sign off on wanton, wholesale criminal activity. You want to know from injustice perpetrated? Ask the families, relatives and friends of those cops who were cut down doing their duty to uphold the law. For that matter, ask the injured cops about all those law breakers being let off the hook.
And in Trump’s make-believe world, the fact that Chauvin pled guilty in the federal case won’t matter. 
A reminder: By pleading guilty, Chauvin agreed in open court that he “willfully depriv(ed) Mr. Floyd of his constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, resulting in Mr. Floyd’s bodily injury and death … and acted willfully and in callous and wanton disregard of the consequences to Mr. Floyd’s life,” as the Department of Justice press release said at the time. And, Chauvin also pleaded guilty to “willfully depriving a then-14-year-old child of his constitutional right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer, resulting in the child’s bodily injury” related to a separate 2017 incident. 
Federal conviction overturned, Chauvin would thankfully still be incarcerated, transferred to the Minnesota Department of Corrections to serve out the remainder of his sentence on state charges. 
But let’s not forget the Minnesota Board of Pardons, which no longer requires a unanimous vote among the three members: the governor, attorney general and chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. 
If Republicans get their act together, they could conceivably win the governor and attorney general races. And then they would face intense pressure to commute Chauvin’s sentence. 
Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Community Safety Commissioner Toddrick Barnette and other political and law enforcement figures are said to be bracing for the Trump pardon. This is, to say the least, prudent.  
In response to Floyd’s murder, May 2020 saw days of protest — but also hell-raising — that damaged more than 1,300 buildings in Minneapolis and St. Paul and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in property destruction. Plus, payouts to victims of police brutality. And a pile of police disability claims. 
A pardon would mean all the bracing in the world won’t keep all hell from breaking loose all over again.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P1057121-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

(Getty Images)Questions remain about Benjamin Ritchie’s early Tuesday execution after his attorneys reported seeing sudden, unexpected movement during the lethal injection process.
But no members of the media were permitted to witness the execution, meaning there was no independent observation or account of what happened.
Defense attorney Steve Schutte, who viewed the execution, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle immediately after that he saw Ritchie lift his head and shoulders “violently” from the gurney shortly after the process began. Two others in Ritchie’s witness room gave similar descriptions.

Dr. Jonathan Groner, an emeritus clinical professor of surgery at the Ohio State University College of Medicine who has written extensively on the death penalty, said “that’s not what is supposed to happen” when the execution drug, pentobarbital, is used to induce death.
“Clearly, this was botched,” Groner told the Capital Chronicle, based on the limited accounts provided by Ritchie’s counsel. “It should be really, really effective — really fast. No one should move … It’s just lights out, go to sleep, no reaction, no coughing, no nothing. They just don’t move.”
Indiana’s Department of Correction (DOC) released few details about the execution. 
When asked whether the pentobarbital used in Ritchie’s case worked properly, DOC spokesperson Annie Goeller told the Capital Chronicle that what Ritchie’s lawyers described “is not an accurate description of the circumstances,” and she maintained that “the execution was completed according to protocol.”
Capital Chronicle Senior Reporter Casey Smith attended Joseph Corcoran’s execution in December and did not observe any sudden movements by the inmate while blinds for a one-way window into the execution chamber were open. 
Corcoran, strapped to a gurney, initially appeared awake with his eyes blinking. After a brief movement of his left hand and fingers several minutes later, he did not move again.
There is no standard definition of what constitutes a “botched” execution.
The Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. that tracks state and federal executions, points to a 2014 book published by Amherst College professor Austin Sarat, which classifies botched executions as those in which “there is a break­down in, or depar­ture from,” the ​pro­to­col for a par­tic­u­lar method of exe­cu­tion.










It should be really, really effective — really fast. No one should move … It’s just lights out, go to sleep, no reaction, no coughing, no nothing. They just don’t move.


– Dr. Jonathan Groner, an emeritus clinical professor of surgery at the Ohio State University College of Medicine


Sarat adds that botched executions are “those involving unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner.”
The absence of news media, however, means the public must depend on the conflicting reports from Ritchie’s lawyers and state officials to determine what, if anything, went wrong during the execution. No other witnesses have spoken publicly about what they saw.
“Killing people is horrific, and it is the most extreme form of state power,” said Gerry Lanosga, professor of journalism at Indiana University and board member for the Indiana Coalition for Open Government. “But the only way we would know whether something goes wrong would be to have independent witnesses there who observe and can ensure that the process is carried out appropriately.” 
A ‘botched’ execution?
Tuesday morning’s death sentence was carried out nearly 25 years after Ritchie shot and killed Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney. The condemned man had been on death row since his conviction in 2002.
Capital punishments were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until state officials announced last year that they’d acquired pentobarbital to resume executions. The one-drug method is a departure from the state’s protocol used since 1995, involving a series of three chemicals.
Ritchie was Indiana’s second execution in six months.
Capital Chronicle reporting revealed the state paid $900,000 for execution drugs, but officials won’t say how much was purchased or if any remains after the two executions.  Officials also have refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details. 
Lethal injection requires execution workers to administer drugs intravenously to the prisoner to stop their heart. It has become the most commonly used execution method across the country — but it’s also the method with the most recorded “botches,” or mistakes.
Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, previously told the Capital Chronicle that many of the documented botched executions in recent years have occurred because the drugs being used had expired, were contaminated, or they were administered “incorrectly.” 



The Death Penalty Information Center describes at least two botched executions that have occurred in Indiana.
In October 1985, it took 17 minutes to execute William Vandiver. Still breathing after the first application of 2,300 volts, four more bursts of electricity were fired into him before he was pronounced dead, according to media reports from that time. The Indiana Department of Correction admitted the execution “did not go according to plan.”
Tommie Smith, who died by lethal injection in July 1996, also had a prolonged execution, according to the DPIC. Because of unusually small veins, it took more than an hour after the execution team began sticking needles into his body for Smith to be pronounced dead. After multiple attempts, the lethal drugs were finally injected into Smith 49 minutes after the process began. It took another 20 minutes before he was pronounced dead.



Experts and researchers generally review official documents and witness reports to confirm execution details, like whether there was evidence that a prisoner made visible or audible expressions of pain; if the inmate was still conscious after a drug was administered; or whether execution workers struggled to find a prisoner’s veins.
Schutte said Ritchie’s sudden, “violent” body movement occurred a few minutes after the witness room blinds opened. He could not hear Ritchie when it happened, nor could he see if Ritchie’s eyes were opened or closed. Schutte also was unable to see the reactions, if any, of anyone present in the execution chamber with Ritchie.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal said during court proceedings last week that DOC’s extensive planning and training requires DOC staff to practice the process at least once each week ahead of a scheduled execution. 
An intravenous line is inserted “into a live (volunteer) every time” a training is held, Neal said, and the condemned inmate undergoes a medical evaluation and weekly assessments of their veins for IV access.
Witnesses did not have visibility into the execution chamber when Ritchie’s IVs were placed. DOC officials did not indicate if any issues arose during insertion.
Groner described pentobarbital as a “potent” drug that, when properly administered, should quickly render a person unconscious “without any movement.”
Pentobarbital is a fast-acting barbiturate approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for specific medical uses in humans and animals. It’s commonly used as a short-term sedative to treat insomnia, as a pre-anesthetic before surgery, and as an emergency treatment for severe seizure conditions. The FDA has also approved the drug for use in animal euthanasia.

It is not approved for use in executions or for causing death in humans; such use is considered “off-label.”
Groner highlighted two potential issues that could have occurred during Ritchie’s execution: the quality of the drugs, and the placement of intravenous lines.
The doctor raised concerns about the unknown age and storage conditions of the pentobarbital obtained by DOC. It’s also unclear how many doses of the drug were administered.
He additionally noted that improperly placed IVs could cause pain and delay the drug’s effectiveness.
“If the drug gets under the skin instead of in the vein, it can definitely burn,” Groner said.
He stressed that a “thorough” autopsy could provide crucial insights into what, if anything, went wrong during the execution.
Indiana does not require an autopsy to be performed after an execution, though. Lawyers said they were unsure if Ritchie’s family would pay to have one done.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently withdrew its own one-drug execution protocol because of what former Attorney General Merrick Garland called “sig­nif­i­cant uncer­tain­ty” about whether exe­cu­tions using pen­to­bar­bi­tal caused unnec­es­sary pain and suf­fer­ing.
Garland’s decision followed a multi-year review and report by the DOJ into the federal execution protocol. The report details some of the ways that using pentobarbital in an execution can cause unnecessary pain and suffering, including the risk of flash pulmonary edema — a condition in which fluid floods the lungs — and extreme pain at the injection site.
No guaranteed public access
The Capital Chronicle confirmed Ritchie had four witnesses present at the execution, which included two of his attorneys, Schutte and Mark Koselke, as well as a litigation specialist. The fourth individual, a woman, was not identified. The fifth witness spot was left unfilled.
The Capital Chronicle made numerous requests to be placed on Ritchie’s personal witness list but was denied.
A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the Capital Chronicle and four other news outlets to pause a state law and DOC policy barring independent media witnesses.

News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
Lanosga stressed that media presence at executions is “critical” for public accountability and warned against relying solely on accounts from officials or those who side with either the victim or the condemned.
“I want a proxy there to tell me what happened,” he said. “Those official accounts are a poor substitute. I don’t want the regime telling me what happened. I don’t think we want, as citizens, a private system of justice. We want justice to be publicly carried out, and this is important for citizens, on behalf of citizens, to have witnesses there.”
He said there are “innumerable” instances in both contemporary and historic times in which official accounts about government acts small and large were later determined to be either vague, missing information, exaggerated, somehow distorted.
Lanosga maintained, too, that limited media access to executions “is part of a larger, troubling trend” of decreased public access to government actions. 
“Citizens are being asked to just accept things that are being done with little access to witnessing how those things are being done,” he said.
Although executions “are gruesome” and many people might prefer “not to know details,” Lanosga said the public interest should supersede individual discomfort. Journalists, he emphasized, “ought to be present on behalf of the public.”
“It’s really important that journalists are present to bear witness to this exercise of power,” he continued. “I think the state wants us to look away from the idea of the death penalty. And maybe to a certain extent, people want to look away and not witness the death penalty being enacted, but I think it’s incumbent upon citizens, if they endorse this action — perhaps especially if they endorse this action by a state government — to acknowledge that it takes place, and to look at it.”

Ilhan Omar gave a succint response to a question posed to her by a reporter from the right-wing Daily Caller a few weeks ago: “F*ck off.”
Not long ago, a politician uttering the phrase may have shocked the Minnesota electorate’s civil sensibilities. But Omar was evidently satisfied with the interaction — she later tweeted it out  — and in a matter of days, if not hours, even conservative posters had moved on.
It took awhile to reach the Upper Midwest, but Democrats here have joined a national trend, employing the kind of crass language that Donald Trump ushered into the political discourse almost a decade ago.
Back in October, less than a month before he and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris would lose the general election, Gov. Tim Walz revved up a friendly audience in Madison.
“Elon’s on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit on these things,” Walz said, pausing for the audience’s laughter. He added: “You know it!” 
The moment went viral, and Walz has since repeated the bit, sparking comparisons to Trump’s affinity for name-calling (though “Trump’s remarks were typically directed toward elected officials of color, not white billionaires,” The New York Times noted, helpfully). 
Minnesota Democratic politicians are usually relatively mild in their cussing, but one thing seems clear: They’re cursing more freely, and often with gusto. 
Since the start of Walz’s vice presidential run, he could frequently be heard bemoaning this or that “damn” thing — “Mind your own damn business” — like a dad suffering over his lawnmower engine, or a frustrated high school football coach. 
In a recent town hall in Texas, he said: “How about we just be proud of our policies, take it everywhere, and we will win the damn election on that.”
But he’ll occasionally rip off a more weighty curse word. In a recently published interview with The Atlantic’s Mark Leibovich, Walz said he regretted that neither he nor Harris went on the Joe Rogan podcast during the campaign.
“I’m like, ‘f*ck it,’” Walz said. “Just go.”
Nearly 10 years ago, Trump transformed the way politicians talk, and especially the way they curse: openly and without apology. He won the 2016 election immediately after the publication of a tape in which he infamously described grabbing women’s genitals and has freely used curse words and vulgar language ever since.
Prior to Trump, cursing was scandalous for politicians. Former President Barack Obama once referred to his opponent Mitt Romney as a “bullshitter,” grabbing headlines and sparking Republican outrage. 
So why are Minnesota Democrats suddenly cursing so much?
Politicians swear in part to seem — irony alert — more authentic, said Melissa Mohr, swearing expert and author of “Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing.”
“A lot of what politicians do in their speeches is quite scripted, and swearing is a way to use language to make it feel like you’re saying things from your heart,” Mohr said.
For Democrats facing the deluge of Trump’s executive actions in the first months of his second term — funding cuts to agencies, mass layoffs, the transfer of immigrants to an El Salvador prison, his defiance of the courts and more — cursing is also a way to emphasize the seriousness of the moment. 
“Usually when we swear, that’s because we’ve got some deep emotion about something, whether it’s pain or frustration or joy,” Mohr said.
But cursing can also backfire when it’s not convincing, Mohr said. 
If voters pick up on a slight hesitation before a bad word, a strange emphasis, or the unusual construction of a phrase, it could signal that the cursing is more of a strategic choice by speechwriters than a genuine burst of emotion from the speaker.
“When it’s not authentic, it comes off as extra not-authentic, and I think that that definitely turns people away,” said Republican lobbyist and local stand-up comedian Brian McDaniel.
As the parties have become more polarized and less inclined to appeal to centrist voters, Republicans — with the notable exception of the commander in chief — have kept their speeches clean so as not to offend the religious base of the party, McDaniel said, whereas Democrats’ cursing can be taken as a way to “stick it to the man.”
Democrats here may have taken a bit longer to jump on the cussing trend because they’re entrenched in the culture of “Minnesota nice.”
Minnesotans and their politicians seem to have a more reserved approach to swearing than people from other regions, though it’s difficult to accurately measure how frequently a population curses. A 2015 map of swear-word frequency compiled by a linguist and based on tweets, seems to indicate that Minnesotans generally swear less, at least in the online public sphere, than people from other areas.
Although lately with the Dems, it’s hard to tell.
On X, DFL Sen. Tina Smith captioned a post by Elon Musk, who was instructing federal employees to send a summary of their accomplishments for the week: “This is the ultimate d*ck boss move from Musk — except he isn’t even the boss, he’s just a d*ck,” Smith wrote. 
And when Smith announced she wouldn’t be seeking re-election, state Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy’s official statement began with a two-word sentence: “Well shit.” (Murphy later showed more restraint: “My mouth is full of cuss words right now,” she said regarding recent negotiations with Republicans on the final day of the legislative session.)
It’s not just a Minnesota thing: U.S. Sen. Elise Slotkin got fiery and profane recently while urging Democrats to “f*cking retake the flag” and to adopt “the goddamn Alpha energy.”
In the case of both Slotkin and Walz, the cussing shows emotion and seeks to shape Democratic identity, melding it to the working class party of old.  
In this populist moment, Mohr said, swearing codes populist. 
“When you break that mold and you swear,” Mohr said, “it kind of brings you to that ‘ordinary’ person’s level.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WalzCurse-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857
,DC,2025-05-22 10:59:54+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republicans-push-through-massive-tax-and-spending-bill-slashing-medicaid,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House early Thursday approved the “big, beautiful bill” that Republican leaders spent months negotiating with centrists and far-right members of the party — two distinct factions that hold vastly different policy goals — over intense opposition from Democrats.The 215-214 vote ships the package to the Senate, where GOP lawmakers are expected to rewrite much of it, before sending it back across the Capitol for final approval, a process likely to stretch through the summer.President Donald Trump, who said he backed the House version, would then need to sign the legislation, which under the complicated process being used by Republicans can pass with just a majority vote in the GOP-controlled Senate.Speaker Mike Johnson said minutes before the vote that he expects lawmakers to give the measure final approval before the Fourth of July.“Now, look, we're accomplishing a big thing here today, but we know this isn't the end of the road just yet,” Johnson, R-La., said. “We've been working closely with leader (John) Thune and our Senate colleagues, the Senate Republicans, to get this done and delivered to the President's desk by our Independence Day. That's July 4. Today proves that we can do that, and we will do that.”Two Republicans voted against passing the bill, which members debated throughout the night prior to the vote just after daylight in the nation’s capital. All Democrats, who dubbed it “one big ugly bill,” were opposed. One GOP lawmaker voted “present.”The 1,116-page package combines 11 bills that GOP lawmakers debated and reported out of committee during the last several weeks. The legislation would:Extend the 2017 tax law, including tax cuts for businesses and individuals;Bolster spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars;Rework energy permitting;Restructure higher education aid such as student loans and Pell Grants;Shift some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food aid program for low income Americans to state governments; andOverhaul Medicaid, the nation’s program for health care for low income people and some people with disabilities.The bill would make deep cuts to Medicaid spending, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.The budget measure would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion.A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released late Tuesday showed the package tilted toward the wealthy, projecting it would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.Republicans hold especially thin majorities in the House and Senate, meaning that nearly every GOP lawmaker — ranging from centrists who barely won their general elections to far-right members who are more at risk of losing a primary challenge — needed to support the bill.Balancing the demands of hundreds of lawmakers led to nearly constant talks during the last few days as Johnson struggled to secure the votes to pass the bill before his Memorial Day deadline.Any deal Johnson made with far-right members of the party risked alienating centrist GOP lawmakers and vice versa.An agreement finally came together Wednesday evening when GOP leaders released a 42-page amendment that made changes to various sections of the package, including the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, and Medicaid work requirements and nixed the potential sale of some public lands. This is a developing story that will be updated.",,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

At residential placements, children under the care of the Department for Children and Families were subjected to hundreds of incidents of restraint and seclusion in 2023 and 2024, data shows. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Youth in Vermont custody have been physically restrained hundreds of times in recent years.","Nate Farnham at home in Waterville on Monday, March 17. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn May 2006, when he was 6 years old, Nate Farnham was removed from his mother’s custody by Vermont’s Department for Children and Families. His mother, with whom he no longer speaks, had a substance use disorder, he said. From his home in Cambridge, Farnham was taken to the Brattleboro Retreat, a residential mental health facility, where he spent most of the next year and a half. There, he clashed frequently with others in the program — “I was extremely violent,” Farnham said — and staff routinely used physical force to subdue him.“Take a kid that’s, you know, almost 7 years old, about 100 pounds soaking wet, and lay two people that are (together) upwards of 400-plus pounds on him,” Farnham said. Nearly 20 years later, he said, those incidents of physical restraint have had a profound and lasting impact on him: Physically and psychologically, it was “devastational,” he said.Farnham is among an untold number of Vermont youth who have been subjected to physical force while in state custody over the years. Now, two years of data — the first figures to be released by the state — shows that such incidents have happened hundreds of times just in the recent past.Vermont youth in residential facilities in the custody of the Department for Children and Families were restrained or secluded, meaning forcibly immobilized or isolated in a room, hundreds of times in 2023 and 2024, the new data shows. As recently as last year, according to the data, children as young as 8 were physically restrained, and children as young as 5 were secluded, sometimes for half an hour or longer.Advocates believe those figures are incomplete, recording only a fraction of the incidents that actually occurred. Even so, the data offers a window into the residential facilities where Vermont sends children and teens — and the sometimes-traumatic events that take place there. Administrators at residential facilities contacted by VTDigger said they are constantly trying to reduce the use of restraints and seclusions, but the practices are sometimes necessary for safety reasons. But restraints and seclusion can be dangerous and psychologically damaging. For youth experiencing them, they can represent a traumatic loss of physical autonomy, Matthew Bernstein, Vermont’s Child, Youth, and Family Advocate, said in an interview. “And for a lot of these kids, their bodily autonomy is essentially the last thing they have left,” he said.What are restraint and seclusion?The term “restraint” refers to a practice in which a person is physically held to prevent them from moving. It’s defined by the U.S. Department of Education as “a personal restriction that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a student to move his or her torso, arms, legs, or head freely.”Seclusions, meanwhile, are instances where a youth is isolated in a room to prevent them from causing harm to themselves or others. The tactics are supposed to be used only as a last resort, and only as a safety measure.“The function of restraint is really to provide for a safety environment,” Tyler Allen, who oversees residential facilities for the state Department for Children and Families, said in an interview earlier this year. “Restraint is really grounded in safety practice, and if the environment is safe, then there is more opportunity for therapy.”Both state officials and advocates for youth in state custody agree restraints and seclusions may be unavoidable in some cases. But the tactics can cause injuries and, in some cases, death.In 2021, for example, the parents of a then-15-year-old girl who stayed at the Vermont Permanency Initiative, a Bennington nonprofit that operates the Vermont School for Girls and the New England School for Girls, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that staff there had broken their daughter’s femur during a 2015 restraint. The case was settled under undisclosed terms the next year. A spokesperson for the nonprofit declined to comment on the suit. Through a lawyer, the parents of the child also declined to comment. The tactics can also cause lasting trauma to youths who may already be traumatized. “From a psychological standpoint, it’s never good,” said Farnham, the former resident, who has advocated for stronger oversight of residential youth facilities.Being restrained repeatedly while in state custody, he said, has had a long-lasting impact on his behavior. When in rooms with large crowds, he said, he immediately notes the exits and avoids going to corners — where, as a child in Vermont residential facilities, staff sometimes caught him before a restraint. “If you were to hang out with me for, like, a week,” he said, “you would see all the little things that I do that most people probably would not.”Newly compiled dataUnder a Vermont law that went into effect in 2023, the Department for Children and Families is required to report all instances of restraint and seclusion of youth in state custody — even those housed out of state — to the Office of the Child, Youth, and Family Advocate. VTDigger obtained the first data compiled by the department showing restraints and seclusions in residential facilities in 2023 and 2024.Over that two-year period, youths were physically restrained or isolated over 500 times in roughly a dozen facilities, according to the data. Advocates, state officials and program leaders say a small number of children account for a disproportionate share of the incidents. Fifty-eight individual youths in state custody accounted for the entirety of the incidents for the second half of 2023 and all of 2024, according to the department.It’s difficult to determine what percentage of youth in residential institutions that number represents, but Allen, of the Department for Children and Families, said that it represents just a “fraction” of the total number of youths who spent time in facilities in that time period. “I don’t think this data shows something unusual or something changing or something aberrant,” he said. “But I think we can also acknowledge that restraint and seclusion incidents are not, in and of themself, a therapeutic intervention.”The department believes that its numbers for the second half of 2023 and 2024 are largely accurate: “Our belief is that it is unlikely that there are many (if any) unaccounted individuals in our numbers,” Allen wrote in an email. But the Office of the Child, Youth, and Family Advocate estimates that the real number of incidents is likely in the thousands. The office sometimes hears from youth and family members about incidents of restraint or seclusion that were not counted in the data, the office’s deputy advocate, Lauren Higbee, said in an interview.What’s more, the statute requires the state to report all instances of restraint or seclusion involving youth in the department’s custody, not just those in residential facilities. But Higbee said her office has received no reports of restraints that took place in other settings. “There are still schools to consider, there’s still hospitals to consider, there’s still inpatient psychiatric facilities to consider,” she said. “And we have no reports from them.”The majority of incidents reported in both 2023 and 2024 come from Seall, a residential treatment facility in Bennington. Descriptions of some of the 2023 incidents, written by staffers, provide a sobering picture of life at the facility, recounting episodes where children attempted to harm others or themselves, break objects or escape.In January 2023, a teenager was trying to get into an office room where staff were storing a confiscated vape, according to the description of the incident. When staff told the teen that she could not enter the office, the girl began to act out: She “was laughing and stating she would fight staff and break the door,” the description reads. “(She) did this multiple times, then kicked the staff office door breaking the frame, again trying to get into the office. She was placed in a restraint.”A March 2023 incident involved a teen who “had been struggling with self-harm,” according to a description of the event. “Staff were informed that she may have something in her room to self-harm with. She was searched with a metal detector. When staff left, she was seen grabbing something from under her mattress. Staff attempted to get (her) to hand it over but she wouldn’t. She was put in a hold to get the item from her.”In one July 2023 episode, a child at Seall “was acting out at bedtime and was told he’d be given a consequence if he didn’t stop which upset him,” a description reads. “He began threatening staff. He then kicked staff and was placed in a hold for safety.”‘Individuals with complex needs’Leaders at Vermont’s residential youth facilities said they are actively working to reduce the number of restraints and seclusions they use.Jim Henry, the executive director of Seall, said in an emailed statement that the 2020 closure of Vermont’s only youth detention center, Woodside, had “introduced a unique group of individuals with complex needs” into Seall’s population. That coincided with a “dramatic increase in the use of restraints,” he wrote. The facility has increased staff, shortened employee workweeks and sought to make the space more therapeutic for youths, Henry said, including hosting weekly visits from a therapy dog and adding off-site activities. “We remain deeply aware of the emotional impact that a physical intervention can have on both youth and staff,” Henry said. Vermont Permanency Initiative, the Bennington nonprofit that operates residential facilities there, reported 36 restraints of Vermont youth in 2024. In three of those incidents, 15-year-old youths were restrained for over 15 minutes.Administrators there said in an interview that they meet weekly to discuss the restraints that took place over the past week and trends in the data they collect. A spike in restraints can often be traced to one particular youth struggling with their emotions after just entering the program or with a traumatic incident at home, they said.  Jeff Caron, the president of the Vermont Permanency Initiative, said in an interview that the data does not capture much of the reality on the ground: Youth enter the facility with mental health issues, family trauma, sometimes aggression or tendencies to self-harm. “The numbers have to have context, you know?” he said. “I mean, it’s not that staff are coming in (saying) ‘I can’t wait to put my hands on that kid!’ It’s dealing with the behaviors that we have. And glass cuts people — if they smash a window, you’re gonna hold them.”Jeff Caron, the president of the Vermont Permanency Initiative. Photo by Peter D’Auria/VTDiggerThe Brattleboro Retreat’s Abigail Rockwell Children’s Center, a youth residential treatment program, reported 17 restraints in 2024. One of those incidents, a “supine floor hold” of a 10-year-old child, lasted for 57 minutes, according to the records. Karl Jeffries, the Brattleboro Retreat’s chief medical officer, said in an interview that the program is “always working, absolutely all the time, to do everything we can to not restrain.”Staff there restrain a patient only when there is no other way to ensure their safety or the safety of others, Jeffries said. And “every time one of them happens, we have an organization-wide meeting the next morning to talk about them, review them, and see if there are things that we can do, any ways to decrease the risk of this happening again.”Asked about the nearly hourlong restraint of the 10-year-old, Jeffries said restraints at the organization are usually brief. But one of the cruel ironies of restraints is that a tactic intended to de-escalate a situation can in fact end up prolonging it.“The challenge is that the act of physically holding somebody can really be a provocative event,” Jeffries said.The 2024 data includes incidents from other programs as well. Community House, a Brattleboro nonprofit, reported 46 incidents of restraint, seclusion or “transport” — meaning, physically moving a youth to a safer space — involving children ages 5 to 10. Twenty-nine of those incidents involved seclusion, per the data. A representative of Community House did not respond to phone calls or emails. The facility operates a short-term “stabilization and assessment program,” according to its website.Brookhaven Treatment and Learning Center, in Chelsea, reported two 2024 incidents to the state, both involving a 12-year-old. Both incidents involved a seclusion — one of which lasted for a total of 42 minutes. Rocky Spino, Brookhaven’s executive director, declined to answer questions about the facility’s use of restraints and seclusions.“I would offer that the topic of ‘restraints and seclusions of youth’ is much too comprehensive and nuanced to accurately capture with a quick series of quotes and in the confines of a print media article,” Spino said in an email.A handful of out-of-state facilities, in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Florida, also reported roughly two dozen restraints and seclusions of Vermont youth in 2024, per the data.‘A system of accountability’Vermont lawmakers are discussing a bill related to restraints and seclusions of youth in state custody, although the legislation is still in its early stages and will not advance until at least next year.The bill, H.30, aims to improve the data being collected and proposes to require “professional development on alternatives to restraint and seclusion” for staff of residential programs.“This is a very simple bill,” Rep. Tiff Bluemle, D-Burlington, the bill’s lead sponsor, said in an interview earlier this year. “It really is focused on building a system of accountability.”The Office of the Child, Youth, and Family Advocate is asking lawmakers to strengthen the bill further by banning particularly dangerous prone restraints outright, and by standardizing and hastening the response times for reporting incidents. “Basically, the concern is that a child will be very seriously injured or killed because there is insufficient oversight of this,” Bernstein, the state’s child advocate, said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Youth in Vermont custody have been physically restrained hundreds of times in recent years.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nate-farnham-2-20250317-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

(Courtesy of state of Indiana)An Indiana woman who wants to sue the doctor who allegedly used his own sperm to inseminate her mother won an appellate ruling last week.
The Indiana Court of Appeals on May 15 granted the woman’s wishes to allow the case to move forward at the local level. The court ruled that the issue of whether the woman – referred to as “anonymous child”  – filed her claim within the two-year statute of limitations period is an issue to be resolved by a jury. 
“We find that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to when Child learned of facts that would have led a person of reasonable diligence to have discovered the malpractice,” Judge Elaine Brown wrote. 
Opposing counsel contended during oral arguments that the woman was aware of the physician’s role as her parents’ fertility doctor prior to the birth of her own daughter in 2019. They said the statute of limitations for the woman’s claims should have commenced no later than the end of 2021. 
But the woman argued she didn’t know the doctor used his semen in cases where semen was already provided — as her mother and father had. 
When that news hit the media, she ordered a DNA testing kit in 2022 and filed suit shortly thereafter. 
The woman was born in 1985. She learned of her biological father, referred to as the “anonymous physician”, following her viewing of the trailer for the 2022 Netflix documentary “Our Father”. 
The Netflix documentary revealed the medical malpractice case of Dr. Donald Cline, former Indianapolis fertility specialist, who admitted in 2017 to using his own sperm to inseminate patients without their knowledge during the 1970s and 1980s. Although Cline is referred to as “anonymous physician” in the legal proceedings, attorneys discussed the documentary in arguments. 
The woman preferred to keep her identity hidden “because her father – does not know that he is not her father.” 
In July 2022, shortly after receiving her DNA test, the woman filed an anonymous complaint for damages against Cline and an anonymous health care group.
The case will now proceed before the local trial court, and could ultimately be decided by a jury.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5e42f46b68c4c.jpg,,,2025-05-22 07:03:32.601857

Tammy Baldwin about their concerns over the impact of Medicaid cuts on families with children such as theirs who have disabilities. (Screenshot/Zoom)As members of Congress continue to debate the Republican budget reconciliation bill that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, Jessica Seawright ponders what that could mean for her young son.
Seawright is a social worker in Southeast Wisconsin. She’s also the mother of a 9-year-old boy with complex medical needs resulting from a genetic condition.
She and her husband — a college professor — have medical coverage through work, but with her son’s condition, which includes cerebral palsy, their health plans could never cover the degree of care he requires.
Medicaid has made the difference, Seawright said Wednesday. It’s helped through the Katie Beckett  program, which enables children with disabilities to have Medicaid coverage while living at home instead of being in an institution; the Medicaid children’s long-term support coverage; and Medicaid support that public schools receive to cover certain services that students with disabilities require.
Her son has been able to thrive living with her and her husband, Seawright said — but worry clouds the future.
“We look toward his adulthood, knowing that disability and aging programs that would support him staying in the community — where we, our family and our community, know he belongs — are being dismantled and defunded,” Seawright said. “Forcing us and others like us into medical bankruptcy is not a solution.”
Seawright was one of two parents who said Wednesday that their lives and their children’s lives could be profoundly upended by the Medicaid reductions that are included in the budget reconciliation proposal.
They spoke during a webinar conducted by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), who has been an outspoken critic of the budget bill’s Medicaid cuts.
“Our neighbors, our friends and our colleagues at work who rely on Medicaid and are scared, really scared,” Baldwin said. She cited estimates produced by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee that with cuts to Medicaid as well as to the Affordable Care Act, the legislation could reduce health care for nearly  14 million Americans, including almost 230,000 Wisconsin residents.
The money saved, she added, would be used to extend and expand tax cuts enacted in 2017, during the first Trump administration. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has said the tax cuts primarily favor the wealthy and corporations.
“It’s giveaways for their wealthy friends at the cost of Americans’ health and lives,” Baldwin said. “That’s the deal.”
Baldwin said the choice that U.S. House Republicans made to advance the bill in committee in the early hours of Wednesday morning was a sign that “Republicans know what they’re doing is deeply unpopular.”
She dismissed claims that the objective of the bill’s authors was to address waste, fraud or abuse in Medicaid and other safety net programs.
“I would be happy to come to the table to write a bill that truly gets at fraud and abuse,” Baldwin said. “We want that out of Medicaid. We want that out of Medicare. But that is not what this bill does. This bill terminates health care for Wisconsin families.”
Besides being a mother of a child who has been helped by Medicaid’s programs, Seawright has experienced Medicaid through two other lenses.
When she and her sister were growing up, their mother was relying on Medicaid for the family’s health care. That helped give the family stability so that her mom could go to community college, become a medical assistant and get full-time work in health care with insurance through her employer, Seawright said.
In her own job as a social worker, she added, some of the clients she works with have Medicaid.
Both her childhood experience and her role as a mental health provider have made her critical of proposals to cut Medicaid, Seawright said — especially one to add work requirements as a condition for adults considered “able-bodied” to enroll in Medicaid.  
“Creating more barriers for people to access the care they need … individuals losing their primary care providers and their specialists, from my perspective, is just a cruel response that is steeped in distrust of those of us who are doing the work day to day,” Seawright said.
Also on the webinar was Brooke Wampole, who lives in northern Wisconsin. She and her husband have a 4-year-old son who was found to have long delays in his development.
About two years ago he was screened and qualified for services and therapies covered by Medicaid programs for children with disabilities, and over time, his clinicians helped him first to “exist, to self-regulate, to see the world around him and not find it to be a threat,” Wampole said.
The family’s regular health insurance “could never cover the cost” those treatments required. “ Medicaid programs “have been absolutely instrumental in our lives.”
In the last year, her son has begun speaking one-syllable words. “My favorites or Mommy and Dada,” Wampole said, then added with a smile, “however, he is pretty partial to talking about trapezoids. And raisins.”
The thought of losing Medicaid coverage “is terrifying,” Wampole said — both because of the loss of services for her son, but also because of its impact on other families.
“I worry what our world looks like without Medicaid,” Wampole said. “Other families, they could be way worse off … and cutting Medicaid could hurt them even more than my family. I don’t want to be part of a system that contributes to that.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)All four Idaho Republican congressmen want the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA, to move its Pacific Northwest regional office from Seattle to Idaho.
In March, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced plans to relocate six of the agency’s regional offices based in cities “that do not comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” The SBA’s Region 10 Office, based in Seattle, covers four states: Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska. 
In a joint letter, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, and U.S. Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher wrote, “unlike other states served by the Seattle Office, Idaho has demonstrated a strong commitment to putting American citizens first. Our state has enacted a statewide ban on sanctuary cities, and the Idaho Congressional Delegation has repeatedly worked to prevent illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities from abusing federal funding.”
The SBA is a federal government agency that helps small businesses get loans.
“By relocating the regional office to Idaho, the SBA would ensure its services align with President Trump’s priorities, directly benefitting law-abiding business owners,” the Idaho congressmen continued. 
The SBA has district offices across the U.S. Idaho’s counties are split between being managed by the Boise District and the Seattle District.

The forecasting area covers two busy interstates that frequently see extreme weather. 
The post Staffing shortage, DOGE-led cuts halt Cheyenne’s around-the-clock weather monitoring appeared first on WyoFile .","The National Weather Service ended 24/7 operations at its Cheyenne forecasting office due to a staffing shortage and cuts by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
The office, which forecasts weather conditions for the southeast corner of Wyoming, does not have enough meteorologists to staff the overnight shift. As with other DOGE-related cuts to services, federal officials aren’t providing many details. 
In response to several written questions — including what the reduced services will mean for forecasting for two interstates that move freight for many industries in the Cheyenne office’s coverage area, or if Wyoming’s only other national forecasting office will absorb the overnight duties — the National Weather Service’s parent agency provided a statement. 
“The National Weather Service continues to meet its core mission of providing life-saving forecasts, warning, and decision support services to the public, our partners and stakeholders,” Kim Doster with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in the statement. 
“In the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
The Cheyenne office’s coverage area includes Wyoming’s Albany, Carbon, Converse, Goshen, Laramie, Niobrara and Platte counties, as well as the western Nebraska panhandle. 
‘Rarely quiet’
The area produces “an extremely diverse and rarely quiet set of forecast challenges,” which range from blizzards and snow squalls to very low humidity and high, erratic winds ideal for wildfire combustion, according to a NWS Cheyenne website.  
The area where Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming meet is also a hotspot for hail — some have even dubbed it “Hail Alley.”
“Storms can produce anything from giant destructive hail to plowable amounts of small to medium sized hail,” the NWS website states.

This time of year, between May and June, the area sees a short river flood season thanks to spring runoff. Flash flooding from thunderstorms and burn scars are responsible for most hydrological challenges in the area. Following the 2020 Mullen Fire, which burned over 175,000 acres west of Laramie, “there are ongoing issues with flash flooding and mudslides in the sensitive ecology left behind,” according to the website. 
“Constant situational awareness and quick thinking are essential to successful hydrological forecasts and warnings here!” 
While the Cheyenne office’s coverage area includes a sparse population compared to its geographical footprint, it also includes two high-traffic corridors — Interstate 80 and Interstate 25. 
The Wyoming Department of Transportation “relies on quick, accurate and localized weather forecasting, and the National Weather Service is one of our partners in providing that information to your employees and the general public,” the agency wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
“We are working with our partners, including our contracted meteorologist team at Day Weather, to determine the potential impacts of an overnight closure to the Cheyenne NWS office.” 
Help from neighbors
As for weather advisories, will people in the Cheyenne office’s area still receive notice in the event of hazardous or extreme weather?
“The answer is yes,” Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, told WyoFile. 
“Because while there’ll be no staff working overnight in Cheyenne, the [NWS] offices adjacent and around you will be monitoring the conditions,” he said. 
That includes offices in Riverton — the only other NWS forecasting station in Wyoming — as well as Rapid City, North Platte and Boulder.

Staffing challenges
About 600 employees left the National Weather Service between 2010 and 2025, Fahy said. Roughly 600 more have left the agency in the first 90 days of the Trump administration. 
About 100 probationary NWS employees were fired just after inauguration, Fahy said, which includes meteorologists, hydrologists and technical specialists. Two hundred more lost their jobs on Valentine’s Day, alongside an uncounted throng of other federal employees. Another 300 cashed out on early retirement. 
Altogether, that’s meant several other NWS offices across the country do not have enough meteorologists to staff an overnight shift, as the Washington Post reported last week. 
There is an upside, Fahy said, to having surrounding NWS offices monitoring the Cheyenne area during the overnight shift — it amounts to more eyes. But ultimately, the better solution, Fahy said, is for Congress to fully fund the National Weather Service and for the Trump administration to make an exception to the federal hiring freeze. 
“For the price of a cup of coffee, and times that by the population of the United States. That’s the budget for the entire National Weather Service for one year,” Fahy said, which comes out to approximately $1.25 billion. 
“If we all pass the hat and get $3.50 a piece, you’ve got solid weather operations for weather service,” he said. 
Wyoming’s delegation has largely backed the Trump administration’s undertaking to shrink the federal government. Meanwhile, some of their Republican neighbors in Congress have successfully pushed back on DOGE cuts to NWS operations. 
After Nebraska’s all-GOP delegation pressed the White House to restore the agency’s ability to deploy weather balloons in their home state, the Trump administration decided to fund more staff, according to the Nebraska Examiner. 
Neither Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis nor Rep. Harriet Hageman responded to WyoFile’s request for comment.

(Photo courtesy of the Idaho National Laboratory)IDAHO FALLS – Members of the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee toured Idaho National Laboratory research facilities Wednesday as the lab is in the process of building its first new nuclear reactors in 50 years. 
Some of INL’s top officials told the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee they expected the next four years to usher in a new nuclear renaissance that INL will be at the center of.
“It’s really intended to get INL back into the role of building and operating new reactors on site and supply chains that need to be exercised, getting us back into design and then ultimately building them and operating them,” INL Deputy Director Todd Combs said.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the budgets for every state agency and department. 
JFAC’s tour included stops at Idaho National Laboratory’s Research and Education Campus located in Idaho Falls as well as the Hot Fuel Examination Facility and the Sample Preparation Laboratory located at the Materials and Fuels Complex.

The Materials and Fuels Complex is part of a vast 890 square-mile research complex located in the desert west of Idaho Falls that is often referred to simply as “the site.”
INL currently operates four nuclear reactors and is considered the country’s leading nuclear energy research and development national laboratory.
  Idaho National Laboratory more than nuclear energy, fuels research hub 

But Combs told JFAC members INL does a lot more than nuclear energy and fuels research. 
INL researchers and staff also focus on cyber security, electric vehicle infrastructure, artificial intelligence, or AI, homeland security and defense. 
INL has built armor for the Abrams tanks and conducted research into vulnerabilities in the electric grid and how to combat those vulnerabilities. 
INL teams have conducted research on electric vehicle infrastructure like charging stations and built the system that powered the Mars Perseverance rover. 
“One might ask, how does this align currently with what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish?” Combs said. “And if you look at executive orders like Unleashing American Energy, and if you look at Secretary of Energy (Chris Wright), his initial memo, and everything he’s been talking about since he took over as secretary of energy, we fall right in line with what they’re trying to accomplish.”
INL celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, and Combs told legislators the lab is growing and ramping up research and operations. Since 2017, INL has grown from about 3,750 employees to 6,500 employees today. 
Since what is now known as INL was founded in 1949, 52 reactors have been built and demonstrated on the site, Combs said.
INL currently operates four nuclear reactors, but the lab is in the process of building its first new reactors in 50 years.
“We’ve got a number of projects right now over the next decade that are coming online as well that are going to be reactors, 53 and 54 and beyond,” Combs said. 
INL made headlines last month when state officials and Department of Energy officials announced a waiver to a 1995 nuclear waste settlement agreement that allows for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho for research at INL. A waiver was necessary because the 1995 settlement agreement called for limiting new shipments of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho and removing certain types of spent nuclear fuel in order to prevent the state from becoming a dumping ground for the nation’s spent nuclear fuel.
 Tour allows legislators to get closer look at research facilities located in eastern Idaho 

Although the Idaho Legislature adjourned the 2025 legislative session on April 4 and is not in session now, JFAC regularly conducts interim meetings to keep an eye on the state budget and learn about how different agencies and organizations spend the money that JFAC approves in the budget every year.
“I’ve never been out there (to INL’s site),” Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said. “Born and raised in Idaho. You would think I would have (visited before), but no. I loved it, and it was fascinating. The thing that really grabbed me was they did so much more than just the nuclear energy. I had no idea about the tanks and all that kind of stuff they’re doing, and the AI. It’s just cutting-edge scientific stuff going on out there.”

“It’s good, I think, for the whole JFAC bench to get a chance to see that and to see we’ve been involved in buying buildings (that INL uses),” Grow added. “The state is involved in this, even though we tend to think that it’s a federal (facility).”
A clear highlight for several JFAC members was entering a hot room at the Sample Preparation Laboratory that is under construction at the site. There isn’t yet any nuclear material in the hot room because it is under construction. But once nuclear materials enter the facility, the public won’t be able to enter the hot room that JFAC members entered Wednesday. 
Legislators did not vote on any bills or budgets during the three-day interim meeting tour. 
The tour kicked off Monday at College of Eastern Idaho, where two health care officials told legislators that Idaho’s near total abortion ban has caused OB-GYNs and other medical professionals to leave the state. 

JFAC members may conduct a fall interim tour this year as well, although a legislative staffer told the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday that plans are not finalized.
The next regular session of the Idaho Legislature is scheduled to begin in January.
Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as a JFAC co-chair with Grow, said the entire three-day spring tour was valuable.
Horman said the tour gave legislators who normally work out of the Idaho State Capitol in Boise a rare opportunity to get a closer look at important facilities and programs located in eastern Idaho that they might not have otherwise seen.  
“I was so proud to see the way our community here welcomes legislators from across the state, and wanted to share with us the great things they’re doing to help the citizens of Idaho,” Horman said.  
An Idaho Capita Sun reporter participated in the entirety of Wednesday’s tour of INL facilities, and the reporter agreed not to take any photos, in accordance with INL’s photo policy. Instead, an INL photographer documented the JFAC tour.

One of the greatest planetary migrations in the world is happening just overhead. Guest columnist Dave Throgmorton advises it's good for us to pause and take it in.
The post Feeling down? Look up! appeared first on WyoFile .","There is much to love about spring in Wyoming, and I would like to suggest one more way to appreciate the natural beauty of our state. 

Opinion

On May 9 some 440,000 birds migrated across Carbon County. They traveled northeast at a speed of about 30 mph. We didn’t notice them because they were flying mainly between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. but also because they were flying at about 3,000 feet.
Even though I can’t see them, knowing an epic journey is unfolding above me instills a sense of wonder and awe I find comforting, given the tumult in the world right now. 
Among the birds migrating north across Carbon County were Bullock’s orioles (just appeared last week!), yellow warblers, black headed grosbeaks and blue-winged teals. The American avocets showed up on May 2 when we had an epic 1,264,200 fly over. Mostly, we are seeing waterfowl, but the ruby-crowned kinglets and their cousins will show up any day now.
I know this because I follow a site called Birdcast. Designed by Cornell Labs, it tracks bird migrations across every county in the contiguous United States every spring and fall. Their website — birdcast.info — tells a great story about how they came to be able to make such predictions following the development of more and more sophisticated radar equipment and satellites.
At the end of the day, the system relies on normal people observing the lives of the birds around them and reporting what they see. Sometimes we don’t see birds so much as we hear them. I know the grosbeaks are in Carbon County because I heard one on the grounds of the Wyoming Frontier Prison, though I never spotted it. I can’t identify anything other than the common birds in the neighborhood by sound, but another Cornell Labs program can. 
The Merlin Bird ID app can be downloaded for free on your phone and has a recording function that can identify birds by their songs, chirps, cackles or other noises. I’ve used it across the U.S. and in Honduras. Yesterday, it picked the brown-headed catbird out of a cacophony of starlings, grackles and red-winged blackbirds (the latter of which seems to have an unusual presence in Rawlins this spring). 
It has been well substantiated that birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs. Scientific American has a short summary about how we know this, but it is increasingly likely that birds evolved from theropods: velociraptors, T. rexes and the like. So it turns out The Flintstones was a documentary! We still walk the planet while millions of dinosaurs fly overhead.
Somehow, that seems to put the absurdity of the moment, of any moment, into a new frame. And a new frame is always helpful.
So while you are enjoying spring as it splashes color across our landscape, look up and enjoy how your county plays a part in the flight of the dinosaurs, one of the greatest planetary migrations in the world. Just keep your mouth closed.

(Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything. 
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson sat out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property. 
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump Administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: the Trump Administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump Administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.
Cave City pushes forward
Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump Administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
  Cave City, Ark. Mayor Jonas Anderson motions toward a storm-damaged home. Cave City could be on the hook for roughly $300,000 in damages. (Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City. 

        !function(){“use strict”;window.addEventListener(“message”,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[“datawrapper-height”]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(“iframe”);for(var t in a.data[“datawrapper-height”])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[“datawrapper-height”][t]+”px”;r.style.height=d}}}))}();

FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.” 
Fema Politics
Over the past two years, the Biden Administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump Administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020. 
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance. 
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: the federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for President Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.  
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold. 
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.
  Cave City’s welcome sign rests against a building. It was damaged along with much of the town after a twister ripped through Northeast Arkansas in March. (Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said. 
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis, Mo. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing…they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

(Photo: Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Proposed cuts in federal healthcare spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act could force more than 250,000 Tennesseans to join the ranks of the uninsured, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation found. 
Healthcare advocates are closely following House debate over a legislative package that would make significant changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. 
The reconciliation bill would cut Medicaid spending nationwide by at least $716 billion, representing the single largest cut in the program’s history, a separate analysis by the Congressional Budget Office found. 
The bill would achieve those cuts in a variety of ways, including by introducing stricter enrollment and work requirements for the low-income and disabled Tennesseans who rely on TennCare, Tennessee’s Medicaid program.
The bill would also eliminate so-called premium tax credits that have helped individuals purchase their own health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Together, the two provisions could cost between 190,000 – 310,000 Tennesseans access to TennCare or private insurance through the healthcare marketplace, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.
Much, however, remains in flux about the final language of the omnibus federal spending bill as it heads to a vote on the House floor. The bill includes a significant increase in spending on immigration enforcement and an extension of tax cuts created during President Donald Trump’s first administration.

(Photo courtesy of Carol Chapin)This week, the U.S. House of Representatives and Wisconsin’s Republican members — U.S. Reps. Bryan Steil, Derrick Van Orden, Glenn Grothman, Scott Fitzgerald, Tony Wied and Tom Tiffany — are supporting a budget that would slash federal Medicaid funding by $790 billion, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office estimate. 
For my family, this isn’t just a number on a budget sheet somewhere in Washington. For us, it is deeply personal. These cuts have the potential to devastate our lives.
My son Liam lives with a developmental disability. Thanks to Medicaid — and more specifically, a category known as Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) — he’s able to live independently in his own apartment. He receives support each day to help him manage meals, take his medications, and safely get to his two part-time jobs using paratransit.
He volunteers at a local food pantry. He makes art. He participates in community programs for people with disabilities. He takes community college courses and continuing education classes, and his goal is an associate’s degree in architectural technology. He’s proud to call Madison’s Eastmoreland neighborhood home.
All of this is possible because of Medicaid. But the Home and Community-Based Services that make his life possible are considered “optional” under federal Medicaid law. They’re on the chopping block if Congress moves forward with the proposed cuts.
If the federal government cuts its share of Medicaid funding, our state will face a painful decision. We will either use more state dollars to fill the gap, or make cuts — fewer people covered, fewer services, lower provider pay. For Liam and others, that means less support, fewer community programs and a greater risk of institutionalization. 
Even with Medicaid, it took our family years to find a supportive care agency with an opening. These services are already stretched to the limit. Some Republican members of Congress are advocating for hard caps on Medicaid costs which would further degrade these essential programs.
Medicaid is not just an insurance program. It is the infrastructure that makes independent living possible for people with disabilities. And it is already under strain. Here in Wisconsin, some disability advocacy organizations have gone months without federal funding due to administrative budget cuts. The signs are all around us: The safety net is fraying. 
If Congress ultimately cuts federal Medicaid spending, we will witness the unraveling of vital support systems: most critically, Home and Community-Based Services. For thousands of people like Liam, this would mean being forced from their homes, with many facing the possibility of institutionalization.
Keeping people in their homes has been a bipartisan issue for decades. Home and Community-Based Services are both significantly cheaper and more empowering for our community-members with disabilities. 
I urge our elected officials — especially those who have said they want to protect “the vulnerable” — to stop these irresponsible cuts to Medicaid. Liam’s life, and the lives of so many others in Wisconsin, depend on it.

(Michael Loccisano | Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”

States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Angela Rigas, chair of the Michigan House Oversight Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government, released a scathing statement Wednesday evening blasting Attorney General Dana Nessel over continued delays in producing requested documents related to the Flint water criminal prosecutions.
Nessel’s office delivered numerous documents to Rigas’s office on Wednesday, but the representative said it was not at all what she requested.
“Dana Nessel’s office sent us an incomplete, incoherent mess of documents on a password-protected flash drive like they were bringing us the Holy Grail,” Rigas said. 
Rigas had requested documents related to the legal battles that ensued during Nessel’s term and in the aftermath of Flint’s water supply being contaminated in 2014. The contamination occurred due to a switch of the water supply without proper lead contamination prevention.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXFormer Attorney General Bill Schuette began an investigation and prosecution, the latter of which began in 2016. Schuette charged a city of Flint employee and two employees with what was then known as the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality [now known as the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy].
Nessel became attorney general in 2018 and scuttled Schuette’s investigation and prosecution to begin anew in 2021. She formed a Flint water prosecution team led by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy and former Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud while Nessel spearheaded the civil litigation side, which resulted in a mammoth settlement.
The criminal cases resulted in charges against former Governor Rick Snyder and several members of his administration, but those charges were later dismissed after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the prosecutorial team had used a one-man grand jury process to indict them without at first holding a preliminary examination that would have given the defendants a chance to poke holes in the attorney general’s presentation of probable cause.
Justices of the high court ruled the process as unconstitutional, and the charges were dismissed shortly thereafter.
Rigas (R-Caledonia) as the chair of the House Oversight subcommittee, requested records from Nessel on March 12 with a deadline of March 25 to give the subcommittee various documents. The request included a comprehensive itemized list of all billable hours, legal fees and associated costs incurred during Nessel’s tenure as attorney general, including personnel time, outside counsel and expert witnesses; a breakdown of all state funds allocated and expended on these cases; copies of contracts and invoices or memorandums of understanding with third parties retained by her office; and a summary of reimbursements, settlements or cost recoveries tied to the cases.
Nessel requested an eight-week extension, which Rigas granted, with a deadline of Tuesday.
Rigas in a news release issued Wednesday evening said the attorney general’s staff brought a password protected flash drive to Rigas’ office, which was also shared with some members of the Lansing Capitol press corps. Nessel’s office also shared a copy of a letter sent to Rigas’ office on Tuesday indicating that the document haul was just one half of those requested by Rigas and that the other portion would be delivered to the representative on or before June 17.
Rigas said that the flash drive contained “a mass array of unrelated documents that were never requested, mostly from [former Attorney General] Bill Schuette’s tenure.” The documents delivered to Rigas mostly contained contracts with attorneys and appointed special counsel Todd Flood and various invoices from Flood’s office.
Needless to say, Rigas was unhappy with what was turned over to her office.
“[Nessel] and her office have consistently failed to meet deadline after deadline, and it’s unacceptable,” Rigas said. “She has failed to follow simple directions and comply with what has so clearly been requested. There will be no more extensions. No more games. This ends now.”

At their core, our statewide meetings amounted to a democracy tour that centered on the foundation of the U.S. Constitution and the duty of elected officials to honor their sacred oaths of office. Deep concerns over the rule of law and due process were repeatedly expressed. We heard distinct fear over exploding executive authority and waning influence from Congress. In fact, concerns over possible implementation of martial law were shared as President Trump expands power in defiance of the courts and Congress.
Attendees repeatedly asked whether the use of the Alien Enemies Act was lawful. Town hall participants queried us about the growing number of constitutional questions before the courts. We were repeatedly asked whether America was in a constitutional crisis. We both affirmed a looming crisis.  
Your avoidance of Idahoans has resulted in your further isolation from the common sense and pragmatism of Idahoans.
During our town halls, Elon Musk shared news cycles with President Trump grotesquely demonstrating how $290 million in 2024 campaign contributions can corrupt our elections and buy a seat adjacent to the Resolute Desk. Idahoans expressed shock at how an unelected billionaire took a chainsaw rather than a scalpel to our government.  
You would have received an earful on the Musk team’s hacking of our most personal data. Idahoans believe they must rely solely on the judiciary to protect citizens’ rights under the Constitution while Congress stands complicit. Our neighbors clearly know the proper bounds of executive power and the constitutional role of checks and balances by Congress in preventing authoritarians from hijacking our democracy. What is unclear are your views on these important subjects.
If you had accompanied us, you would have heard a great deal of anger and frustration over the shock and awe emanating daily from the White House. They voiced serious disdain for the performative executive orders, rambling press statements, revenge-based ad hominem attacks on opponents, sycophantic fawning from cabinet members and daily violations of due process. We heard all of this from your constituents.
Idahoans are not fooled by the White House gaslighting strategy of quickly diverting Americans’ attention from one shiny object to another. It seems like ancient history when you remained silent as 1,600 January 6 insurrectionists were pardoned after rioters disrupted the peaceful transfer of power by violating our Capitol and your offices. You meekly stand by as President Trump upends our 80-year-old international alliances through bullying and belittling.   Idahoans don’t understand why ALL CAPS intemperance has replaced diplomacy.
Town hall attendees expressed concern that MAGA ideologues and tech-capitalists are gunning for our public lands, thereby restricting our ability to hunt, recreate, graze, hike and cherish our magnificent resources. Current and retired public land managers spoke passionately about their love of country and pride in their special knowledge so important to protecting our natural resources.
Concern by rural Idahoans were shared with us. Cuts to Medicaid could cause closures of rural hospitals despite an ballot initiative approved by 61% of Idahoans to expand Medicaid.
The lack of clarity on tariff policies is causing chaos among farmers who rely on exports. Similarly, Idaho small businesses appear to be collateral damage on the mis-handled tariff rollouts. 
The dairy industry is waiting for the next shoe to drop on immigration. Rural school districts are threatened by vouchers prioritizing urban private schools. An end run on clear water standards can threaten anadromous fish runs. Sources of objective news for rural Idaho through the Public Broadcasting System are headed to the chopping block, creating larger news deserts.
Idahoans stated concerns about dark money in the political system. They equate your silence with dollar-fueled intimidation and raised the Citizens United decision on many occasions. Billionaire cabinet members have been confirmed who appear to be ideologically selected and driven primarily by personal loyalty rather than to the Constitution. Idaho has a strong record on human rights that could be displaced with DEI conspiracy theories and anti-woke messaging.  Misinformation is rampant.  
Clearly, town hall participants were upset with Democrats and Republicans alike for allowing President Trump to shatter norms, challenge constitutional safeguards, defy court decisions, govern by executive orders, upend decades-old alliances, prioritize loyalty as a primary qualification for public service, attack institutions based on revenge, lie and dissemble daily, and put our economy and retirement security at risk through chaotic tariff gambles.   
Overall, our town halls were centered on protecting our democracy, rule of law and constitution. We listened. We learned. We were inspired by the patriotism and civic concern of our fellow Idahoans who approached the microphones to speak on issues big and small. In each town hall there was a deep commitment to find common purpose to protect our precious democracy now under attack.

Patrick Morrisey hikes the newest Mountaineer Mile Trail at Summersville Lake State Park in Summersville, W.Va. on May 9, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)

Among the new construction and second-growth forest above the rock cliffs of Summersville Lake, Gov. Patrick Morrisey cut a ribbon, did some media and walked the third Mountaineer Mile hiking tract. Steps from where the local edition of his gubernatorial predecessor’s Almost Heaven Swing offers a selfie-ready sit, the governor walked the loop of the newly designated trail. The obligatory press availability of such festivities involved the governor extolling the virtues of setting an example of “if I can do it, with all the challenges in place, certainly everyone in West Virginia, if you have the chance, get out and walk a mile.” 
While Summersville Lake State Park is the first new officially designated one in over 30 years, West Virginia’s State Parks have long been a source of not only recreational opportunity but local pride. As gateways to some of West Virginia’s best scenery, natural wonders, and preserved environments, the state park system has been the public facing portal for the wild and wonderful for generations. Country roads might take you home, but designated camping and outdoor recreation areas are vital to attracting West Virginia tourism as well as being go-to places for locals. Plus, along with West Virginias, walking is always free in addition to being good for the body as well as the soul.  
The Mountaineer Mile initiative is planned to expand to 32 West Virginia State Parks. The benefits of such a marriage are obvious: Take a new initiative, marry it to one of West Virginia’s most successful state-run programs, let the press and social media streams cross on something that is common sense and everyone across the political spectrum can agree is a good thing. 
But politics, like hiking the hills, isn’t about how you start, it is how you finish. Which is a good thing for Morrisey. The Mountaineer Mile is part of a larger push for healthy legislation, regulation and policy proposals. During a “Make America Healthy Again” joint event in March with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Morrisey found himself on the receiving end of what many took to be weight jokes from RFK. The reaction ranged from laughing it off, which is what Morrisey did, to fat shaming accusations in national outlets, to others finding it a cringy and inappropriate break in the West Virginia ethos of “we can poke fun of us and ours, but you can’t” regarding outsiders. 
The viral moment with the highly controversial Kennedy highlights the problem of walking the line between prudent policy and performative politics. Morrisey — to his credit — has the self-awareness to realize that in the highly-visual world of modern politics talking about government-enforced health in others has a prerequisite of taking action and personal accountability himself. That is just common sense, a little media/political savvy, and also good basic leadership. 
Trickier is balancing his current battle to remove soda from SNAP benefits while the southern coalfields of West Virginia are struggling under a water crisis. Or being in lock-step with the still very popular in West Virginia Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to cut federal funding to a state like West Virginia which receives 27% of its annual revenue from Washington, D.C. Or the escalating vaccination fight that has combined health care debates, education issues, and personal freedom with legal questions, contradictory policy and plenty of raw emotions. 
Then there is still the looming need for a legislative special session to potentially deal with a PEIA can that is annually kicked down the road by delegates and state senators who are under the umbrella of a supermajority but have been shown to have plenty of divisions beneath it. 
Medical science tells us exercise in general, and walking specifically, is great not only for physical health but also mental health and stress relief. Trekking out and back from the newly-designated Hughes Ferry Day Use Area at West Virginia’s newest state park on a glorious May day was surely a respite for Morrisey and the many claims on his time and attention. The Mountaineer Mile is one of those initiatives where good policy and good politics meet at a place of agreement. A rare place these days, agreement … one that doesn’t have much demand for a sanctioned hiking trail to get there, nor will have a well-worn trail there and back again. Shame, that. 
Performative politics that has good policy behind it is just good politics and good policy in a good public package. A good politician dreams of such things. A great politician makes such things a reality. But that is a fine line to try and walk for anyone — Morrisey included — for any stretch, let alone a mile. That’s a long way to lug a health initiative that is light on the science and heavy on the internet feels and populist politics. A distance that is still early days in  a four-year term leading the Mountain State into the future. For Morrisey, the start has had missteps in putting in his miles when the performative politics outweighed the prudent policy. We will see how he finishes.

This is the third in a series about homelessness in Western Kentucky.
CENTRAL CITY — Pastor Jennifer Banks and other leaders of Abundant Life Church were not sure what to expect when the mayor of this Western Kentucky town called a meeting to talk about their plans for helping people who are experiencing homelessness.
They had briefed the mayor and a few city officials once before. This time they were surprised to see downtown business owners and other city officials also gathered in the room.
They soon heard that the church’s plan — they had dubbed it the “Beacon of Hope” —  was setting off alarms.

They were warned that their outreach to locals in need would attract — was already attracting — people from other places, raising fears that the community’s already short supply of housing and services would be strained even further. The specter was raised of Austin, Texas, where voters banned panhandling and camping in public places in response to burgeoning encampments.
“What will happen to a city that takes in all of this stuff — it’s destroyed,” said Central City Mayor Tony Armour. “We’re short on homes for people that live here, but the more we reach out for people to come in here, the shorter we’re going to be for homes.”
Zachary Banks provided the Lantern with an audio recording of the meeting.
Mayor Armour did not respond to requests seeking an interview about the December gathering. The Lantern sent emails requesting an interview, left messages by phone and in person at city hall.
During the meeting, Armour said constituents were complaining about seeing homeless people around the church and about water running off from its mobile  shower. “We’ve got major people upset here in the city about the church.” 
Abundant Life had gained a reputation as a place people could come for a meal and other resources. The church had allowed people to sleep in its parking lot when they had nowhere else to go. The Felix Martin Foundation, a local nonprofit, provided a grant to install a mobile shower outside the church.

At one point during the meeting, the mayor said to Jennifer Banks, “You’re not seeing the big picture. You’re seeing the kindness of your heart, and I appreciate that. I love you for that. But you know what? We’re not willing to destroy our community.”
“We’re not either, sir,” Banks responded. “The church was supposed to take care of widows. The church was supposed to take care of orphans. We’re supposed to feed. We’re supposed to clothe, and at the end of the day, Abundant Life Church-Central City is just trying to be that.” 
The meeting ended with tentative plans to meet again and Armour saying there were different visions on “how to move forward and what to do.” 
The mayor and Abundant Life Church leaders haven’t had any meetings since, and the “Beacon of Hope” plan to buy a local motel and transform it into something more is still in the talking stages.

The motel is already a place where people without shelter stay, sometimes paid for by a local church or members of a loose coalition of community members trying to help people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing. 
The “Beacon of Hope” idea for the motel: Turn the rooms into efficiency apartments, where tenants could pay rent to build up a financial record, eventually moving on to other housing. 
Local agencies could come in and provide pop-up services — dental clinics, mental health care — and the church would offer  Bible studies. When asked if the idea would be a form of transitional housing, Jennifer Banks said “what is in our heart fits in no category that already exists.
“If services are offered in one location, even if it’s once a month, even if it’s once every six months — if it’s accessible to you zero times a year, but now it is twice a year, that can change the whole dynamic of everything,” she said.
Jennifer Banks said the church is still in conversations with the owner of the Central Inn about a possible purchase. 
Meanwhile, disagreements over how to help have frayed the informal coalition seeking solutions. Some arguments are over how to help people who are using drugs.  The debates also center on numbers: How many people are experiencing homelessness in Muhlenberg County? Does that number justify something like an emergency shelter?
AsheLynn Andrews, operator of a tattoo shop in Central City, worked closely with Gwen Clements and Abundant Life Church until they split over who and how to help.

In an interview in October, Andrews argued there is no need for a shelter — something she thinks would attract homeless people from other places — because there are only a handful of homeless people in Central City.
Clements, on the other hand, says she knows of dozens of people across Muhlenberg County who are homeless at least art of the time. Numbers are fluid, she said, changing depending on the time of year, weather and individual personal circumstances.
The Point in Time Count — an annual, federally-coordinated count of the number of people experiencing homelessness across the country on one day of the year — counted just one person as unsheltered in Muhlenberg County in 2024.
Advocates for the unhoused and even federal officials acknowledge the count is an underestimate because unsheltered people can be hard to find, the number of volunteers surveying can vary from community to community, the timing of the count in January when it’s cold means fewer people are outside, and the count is only a snapshot of one day. 
Another count by Kentucky school districts that seeks to capture the number of students in unsafe and unstable housing situations reported 34 students, all of them in kindergarten or first grade, in that category in Muhlenberg County during the 2023-24 school year. 
Muhlenberg County spans hundreds of square miles of rolling hills, making it hard sometimes to find people who are known to be without shelter. Finding them becomes urgent when the weather turns dangerous.

In January, the loose coalition sprang into action when bitterly cold air swept across the state, plunging temperatures into the deadly range.
Clements took to Facebook, asking her neighbors for donations to put unhoused people into motel rooms at the Central Inn and another hotel. Debra Gorham, a local food pantry director, met Clements at Wendy’s, and handed her hundreds of dollars Gorham had gathered for the effort. 
Clements knew one of the people she had to find was someone she had known years before he started living outside, a man well known for walking the streets of Central City.
“Sometimes it’s difficult if you’re looking for him, it’s difficult to find him because you don’t know where he’s at, who he’s with, where he’s staying from day to day,” Clements said.
She had to find John Paul Shanks.

(Stock photo by Inti St. Clair/Getty Photos)In Kentucky more than 753,000 residents, or 1 in 6, face hunger. They often don’t know where and when their next meal will be.
That sobering statistic is felt daily across the commonwealth — from families forced to choose between groceries and rent to schools struggling to meet students’ basic needs. 
Food banks and our partners across the state are doing all we can to provide millions of meals annually and coordinate critical emergency support — but we can’t do it alone, and we certainly can’t do it with policy that sends us backward.
But that’s just what’s happening, and hungry Kentuckians will pay the price.
The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture has proposed a plan that would quietly shift the burden and worsen the problem. If passed, the Kentucky budget would be responsible for funding over $150 million annually by 2028 just to maintain current benefit levels. With food insecurity projected to rise, that cost will likely increase even more.
We’re sure federal and state governments will jostle for who is to blame, but the bottom line is simple: Fewer Kentuckians will be able to eat. And that’s why we’re pushing back. 
The proposal under consideration would throw the entire SNAP system off, and there’s no solution being offered. SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) works because it can scale up quickly when people are struggling, like after a natural disaster, such as recent tornadoes. States just don’t have the resources to handle that kind of surge.
Keeping SNAP federally funded is the only way to ensure it’s there when people really need it.
Charitable food assistance steps in where other support falls short, but it’s not enough. For every meal provided by the charitable food system, SNAP delivers nine. That ratio matters. Reducing access to SNAP won’t just stretch food banks thinner, it will stretch family budgets to the breaking point.
Hunger is not just about food; it’s about health, learning and opportunity. When children don’t have consistent access to meals, it impacts their development, their education and their future. In Kentucky, 1 in 5 kids faces hunger. When adults don’t have food, they can’t be expected to perform their best at their job. The consequences ripple far beyond the dinner table.
We already know what works. The community eligibility provision helps high-poverty schools serve free meals to all students. Summer EBT provides grocery assistance when school is out. SNAP helps families put food on the table every night. These aren’t luxuries — they’re lifelines. And they’re part of our shared responsibility to ensure no Kentuckian goes hungry.
Kentucky’s food banks are committed to doing our part. But systemic hunger cannot be solved through charity alone. We need policies that protect families and uphold the principle that access to food is a basic human right.
Anyone can experience hunger. A  job loss, medical emergency  or child-care crisis can leave a family facing food insecurity. These programs offer dignity, consistency and hope when it matters most. And no matter our political beliefs, we should agree on this: No legislation should determine who gets to eat and who doesn’t.
Congress can act to protect and strengthen the nutrition programs that keep families afloat and give children a fair shot. We can work together to build a future where no one in Kentucky goes hungry.

The adults are really messing up your world.
Your futures are being threatened by a Trump administration that is attacking universities, trying to get young people to forgo college for factory jobs, making it harder to get and repay student loans, unleashing unregulated artificial intelligence and enacting potentially ruinous tariffs.
It’s no wonder that members of Generation Z, people born between about 1997 and 2010, disapprove of Trump’s economic policies more widely than any other age group, according to a recent national poll.
Trump’s chaotic tariffs are about to nick Michigan’s economy and could lead to an even more serious plunge. A new University of Michigan state economic forecast predicts tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum will destroy 13,000 jobs “over the next several years.”
Michigan is expected to see virtually no job growth in the final nine months of this year before modest growth returns next year, according to the forecast.
The best prospects for new grads and other job seekers are likely to be in “noncyclical” industries, including private education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and government, according to the U-M forecast.
Ninety-five percent of Michigan’s job growth over the next three years is expected to come from noncyclical industries. But proposed deep budget cuts by Trump and the Republicans in education and health care could kill jobs in those areas, too.
Tariffs are expected to hit the manufacturing sector, particularly autos, the hardest. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sales of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis vehicles are expected to fall by 200,000 vehicles this year as tariffs boost the average vehicle price by 13.2%, or $6,200, according to a U-M forecast summary presented at last week’s state revenue estimating conference.
U-M economists say their forecast is “very uncertain” because of Trump’s chaotic tariff implementation and the complexity of assessing the effects of the tariffs.
But Michigan’s dependence on the auto industry could lead to hundreds of thousands of lost jobs in a national recession, based on past downturns. And that’s something economists are increasingly concerned about as companies begin to raise tariffs.
Trump is worried, too. The president blew a gasket after Wal-Mart said it will have to pass some its tariff costs to customers, demanding the retail giant “eat the tariffs.” (Funny, Trump has previously insisted that other countries, not U.S. businesses, pay the tariffs.)
Michigan’s economy, because of its heavy reliance on manufacturing and agriculture, is considered to be one of the most vulnerable to the negative effects of tariffs.
Trump and his accomplices see it all differently. They view tariffs as a cudgel to force auto companies and other manufacturers to bring back their plants from foreign countries, reshoring hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month that “the great jobs of the future” would be skilled trades positions in auto plants repairing robots and keeping the air conditioning working. These jobs pay between $70,000 and $90,000, he said.
Lutnick made the wildly inflated claim that there are 4,000 to 5,000 of these jobs in a single auto plant. The typical auto plant has fewer than 3,000 workers in total.
“This is the new model where you work in these kinds of plants for the rest of your life and your kids work here and your grandkids work here,” he said.
Really? That sounds like a 1960s employment model to me.
It’s hard to say what the new employment model will be, thanks to the rapid implementation of artificial intelligence.
There are all sorts of predictions about which jobs will be eliminated by AI and which ones will survive. Some experts believe AI could create tens of millions of new jobs involved with implementing this new technology.
The scariest forecast came from Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who recently told “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon he thinks humans will no longer be needed “for most things” within 10 years.
Democratic and Republican policymakers for years have been pushing skilled trades as an alternative to costly four-year degrees. That effort is accelerating in the belief that these jobs are the least likely to be eliminated by AI.
If would love to be welder, electrician or plumber, I say go for it. You’ll likely find a good-paying job.
But it’s a mistake to dismiss the societal and economic value of having a lot of people with four-year degrees at a time when critical thinking skills, broad knowledge and having a sense of social responsibility are more important than ever.
That’s why some experts are saying that a much-maligned liberal arts education might be just the ticket to prospering in an AI-driven world.
“My instinct is that no one really knows how jobs and careers are going to change and how fast,” Lou Glazer, president of Michigan Future Inc., an Ann Arbor think tank that promotes a more prosperous state, told me.
“So I think the most valuable career success skills are not going to be occupation-specific, but more generalist skills—liberal arts-based,” Glazer said.
I suspect Glazer’s view of the future of work will prove more accurate than Lutnick’s. I hope for the sake of young people soon to enter the workforce that it’s not Gates’.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/graduates-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 06:03:36.682364

The board also voted unanimously to decertify all three members of an unnamed county’s election commission after hearing the results of its staff’s investigation of complaints about the 2024 general election. The board doesn’t name counties when levying sanctions until the affected county and individuals have an opportunity to respond and either accept or challenge the proposed sanctions.
State law allows the board to conduct election integrity reviews in the odd-numbered years following an election. The board can choose the counties randomly or by a two-thirds vote if it has received information a substantial violation of election or voter registration laws has occurred.
The board issued a letter of reprimand earlier this month to Pulaski County Clerk Terri Hollingsworth over violations of state election law during early voting last year. A deputy clerk changed the street addresses of 132 voters in a precinct file without authorization, according to the SBEC letter. Other clerk’s office employees caught the changes two days later but not before four voters had cast the wrong ballots. The employee resigned shortly after the incident, the letter says.
Unauthorized changes to voter records are considered a felony under A.C.A. 7-1-104, and the SBEC referred the matter to the Pulaski County prosecutor and the attorney general’s Election Integrity Unit.
The SBEC also issued a letter of warning to the Pulaski County clerk for failing to prevent unauthorized changes to voter records.
The election integrity reviews approved by the state board Wednesday will seek to identify errors and any evidence of fraud in voter registration records and absentee voting documents as well as verify the accuracy and integrity of election results, according to ACA 7-4-124.
No specific mention was made about the reason Izard County will be the subject of an election integrity review, but the board voted at its December meeting to refer complaints from election monitors to SBEC staff for investigation.

 Decertification of election officials

Separate votes by the seven-member SBEC mean the chairman of the unnamed county’s election commission won’t be able to work in an official election role for 14 years and the other two commissioners for eight years.

SBEC Director Chris Madison said it would be up to the respective county political party committees to appoint new members to the election commission if the sanctions are accepted. County election commissions are composed of three members, two from the majority political party and one from the minority party.
County election officials were the subject of six complaints to the state board, including two that referred to a hostile environment created by the election commission chair and poll supervisors toward poll watchers.
The allegations included “hostility and [an] overall lack of professionalism in dealing with poll watchers” and a failure by the chair and poll supervisors to “recognize the rights and responsibilities of the poll watchers, thereby preventing the poll watchers from performing their duties,” SBEC legal counsel Waylan Cooper said.
Cooper said the investigation found evidence supporting the allegations, including an incident when the county commission chairman called sheriff’s deputies to remove a poll watcher after the poll supervisor tried to prevent the watcher from sitting in a chair that allowed a full view of the voting process. The chairman also raised his voice while telling poll watchers they were being ejected from the location, intimidating at least one potential watcher from participating further, Cooper said.
“The hostility toward poll watchers later spread” to another voting site in the same city on Election Day, Cooper said, when a disagreement between the poll supervisor and a poll watcher led to the supervisor’s husband, who was also a poll worker, verbally accosting the watcher with profanity and telling the watcher to leave.
“The backstory is that there’s two political factions in this community, and the election officials are on one side of a local issue and the poll watchers on the other,” Madison told the board.
Madison made a similar remark about Izard County during the board’s December meeting: “[Izard County] has a city that has two very engaged factions, and Hatfields and McCoys kind of comes to mind.”

“They have to be professional and adult enough to put aside that they don’t like the people who are poll watchers and allow them to do their jobs,” SBEC member Sharon Brooks said. The law requires it and their training demands it, “and they’re not doing that,” she said.
The board voted unanimously to decertify the supervisor and her husband for four years. Madison noted that the couple has since moved to another county and Clemmer’s motion applies statewide.
Regarding the allegations against the county commission chairman, SBEC member Bilenda Harris-Ritter said, “I think it’s unconscionable that the chair of the election commission is behaving like this … and encouraging other officials to behave like this.”
Harris-Ritter offered the motion to decertify the commission chair for seven two-year federal election cycles, the maximum the state board can impose.
Madison said the action was appropriate “to help solve some problems up there.” The SBEC staff will be intimately involved in the county’s election processes going forward, he said.
The board voted separately to decertify the other two members of that county’s election commission over a complaint that the commission didn’t deliver provisional ballots to the clerk and secretary of state until a week after the deadline. Unlike in many Arkansas counties, the clerk there is not the election coordinator; another member of the election commission is the coordinator.
In another case, the board voted to decertify an election commissioner in a different county for 14 years over his failure to show up on time to open a polling place at the start of early voting. Board members in support of decertification noted similar issues had happened in previous years.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)While Abigail Spanberger’s former congressional colleagues stayed up late Tuesday night debating proposed cuts to Medicaid in a jumbo GOP bill to reduce federal spending, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee outlined her health care-focused plans if she becomes Virginia’s next governor Wednesday morning at a local independent pharmacy in Mechanicsville.
Standing in Mechanicsville Drug Store, a family-owned business that’s nearly 70 years old, Spanberger drove home her legislative priorities to lower prescription drug costs and close rural health care gaps in the state. 
“It’s essential that we be able to strengthen access to health care, improve affordability, and recognize that for so many Virginians, they’re one medical event away from really substantial ruin,” Spanberger said. “But for so many, (health care cost) is just one more worry that keeps them up at night.”
Speaking near the counter where prescriptions are filled in the back of the store, Spanberger said threats to health care coverage spurred her to run for Congress in 2018. During President Donald Trump’s first term in 2017,  members of Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That federal legislation made it possible for states like Virginia to expand their Medicaid program to encompass more people who fall through health coverage gaps. 
With a similar sense of medical coverage uncertainty now pervading the nation’s capital, Spanberger said she wants to protect access to care here at home.
“As we see challenges coming out of Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, as governor, I will focus on what can be done here in Virginia,” Spanberger said. 
She also plans to create a statewide hospital price transparency comparison tool to help people better weigh their options for treatments and drugs, uphold consumer protection laws and direct the next attorney general to identify and crack down on scams that may fraudulently enroll people in unnecessary coverage, Spanberger said. 
Virginia’s “safety net” providers, like free clinics and community health centers, can also count on Spanberger’s support if she ascends to the governorship, she said. Virignia’s free clinics have for years requested more funding from the state legislature to stay afloat and serve the  most vulnerable populations, especially under- or uninsured people and rural patients who live further from hospitals. She also laid out her intention to work with Virginia’s hub of medical manufacturing companies to increase the production of generic drugs that more people would be able to afford. 
One thing Spanberger’s plans didn’t include is a Prescription Drug Affordability Board.  A bipartisan proposal to create an independent board of medical and health experts tasked with analyzing data to set payment limits on drug prices within state-sponsored health plans has failed multiple years in a row in Virginia’s legislature. After clearing the legislature this year, the measure was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in late March. 
While PDABs have gained traction in several states in recent years, they have not been without skepticism — particularly as other states’ boards, like Maryland’s, have taken years to set up and have not yet fully yielded the savings they’ve promised. 
Spanberger is also cautious and said Wednesday she would keep an eye on the proposal but stopped short of endorsing it. 
“I want to make sure that whatever we might implement in the future will be a best practice based on the successes or challenges that other states have faced,” she said. 
A new law that will take effect next year also aims to boost drug affordability, and has Spanberger’s stamp of approval. 
A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers introduced the “Save Local Pharmacies Act” this year, which outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin approved. 
Once implemented, the law will eliminate health-run-plan pharmacy benefit managers in Medicaid and establish a single state-contracted one — a move supporters say would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. The proposal drew support from both independent pharmacy owners and workers in chain pharmacies during the 2025 legislative session.
Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, who is among several Democratic candidates that will face off in a primary next month for the lieutenant governor nomination, said that he is “proud that (Spanberger) agrees this is the type of strong action we need to help Virginians.”
Rouse had been the chief patron of the PBM reform bill and worked closely with colleagues to pass it. 
A spokesperson for Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is the Republican nominee for governor, did not immediately return calls Wednesday when asked for more details about Earle-Sears’ health care policy stances and thoughts on federal Medicaid debates. 
Her campaign website does not spell out concrete health care plans, but more broadly points to a goal of reducing the cost of living. 
“She will scour the government books to cut wasteful government spending and job-killing regulations because taxpayers know how to spend their money and run their businesses better than government,” Earle-Sears’ website reads.

Hanover County resident Ann, who declined to share her last name and identified herself as a Republican voter, was skeptical of what Spanberger had to say during her pharmacy visit on Wednesday. 
Ann said she doesn’t know enough about the pharmacy benefit manager proposal Spanberger is backing but another health care issue is a priority for her going into this year’s state elections: abortion. 
While she isn’t sure what week of pregnancy she would like to see abortion restricted, she thinks current law and the in-progress constitutional amendment to enshrine broader reproductive rights goes too far. 
“I don’t want it to be completely banned, but there do have to be restrictions,” she said. “When you abort and murder a live baby, that is something very sinister.”
Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court

Current abortion law allows the procedure for any reason until about 26 weeks, with exceptions for the rare instance where people have later abortions — typically related to medical emergencies. Virginia Republicans and President Trump have for years incorrectly stated that Virginia Democrats support infanticide, which is illegal.
Spanberger has voiced her support for abortion access repeatedly, tweeting on the second anniversary of the Supreme Court’s dismantling of federal abortion protections that “Virginians are worried about the future of abortion access — but they are also deeply worried about extreme politicians attacking IVF and contraception. As Virginia’s next Governor, I will defend our fundamental rights.”
Earle-Sears has decried abortion, speaking against the procedure as a keynote speaker at this year’s March for Life rally and literally marking her disapproval of an in-progress constitutional amendment protecting reproductive health care access, including abortion. In her duty as lieutenant governor, Earle-Sears has to sign passed legislation, and as the reproductive rights measure cleared the legislature this year, she signed it with a note that she was “morally opposed” because she didn’t feel it protected “the child.”
Earle-Sears ‘morally opposed’ to Virginia’s reproductive rights amendment, note shows

Republicans had sought to insert an amendment into the measure that would further outline existing state and federal law concerning live births. Democrats, who control the House and Senate currently, rejected the idea because it’s already on the books. The proposed constitutional amendment must pass the legislature again next year before appearing on statewide ballots. 
Ann, the Hanover Republican, knows that partisan control of the House of Delegates and the political position of the incoming governor will be pivotal in shaping the future of Virginia’s abortion laws.  It’s why she has her eye on “all of them.”

(Photo by Mason Adams for the Virginia Mercury)Virginia awarded $983.6 million to 53 applicants in the sixth iteration of the competitive SMART SCALE process to help improve transportation across the commonwealth.
On Wednesday, the Commonwealth Transportation Board approved the transportation and infrastructure projects that were recommended for approval by staff, after weighing 270 applications and making significant changes to the program last year.
Localities and planning districts submit their project applications every two and half years in the SMART SCALE process, and the state scores them using a funding formula to identify their transportation needs compared to other applications. The state considers how projects improve safety, reduce congestion and contribute to economic development, among other factors, when weighing the proposed projects.
Some localities had already expressed opposition to the projects staff recommended for the green light including leaders in Fairfax County, who submitted three applications for projects that ranked low in priority compared to other projects and are unlikely to get state funding allocated through the SMART SCALE process.The Fairfax Board of Supervisors expressed their concern in a recent letter to Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller.
Miller said the board will continue to listen to local leaders and analyze the concerns again in the future.
“At the end of the day, we just want to get it right, and of course, there’s no right, no 100% right. It’s a judgement system,” said Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller. “We’re judging how these projects return value to the commonwealth.” 
Not all of Virginia’s districts received district funding grants, which are only open to certain localities. The districts that failed to receive any district funding grants are Culpeper, Fredericksburg, Lynchburg and Salem. Lynchburg also failed to acquire any funding from the High-Priority Projects Program, which puts projects in competition with others from across the commonwealth.
Board member Raymond Smoot, who represents part of Southwest Virginia, raised concerns about the districts which did not receive any district funding grants. While Smoot acknowledged that applications that didn’t make the cut may not have met the level of need of other districts, he questioned whether the funding formula appropriately measured the needs within the four districts.
“Now that’s all, in my view, water over the dam; but looking ahead to round seven … I think we need to keep these perspectives before us and see what, if any, changes we need to make in round seven that would perhaps reduce a different result,” Smoot said. “But I think this has gone well, and I appreciate all the work that has been done on it, and I just think we need to keep this in mind for future reference.”
In January 2024, the board made several changes to the funding process after its review of SMART SCALE, established in 2014. The tweaks included requiring public bodies applying for funds to calculate traffic congestion for seven years in the future, adjusting the weight given in calculations to safety, congestion and accessibility, and keeping existing application caps in place.
The changes concerned some localities, who said the modifications reduced state funding for smaller transportation projects for cyclists and pedestrians while favoring larger projects.
The board voted on the awards and agreed to suspend any action on Alexandria’s project application, designed to improve safety at two intersections: Duke Street and South Henry Street, and Duke Street and South Patrick Street. 
According to Alexandria leaders, the city’s funding request came after it documented over 70 crashes at the two intersections since 2014. Of those, four crashes resulted in severe injury and more than 20 resulted in non-life-threatening injuries. 
Miller stated that the agency did not inform Alexandria that its project wouldn’t be funded until after it had already been included in the staff recommendations drawn up before the board’s action Wednesday. During Tuesday’s work session, staff explained that the city’s project remains unfunded due to Alexandria’s lack of improvement in performance compared to other city projects the state has funded.
Alexandria’s project could be amended as early as January after the agency speaks with city leaders, Miller said.
“We need to ensure that we communicate better than we have in this case,” Miller said. “Whether that’s in Culpeper or whether it’s in wherever … we need to make sure we have those conversations so people aren’t surprised.”
Board member D.J. Gribbin, representing the Northern Virginia District, joined Miller during Tuesday’s work session, expressing support for holding localities accountable for completing projects after they receive SMART SCALE funding. Loudoun County proved accountability measures are necessary, Gribbin said, pointing to the county’s plan to swap out its Cascades Pkwy Bike & Pedestrian project from Church Road to Victoria Station Drive for a Route 15 roundabout project, since Loudoun’s annual performance review of administering five or more projects has not improved.
The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) will administer the roundabout project.
“I think having accountability is key,” Gribbin said. “I also want to thank VDOT and the team for working with Loudoun County to help them get over the hump, so we can get one of these projects up and going. This is a really good combination of being accountable, but also being flexible (and) working with counties that are trying hard.”
In addition to Alexandria’s project, other projects that were not funded include the Little Creek Road Bicycle Improvements project in Norfolk and the Waynesboro Transit Access Project in Waynesboro.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar / Maine Morning Star)Maine students have been restrained and secluded more than 22,000 times a year in some years. But the real number of times educators put students in holds, move them against their will and shut them alone in small rooms is likely much higher.
Restraint and seclusion are widely condemned practices that create lasting trauma for students, their families and the educators involved. That’s why every use is supposed to be documented and reported to the state. But over the past decade, only 24 out of more than 250 private schools and public districts in Maine have consistently reported their numbers.


May 21: Restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used on students in emergency situations. Accounts from families and educators show how districts’ interpretation of state law vary widely and how traumatic the experiences can be.
May 22: State data reveals only a fraction of Maine’s schools and districts are consistently reporting incidents of restraint and seclusion in violation of state law. Even with the underreporting, Maine schools are relying on these practices thousands of times per year.
May 23: How one district worked with researchers to change its approach to student behavior and significantly reduced the use of restraint and seclusion

Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education, however the department did not say whether there was any penalty for failing to report. 
Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education. However, according to Bear Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist, Maine DOE “has not been given statutory authority or mechanisms to enforce compliance.”
Rather, the department seems to operate under the assumption that a district’s lack of reporting means schools didn’t restrain or seclude any students that year. 
“It is possible that if a school district does not have any incidents of restraint and seclusion in a school year, they will not report any data,” said Chloe Teboe, the department spokesperson, when asked about the dozens of districts that aren’t reporting every year, according to publicly available state data. “The Maine DOE can only act on the data that is shared by school districts, as required by statute.”
Atlee Reilly, managing attorney for the advocacy organization Disability Rights Maine, said it’s “beyond unlikely” that districts failing to report have not used restraint or seclusion.
Overall, reporting to the DOE has fallen off in recent years, Reilly told lawmakers on May 9 during discussion of a proposed bill that aims to relax the rules on restraint and seclusion. Many of the state’s largest districts and schools that historically reported frequent use of restraint and seclusion have stopped sharing their numbers in recent years, according to statewide data. 
“I know that some schools that have historically reported high numbers of restraints haven’t reported,” Reilly said. “So does that mean that they, all of a sudden, are not restraining or secluding youth? I think probably not.”
At least one school not reporting high use to state
A closer look at the Bangor Regional Program, a school for students with disabilities, reveals how restraint and seclusion practices can go unreported for years.
Bangor Public Schools is responsible for reporting its own numbers, as well as the data for the Bangor Regional Program, which serves students from several area districts. The state database includes numbers from the regional program for one of the past 10 years, after a 2019 investigation found the school had been restraining and secluding students thousands of times each year from 2015 to 2018, more than almost any other school in the state.  
During the 2019-20 school year, the regional program used 261 restraints and 325 seclusions on 33 individual students. Internal data provided by Bangor schools to Maine Morning Star in response to a records request shows that in the following years, the program continued using these practices. In 2021-22, the school reported 419 total uses of restraint and seclusion. In 2022-23, use dropped to 187, and in 2023-24, increased to 281.
None of these incidents were reported to the state, according to publicly available state data. 
Though Bangor Public Schools reports its data every year, when asked why the regional program’s numbers were not shared with the state, spokesperson Ray Phinney said he didn’t know and couldn’t find out due to recent changes in district leadership. 
“The superintendent who oversaw the submission of this is no longer with us,” he said.
The DOE did not respond directly to questions about this school’s lack of reporting, but the spokesperson said the department “reports any data received from school districts and does not make a practice of not publishing it.”
Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based nonprofit that works with schools to reduce restraint and seclusion, said it’s important for the department to explain what happens when schools like the regional program collect data but don’t report it to the state. 
“We still don’t have a true sense of the scope of using these dangerous practices, so this, to me, points the spotlight back at reporting and collecting,” he said. “So what more is DOE doing to ensure the completeness of the data, the completeness of this picture?”
Few districts regularly report data
This underreporting casts doubt on the apparent progress Maine has made in relying less on these practices in the wake of a 2021 law, which specified restraint and seclusion should only be used in emergency situations.
The law was intended to reduce the use of emergency behavioral interventions that are known to be traumatic — particularly for students with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected.
“It’s very difficult to tell if the numbers went down or up after the law change because of underreporting,” Jones said. 
In the 2022-23 school year, Maine schools reported 44% fewer incidents of restraint and seclusion in schools than it did four years earlier. But only 140 of Maine’s 300-plus school administrative units submitted their data for that school year. In 2018-19, that number was 213.










I don't want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it's traumatic, it's not good. However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.


– MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason


Only 24 districts have submitted restraint and seclusion data every year for the last decade, a Maine Morning Star analysis found.
Together, they represent fewer than one-quarter of Maine’s roughly 170,000 K-12 students. Only two of the state’s 10 largest districts, Bangor and Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 6 in the Buxton area, are among them.
In the 2018-19 school year, MSAD 6 staff reported restraining students 150 times and placing them in rooms by themselves 256 times.
By 2022-23, MSAD 6’s use of those tactics, especially seclusions, had dropped considerably. District staff that year reported restraining students 100 times and placing them in seclusion rooms 132 times.
That district’s reliance on restraint and seclusion roughly matches the trend statewide over that period. Across Maine, use of restraint and seclusion peaked in the 2018-19 year at more than 22,000 reported uses, according to the available state data. After passage of the 2021 law restricting their use to instances when a student’s behavior poses an “imminent danger” of serious injury, overall incidents fell to just under 12,600 in the 2022-23 school year — a 44% drop. 
“I don’t want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it’s traumatic, it’s not good,” said MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason. “However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.”


Numbers still high despite underreporting
Despite inconsistent reporting, it’s clear many Maine districts still rely on these practices thousands of times a year. In 2021, data reported directly by schools to the federal government showed that Maine ranked first and second in restraining and secluding students, respectively, per capita. According to an analysis of the most recent national numbers, the state fell to third and fourth per capita.
“These are still extremely high numbers,” said Jones with Lives in the Balance. “Each one of these is a kid being grabbed or put into a closet, and then there’s probably more of it going on based on what we know.”
The number of reported restraints and seclusions vary widely from district to district, noted Alan Cobo-Lewis, director of the Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies and associate professor of Psychology at the University of Maine.
Some districts have reported zero incidents for many years, and others like those in the Buxton-area, report large numbers. But “whether they’re model programs, or whether they’re just not reporting their restraints, I don’t think that you can know that without actually visiting schools,” Cobo-Lewis said.
“I have advocated for a while for the department to visit the schools that had high rates and also visit the schools that had zero,” he said.
While the federal government collects this data from districts, there is no federal oversight, and every state has different laws about restraint and seclusion. Some members of Congress have proposed a federal ban on school use of restraint and seclusion, with the most recent legislation introduced in 2023.
The proposal currently before Maine lawmakers would allow districts to move students against their will without reporting it as a restraint and would allow educators more flexibility in determining when they use these practices by decreasing the level of danger posed by a student’s behavior from “serious physical injury” to just “injury.”
Both Jones and Reilly of Disability Rights Maine worry that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report incidents where staff move students against their will into classrooms and quiet rooms. That would mean the statewide data on the number of restraints could drop. 
“What we’re going to do is take a whole class of stuff — like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child’s being restrained — and say it’s no longer restraint,” Reilly said.
He added, “It doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.”
From 2014 to 2023, school units reported 55 serious bodily injuries to students and 594 to staff members related to the use of a restraint or seclusion, according to publicly available data. In recent years, the number of students injured while being restrained and secluded has increased, with 22 of those 55 instances reported in the 2022-23 school year, all reported by Biddeford Schools. The southern coastal district did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Most years, the vast majority of districts reported zero injuries. 
MSAD 6 in Buxton is one of the only districts that has reported staff and student injuries to the department every year, but Gleason said he did not recall any serious incidents, and did not know what criteria was used by staff who filled out forms. 
“There are minor injuries that happen to both staff and students, sometimes with somebody getting a little rug burn or bumping into a desk or something,” he said, explaining the typical ways staff or students might get injured during a restraint or seclusion.
“But I don’t know if it’s a standard kind of thing across districts and how they report it, or if it’s like an internal measure,” he added.
According to state law, school units would not report injuries that do not meet the definition of serious physical injury, according to Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist. But in practice, “I have talked with many schools and there is a wide range of ways that [school administrative units] choose to report injuries with some tending to report even more minor injuries,” he said. 
While the department collects injury data, there is no statewide policy about what districts should do in response to student or staff injuries.
Majority of reports from schools for students with disabilities
When public school districts determine they can’t adequately serve a student with disabilities, some of them are referred to special purpose private schools. Although these schools still receive public funding, Jones said the programs are often insulated from scrutiny.
Having sat through dozens of those placement meetings, Jones said the student’s parents and advocates are hoping that a move would increase support for the child, but that’s not always the case. 
Pointing to the high number of reported incidents, Jones said these schools can often be “hotbeds for the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion.”
Over the past decade, Maine’s special purpose private schools have accounted for roughly 57% of all uses of restraint and seclusion in the state each year, going up to almost 70% in 2019-20, when the state saw the most incidents in a decade.
Though the data from these schools haven’t been consistently included in the state’s annual data, students with disabilities in Maine and nationwide are much more likely to be subject to these practices.
Maine’s special purpose private schools served roughly 850 students in 2022-23 but accounted for 58% of all 7,975 restraints in the state, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis. That same year, they also accounted for about 47% of all seclusions in Maine: 2,154 of 4,618 incidents.
The Margaret Murphy Centers for Children, a special purpose private school with campuses in Auburn, Lewiston, Saco and Turner, has topped the state’s list for seclusion every year since 2014-15; it has also restrained students more than any other school every year since 2017-18, state data shows. 
The centers used these practices more than 11,000 times on just 108 students in 2019-20, according to the state data from 2023.
There is no state law restricting an educator from using these practices repeatedly on a particular child. And unless a parent complains and requests a district try a new approach, there is no statewide process for addressing the frequency of incidents.


Margaret Murphy Senior Director Michelle Hathaway attributed those numbers to the severity of the student population’s needs. The school exclusively serves children and young adults (up to age 22) with significant behavioral and developmental challenges, many of whom are referred to the school specifically because of the “intensity or dangerousness of their behaviors,” she said. 
They sometimes display aggression — including attempts to hit, choke, or rip out hair — that can pose serious safety risks to themselves or others.
Hathaway wrote in an email that restraints are only used as a “last resort” but argued the law leaves room for interpretation and that ambiguity means some schools may “over-document and over-report.” 
For example, she said a staff member holding a 3-year-old’s hand to prevent them from running into a parking lot could technically, under current law, be considered a restraint.
But repeatedly using restraint and seclusion on a small number of students should be a red flag that something is not working, Jones said.  
“Of course emergency situations will arise, but after the first few uses of restraint or seclusion, we are no longer talking about emergencies,” he said. “We are talking about predictable behavior that can be planned for, trained for.”

Brooke Rollins in April. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services is providing the U.S. Department of Agriculture with data on the number of certain SNAP program applicants, following a sweeping demand from the government earlier this month. A DHS spokesperson did not confirm or whether the agency would share more sensitive data in the future.
The data-sharing was initially confirmed in emails provided to the Advocate through an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request, and then by a DHS spokesperson, who said none of the information shared thus far was personally identifiable. 
A USDA official sent a letter to states on May 6, stating they would need to provide USDA with a trove of personally-identifiable information on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, such as names, addresses and Social Security numbers — data not typically shared with USDA as part of the SNAP program.
USDA directed states to provide “[r]ecords sufficient to identify individuals as applicants for, or recipients of, SNAP benefits, including but not limited to personally identifiable information in the form of names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers,” along with detailed payment data to show how much a recipient has received in benefits. The request is for data dating back to Jan. 1, 2020.
Advocates for child well-being call for removal of barriers to Arkansas SNAP participation

Failure to provide the data or give permission for third-party data processors to do so could trigger “noncompliance procedures,” the letter continued.
In an email to two members of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ communications team, DHS spokesperson Gavin Lesnick wrote on May 9: “One more for you — a reporter with the Washington Post reached out below about a new requirement for all states to share SNAP data with USDA. We are in the process of providing this data.”
However, in response to questions from the Advocate, Lesnick said the data provided by the department was not personally identifiable.
“The Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) began sharing data last week detailing the number of disqualified and sanctioned SNAP applicants so far this year,” Lesnick wrote in an emailed statement. “This dataset did not include any personal information.”
SNAP data is “stored by DHS” but is also provided to a third-party vendor to produce the program’s EBT cards, Lesnick said.
When asked to clarify whether DHS had plans to share the broader trove of personally identifiable information requested by USDA in the future, Lesnick did not directly answer the question. 
“DHS plans to provide USDA any data requested that supports efforts to ensure program integrity,” he said. “We take seriously our responsibility to safeguard sensitive data, and will ensure any information submitted to USDA is provided safely and securely. Questions about specific data types or future requests should be directed to USDA.”

The statement Lesnick provided to the Washington Post reporter earlier this month said: “The Arkansas Department of Human Services is fully committed to efforts to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in all programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). We look forward to continuing our partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to ensure that SNAP benefits go only to eligible families.”
The May 6 letter was prompted by a March executive order from President Donald Trump called “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,” which directed officials to take all steps necessary “to the maximum extent consistent with law,” to obtain access to data necessary to root out “waste, fraud, and abuse.” 
It also directed federal agencies to take steps to gain “unfettered access to comprehensive data from all State programs that receive Federal funding, including, as appropriate, data generated by those programs but maintained in third-party databases.”
The USDA letter said that “At present, each State, district, territory, and payment processor is a SNAP information silo.” 
USDA requires “unfettered access” to the data held by states and third-party processors, the letter said, to eliminate inefficiencies and fraud in accordance with Trump’s executive order.
However, privacy advocates have raised alarms over the demand, sending letters to third-party data processors used by states urging them not to comply. 
States Newsroom has reported on efforts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to consolidate personally identifiable information from various government databases, potentially in violation of privacy laws. 
Some states, such as New Mexico, have refused USDA’s demand on privacy grounds. Others, like Iowa and Alaska, have complied.
As of March, 235,927 people in Arkansas received SNAP benefits, the Advocate previously reported — approximately 7.6% of the state population. As reported by NPR, the personal data of SNAP recipients normally remains under the control of states, while USDA is able to audit state programs.

(Courtesy of the Raleigh Rescue Mission)The Raleigh Rescue Mission on Tuesday broke ground on the construction of a new campus in Knightdale that will expand its capacity to serve women and children by 483%, the organization announced in a news release.
The new campus — The Garden — is being developed in partnership with the Town of Knightdale and the homebuilder Lennar. It’s backed by more than $25 million in commitments from private foundations and donors, the Rescue Mission said.
“The Garden will provide a safe and supportive environment for women and children to rebuild their lives and become contributing members of society,” said John Luckett, president and CEO of the Rescue Mission. “This is an opportunity to offer not just shelter, but stability, resources and the support needed to progress through our New Life Plan and build a new future with confidence and purpose.”
The New Life Plan is a six-step plan that begins with clients living at the Rescue Mission for 4-6 months through phases 1-4. In phase 5, clients move into non subsidized apartments for months 6-12. Phase 6 culminates in homeownership through Habitat For Humanity and similar organizations.
According to the new releases, homelessness in Wake County increases by 8% each year and 70% of people seeking services are experiencing situational homelessness, which means they have been displaced by sudden, life-altering events.
“This is an exciting partnership that reflects Knightdale’s commitment to community and compassion,” said Knightdale Mayor Jessica Day. “The project supports families and meets a growing need in our region.”
The Garden will offer long-term transitional housing for 300 to 400 people. It will also free up space to increase capacity to serve men by 150% at the Rescue Mission’s downtown facility, the organization said.
The campus is being built within a new Lennar single-family home community.
“At Lennar, we believe in building with purpose and integrity, and The Garden is a powerful example of these values in action,” said Robert Smart, Lennar Raleigh division president.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Garden.jpg,,,2025-05-22 05:04:02.098270

Santiago/Getty Images) Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
New laws proliferate
Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
Washington state compromises
For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
Oregon bill would implement protections for Uber, Lyft drivers

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

State Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, told the House Ways and Means Committee said the tax credit in House Bill 167 would offer a stronger incentive for employers than the federal tax credit does, by bridging a gap in the federal funds available for businesses. The tax credit would also be another attempt to stem a problem that covers all of Ohio, from urban centers to rural regions.
“Let’s try something, let’s get something going to see how we can get our employers engaged,” White told the committee.
H.B. 167 would authorize a nonrefundable tax credit for an employer providing “certain child care benefits” to employees, allows the credit to be claimed against other taxes like income or the commercial activity tax, and creates eligibility for costs “associated with establishing or operating an employer-owned child care facility, contracting with a child care facility, or paying employees for the provision of their own child care.
Under the current language of the bill, the credit is limited to $500,000 per year, but any unused funds can be carried over for five years, White said. She said she’s open to changes to that cap or the carryover language if the committee feels the amounts are too high.
The federal credit that’s already in place covers 25% of total expenses related to child care services or benefits, and up to 10% of the resource and referral expenses, for a total credit capped at $150,000 per year.

It’s a heavy lift for businesses, White argued, since they must spend at least $600,000 to be able to get the full benefit, if they’re aware of it at all.
“People don’t know about this credit, they don’t quite understand how to utilize it,” White said. “…But the other thing is it doesn’t help if you, as a business, want to give a stipend for your employee, it doesn’t cover that as a tax credit, so this gives employers more options so that they can actually take advantage of it.”

H.B. 167 also allows non-profits to utilize the tax credit, unlike the federal credit, White said.
The measure comes amid ongoing discussions about the state of child care, and how the economy is affected by a lack of access and affordability for the services in Ohio. Child care “deserts” exist in Ohio where no services are available for children, and data from the Ohio Department of Children and Youth estimate 40,000 children in the state aren’t eligible for Publicly Funded Child Care, meaning they don’t receive state assistance to pay for the services.
On top of those problems, low pay and high turnover in the child care sector means even if child care exists, the workforce shortages reduce capacity at facilities.
White cited recent research by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that found Ohio is losing $5.48 billion every year in economic activity because of “insufficient child care,” including $1.52 billion in tax revenue and $3.97 billion in losses related to child care employee turnover and absenteeism.
“The business community, our families, are looking for solutions, and this is a solution,” White said.
The bill sponsor also echoed comments by ODCY director Kara Wente in supporting the Child Care Choice Voucher Program, which subsidizes child care for those who fall outside the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility of 145% of the federal poverty line.
This is certainly not the first time White has pushed for more child care supports. A bill she co-sponsored establishing child care grant programs for employers was passed last month by the House committee she chairs, the Children and Human Services Committee.
State support for child care is uncertain as it is, with the state operating budget draft being drawn up by the Ohio Senate, after the Ohio House finalized its own draft last month.
The House’s version added $50 million to the Child Care Choice Voucher Program for each of the next two fiscal years, taking from federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant funding.
Despite a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine to increase the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility to 160% of the federal poverty line, the House budget draft maintained the 145% level, which Wente said is the lowest eligibility level in the country.
Also included in House budget proposal is language originally included in separate legislation, which would create a cost-sharing model for child care, in which the state, employers and employees would all pay a percentage of costs. In a hearing earlier this month, the House Children and Human Services Committee passed the original bill with language they said harmonizes the bill with the budget proposal details. In House Bill 2, the state would pay 20% of the costs, and employers and employees would each pay 40%.
During the hearing, however, two Republicans on the committee put concerns on the record about H.B. 2 and White’s child care grant program bill, House Bill 41. State Rep. Sarah Fowler Arthur, R-Ashtabula, voted against both bills, saying she had “concerns about the state subsidizing child care going forward.”
State Rep. Tracy Richardson, R-Marysville, voted in favor of both bills but said the House Finance Committee may have to work on at least House Bill 2, “maybe look at perhaps some potential reduction in overall funding.”
On H.B. 41, Richardson said the finance committee “should take a closer look at the overall appropriation.”
The Senate is currently working on their own draft, on line for an end-of-June deadline for both chambers to reconcile each of their budget drafts and get a final budget to the governor for signature.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Another effort to prevent New Hampshire’s State Council on the Arts from being eliminated during the state budgeting process has fallen short.
New Hampshire state senators have spent the last few weeks working through the state budget. After the Senate Ways and Means Committee projected that state revenues — which have been lagging in recent years — would rebound faster than House predictions, the Senate Finance Committee has been identifying cuts made by the House that the Senate can undo. The committee recommendations so far include reversing a 3% cut to Medicaid reimbursement rates and restoring funding for developmental disability services.
However, on Wednesday, the committee didn’t do the same for the State Council on the Arts, which the House eliminated in its version of the budget. The Senate Finance Committee voted, 5-3, not to restore the council during a work session Wednesday. Gov. Kelly Ayotte had included funding of roughly $1.7 million over two years for the council in her budget proposal. The council was also set to receive an additional $2 million in federal funds.
Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, a Nashua Democrat and one of the three dissenting votes on the Finance Committee, pushed for the arts council to be restored Wednesday, saying, “the arts help drive the economy.”
Sen. David Watters, a Dover Democrat, said the arts are “so deeply woven into the fabric of the state and always have been and (are) something that helps define our identity.”
“It supports traditional arts programs, it supports the thriving arts community all around the state,” Watters said. “I think we should at least restore it to the governor’s level.” 
Republicans on the committee disagreed.
“I do think the Council of the Arts is important,” Sanborton Republican Sen. Tim Lang said. “But in this tough budget cycle where we’re balancing the needs versus the wants, a $3 million add is probably not appropriate for a want.”
Lang proposed an amendment that establishes a state fund that can accept donations. The council would become a volunteer council, and the state would appropriate $1 to the fund, a procedure mechanism to create it. He noted that many other councils in the state are voluntary.
“So the council could go out and get corporate sponsors and donations,” Lang said. “They’ll be able to use those donations to get federal matching grants, and it’d allow them to at least continue in some way, shape, or form their mission and their goal.”
Watters pushed back against the amendment. He said if the state is not putting money toward it, the arts can’t complete its mission.
“If there’s no funding, there’s no arts council,” Watters said. “Let’s face it.”
The committee voted, 5-3, to approve Lang’s amendment.
The Council on the Arts could still be restored if an amendment is introduced to the budget when the full Senate votes on it in June. If the Council on the Arts isn’t restored, New Hampshire would become the only U.S. state not to have such a council, according to the National Endowment for the Arts website. New Hampshire’s State Council on the Arts receives federal support from the Endowment for the Arts. 
Hearing the news Wednesday, Ayotte told reporters she was disappointed in the Senate Finance Committee’s recommendation. Her budget proposal, which projected state revenues would be higher than both the House and Senate estimates, pared down funding for the council but did not eliminate it entirely.
“I’ve been very clear: I do support the arts,” Ayotte said. “I think it’s really part of the culture of our state, but as we think about our travel and tourism and attracting people to New Hampshire, the arts are a part of our economic development as well.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/capcenter-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-05-22 05:04:02.098270
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-22 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT lawmakers pledged long-term care insurance reform. Will it happen?,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/22/ct-long-term-care-insurance-reform-2025/,CT lawmakers who pledged urgent reform to bring relief to LTCI policyholders are still trying to figure out what changes may move forward.,"For more coverage of the long-term care insurance industry, please click here.
In January, just weeks into the legislative session, key lawmakers — frustrated with soaring rate increases on long-term care insurance plans — pledged urgent reform to bring relief to Connecticut’s struggling policyholders.
They followed up with 17 bills that cover a wide range of proposals, from placing caps on annual rate hikes to providing tax credits for consumers and requiring the state to hold public hearings when insurers seek price increases. Five legislative committees advanced measures with bipartisan support, some that included broad consumer protections and cost savings.
But with three weeks left in the regular session, proponents are still trying to figure out what — if any — changes may move forward this year. Some proposals, like tax credits and deductions, have been weighed down by hefty price tags. In other cases, a lack of consensus and political will have hampered efforts.
“Here we are, the insurance capital of the world, and we have long-term care insurance that’s so expensive, it’s not even worth having,” said Rep. Lucy Dathan, a Norwalk Democrat who is co-chair of the Government Oversight Committee, which passed a bill on the issue in March. “It feels like such an injustice. We need to figure this out.”
“We’ve been patient for years, and to not have something meaningful pass this session, I’m very concerned,” said Kenneth Kollmeyer, 75, whose annual insurance payments have climbed to $7,600 for his policy and his wife’s, more than double what they paid when they purchased the coverage in 2004. Their policies are set to increase again next year.
Nearly 100,000 people in Connecticut have long-term care insurance — coverage that, depending on the policy, supports skilled in-home care, rehabilitation therapy, assisted living, nursing home stays and respite care.
A Connecticut Mirror investigation found the annual cost of maintaining these policies has skyrocketed for many residents due to miscalculations by insurers on how long people would live, the price of care and how many would need it. Consumers face sizable rate increases, often exceeding 50% and, for a few dozen people, as high as 174%, according to a CT Mirror analysis.
A review of rate hikes from January 2019 to October 2024 shows more than 17,000 people with long-term care policies have gotten hit with increases of 50% or more. Some of the biggest companies in the market, including Genworth Financial, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Transamerica Life Insurance Company, requested hikes for five years in a row beginning in 2019.
When providers seek premium increases, thousands of consumers can be affected. In 2019, for example, Genworth Financial requested a 40% rate hike on more than 9,000 Connecticut policyholders. In 2021, Transamerica requested a 20% rate increase on 8,000 policies. The Insurance Department approved both requests with no changes.
In 2022, Genworth raised rates for more than 2,000 people by an average of 97%, with increases ranging from 79% to 173%, depending on the policy. The approved amounts were a slight reduction from the company’s original request.
New language and last-minute plans
Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Middletown, this week introduced a revised bill that would require insurance companies’ cost-sharing responsibility to increase in relation to the cumulative rate hikes on long-term care coverage.
The state insurance commissioner would have to come up with a calculation for the new cost-sharing responsibility.
“We’re giving relief to people who have seen repeated increases from their insurance companies,” Lesser, co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said. “And we’re saying that, as you get hit more and more by your insurance company, we’re going to ask the company to eat more of the cost instead of passing it on to the policyholder.”
Sen. Jorge Cabrera, co-chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, which also passed legislation in March, said he’s in the process of “grabbing different elements” of the bills that advanced to create one proposal with consensus. What that could look like is still in flux.
“I want to do something, because it’s a big issue that everyone’s dealing with, regardless of party,” he said.
Measures that would give policyholders a financial break in the form of a tax credit or tax deduction have hit a wall due to sizable costs. Estimates by the state’s Office of Fiscal Analysis put the price of one tax credit at $67.2 million and a tax deduction at $20.2 million.
Despite Connecticut being on pace to close this fiscal year with the second-largest surplus in state history, a nearly $2.4 billion windfall according to Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, officials are wary of providing tax relief in the next budget.
Given ongoing congressional efforts to make unprecedented cuts in Medicaid, lawmakers fear Connecticut stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
But other components of the reform bills have far smaller cost estimates or no expense. Legislators proposed 10% caps on annual rate increases, public hearings so policyholders can share their perspectives when rate hike requests are filed, consumer notifications warning of the risk of large premium increases, and a sweeping review of the state’s regulation of long-term care insurance. 
Other measures would tie annual rate hikes to the consumer price index, require insurers to certify that premium increases are necessary to prevent a material risk of insolvency, and bar carriers from entering into state contracts if they don’t comply with LTCI policy changes.
Several consumers and legislators testified in support of the bills, while insurance sector officials opposed them.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said impending federal budget cuts will put huge economic pressure on Connecticut’s working families, but lawmakers haven’t abandoned efforts to provide relief to long-term care policyholders.
“We don’t have huge amounts of money, but it’s a real problem for people who bought those policies,” he said, adding that “everything is tentative right now.”
Rate hike requests persist
As consumers are squeezed, grievances filed with the Connecticut Insurance Department have mounted. The office received more than 700 complaints in the last six years about long-term care insurance, mostly rising premiums.
Solutions have been elusive. Legislators introduced more than 50 bills from 2019 to 2024, with only a small number passing and offering limited relief. They blamed budget constraints and pushback from insurers, among other problems.
Shortly after the CT Mirror’s investigation published in January, the state Insurance Department rejected a proposed rate increase of 167% by Brighthouse Insurance Company covering about 5,100 people in Connecticut.
But more rate hike requests have been filed. In a recent filing, the State Life Insurance Company, which represents a small group of about 22 policyholders, is asking for an average increase of 560%, drawing outrage from legislators and advocates.
“When you see a 500% proposed increase come across — it’s crazy,” Dathan said. “I’m pretty upset about it because I’ve been trying to find a way to get [solutions] adopted.”

The authors of the plan say most of the positions are vacant anyway, but of course, that’s something that’s mostly attributable to lousy pay, benefits, and working conditions.
As Charles Owens — a health care technician at the Cherry Hospital psychiatric facility in Goldsboro – explained at a Raleigh press conference, the state’s mental health facilities are already down hundreds of essential positions.
And that reality presents a big daily safety problem for him and the other workers who remain. The same is true for guards and other employees throughout the state’s prison system.
The bottom line: North Carolina is a big and fast growing state that needs more state employees to provide essential public services – not fewer. State lawmakers need to wake up to this reality.

President Donald Trump is clashing with the courts over what detainees are legally entitled to as Immigration and Customs Enforcement rounds up people it believes are undocumented and takes them overseas. 
A federal judge in Boston on Wednesday ruled that eight migrants sent to the violence-torn country of South Sudan were not given a meaningful chance to contest the deportations on the grounds that they would be put in danger. Only one of the individuals is from South Sudan.
The administration deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador even though a court issued an order forbidding it. The U.S. Supreme Court has subsequently ruled that the administration cannot deport people without giving them due process.
Most people of all ages and partisan affiliations believe that’s the proper course.
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stumbles over questions from Democrats on habeas corpus

A poll released Tuesday by the Bullfinch Group and the National Immigration Forum gave respondents a brief definition of due process. Then they were asked whether they supported or opposed requiring due process before deporting people.
Sixty-three percent said they supported doing so, 23% were opposed, and 14% were undecided. That’s a 40-point margin in favor of due process.
Democrats supported due process for people facing deportation by a 81-11 margin. Independents supported it by a 59-23 margin. For Republicans, it was 51-35. 
In other words, the closest margin was 16 points.
The poll surveyed 1,200 adults between May 9 and 13. 
“Due process is essential to keeping American communities safe and immigration processes orderly,” Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum, said in a written statement. “This bedrock American value protects all of us.”
Even so, not all detainees have received due process in Ohio, said Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.
Last month, her group got an attorney for a man who’d gotten a final order of deportation. The jail where the man was held wouldn’t allow the attorney to visit the man on less than a week’s notice, Tramonte said. 
“All of a sudden, the night before the attorney visit, he’s gone,” she said. “This was weeks before his scheduled deportation, so this is a clear indication that they wanted to get him out quickly because they knew he was getting a lawyer to fight his case.” 
Tramonte added, “It’s just not fair. The government has attorneys in every immigration case — in the courtroom — every single time. The immigrant deserves to have an attorney by their side, too.”
Tramonte didn’t give the man’s name or nationality to protect his identity. 
Most Americans appear to agree that such treatment is unfair, and unwise.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A poll also conducted by the Bullfinch Group and the National Immigration Forum in December found that Americans overwhelmingly think that deportations should focus on immigrants who commit violent crime, that the persecuted should be protected, and that families should be kept intact.
The Trump administration’s continued harsh treatment of immigrants might be costing it in the court of public opinion.
An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in late April found that immigration remained Trump’s strongest issue. Even so, more Americans disapproved of the job he was doing in that arena than approved — 53% to 46%. 
There also appeared to be little appetite for Trump to take measures on immigration that are even more sweeping. Forty-eight percent of respondents said that Trump had gone too far on immigration, 32% said his approach had been about right and just 18% said he hadn’t gone far enough.
Murray of the National Immigration Forum said people want the Trump administration to follow the law.
“Americans do not want our immigration system to undermine the rule of law,” she said. “We look forward to working with leaders on approaches that uphold fairness and due process.”

Ohio state Reps. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, and Monica Robb Blasdel, R-Columbiana, are introducing the Lead Line Replacement Act. 
“This legislation aims to keep our community safe and healthy by implementing a comprehensive regulatory framework to plan, execute, and assist in the replacement of all lead water lines in the state of Ohio,” Robb Blasdel said. “Lead water lines are a relic of the past. However, despite the danger, we know these are still in use all across our state.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ohio has 745,000 lead service lines and nearly 4,000 Ohio children are tested for high levels of lead poisoning, said Jarrells, who is a survivor of lead poisoning. 
“Ohio is in a crisis,” he said. “The number (of lead poisoning) is likely higher because of the reality that not every child in this state is tested.” 
The use of lead pipes was banned by Congress in 1986. In 2021, Ohio ranked third in the nation for the most lead pipes, according to the EPA. 
Lead is able to enter drinking water through the corrosion of lead or lead-contaminated water service lines. 
No amount of lead exposure is safe for children, the lawmakers said.
“Replacing each of these (lead lines) will be a challenging task, but one we firmly believe is attainable,” Robb Blasdel said. “This bill would mandate local water providers to work with the state to identify these lines, develop a plan to replace these lines with safe alternatives, and execute this plan over a 15 year time period.”
The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency would be responsible for overseeing enacting this mandate if the legislation passes.  
“This bill also prohibits partial replacements that can make contamination worse,” Jarrells said. 
It would cost nearly $5 billion to remediate every single lead line in Ohio, he said. 
“I didn’t introduce this in the budget because I wanted to do the work to make it bipartisan,” Jarrells said. 
He put forth a similar bill during the last General Assembly, but it only had sponsor testimony in committee. 
“This is necessary,” Jarrells said. “This is a human issue, and to introduce this bill with bipartisan support, that’s how we’re going to ultimately see this bill become law.”
Lawmakers say replacing Ohio’s lead lines would lead to fewer cases of dementia, depression, anemia, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular mortality, infant mortality, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Lead poisoning poses a threat not just to children. Adults exposed to lead are more likely to experience increased risks of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, kidney and nervous system problems, said Annalisa Rocca, the drinking water manager for the Ohio Environmental Council Action Fund. 
“I grew up turning on the kitchen tap without a second thought, and most Ohioans still do the same, unaware that an unseen lead service line may be supplying their water,” she said. 
Archie Beasley, lead program director of the Junction Coalition, serves a Toledo neighborhood that has 100-year-old homes with lead lines underneath them that are transporting lead into kitchens and bathrooms. 
“We’re going to make sure that no child goes to their kitchen sink, that no child goes to their grandmother’s kitchen sink and gets water out of the refrigerator, and they’re going to be drinking lead water that is going to impact their health,” he said.

Gov. Jim Tressel speaking at a news conference. (Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel is still considering a run for governor, saying that the state GOP’s endorsement of Vivek Ramaswamy won’t affect his decision.
The night before the Ohio Republican Party Central Committee was set to endorse a candidate for the 2026 gubernatorial primary, Tressel said that he was interested in a possible run to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine. Because he commented so late, he wasn’t considered during the meeting as a candidate.
Strategists have been pushing the former OSU coach to jump into the race, but he hasn’t given a firm answer on what he plans to do.
We asked why he decided to say he was considering a run the night before the Ohio Republican Party endorsement, and whether he thinks that endorsement will impact his decision on whether to enter the race.
“Well, I don’t think an endorsement would impact, at least in my opinion, whether I would be interested in getting in the race or not,” he responded.
He said that wherever he goes, he has been getting “so many questions,” so he decided to say something.
In a meeting in Columbus on May 9, the Ohio Republican Party voted 60-3 in favor of Cincinnati entrepreneur Ramaswamy over Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost.
In an email to supporters Friday, Yost suspended his campaign, saying that although he has worked to better Ohio for years, this is “not a time for a family squabble.”
On the Democratic side, the only candidate to announce so far is former Ohio Health Department director Dr. Amy Acton.

When asked his thoughts about infighting for the primary nomination, Tressel explained that he isn’t experienced enough to have an opinion about “squabbles” or what “the party needs,” but that he is going around the state and speaking at dinners with “enthusiasts.”
“They’re thinking about this whole election cycle and their excitement and so forth, but I don’t really know about whether the family squabble gobble thing,” he said. “Every voter deserves a chance to decide what they’d like to vote for.”
We asked him what his top three priorities would be as governor. After saying we stumped him, he proceeded to explain he wants to focus on the livelihood of Ohioans — similar to DeWine.
“I always hear [DeWine] talk about safety, that he wants every person to feel safe and be safe,” he responded. “I’ve heard him talk every day about wanting every Ohioan to reach their God-given potential, and to me, those sound like non-negotiables. You better do darn well at those.”
He emphasized that he is an “education buff” as well. Also, he wants to make sure that veterans are supported.
He spoke to reporters following an event honoring fallen soldiers.
“Education is a big deal to me, and tradition, like we had today, and remembering sacrifice, being grateful, to me, might be number one,” he said.
We are awaiting a response from Ramaswamy’s team for his reaction.
Tressel didn’t have an answer on when he would, if he does, officially announce.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The Kansas Open Records Act makes clear demands of state and local government.
This vital law requires timely release of public records within three business days of receiving a request. If officials can’t fulfill that timeline, they’re required to explain why, in detail.
The Kansas Senate Committee on Government Efficiency claims to be working for the good of all by ferreting out waste and bloat in state government. Perhaps it should start with itself, or at least with chairwoman Renee Erickson, R-Wichita. She led the effort to stonewall news media requests for public recommendations submitted to COGE through its online portal. Kansas Reflector requested the records from her on Feb. 25. They weren’t released until April 9 — more than six weeks later.
By that time, our reporter Anna Kaminski had already examined a leaked copy of public feedback.
That batch of public comments suggested why Erickson pushed the public release until after the legislative session ended. Kansans blasted the committee with messages calling for Medicaid expansion, legalized cannabis and tolerance for LGBTQ+ youths. They show, in short, how anti-government narratives miss the mark in Kansas, where right-wing ideologues have poisoned the well of state government for years.
On Wednesday, Kansas Reflector editor in chief Sherman Smith submitted a complaint to the state Attorney General’s Office about this delay. Erickson’s committee did not respond to our request in a timely manner, and the broader public suffered because crucial information was hidden from them. COGE members could access the messages in mid-March, but their constituents could not. We believe that government officials should be held responsible for delay and obfuscation.
We heard attempts to justify the delays at a COGE meeting May 13. There were just so many messages. We had to screen them all. We didn’t delete anything.
Gordon Self, a legislative staff member, opined: “Once the KORA requests were received and a response was made, there was a review of the records, all 2,000, to determine if any of the records did contain information. After a thorough review, there were some identified that did have some sensitive information in them.”
Erickson harumphed: “At the end of the day, there are none that have been deleted, there are none that are not available for review. But as was said, we wanted to make sure that we were not including information that was not appropriate for such a situation.”
Forgive me for rolling my eyes. These self-satisfied excuses don’t add up.
None of the messages reviewed by Kansas Reflector staff appear to include sensitive information that the government had to shield from prying eyes. As noted earlier, a tranche of unredacted submissions was leaked to us in late March. We have compared the two versions. There’s no there there.
In one message, for instance, Statehouse staff omitted a profane phrase. That didn’t protect anyone’s personal or private information.
In another case, the same suggestion was apparently submitted in two categories. The messages mention Senate President Ty Masterson’s lucrative side hustle at Wichita Stare University, where he earns more than $150,000 a year as “director of GoCreate, a Koch Collaborative.” In one of them, Masterson’s name has been redacted, along with that of the author. In the other, neither Masterson nor the author has been redacted.
Only a few dozen of the thousand-plus messages saw any redactions at all.
Perhaps Statehouse staff don’t have the slightest idea what they’re doing. Perhaps they made a few random edits to the messages to justify the month-plus delay. Neither option should fill Kansans with confidence in their legislators or the work of COGE.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, he COGE web portal includes the warning that “Portal submissions are public records that are subject to the Kansas Open Records Act.” Those sending in feedback have to check a box next to that warning. Why even bother to do that if you’re going to screen the material afterward?
Like other public records conflicts, this runs the risk of sounding petty. So what, I can hear some readers ask. You got the information anyway. Why fuss?
My answer remains the same as when I wrote about Emporia Stare University’s unconscionable response in turning over information to Kansas Reflector. This information belongs to everyone. Lawmakers don’t get to pass a law and then arbitrarily decide whether to follow it. If they expect town and county governments to follow KORA, if they expect other state agencies to follow KORA, they can damn well follow it themselves.
That’s what justice and fair play demands. That’s what their fellow Kansans deserve. And it’s what we’re going to do, no matter Erickson’s sanctimonious claptrap.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)It’s no secret Americans are struggling. From rent to groceries to medical care, the cost of living keeps climbing — and now, Congress is considering cuts to the very programs that help people survive.
It seems like we’re in for rougher times ahead — and our leaders at home haven’t made it any easier. Earlier this year, the Ohio House passed a budget proposal with a dangerous provision: If the federal government ever reduces its contribution to Medicaid, Ohio would immediately revoke health insurance for more than 750,000 Ohioans.
I understand the desire for fiscal responsibility — but eliminating life-saving programs isn’t responsible. It’s cruel.
I’ve lived with cerebral palsy my entire life. I rely on 10 hours of Medicaid-funded home care each day through Ohio’s Individual Options (I/O) waiver. This care helps me live independently at Creative Living, a supportive community in Columbus for people with disabilities. Without it, I wouldn’t be able to get out of bed, manage my health, or live on my own.
My income is $1,528 per month from Supplemental Security Income (SSI). That modest amount covers my rent, groceries, and basic needs. Without Medicaid, I’d lose my independence — and possibly my home. I’d be forced to rely on my aging parents, who can’t provide the kind of intensive care I need.
Losing Medicaid would introduce a huge unknown into my life. I have a loving family I could lean on — but many people don’t. I honestly don’t know what my life would look like without it: no home care, no therapy, no transportation, no housing. I’d lose rental support, medical care, and the freedom to move or live like any other bachelor in his mid-30s.
Even my wheelchair could become a luxury — something easy enough to axe.
But I’m not alone by far. More than 1 in 4 Ohioans rely on Medicaid – including 40% of children, 20% of working-age adults, and 10% of seniors. Republicans’ proposed budget cuts would send shockwaves through our communities, taking away support from those who need it and straining our already-overburdened health care system.
Since Medicaid expansion, Ohio’s uninsured rate has been cut in half. That means more people getting preventive care and fewer costly ER visits and hospital stays. Cutting Medicaid now would reverse that progress and hurt everyone — including hospitals, providers, and taxpayers. Some lawmakers justify these cuts by pointing to “fraud,” but the real impact would be stripping care from children, working families, seniors, and disabled people like me. We would suffer — just to make room for more tax breaks for the wealthy.
What I receive isn’t extravagant. It’s basic, essential care. Cutting it isn’t about reform: it’s blatant, anti-human abandonment. Watching politicians push these cuts while handing out giveaways to those at the top should outrage every American. Is that the kind of nation we want to be?
I urge our state representatives and members of Congress to reject Medicaid cuts and protect services that provide basic needs. Congress should make the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share and invest in programs that actually keep people alive. We don’t need to gut these programs — we need to make them work better.
These cuts would be devastating — for me, and for hundreds of thousands of others across our state who deserve to live with dignity.

As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
 How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
Plagued by teacher shortages, some states turn to fast-track credentialing

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
 Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

,California,2025-05-22 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom’s off-the-mark budget numbers undermine his credibility again,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/newsoms-budget-numbers-credibility/,"Wrong revenue projections a few years ago led California to overspend, creating structural deficits. Now underestimated  Medi-Cal costs are blowing holes in the latest proposed budget.","Gov. Gavin Newsom’s revised state budget assumes California will see a sharp decline in projected revenue, largely because President Donald Trump’s tariffs will slow the nation’s economy.
Newsom blames a “Trump slump,” as well as an unanticipated increase in spending on Medi-Cal, California’s medical program for the poor, for punching a $12 billion hole in the budget.
Both of those factors, however, underscore a consistent trend in budgets Newsom has proposed and signed during the last six years — projections of income and outgo that miss the mark, often by many billions of dollars, thus undermining the credibility of the governor’s financial depictions.
The most obvious example happened in May 2022, as the state’s economy was recovering from the brief but severe recession caused by shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Newsom presented a revised 2022-23 budget that was $14 billion higher than his original proposal, boasting that the state was experiencing a $97.5 billion surplus. “No other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this,” Newsom said as he unveiled the revision.
The budget he signed a month later added still another $7 billion in spending with immense new commitments, including cash payments to poor families, expanded health care for undocumented immigrants and new funds for early childhood education.
The surplus Newsom extolled, however, was an illusion. He and his budget advisors had assumed that a one-time spike in state revenues would be permanent, setting a new base of personal and corporate income taxes and sales taxes well in excess of $200 billion a year.
But it didn’t happen.
A year ago, a brief passage in Newsom’s 2024-25 budget revision acknowledged the error.
“Due to the revenue spike from 2019-20 to 2021-22, the budget acts of 2021 and 2022 were based on forecasts that projected substantially greater revenues in the last two fiscal years than occurred,” the budget declared.
“Substantially greater” indeed.
An accompanying chart on revenues from the state’s three major tax sources revealed that “The total difference across the four fiscal years is a negative $165.1 billion,” meaning the error was $40 billion or more a year.
However, the fiscal damage was done. Newsom and the Legislature had already committed the state to tens of billions of dollars in new spending based on revenues that didn’t exist. They created what’s called a structural deficit — a chronic gap between income and outgo — that’s currently estimated at $10 billion to $30 billion a year.
One might think that, having made such an immense error of fiscal judgment, Newsom and his Department of Finance would be ultra-careful in projecting revenues and spending.
Apparently not.
Last year, one of those 2022 commitments based on the erroneous surplus projection — the extension of Medi-Cal coverage to everyone in the state, including undocumented immigrants — took effect. Early this year, the administration revealed Medi-Cal costs were outpacing expectations by more than $6 billion, mostly due to the coverage expansion.
In other words it’s a double whammy. The false assumption of budget surpluses has been compounded by a false assumption about Medi-Cal costs, thereby worsening the structural deficit that, if left to fester, would compound itself even more. The Legislative Analyst’s Office says the deficit could reach $42 billion by 2028-29.
The administration’s sorry record on income and outgo projections should make the Legislature and the voting public very skeptical of Newsom’s current assumption that the “Trump slump” from tariffs will punch an even larger hole in the budget. 
That certainly could happen, but with tariffs and their impact shifting day-to-day, putting any number on the revenue impacts is nothing more than guesswork. And we already know that the administration’s fiscal guesses are unreliable.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 03:02:08.410248

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder
Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and state regulators hailed on Wednesday Georgia Power’s tentative agreement to freeze base rates for the next three years as a symbol of the state’s economic growth.
Some clean energy advocates dismissed the timing of the Republican governor’s Wednesday press conference as an effort to shore up support for two sitting GOP Georgia Public Service Commission members before they face voters on this year’s ballot. 
On Monday, Georgia Power and the PSC staff reached an agreement for the company to “freeze” its base electric rates from 2026 to 2028.
The PSC is scheduled to hold hearings on the agreement in June that, if approved by the commission, would eliminate the need for this year’s planned rate case, which normally occurs every three years.
Critics say that despite the rate “freeze,” Georgia Power customers will still see their utility bills go up as hundreds of millions of dollars from storm damage and fuel recovery expenses are approved.
On Wednesday, Kemp credited lower electricity bills with the state attracting 193,000 jobs and $90 billion in industrial investments since 2019. 
“We are freezing (rates) because of smart choices by our utilities and buyers, the people you see here beside me today and many other leaders around the state,” Kemp said while flanked Wednesday by PSC Chairman Jason Shaw and Commissioner Lauren “Bubba” McDonald, who are not up for re-election this year. “Our rates are stable even in the midst of unprecedented growth because we have a strong, reliable energy grid and strong partners in both private and public sectors. 
“Coupled with the falling gas prices, this rate freeze will help Georgia families in the time they needed it most — after historic inflation and storms that challenged many people’s day-to-day lives,” Kemp said.
This week’s announcement is ahead of the early voting period that starts this coming Tuesday for the June 17 primary election for the two commission seats on the ballot this year. The winners will go on to compete in the Nov. 4 general election.
Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are facing challengers seeking to upset their bids to remain on the board.
Echols, who is seeking his third term on the PSC, will face challenger Lee Muns in the Republican primary for the commission’s District 2 seat. Whoever wins will face Alicia Johnson of Savannah, the sole Democrat in that race.
A large field of candidates qualified to run for the metro and suburban Atlanta area district represented by Johnson, who is seeking re-election after being appointed by Kemp to fill a vacancy in 2021.
Clock ticking for Georgia voter registration to elect two new members to Public Service Commission

One of the Democratic candidates is Daniel Blackman, who served as a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden, and forced a run-off against McDonald in the 2020 PSC election.
Brionte McCorkle, the executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, said the “freeze” will help Georgia Power ratepayers but said she suspects the agreement and Wednesday’s press conference is a political move to avoid voter backlash during an election year.
She accuses the five-member commission of having a history of favoring Georgia Power’s “irresponsible investments in fossil fuels” and ignoring public calls for renewable energy.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited that there is a pause to the relentless rate increases that Georgians have experienced for the past several years,” McCorkle said. “But make no mistake, this is definitely an attempt to kick the rate increase down the road when there’s not two important elections on the ballot.” 
During the June hearing, expert witnesses for Georgia Power and PSC staff will present evidence and testimony and be cross examined by consumer and clean energy watchdogs, environmental groups, industrial customers and others. 
Commissioners are set to take a final vote on the new agreement on July 1.
Environmental groups said they’d like to get more information about the negotiated agreement that comes after a series of hikes since the start of 2023. Since then the average Georgia Power residential customer is paying about $43 more to cover base electric rate increases, excess fuel expenses, storm costs and the completion of two nuclear power generators at the Plant Vogtle.





Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the “freeze” doesn’t mean Georgia Power customers won’t face higher bills since looming storm and fuel recovery costs would result in rate increases.





“What this agreement does is it says the only rate increases that will happen, other than fuel costs that could go up and down in the next couple of years, will be to the base rate for storm costs,” Whitfield said.
Shaw emphasized the role of reliable utilities and his own commission in maintaining low energy costs. 
Shaw denied the agreement was announced in order to ease criticism of board members while on the campaign trail this year.
Kemp defended the Public Service Commission’s handling of complex utility cases and said it’s ironic that there are complaints about base electric rates being paused for three years. 
“I think this is good news to sell to our state,” Kemp said. “The time, to me, doesn’t matter. We’re talking about an upcoming primary election for down ballot offices that will have to be decided in November. We’re not basing our calendars around here on what political elections are coming up.”
Georgia Power and PSC officials say that the company’s fuel and storm damage costs aren’t profit based, but instead intended to cover fuel cost overruns and money spent responding to natural disasters such as last year’s Hurricane Helene.
Georgia Power was expected to include storm damage assessments as part of its 2025 rate case. Instead, Georgia Power is currently undergoing an audit of storm-related costs and is set to file for recovery expenses in 2026. 
“This stipulated agreement helps balance the affordability needs of our customers while ensuring Georgia Power remains equipped to continue its support of our state’s incredible growth – which is good for all of our stakeholders,” Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft said in a statement.
Georgia Power projects that over the next decade the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption. The proliferation of data centers has become a source of consternation for a number of consumer and environmental watchdogs.
But on Wednesday, Shaw credited the rate case deal agreement with another agreement this year in which Georgia Power agreed not to pass down costs to serve data centers and other large manufacturers onto other customers.  
“Part of the reason we’re able to stand here today, in my opinion, is because we’re able to do things that other states weren’t able to do,” Shaw said. “We’re able to show that the revenue from these large load customers is indeed putting downward pressure on rates for others.”

Megan Hunt of Omaha listens to State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil kneeling at her desk. March 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — An uneasy compromise that became the Education Committee package bill died on the Nebraska statehouse floor Wednesday, in part because the quest to infuse more religion into public schools failed. 
A cross-section of committee members tried to get a group of loosely related education proposals out of committee and onto the floor for a month. 
The combined bill was viewed as a bipartisan deal involving several groups, including the conservative chair of the committee and the state’s largest teachers union, to marry a proposal that would allow K-12 students to be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework to a bill from State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha that would help schools find more long-term substitutes so teachers could take paid time off around significant life events. 
Some who backed the deal have said that parents can already sign out their kids for any reason and that they do not see it as a state endorsement of religion. Other lawmakers have expressed that it would open the door for other religious-themed bills.
Floor debate tense
The floor debate was like many of the tense executive sessions on the package. The deal blew up on the floor after State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha successfully removed Central City’s State Sen. Loren Lippincott’s Legislative Bill 550, a release time proposal, killing the whole package.

While the original deal is dead – lawmakers involved in negotiations let lawmakers skip over the bill. Their aim: to bring back a cleaner version of LB 306 — mainly some clean-up language sought by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil to address change terms and provisions in state law relating to higher education in the session’s final days while giving lawmakers an opportunity to pro attach their proposals to it individually and let the full Legislature vote on each. 
“I think in any normal course of a session, a bill like LB 550 would be seen as a radical piece of legislation,” Hunt said. 
The vote to remove Lippincott’s proposal was bipartisan, 25-9. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of letting students leave, including how often students would miss classes. Some wondered whether it might blur the line between church and state. The Lippincott bill was part of a national lobbying effort by a Christian education organization with ties to the populist right, LifeWise Academy. Lippincott confirmed in previous reporting that his bill is modeled after other states’ “release time” legislation.
Jesse Vohwinkel, LifeWise Academy’s Vice President of Growth, testified in favor of Lippincott’s bill during its public hearing in February. The company was mentioned multiple times during the debate. 
Some GOP dissent
In recent weeks, some legislative Republicans have privately told the Examiner that Lippincott’s bill could go a step too far for them. The vote indicates the climb some social conservatives backing religious bills face.

“I find that it has a high potential of being very discriminatory against other faiths,” State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston said during the debate. 
After the Lippincott proposal was removed from the package, state Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings attempted to remove Spivey’s bill from the package. It failed by a 22-16 vote, needing 25 votes. Then, after the failed motion to remove Spivey’s bill, some Republicans on the committee said Democrats had broken the “deal.” Education Committee Chair State Sen. Murman and other Republicans tanked the package. 
“We had an agreement in the Education Committee,” Murman said. “All of us on the committee had to compromise a little bit … the compromise is no longer in effect.”
Democrats on the committee said Murman’s approach requiring LB 550 in the package had caused the tension. The final nail came in an 8-29 vote, with the Legislature failing to adopt the committee package as an amendment to the bill, LB 306, killing Spivey’s priority bill and other parts of the package.
The Spivey bill sought to give teachers up to three weeks of paid leave to deal with significant life events. The bill would have paid for this leave using a new payroll fee on teacher salaries to cover the costs of paying long-term substitutes while the teachers are out. The fee would also help pay for special education teacher recruitment and retention.
NSEA frustration
The Nebraska State Education Association, one of the brokers of the package, saw the deal blow up as Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, was behind the glass watching lawmakers. He said the union was “disappointed” with the outcome.

“We’re disappointed with the vote. Only 8% of educators feel the Legislature takes them into account when they craft education policy,” Royers said. “Tonight’s vote is indicative of why they feel that way. We fully intend to come back next session and get a bill to the Governor’s desk.”
But the union may not need to wait long if the late compromise between Murman and other lawmakers who want to revive a backup plan comes to fruition. Speaker John Arch said he would bring the base of LB 306 back during the last few days of the session. 
The impromptu compromise came after Omaha State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh threatened to grind the Legislature to a halt over the package’s death.
“This is awful when we can’t pass the committee priority package bill because the committee chairman won’t even vote for his own committee amendment,” Cavanaugh said. “This session is an abomination.” 
Lippincott told the Examiner that he’s considering attempting to propose his amended version of LB 550. However, he said he was thinking about it realistically, as a majority of senators have already rejected his proposal. 
Murman said the remaining proposals that were part of the package would likely get votes as separate amendments. 
“Making laws is like making sausage; you hope it sticks together,” Murman said. “It didn’t.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A late legislative attempt Wednesday to give additional protections to health care practitioners who recommend medical cannabis to Nebraska patients fell well short of moving forward a day after a broader medical cannabis regulatory bill stalled.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha sought to add those physician liability protections Wednesday to a broader Health and Human Services Committee bill: Legislative Bill 376. The measure seeks to slash various reporting requirements and make other changes primarily in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. 
Cavanaugh said his effort was a “solution” that would be a “small but meaningful step” for some of the families who showed up Tuesday for LB 677, the medical cannabis regulatory bill from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. LB 677 failed 23-22, falling 10 votes short of overcoming an all-day filibuster.
“Give these families some hope, some opportunity to get access to what the voters approved at over 70%,” Cavanaugh told his colleagues. “Vote to give doctors some small protection if they follow their conscience and their training.”
‘Absolute failure’: Medical cannabis regulatory bill stalls in Nebraska Legislature

Under the ballot measures approved in November, a patient can possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis for any condition with a health care practitioner’s recommendation.
Physician recommendation hesitancy
However, DHHS has not issued guidance and many advocates have reported that in-state physicians have refused to issue any medical cannabis recommendations. Until medical dispensaries are licensed, which is required under the voter-approved law by Oct. 1, cannabis can’t legally be purchased in Nebraska.
Part of Cavanaugh’s push also comes as Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has acknowledged the possibility of investigating the licenses of physicians who recommend cannabis and continued to challenge the voter-approved laws. 
  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha speaks with reporters after a legislative proposal seeking to help implement medical cannabis stalls in committee. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Under Cavanaugh’s amendment, in language identical to the medical provider protections in LB 677, a health care practitioner could not be arrested, prosecuted or disciplined solely for providing a written recommendation or for stating in their professional opinion that a patient is likely to benefit from using cannabis to treat or alleviate a medical condition.
The Nebraska Medical Association had voiced support for the protections.
‘Cheap parlor trick’
State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, who staunchly opposed LB 677, argued that Cavanaugh’s amendment was not “germane,” or related, to LB 376. Speaker John Arch of La Vista, a former HHS Committee chair who was presiding over the Legislature at the time, agreed.
Cavanaugh moved to overrule the chair, which fell short 15-30, so the proposal didn’t reach an overarching vote. The motion needed at least 24 votes because three senators had left the Capitol.

Hansen, a former HHS Committee chair, said there was no “boogeyman” in the amendment.
But State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering, current chair of the HHS Committee, called the attempt a “cheap parlor trick” that could get LB 376 vetoed. Gov. Jim Pillen has said LB 677 wasn’t needed.
“Fascinating process of playing chess where they’re trying to deep-six the committee bill from HHS with an unwelcome amendment,” Hardin said.
State Sens. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse and Mike Moser of Columbus also disagreed that the amendment was in the “natural and logical sequence” to the subject matter of LB 376,” as Cavanaugh argued under legislative rules. Cavanaugh also pointed to a section in the bill that discussed civil and criminal protections for certain physicians or hospital staff. 
  State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
If the amendment was worthy, Hallstrom and Moser said, senators needed more time.
“I think this is crazy,” Moser said of the amendment, lambasting that it came around 8 p.m.
Last-minute amendments, particularly late at night in legislative sessions, are not unusual.
Germaneness is a mixed bag
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said she thought the amendment was germane and that her opinion was just as valuable as that of Hallstrom or Moser.
Hunt said the “gag” is that germaneness is whatever the majority says it is. She pointed to the 2023 merger of bills to restrict abortion and health care for transgender youths, which State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha also mentioned. The Nebraska Supreme Court later affirmed the combined 2023 bill as having been germane.
DeBoer said she understood Wednesday’s hesitation and asked Cavanaugh why he chose a last-second approach and hadn’t warned Hardin or others before filing his amendment. He responded that LB 677 stalled late Tuesday and that he came up with the idea Wednesday.

DeBoer said that if lawmakers followed past practice on determining germaneness, the amendment was likely germane. But she acknowledged “it’s kind of crappy to do it last minute like this, no offense.” 
DeBoer was one of seven senators who voted for LB 677 but on Wednesday voted to uphold Arch’s ruling against Cavanaugh’s amendment. The others were progressive State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and conservative State Sens. Stan Clouse of Kearney, Myron Dorn of Adams, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Jana Hughes of Seward.
‘Do the right thing’
The two senators voting to overrule Arch’s ruling and who did not vote for LB 677 were State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, who was “present, not voting” as she continued discussing concerns with Hansen, and State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, who missed the final vote but had supported the bill.
Bosn, a former prosecutor who chairs the Judiciary Committee, and whom Pillen first appointed to the Legislature in 2023 before she was elected in November, told the Nebraska Examiner that she was convinced by Cavanaugh’s argument that LB 376 opened up many sections of law.

Had Cavanaugh’s amendment come up for a vote, Bosn confirmed she would have voted for it. Bosn said it made sense and is within legislative responsibility if physicians are reluctant to act. Bosn, Cavanaugh and Hansen said it was also a question the Legislature would have to grapple with soon because the regulatory commission can’t shield physicians through regulations.
In his final plea to senators, Cavanaugh uttered a popular phrase that the “hottest places in hell are reserved for those, when in times of moral crisis, preserve their neutrality.”
“Don’t relegate yourself to the hottest places in Hell,” Cavanaugh said. “Do the right thing for these families.”
Cavanaugh and Hansen said the medical cannabis fight continues in whatever way possible, either in the final seven days of the 2025 session, the regulatory process or in 2026.
Hansen pointed to a phrase on the north side of the State Capitol that he said was crucial as regulations moved forward: “The salvation of the state is watchfulness in the citizen.”



Germaneness of adding medical cannabis physician protections to LB 376
Speaker John Arch of La Vista ruled that liability protections for physicians who recommend medical cannabis was not “germane” to Legislative Bill 376. A vote to overrule Arch failed 15-30. It needed 24 votes.

Wes Moore (D) of the Reparations Commission bill. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore’s veto of the Maryland Reparations Commission bill came as a shock to lawmakers here, but they are confident they can override the veto, making it little more than a temporary setback for the initiative.
“We’re not done in getting this bill into a law. That is the ultimately goal, no matter what hurdles are in front of us,” said Del. Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a House version of the measure and helped pass Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s).
For advocates around the country, however, the shock is still being felt. They worry about what the bill’s troubles in Maryland — a state with a Black governor, a Black attorney general, a Black House Speaker, a Democratic super-majority and a powerful Legislative Black Caucus — portend for efforts in their own states.
“Gov. Moore needs to realize that he’s not only impacting Maryland, but he’s impacting South Carolina and many other states with the veto,” said South Carolina state Rep. John King, a Democrat from the Rock Hill area of the state.
The Maryland bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also have examined how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs. Unlike previous years, when reparations bills had price tags of $1 million or more, the bill passed this year drew heavily on volunteers and existing resources, and was expected to cost $54,500 in its first year.
In his veto letter, Moore praised the work and the intentions of those behind the bill, but said “now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.” He cited a number of studies over the past 25 years on the legacy of slavery, and promised that his legislative agenda next year would include a package of proposals to “address the barriers that have walled off Black families in Maryland from work, wages and wealth for generations.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Those justifications appeared to be lost on many advocates, however, who called the veto everything from shocking to a betrayal.
King expressed his disappointment on his Facebook page Monday, when he called on his state’s Democratic Party to rescind an invitation to Moore, who is scheduled to be the featured speaker at the party’s annual Blue Palmetto Dinner on May 30 in South Carolina. Tickets start at $150 for the dinner, which has featured potential presidential candidates in the past, like U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who headlined last year’s dinner with Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).
“I will still support [the] governor, if he decided to run for president,” said King, who spent summers in Maryland where his mother grew up in the Baltimore area. But in light of the reparations veto, “I don’t think the timing is right for him to come to South Carolina,” he said in an interview Tuesday.
South Carolina Democratic Party officials did not respond to requests for comment, but as recently as Wednesday the party was sending out email appeals urging people to buy tickets for the dinner and the chance to “hear from Maryland Governor Wes Moore.”
King’s colleague, Rep. Annie McDaniel, a Democrat from Fairfield, said she also disagrees with Moore’s veto.
“I’m not saying whether the governor’s right or wrong. I’m just saying that the way he chose to handle this is not good,” McDaniel said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s not good for the plight that African Americans are on now in this state.”
But McDaniel, who chairs the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, also said Moore should attend the Blue Palmetto Dinner and explain himself. She said she would also like to see an invitation extended to Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus.
“I think that would be an awesome opportunity,” McDaniel said. “I don’t want the conversation to be one-sided. I believe in fairness. I just think that having her [Wilkins] in the room and having him [Moore] in the room at the same time will give us an opportunity to hear both sides.”
Wilkins declined to comment Tuesday. A spokesperson for the governor’s office also declined to comment.
‘Reparations now’
Moore’s veto Friday was announced hours after he spoke at commencement for the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, one of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, and the day before an unrelated reparations rally in Washington, D.C.
Moore to veto reparations bill, one of a list of measures he will reject

The governor’s decision has sparked some conversation on online broadcasts and among civil rights organizations. David Johns, CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective, called the governor’s decision in a statement Tuesday “a betrayal of generational efforts to pursue truth, healing, and repair.”
“As the first Black governor of Maryland, Gov. Moore had an opportunity to lead with moral clarity, political courage, and historical awareness,” Johns said in a statement Tuesday. “Instead, his decision represents a dangerous step backward in the long and necessary march toward racial justice.”
Outside the State House on Tuesday, as the governor was inside for the last bill-signing of the year, a small group of protesters stood on Lawyers Mall, holding signs and chanting: “What do we want? Reparations! When do we want it? Now!” The rally was led by Malik Shabazz, an attorney representing Black Lawyers for Justice, who said the legislature should override Moore’s veto.
“Clearly, the governor’s not for reparations,” Shabazz said to reporters. “And clearly, he’s looking to cut off a study and calculation of an assessment of the damages of what has been done to the people and the constituents of his own state, and that’s unacceptable.”
But Linda Lee Tarver, with the Black conservative organization Project 21, said Wednesday that reparations aren’t the answer to help Black communities.
Tarver, who runs a political consulting business in Lansing, Michigan, agreed with Moore’s veto message that studies have been, and continue to be, done by other organizations.  She referenced her own group’s policy recommendations, which include election integrity, reducing “harmful ‘environmental justice’ agenda,” making health care more market oriented and protecting science, technology, engineering and math instruction “from the poison of ‘equity’ activists.”
She said she was surprised at the apparent disconnect between Moore and the Legislative Black Caucus, which had endorsed the reparations bill.
“I believe that Gov. Wes Moore got caught in pretending to care for reparations, and then his pen was required, and he punted,” Tarver said. “It’s shameful. Just say up front you don’t believe in it.”
Disconnect or not, McCaskill said the debate is healthy — and the debate will continue as the commission moves forward, as she believes it will.
“I am excited to hear that it’s on folks’ minds, in opposition or proponents for it,” she said. “This commission is important to hear from all Marylanders because it will eventually affect every Marylander.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Reparations-rally-5-20-2025-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-05-22 01:03:24.763795

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Could North Omaha create its own version of Kansas City’s Keystone Innovation District? Or Indianapolis’ 16 Tech, or the RICE innovation hub in Atlanta, which focuses on building Black businesses?
The three campuses were spotlighted Wednesday as examples of entrepreneurial and tech-centric hubs akin to what could be built locally as the Omaha Inland Port Authority embarks on its newest mission: development of an innovation district, funded partly with $30 million in state funding.
  Small groups generated ideas and goals for the innovation district poised to rise in Omaha’s Inland Port Authority boundaries. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
Nearly 100 people turned out for the public meeting that kicked off a six-month visioning process for the new district, which is to be developed within the boundaries of the port authority’s roughly 3,000 acres in North Omaha, near Eppley Airfield.
Davielle Phillips, an Omaha architect who is vice chair of the port authority board, said the initiative got off to a good start, with more participation than anticipated at the meeting held at the Venue at Highlander Accelerator. 
The board is also overseeing development of an industrial-focused business park funded by a separate $90 million state grant. That initiative, in contrast, was beset early on by criticism that the development team did not seek enough public engagement and input.
For the innovation district, the port authority board hired HR&A Advisors Inc. as a consultant that, along with partners Lamp Rynearson and Vireo, are to create a business plan model for the local innovation district. The consulting contract is for $546,000.
 Music, block parties, housing

During the public meeting Wednesday, the consultant team presented demographic and other data about the North Omaha area and offered examples of other innovation districts. It also highlighted the health-focused EDGE District rising on the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus.
Participants split into groups to discuss what they’d like such a district to look like and achieve. Several said they’d like housing to be a component, along with job training. Many said they’d want the campus to nurture and grow tech startups; draw young talent; raise the area’s per capita income and have a multigenerational and multicultural flair.

One group said music should play a role, along with cultural events and block parties to build community.
Phillips said his goals for the meeting were met, including good attendance and engagement. He said he also wanted to clarify that the innovation district is separate from the long-discussed industrial business park, which was met with resistance from many area residents who worried the city might use the power of eminent domain to force acquisition. That option has been ruled out.
“I want to let people know we heard them; we listened,” Phillips said of the gathering. 
Other port authority board members attended, including mayoral chief of staff Tom Warren, as did North Omaha City Councilwoman-elect LaVonya Goodwin. 
Tuesday, focus groups were invited to offer input. Next steps, Phillips and the consultant said, include a public meeting this summer to continue to build upon the ideas.
 Spot, size yet to be determined

Still to be determined is the exact location of the innovation district within the port authority boundaries, along with its size, shape and character, Phillips said. He said the port authority board likely would seek bids for a developer to build out the district campus.
Both the innovation district and the industrial business park are to be anchors of the port authority and are seen as key to helping more private businesses produce jobs and economic development that benefits North Omaha area residents. 
Funds for both projects originally were approved by the Nebraska Legislature as part of the Nebraska Economic Recovery Act of 2022, seeded with federal pandemic-related dollars, though the legislation and funding sources have since been updated.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)At-Large Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando (D) said Wednesday he will run to replace current County Executive Marc Elrich (D), who is term-limited and cannot run for a third term next year.
Elrich was on hand Wednesday night with at least 200 others for Jawando’s announcement at Citizens and Culture in Silver Spring.
“People need to know you’re going to fight. If they know you’re going to fight, they respect you. They deal with you,” Elrich said. “That’s one of the things that I like about Will, and what I think he brings to this race is that kind of leadership.
“The other thing is independence. You cannot elect the county executive who already has millions of dollars from developers,” he said.
Other speakers included fellow Democratic County Councilmembers Laurie-Anne Sayles and Kristin Mink, and former “The Real Housewives of Potomac” cast member Candiace Dillard Bassett. Support also came from Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D), who is heavily favored in a June 3 special election for county executive there to fill out the term of former Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D), who was elected to the U.S. Senate last fall.
“It matters who you elect as executives in this capital region,” said Braveboy, pointing to the challenges from the Trump administration for local governments. “I can’t think of a brighter, smarter, tougher person for Montgomery County than you. We’re all about diversity, equity and inclusion. We’re going to keep talking about it.”
Jawando, 42, was elected in 2018 to an at-large council seat from the county of 1 million people, the state’s largest. He’s an attorney who’s worked in the U.S. Senate for then-Sen. Barack Obama and for former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. He was the first to announce a bid for the Democratic nomination to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, but he withdrew in October 2023.

On Wednesday, Jawando highlighted some of his priorities as county executive, such as supporting rent stabilization and affordable housing, continuing to invest in the public schools and supporting small businesses, which he said represent about 80% of county businesses.
He touched on the importance of diversity and the “beautiful tapestry” at the restaurant and throughout the county. He talked about his family, including his parents, a Nigerian father and white mother who moved to Montgomery from his mother’s home state of Kansas in 1980.
Besides Jawando walking on stage and his wife, Michele, giving rousing remarks, some of the biggest applause came when he mentioned potholes.
“I promise to fix your potholes in your neighborhood. I know that’s a problem,” he said. “When you have good streets, you have good commerce, and you have good safety. It’s a good thing.”
At least two other candidates have announced bids for county executive. Celeste Iroha, a registered medical assistant, was the first person to announce in March, according to Bethesda Today, whike At-Large County Councilmember Evan Glass (D) said  Wednesday he qualified to use the county’s public financing option. Glass, who was the first openly LGBTQ+ member of the council when elected in 2018, would become the first as county executive, if elected.
County Councilmember Andrew Friedson (D) is expected to also enter the county executive race.
Montgomery and Prince George’s aren’t the only counties getting new leaders. Howard County Executive Calvin Ball (D) and Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) are both term limited and cannot seek a third term next year.
In Baltimore County, former state Sen. Kathy Klausmeier (D) was appointed replace County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. when he was elected to Congress last fall, but she is not expected to seek reelection next year. Baltimore County Councilman Pat Young (D), one of four Democrats eyeing the executive’s seat, announced Wednesday he will be the first candidate in the race to fund his campaign through public financing. The council approved the law in 2021 and funds will be available for disbursements next month for the 2026 election cycle.

The CT Office of the Consumer Counsel has good ideas on how to do that.,"When SB 1560, An Act Concerning Connecticut’s Economy, Electricity Affordability and Business Competitiveness and Establishing the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority and the Green Bond was posted, it raised eyebrows. 
It’s not often a comprehensive 80-page energy bill is introduced in a committee other than Energy & Technology.
The bill creates the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority (CEPA), charged with taking over the buying of electricity, a function performed by our utilities. Also created is a Green Bond fund to pay for parts of electricity bills currently funded by ratepayers.  
The complexity of energy markets is daunting, but it’s important to note that there are processes, called dockets, in which all the players get a chance to participate equally. That due process is vital. It minimizes favoring one interest group over another.
SB 1560 needs work in that area. From testimony posted on the CGA’s website, it clear that many of the bill’s proposals caught energy stakeholders off guard. 
For example, if you put solar on your house or business, you are compensated for that, just like a power plant. And on really sunny days, unlike a fossil fuel plant, you’re putting 100% clean electricity into the grid. SB 1560 would drastically reduce that compensation for solar, just when grid-helpful solar with battery backup installations are increasing.
Solar vendors testified the change would wipe out the solar industry in Connecticut. The exodus of those businesses, jobs, and tax revenue from the state is in no way a positive. There’s a docket currently underway examining solar compensation. Let’s allow that to play out.
Another change proposes redefining nuclear power as renewable energy. To be clear, this won’t suddenly make spent uranium fuel rods unspent. But it will take funding away from true renewables that are cheaper in the long term. 
Ironically, for legislation promoting cost reductions, the solar and nuclear sections will save little, if anything, in the short term, and likely increase costs long term. Similarly, a section to reduce high demand charges to businesses would simply spread that among other ratepayers.
Tasked with electricity procurement, CEPA, according to the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, is not obligated to follow the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, which means “… both participants appearing before it and ratepayers are not guaranteed due process.” Further, CEPA can accept monetary gifts. It’s worth contemplating how sizable donations might influence CEPA’s politically appointed directors.
CEPA would use bonds to fund some of the combined public benefits programs. This could work if done with care. But as written, there are safeguards that are missing. Concerns raised by OCC’s analysis articulate situations that could require ratepayers to “… cover costs of the new programs in addition to the current costs ratepayers pay for on bills.” 
OCC points out they’ve already “… evaluated different potential revisions to our current procurement laws and processes…” in collaboration with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the Energy & Technology Committee, and other stakeholders. If legislators elect to go with a CEPA type entity, OCC has recommendations, one of which places it under the auspices of PURA or the Dept of Energy & Environmental Protection. This would continue necessary oversight on behalf of all ratepayers.  
Legislators voted SB 1560 out of the Finance, Revenue & Bonding committee, making clear it needs to be improved. They want to prudently address high utility rates. The OCC’s expertise is in understanding how to best put that in play.
Let’s put their guidance to work.

Contrary to her claim, effective age verification (‘AV’) does not require either identifying users or building databases of sensitive personal data. In fact, industry-standard systems ensure there is nothing to hack – because no personal data is retained at all.
Today’s age assurance solutions, recognized as “highly effective” by the UK’s globally-respected regulator, Ofcom, already in use across many European Union member states and about to be required in Australia to keep young children off social media completely, use techniques that determine on only your age, never your identity.
Privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), outlined in standards such as ISO/IEC 27566 and IEEE 2089.1, allow independent, regulated third-party age-verification providers to confirm a user is over or under a threshold age without the websites or platforms they are accessing ever knowing who they are.
The data breaches Caccamo references were not from age verification providers – who are audited and certified to avoid retaining personal data – but from identity verification services, which necessarily store information that could be compromised. That distinction matters.
Modern age verification does not rely only on government-issued ID. It can be achieved through tokenized signals, anonymized hand movement and facial estimation (where images are immediately deleted, and often never leave the palm of your hand as the estimate is processed on your own smartphone), or verified credentials stored securely in users’ own devices. These approaches work across all communities, including those who lack traditional ID or are rightly concerned about discrimination or surveillance.
Equally misguided is the idea that platforms will downgrade services for everyone. Just as websites currently tailor content based on device, location or cookies, they can provide age-appropriate access without creating a “Disneyfied” internet.  The latest interoperable technology means you can do one age check and then use it across multiple sites – truly making the Internet age-aware.  Note that is age, not identity.  The essence of the age verification industry is proving your age without disclosing who you are.
Laws do need to be carefully drafted – targeting only harmful content and functionality, not entire apps that for many young people are the principal way they access the many benefits of the Internet. But dismissing age assurance entirely ignores the global shift towards privacy-first, standards-based solutions that protect children without compromising adult freedoms.
Connecticut has the chance to lead with smart, privacy-respecting legislation. That means rejecting myths and recognizing that age verification is not about identity – it’s about child safety, anonymity, and trust.

“Congratulations!” the protesters called out to the cadets and their family members as they passed by on the sidewalk. Some of the graduation attendees thanked the protesters for their presence outside the academy.
The protesters carried signs calling out various actions by the Trump administration, including the unlawful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, the Trump administration’s cuts to veterans services, the recent federal budget proposal that includes cuts to Medicaid, the administration’s position on Ukraine and the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student who played a strong role in pro-Palestinian protests.

While demonstrators protested right outside of the campus, Noem got a polite and warm reception from Cadet Memorial Field as she delivered a 20-minute keynote address.
“You’re the first graduating class of a brand new Coast Guard,” Noem said. “I want to share with you today what part of President Trump’s vision is for the future of this force. With your help, President Trump and I are going to make America’s Coast Guard the strongest, the most capable, the also most effective military service in the entire government.”
She highlighted recent conversations with President Donald J. Trump from the Oval Office about the needs of the Coast Guard, which, unlike other military branches, is overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And she detailed how the administration plans to “transform” the service through a new effort called “Force Design 2028.”
Protesters, meanwhile, uniformly told The Connecticut Mirror they had no problem with the Coast Guard. In fact, they expressed admiration for the service.
“[I] highly respect the Coast Guard,” said Janet Bannister of Coventry. “I’ve known a lot of young people who have made it through. I’m just so proud of them. So yes, we hope it’s clear to people that we are pro-Coast Guard and celebrating the graduates, but … here we are.”

Montville resident Linda Ness said she was against the current federal budget proposal, particularly cuts to Medicaid and the amount of money it would add to the national debt.
“It’s where they’re putting their money. It has nothing to do with the country[’s] needs and the people. They’re taking care of corporations, they’re taking care of the ultra-wealthy. That’s not democracy,” she said.
Ness held a sign listing police, fire departments, hospitals and utilities as some of the benefits that the wealthy use and said she was opposed to the idea of them receiving tax cuts.
Claudia Allen, a resident of Thompson, told CT Mirror that she’d been attending protests since Ronald Reagan was elected president.
“ My son was sent to Iraq, and I’m a peace activist. That was horrifying, with George Bush. But even that, there were some people who were competent and who were not aligned [with] him instead of the U.S. Constitution,” said Allen. “This is the Constitution state, and she’s not upholding the Constitution, nor is that administration. That’s a big reason that I’m here.”

Immigration enforcement was another common theme among the protesters. They mentioned the violation of court orders, instances of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apprehending people, and deportations to countries like El Salvador and South Sudan without due process.
“[The administration] is so incompetent,” said Denise Weinschenker of Salem. “ He was supposed to drain the swamp. Instead he went into the swamp and pulled all those people out.”
Joanne Sheehan, one of the protest’s organizers and a member of the Unify & Resist Coalition, told CT Mirror that they have organized protests in the past against U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement speakers. She said they had counted 250 people present at the protest today but estimated that there were more.
Sheehan said the protests were different sizes each year. Some years, only a few dozen people showed up, and others counted protesters in the hundreds. The largest, she said, was the spring after Trump was elected for the first time.

Other protesters mentioned the abrupt firing of Admiral Linda Lee Fagan in late January, a day after Trump’s inauguration.
They criticized the administration for Fagan’s dismissal, noting that she was the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and praising her focus on diversity in the Coast Guard.
“Sexual assault has been endemic and such a problem here. And they finally get someone to clean it up, and he fires her immediately. Day one,” said Mystic resident Martha Crum.
The firing drew condemnation from some of Connecticut’s congressional delegation at the time.
DHS officials cited issues with deployment of the Coast Guard to assist with border security, dissatisfaction with recruitment and retention, efforts surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and cost overruns on icebreakers and helicopters used in the Arctic region.
They also raised concerns about the handling of Operation Fouled Anchor, an investigation into decades of sexual misconduct claims at the Coast Guard Academy and past leaders’ decisions not to disclose a report about it to Congress. Fagan did not serve as commandant at that time but had apologized for not acting on it until CNN broke the story in 2023.

In addition to a shift in top leadership, the Coast Guard and its New London service academy have already undergone other structural changes.
Since Trump’s executive order taking aim at DEI policies, the Coast Guard has shuttered a number of DEI-related programs and offices, including the Academy’s Office of Culture and Climate.
The Coast Guard had prioritized DEI as a way to boost recruitment and retention among cadets as well as within the force. In a Coast Guard Academy diversity report submitted to Congress in 2024, Fagan wrote that such initiatives show progress was made “in attracting a workforce that is representative of the nation and preparing culturally competent leaders for the future.”
Recruitment was a big part of Noem’s keynote address Wednesday, pointing out the current shortfalls in the enlisted workforce as well as ships with incomplete crews. According to Admiral Kevin Lunday, who is currently serving as acting commandant, the Coast Guard has surpassed its annual recruitment goal and has so far recruited 4,700 new members, Noem said.
Since Trump’s executive order taking aim at DEI policies, the Coast Guard has shuttered a number of DEI-related programs and offices, including the Academy’s Office of Culture and Climate.
Along with recruitment, Noem said, “Force Design 2028” will aim to reorganize the service by reducing the number of admirals by 25%, replacing outdated technology, fixing crumbling infrastructure and increasing the number of icebreakers. She said the goal over the next four years is to increase the size of the Coast Guard by at least 15,000 personnel.
“Those needs represent the biggest Coast Guard readiness crisis that we have seen since World War II,” Noem said. “That may have been the Coast Guard of the past, but that will not be the Coast Guard of the future.”
As her speech concluded, Noem made an initially unplanned announcement about the new leadership team at the Coast Guard. Among other promotions, Lunday will now be nominated for the commandant role permanently. He spoke shortly before Noem and praised the administration for its “inspiring leadership and remarkable advocacy” of the Coast Guard.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The federal judge overseeing the case of a Columbia University student activist held at a Louisiana immigration detention center has deferred to the private prison company managing the facility in determining certain rules for her court. 
The questioned standards come into play as Mahmoud Khalil faces his next court hearing Thursday morning at the LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, when his attorneys say they’ll file a motion to throw out the case against him for “egregious government misconduct,” namely that Khalil was arrested without a warrant. They’ll also argue that Khalil is at risk of harm by Israel “anywhere in the world” and thus cannot be removed to Syria or Algeria.
The hearing is the first since one of Khalil’s attorneys, Nora Ahmed with the American Civil Liberties Union, was prevented from bringing her laptop computer into the courtroom on the grounds of the LaSalle Detention Center for an April 11 hearing. Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans said Khalil’s attorneys must abide by policies set by the facility’s operator, the GEO Group. Ahmed was prevented from having her electronics with her, despite attorneys for the federal government being allowed to have their computers.

Comans’ ruling gives the Trump administration an unfair advantage in the case, Ahmed said in an interview with the Illuminator.
“It facially goes to show how biased the hearing was from the get-go – that this attorney was denied all of the access to electronics that the government” had, Ahmed said. 
Khalil has been held at the Lasalle Detention Center since March 8, when federal authorities took him from his Columbia University apartment building in New York City. Although he’s a legal U.S. resident, ICE officials said they had a warrant to revoke Khalil’s student visa. He’s the first person President Donald Trump sought to deport from the U.S. for his involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests.
Motion sought formal order
Over two months after being taken into federal custody, Khalil has yet to be charged with a crime. At his April 11 hearing, Comans ruled him deportable in light of a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating that Khalil’s activities at Columbia could have “adverse foreign policy consequences.” 
According to a motion filed April 28, Ahmed was prevented from bringing her laptop and phone into that hearing, despite DOJ policy explicitly allowing counsel to have electronics. Ahmed said she had already been given permission to take her electronics inside by the ICE facility’s warden, GEO Group employee Shad Rice. GEO Group personnel handle security for the facility, including the secured area between the facility’s entrance and the courtroom doors. 
Unable to bring her computer into the courtroom, Ahmed worked with a notebook and pen instead.
Judge Comans’ refusal to let Ahmed retrieve her computer is in direct violation of the Department of Justice’s policy, according to the April 29 motion. The policy states that attorneys “in proceedings before [Executive Office for Immigration Review] will be permitted to use electronic devices in EOIR courtrooms.”
After the hearing, according to the motion, Rice told Ahmed that “the Judge appeared to contradict herself” by blaming him and the GEO Group for Ahmed not being allowed to bring her laptop into the courtroom.
Jason Burke, administrator for the LaSalle Immigration Court, told the Illuminator that Justice Department rules do indeed allow Ahmed to bring her laptop to court proceedings, “but they got to get to EOIR space first. which we don’t control when we’re in a detention center.” 
The GEO Group declined to answer questions regarding the matter.
In light of the confusion on April 11, the April 28 motion asked the court to ensure that Khalil’s counsel at upcoming hearings could bring their electronics into chambers. 
Comans ruled May 9 that the motion was moot, writing that “should an attorney elect to appear in person, they are subject to the detention facility’s rules.”
Homero López, director of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in New Orleans, was startled when he learned of the judge’s order, which he described as “bulls–t.” López previously had a similar issue in 2022 at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in the Acadia Parish town of Basile. It was resolved when ICE Field Office Director Melissa Harper “clarified with Basile management that laptops will be permitted,” per emails López provided to Illuminator.
López said it was particularly surprising to have that issue at the Jena center, where, unlike other Louisiana ICE centers, the detention area and courtroom have separate entrances. 
“I’ve never had to once ask anybody for additional permission to bring electronics into court” at Jena, nor has any other attorney he knows, López said. Comans should have directed ICE to get GEO Group to abide by federal policy – not defer to the company – he added. 
The judge’s failure to do so “is another way to discourage people from taking on cases at that facility,” López said.

Unequal footing for ICE detainees
Khalil’s lawyers argue that the unequal access highlights a lack of transparency around immigration proceedings, and the hurdles the GEO Group and the federal justice present that affect a detainee’s legal proceedings. In a briefing for reporters Wednesday, co-counsel Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at City University of New York, described Comans as “an immigration judge who’s not an independent judge, who’s really a DOJ functionary.”
Khalil’s counsel decried this lack of transparency in a second motion, also filed April 28. The motion requested that, due to enormous public interest in Khalil’s case, Comans allow virtual or telephonic access for her proceedings.
During the April 11 hearing, Ahmed had asked permission to read out a statement about public access – a request Comans refused.
Ahmed’s quashed statement was a plea for Comans to ensure broader access to the hearing, noting that “what transpires today – determining who is allowed to stay on American soil and who must leave it – will have reverberations for years to come. As such, we ask this court to accommodate those intent on observing these proceedings.”
Instead, GEO Group security allowed less than two dozen people to enter the facility, leaving supporters and members of the news media to wait outside, some of whom had traveled from as far as New York. 
Zach Kopkin, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace in New Orleans, was among those denied access. He told Illuminator that it “felt really important that Jewish folks be in that room” and “that we fight back with the truth, which is that a ton of Jews are also critical of the Israeli government’s war crimes and genocide.” 
Comans also called the second motion moot, noting simply that “immigration hearings are generally open to the public, although certain exceptions apply.”  Khalil’s team still has an outstanding request to the judge for an overflow room.
Khalil hopes to hold month-old son
New allegations against the GEO Group of violating federal policy in Khalil’s case were levied Wednesday. The LaSalle facility has refused to allow Khalil to hold his newborn son, who was born while he’s been in federal custody, citing “security concerns.” This comes despite ICE directives and federal policies which explicitly encourage contact between detained parents and children.
Khalil filed a request Wednesday with a federal court to order ICE to allow him a contact visit with his month-old son by the end of the day. The federal court accepted the argument and Khalil’s counsel say they’re working out details of the visit. Khalil’s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, traveled over 1,000 miles with their child so Khalil could hold him for the first time.  
According to emails within the filing, the GEO Group’s facility administrator said its procedures allow for “non-contact” visits only through a secure window. 
ICE policy notes that contact visits “may be facilitated at all ICE detention facilities.” 
Khalil’s lawyers argue the GEO Group’s refusal of contact is part of the “punitive” nature of his detention and transfer from its New Jersey facility, where family contact visits are provided daily and parents are allowed to hold their children.
Judge Comans will also decide whether Dr. Abdalla is permitted to hold their infant while attending proceedings Thursday.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Are 15 minutes enough time for a lunch break? That’s the typical time Utah schools allocate for children to eat, counting the time to walk to the cafeteria, and line up to get food. 
That’s a big deal for many parents and children, Rep. Tiara Auxier, R-Morgan, said during the the Education Interim Committee’s first meeting of the year on Wednesday, while she advocated for the panel to study expanding the seat time for lunch in public schools.
As her colleagues passed a House bill this year making school lunch free for students who qualify for reduced-priced meals, Auxier kept thinking about unresolved issues, especially the timing concern she experienced with her kids.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“One of my biggest concerns was that we were going to be putting a lot of money into this program, and the kids still weren’t going to be able to eat them,” Auxier said. “We heard so many times about full trash cans and kids just being rushed out.”
With some lawmakers supporting the idea, while acknowledging that its implementation could be a challenge, the committee voted unanimously to add a review of policies and best practices centered around lunch times to its list of interim study items and audits. 
Starting July 1, Utah students qualifying for reduced-priced lunches can get meals for free

Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, who is an educator, said this is a step in the right direction, though she worried about how extending the lunch break may affect existing legislation requiring certain time minimums for core subjects. 
That’s a concern that the chair of the committee, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, had heard as well from teachers.
“They usually say, ‘well, we just don’t have time, right? You’ve got to pack everything in.’” Pierucci said. “So that should be a part of this discussion.”
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends schools provide at least 20 minutes of seat time for students to eat their meals and socialize. That’s apart from the time it takes them to use the restroom and wash their hands, wait in line, walk to their tables and bus trays after the meals. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“About half of school districts nationwide do not require or recommend that schools give students at least 20 minutes to eat, once they receive their meal,” the CDC’s website reads. “Some students report that insufficient time to eat is a key reason for not participating in the school lunch program.”
The Utah State Board of Education has a similar guideline in its Health and Wellness Policy, directing schools to provide a minimum of 10 minutes for breakfast, and 20 minutes of lunch, “which excludes time to arrive at the cafeteria and waiting in line.” However, lawmakers noted that it seems like the direction isn’t being followed in all schools.
As of Wednesday, the committee is prioritizing other study items, including changes to the Department of Education and other federal programs with the new administration; any progress on universities’ plans to reallocate 10% of their budget for courses; reviewing school employees’ disciplinary actions; and solutions for chronic absenteeism.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After 22 years in the Alaska Senate, Senate President Gary Stevens is retiring. 
Stevens’ decision has been discussed in the Alaska Capitol for more than a year, but on Tuesday, it became official as Kodiak Republican Rep. Louise Stutes became the first person to announce that she will run for Stevens’ seat.
“I certainly will endorse Louise any way I can to help her out,” Stevens said on Wednesday. “She should be a really fine senator. She’s had a lot of experience in the House, and I think she’d do a great job, and I’d be glad to help her out in any way I can.”
Stutes filed a letter of intent with the Alaska Public Offices Commission shortly after the Alaska Legislature adjourned its regular session for the year. 
Legislators are forbidden from campaigning during the session, and the day after the first year of the legislative session typically marks the informal opening of the candidate filing period.
Campaigning typically doesn’t begin in earnest until after the second year of the legislative session.
Stutes’ early start may be a foreshadowing of things to come in the district: Stevens has represented the area covering Kodiak and the southern Kenai Peninsula since being appointed to the seat in 2003, making next year’s election a generational shift for the district.
Stutes said on Wednesday that fundraising doesn’t come naturally to her, “so I thought that I’d better get a jump start on it. You can’t get a jump start on it until you file your letter.”
Stutes said she doesn’t know whether there will be many candidates in the race.
Each of Alaska’s Senate districts includes two House districts. Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, represents the other half of Stevens’ district and hasn’t filed a letter of intent for next year’s elections. She did not return a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday afternoon.
Stutes noted that her husband, commercial fisherman Stormy Stutes, grew up in Anchor Point, and they still have family members who live in Vance’s district, so she has connections to that part of Alaska.
This isn’t the first time that Stevens has said he will retire, but it’s certain this time.
“I’m 83 now. I’ll be 85 when I retire, and I think that’s just enough,” he said by phone. “I have other plans, things I want to do. I wrote a play about Ted Stevens that was successful in Anchorage; I want to do another one. I’m a bit of a painter, and I want to go on and do painting and writing and concentrate on those things, as well as spend time with my grandkids.”
Stutes said she’s been interested in running to replace Stevens since that first abortive retirement.
“I’m really lucky. Gary and I get along really well. … He’s been wonderful to work with. I’ll really miss him, of course, because we have such a great working relationship,” she said.
Voters elected Stutes to replace longtime Kodiak lawmaker Alan Austerman in 2014 and reelected her five times since then. She has governed as a moderate Republican, frequently joining the House’s predominantly Democratic coalition and once served a term as speaker of the House.  
“I’m like every legislator. I really feel like I’m helping my district and Alaskans. Right or wrong, I feel like I’ve been able to make a difference with the Marine Highway System. I believe I’ve been able to help bring fisheries to the forefront,” Stutes said. “When I first got elected years ago, I told Stormy that the one thing I want to do is take fisheries from the back burner and put them on the front burner. And I think that I’ve been somewhat successful in moving it forward.”
The Alaska Senate is currently controlled by a 14-person bipartisan coalition that includes nine Democrats and five Republicans. Three of those Republicans are up for reelection next year, and all are in potential swing districts.
Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, and Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, said they will run for office again. Stevens is the third. 
Among the coalition’s Democrats, Sens. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage, and Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, both confirmed that they will run for reelection. 
Sens. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, and Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, have not yet filed letters of intent. Hoffman has been in the Legislature since 1987 and in the Senate since 1991, making him the longest-serving legislator in state history.
Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, said on Wednesday that he hasn’t yet decided whether he will run for reelection. 
Sens. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, and Rob Myers, R-North Pole, also face reelection next year. Neither returned a text message seeking comment on Wednesday.
Among incumbent members of the state House, Reps. Maxine Dibert, D-Anchorage, Carolyn Hall, D-Anchorage, and Donna Mears, D-Anchorage, have all filed letters of intent for reelection. 
Former Rep. Cliff Groh, D-Anchorage, announced that he will again seek to challenge Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, in 2026. Nelson had been elected in 2020, lost to Groh in 2022 and defeated Groh in 2024.Through Wednesday afternoon, Groh was the only nonincumbent to file with the Public Offices Commission.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A pay raise for legislators, lottery ticket payments using debit cards and a potential reduction in funding for the city of Columbia were all part of a spending plan a panel of legislators approved Wednesday.
Much of the actual spending in the state’s $14.7 billion budget, including a $1,500 bump in the state’s minimum teacher pay and the completion of an income tax reduction already in law, was locked in when the six-person committee started negotiating Tuesday.
A $1 billion hike in revenue projections Tuesday helped legislators quickly settle the remaining differences between the House and Senate spending plans.
The newly recognized revenue allowed budget negotiators to choose whichever plan had the larger amount. That includes sending the state Department of Transportation $200 million to fix aging bridges and $35 million for Hurricane Helene cleanup (the House version), instead of the Senate’s $100 million and $25 million.
Negotiators also approved $45 million to pay private K-12 school tuition and other costs for up to 10,000 eligible K-12 students under a law Gov. Henry McMaster signed earlier this year. (The Senate version put $20 million toward the scholarships.)
SC legislators get extra $1B to spend as budget negotiations begin

They left roughly $500 million of the unexpected revenues unspent. That could become part of discussions next year in changing the state’s income tax structure. It could also serve to fill holes amid economic uncertainties, said House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, R-Greenville.
“That’s left us a lot of flexibility, which I think is a good, responsible way to do it,” Bannister said.
Not included in this year’s budget were earmarks.
Removing all one-time funding requested by legislators, usually for their districts, sped up the process, said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney.
While some legislators have said the decision will disproportionately hurt poor, rural areas that lack the tax base to pay for projects themselves, Peeler and Bannister said a one-year moratorium was needed to rein in spending that swelled into the hundreds of millions of dollars the last several years.
“It’s something that needed to happen this year,” said Peeler, who made the initial announcement refusing earmarks this year. “It had gotten out of hand — too many earmarks, too large — and we had to have a full stop.”
Legislators are expected to take a final vote on the spending package next week. It takes effect with the July 1 start of the fiscal year.
Pay raise for legislators
Budget clauses that direct how to spend money made up most of the items of contention this year.
That included a directive that effectively increases legislators’ pay by $18,000 over the fiscal year.
The clause inserted into the Senate plan during that chamber’s floor debate was approved unanimously Wednesday by the panel’s three representatives and three senators. It officially raises their allowance for “in-district” expenses from $1,000 to $2,500 per month. But there are no limitations on how it can be spent, so it’s really just a raise.
That adds to their salaries of $10,400, which hasn’t changed since 1990. They also receive stipends that are meant to cover meals and lodging as well as mileage while they’re in session. Their $1,000 “in-district compensation” hasn’t changed since 1995.
The last time legislators attempted to increase it was in 2014, when then-Gov. Nikki Haley vetoed the effort. In that time, inflation has caused costs to rise drastically, legislators who proposed the change said.
“It’s just time,” Bannister told reporters.
Peeler, who voted against the raise on the floor, said he voted for it Wednesday in order to reflect the will of the full Senate, which voted 24-15 on the raise. But he said he still didn’t fully support it personally.
McMaster recently told reporters he’ll decide whether to veto the clause after the final package reaches his desk. But he hinted he may let it go, unlike his predecessor.
Being a legislator is officially a part-time job. But legislators work hard and often late into the night. It makes sense that inflation has hit them hard too, he said.
“They need to be able to work without a whole lot of distraction,” McMaster said. “I’d like to see exactly what the details are, but everyone, if they’re working at home, they have a home office, an office in their business, I think they’re entitled to be reimbursed for all their expenses, and that’s the nature of this.”
Other spending clauses
Also adopted by negotiators was a clause that would revoke an estimated $3.7 million from the state’s capital city unless it repeals a ban on so-called conversion therapy.
The Columbia City Council deferred a vote Tuesday on the 2021 ordinance that threatens a $500 fine for anyone who tries to alter a juvenile’s gender identity or sexual orientation through counseling. Officials wanted to wait and see whether the clause was included in the final version of the budget.
Attorney General Alan Wilson sent the city a letter earlier this year asking council members to repeal the ban to “avoid any future legal action.” Under a 2022 state law, only the state can license and regulate medical fields, including counselors, Wilson wrote.

The clause included in the state budget threatens to pull state aid from any city with an ordinance banning the practice, but Columbia is the only city in the state with such a ban.
Bannister spoke with members of the Columbia City Council before the vote. He said the officials he spoke with — he declined to name them — supported including the threat in the budget, as they feared the city would lose any lawsuit challenging the ordinance.
Adding the clause “would encourage their members to think a little harder about it,” Bannister said.
Another adopted budget directive would allow people to buy lottery tickets using debit cards, which Gov. Henry McMaster recommended as part of his executive budget. Opponents of gambling insisted on banning sales using credit and debit cards in 2001, when legislators created the lottery.
But as fewer people regularly carry cash with them, allowing sales using debit cards could increase revenue by about $52 million, the state Lottery Commission estimated.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The state House budget proposal drew broad bipartisan support Wednesday after Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said he liked a lot of it. 
The House gave its budget preliminary approval with a vote of 93-20 after hours of debate on proposed amendments. Thursday’s vote will start negotiations between House and Senate Republicans on a compromise spending plan. The Senate passed a budget last month that is significantly different from the House plan. A final vote on the House plan is expected to take place on Thursday.
The House Republican-authored budget would significantly increase beginning teacher salaries. It also gives state employees 2.5% raises, though House Republicans said workers will get more because agencies will be able to use money from the elimination of thousands of vacant jobs to fund wage hikes.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a House senior budget writer, called it a “well-crafted plan” that builds on the state’s “strong fiscal management.”
Stein praised the House budget for these proposed salary increases and, in a statement, highlighted the differences between the House and Senate tax policies. 
The state’s 2023 budget built in up to three automatic personal income tax cuts in tax years 2027 to 2034 that depend on the state meeting revenue targets. 
The House budget changes those targets, meaning the state would need to bring in more money to trigger a reduction in the personal income tax rate and likely delay a cut.

Rep. Julia Howard (R-Davie) said the increased revenue amounts needed to trigger tax cuts were based on inflation and population growth. 
The House budget also increases personal income tax standard deductions and restores a back-to-school sales tax holiday. An income tax deduction on tips of up to $5,000 would begin in the 2026 tax year. 
Nonpartisan economists in the state budget office and the legislature have projected state revenues will drop in 2026-2027 as planned tax cuts take effect. In addition to cuts in the personal income tax rate, the corporate income tax is being phased out.
The Senate budget proposal took the opposite approach, adding more triggered cuts. 
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters he did not believe the revenue forecast. 
Stein wanted to freeze income tax cuts, but among the Republican options, he prefers the House approach. 
“Importantly, the House budget cuts taxes for working families while recognizing that North Carolina is a growing state and reduces personal income tax rates after this year only when the economy is growing,” Stein said in a statement. “In contrast, the Senate’s fiscally irresponsible revenue scheme will result in fewer teachers and law enforcement officers and diminished services that would harm our people.”

In an interview, House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham), said the state is in tough fiscal shape because of cuts to revenues and overspending on vouchers that rural students don’t even have the chance to use.
Republicans are protective of vouchers, and the House rejected amendments that would take even modest amounts from voucher reserves to fund other education needs. They also rejected an amendment that would restore family income limits, require schools accepting vouchers to limit their annual tuition and fee increases to 5%, and require teachers in voucher schools to hold a bachelor’s degree or a teacher license.
The House budget is a negotiating document, a counterproposal to the Senate budget, Reives said in the interview.
“Our ultimate goal is we have got to get a budget that is responsible,” Reives said. “The Senate budget is completely irresponsible. We’ve got to get a budget that recognizes the fiscal position that we’re in, and we’ve got to get a budget that starts talking about the tough questions.”
Reives and 26 other Democrats voted for the budget. Reives said during the floor debate he wouldn’t vote for it if it was the final bill.
“There is a lot of work that has to get done before we have a bipartisan budget,” he said.
House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) acknowledged that it was unlikely the final budget would earn such broad support.
“Both sides got a chance to put forth their amendments,” Hall told reporters after the vote. “And I think that … made up most of the reason why you see a bipartisan vote today.”
Meanwhile, the House budget faced resistance from outside conservative voices.
Club for Growth, a national group that focuses on tax cuts and often spends big in elections, sent out a public threat to anyone voting for the House budget. Those who support it “should expect to be held accountable on election day, and kiss their political future goodbye,” the group wrote on social media.
And the Carolina Partnership for Reform, in its newsletter and blog, decried the plan as a “Republican-sponsored tax increase.”
“Having no budget deal is a better outcome than this one,” the group wrote.

Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort), leader of the body’s hard right Freedom Caucus, sought to counter any criticism of the House approach to taxes.
“We’ve got one of the best bills from a tax perspective I’ve seen,” he said. “Let’s send a message to the Senate that we have one heck of a bill here, and they need to pass it.” 
Hall remarked that he believed the critical conservative groups “like the Senate budget, and would prefer House members to like the Senate budget.”
The House rejected 40 amendments offered by Democrats over hours of debate. The House adopted four amendments, including one that would kill tolling a portion of Raleigh’s Capital Boulevard to pay to widen it. The state Department of Transportation is planning to toll the road from I-540 in Raleigh into Wake Forest.
“We do not tax free roads in North Carolina,” said Rep. Mike Schietzelt (R-Wake). The amendment will prevent using public money to study, design, build, operate, or implement tolling on Capital Boulevard.
Two Wake Democrats said shutting down the option for tolls would curtail efforts to improve the highly trafficked thoroughfare
“We need to have the conversation with the communities to get to the right solutions,” said Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake). “This is not going to get the outcome that you need.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1868-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 21:03:46.028913
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-22 00:32:17+00:00,CT Mirror,Teachers arrested at CT Capitol after rally for education funding,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/21/teachers-arrested-capitol-education-funding/,"The apprehensions took place following a rally of teachers, students and others seeking more per-pupil funding for CT school districts.","Several educators and at least one student were arrested for disorderly conduct after staging a sit-down in front of Gov. Ned Lamont’s office at the state Capitol Wednesday afternoon.
The apprehensions took place in the wake of a rally, organized by the state’s chapter of the American Federation of Teachers union. For over an hour Wednesday afternoon, chants of “Fund our schools!” echoed within and outside the building as dozens of union members, students and other community leaders called on the governor and lawmakers to increase assistance for school districts and boost support for growing special education costs.
The group is seeking provisions in Senate Bill 1511, a proposal to increase per-pupil funding in the state’s Education Cost Sharing Grant, to be implemented in the state budget.
“Our children should not be subjected to the reality of two Connecticuts,” said Leslie Blatteau, who serves as the president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers. “Our children in New Haven, New Britain, Bridgeport, Hartford, Meriden and rural parts of this state deserve the world class education we know students in other parts of the state get.”
Since 2013, the state has contributed $11,525 per student to education districts, with additional funding for students who come from low-income backgrounds and those who are multilingual learners. S.B. 1511 proposes raising that “foundation” amount by over $960, to at least $12,488 per pupil; It also proposes adding a 50% weight for students with disabilities who receive special education services.
Earlier this year, legislators passed emergency legislation to provide $40 million in supplemental aid this fiscal year to local schools to offset what many called a crisis in special education. The School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan education policy group, estimated districts needed $108 million.
The governor has proposed sending schools an extra $40 million annually for special education, but that wouldn’t kick in until 2027-28 — two years from now.
The Appropriations Committee budget, released in late April, would maintain the extra $40 million in state payments in the next two fiscal years and add another $124 million in special education grants in each of the next two years.
At a news conference Wednesday morning, House Speaker Matt Ritter said he thought much of what educators were seeking was already in the committee’s proposed budget. 
“I’d have to know what the argument is,” he said. “I mean we are doing the 50% weight, so if that’s the cause, don’t get arrested for that. We’re doing it.”
In response to Ritter’s comments earlier Wednesday, educators said the proposed budget was a step in the right direction, but that the state also has to also make up for decades of chronic underfunding.
“We will recognize that yes, the [Education Cost Sharing] formula is fully funded now, but still we are dealing with years after years of deficits before,” Blatteau said. “That’s hard to rebound from.” She said remedies would include the 50% weight for special education and an increase to the “foundation” amount. 
“We shouldn’t have to wait another 10 years,” she said.

After a brief news conference outside Wednesday afternoon, Blatteau joined over 100 education advocates who marched into the Capitol and overtook two floors in the building. The governor then spoke with roughly two dozen of the protestors in a closed-door meeting in his office.
“Gov. Lamont invited members from AFT to his office today to hear their thoughts and concerns. Connecticut has the best schools in the country because we have the best teachers in the country. That’s why he has made historic investments and increases in education funding,” Julia Bergman, a spokesperson for Lamont’s office, said in a written statement Wednesday evening. “During the final weeks of session, he plans to work with the legislature that continues that progress.”
Following the meeting with the governor, Blatteau told her fellow protestors that Lamont “was not able to commit to us today the necessary increase that we want to see that will fix the formula and that will prevent staffing cuts and layoffs across the state.”
Blatteau’s comments triggered loud booing from the crowd. 
Then Blatteau and nine other educators and students sat down outside the governor’s office, blocking the doors. After ignoring requests to leave the premises and threats of arrest for disorderly conduct from Capitol police officers, the ten individuals were placed in flex cuffs and escorted outside. They were met with cheers and chants from the crowd there as they were charged.

“I feel embarrassed by some of [Lamont’s] questions to the crew,” said David Weinreb, a magnet resource teacher at Elm City Montessori School in New Haven and one of the educators who spoke with Lamont Wednesday. 
“He asked us ‘How are the kids doing?’ as if it’s a question that we hadn’t wrestled with or a thought about a ton every day,” Weinreb said. “I was disappointed in how out of touch he sounded and how confused he seemed to be in terms of processing what we were asking for.”
The demonstration Wednesday was just one of many ongoing efforts by education leaders and advocates during this year’s legislative session, in which they’ve called on the state government to increase funding for public schools. On multiple occasions, students have lent their voices to the effort, including bussing in from around the state and leading rallies of their own. Superintendents and mayors from the largest school districts in Connecticut have also held news conferences seeking more funding.
In January, education advocates called for $545 million in increased funding, a figure derived from an October report put out by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which offered recommendations for reengaging students who have lost touch with the education system. 
In recent weeks however, education leaders and advocates have switched gears, saying their requests are simply to help maintain staffing.
“We’re bleeding staff left and right and class sizes are going to increase. We also have issues that we might not be able to fully schedule students because we don’t have enough personnel,” Norwalk Superintendent Alexandra Estrella told The Connecticut Mirror earlier this month. 
“We just got out of a pandemic. The crisis has not ended yet. The resources have been depleted, and the need continues.”

Jimenez/National Park Service)A state judge has extended a restraining order that bars the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from killing bears in a controversial predator-control program.
Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin, in an order issued late Monday, said the department’s decision to shoot bears earlier this month in violation of a previous court ruling justified her decision to keep the temporary restraining order in place beyond the 10 days that is standard in Alaska law.
The department will be prohibited from conducting its planned bear cull in the Mulchatna caribou herd range until it corrects the legal flaws identified in a March 14 ruling issued by a different judge, Rankin said.
She rejected the state’s request to lift the restraining order and its argument that the prohibition was no longer needed.
“Despite the State’s stated intention of discontinuing its bear predator control measures this season, due to its prior position that it would continue bear abatement unless specifically enjoined, this Court thinks it is prudent to specifically state that the TRO will not expire after ten days and extends the TRO until further order of the Court or until the State obtains proper legal authority, consistent with the March 14 Order, and the May 7, 2025 Order,” she said in her order.
It is the latest development in a lawsuit filed in 2023 by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance that challenged the predator control program.
State officials say the program is needed to boost Mulchatna caribou herd numbers, and it must be conducted in spring and early summer, when newborn caribou calves are vulnerable to bear predation. But the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and other critics say the program lacks scientific validity and was put into place without proper public input.
Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi ruled on March 14 that the department and the Alaska Board of Game had violated state constitutional requirements when approving and starting the program. He agreed with the Alaska Wildlife Alliance’s argument that public notice and opportunity for public input was inadequate. He also found that state officials violated the constitution’s mandate that replenishable resources be maintained for sustained yield, by failing to properly analyze the program’s impact on bear populations.
After Guidi’s ruling, and after Rankin ruled on May 7 that a Board of Game emergency regulation allowing the program to resume was legally void, the department restarted the bear culls on May 10 anyway.
Eleven brown bears and one wolf were killed that weekend, the department said. That toll added to the 175 brown bears, five black bears and 19 wolves that the state said were killed during 2023 and 2024.
That weekend action led to Rankin’s determination that the state had acted in “bad faith” and her decision to impose the temporary restraining order.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance has also served notice that it may ask for the department to be held in civil contempt for its bear kills earlier in the month.
The Mulchatna caribou herd numbers about 15,000 animals, after hitting a peak size of about 200,000 in the 1990s, according to the department. The department’s goal is to have the herd expand to between 30,000 and 80,000 animals, big enough to support a hunt. Hunting of that caribou herd was closed in 2021.

Gov. Wes Moore (D) plans to nominate Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman for the job.","Maryland Democratic Party Chair Ken Ulman. (Photo by Emily Condon/Capital News Service)Maryland Democratic Party Chair Ken Ulman, a longtime player on the state political scene, announced Wednesday night that he plans to resign effective June 13.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) intends to nominate Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D) to replace Ulman when the state Democratic Central Committee next meets at its regularly scheduled meeting late next month — shortly after the state party holds its annual fundraising gala June 12 in Baltimore County.
The party’s first vice chair, Charlene Dukes, does not intend to seek the top job but will remain in her current post.
Ulman, a former Howard County executive, has told top Democrats that he wants to return full time to his development consulting company, Margrave Strategies, which is involved in several high-profile economic development projects across the state. He has served as state party chair since November 2023
Ulman announced his intention to resign during a meeting Wednesday evening with the state party’s trustees — an advisory group of top donors.
“I am grateful to Ken for his willingness to lead us through an intense and demanding election,” Moore said in a statement.

If Pittman is elected state chair — and he is unlikely to be the only candidate for the position next month — he too would split his time between his full-time gig as county executive and the state party post. Moore called Pittman “the right leader for this moment.”
Pittman is termed out of office in December 2026 and has been pondering his next political move. Heading the state party would enable him to stay in the political arena — though he has also been mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed veteran U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) whenever Hoyer decides to end his 60-year political career.
“With an all-out assault on our state and our values underway from Washington, D.C., I know Steuart Pittman will put his experience and his moral clarity to work to defend our state, fight back against the Trump administration, and ensure Democrats win elections,” Moore’s statement said
Ulman and Pittman did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
The state party in the 2026 election cycle will be preoccupied with reelecting Moore – who could face a tough race, especially if former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) runs again – and other statewide elected officials, who should be on firmer political ground.
Party leaders are also determined to field a strong challenger against the state’s lone Republican member of Congress, Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st); Jake Day, the secretary at Maryland’s Department of Housing and Community Development, is actively exploring a bid.
Ulman’s looming departure from the Maryland Democratic Party ends a short-lived reentry into the state political fray. Ulman, 51, was considered a rising political star after four years on the Howard County Council and eight years as county executive. He was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2014, losing in an upset to a Republican ticket headed by Hogan
Ulman launched his development firm shortly after that election and, before becoming state chair, worked on the fringes of politics, using his contacts to firm up development projects.
As state chair, Ulman helped now-U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) win her first term in 2024, kept the Democrats’ 7-1 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation, helped defeat several conservative school board candidates throughout the state, and raised more than $5.5 million for the state party.
Pittman was a political novice when he ran for Anne Arundel executive in 2018, when better-known Democrats chose to skip the race. He ousted Republican incumbent Steve Schuh in an upset.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)The final GOP debate of the gubernatorial primary season was Tuesday night in Newark, with the three front-runners — state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, and radio talk show host Bill Spadea — on the stage. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:
Energy
The audience was rowdy, much more so than the larger crowd that attended the five-person Democratic debate on Sunday. Not sure if audience members met up to pregame or whether Republican voters are just more rambunctious, but it sure got loud.
Attacks
The Dem debate was light on one-on-one attacks. Ciattarelli and Spadea did not hold back, with Ciattarelli hitting Spadea for never winning elective office and Spadea attacking both his chief rivals for being insiders. Bramnick, who got in a few jabs of his own, often appeared like a peacemaking dad to two brawling children. “Let’s stay with the substance, and in the general election none of this is going to help us. Let’s concentrate on the Democratic policies that have put our state in a situation where we’re unaffordable, energy costs are off the charts, and of course we’re closing prisons as opposed to putting people in prisons,” he said.
Trump
President Trump loomed large, naturally, especially his endorsement of Ciattarelli over Spadea, who got this issue out of the way from the start, saying in his opening statement, “The president endorsed a poll, a poll that was conducted and paid for by Jack’s campaign. The president did not endorse a plan. The president did not endorse a set of principles.” Bramnick, who has been a Trump critic for years, was not in the running for the president’s nod, which he noted with a quip: “I did not get the endorsement from Donald Trump. I waited up late at night — no phone call.”
Thoughts on New Jersey Democrats’ long, long debate night

Death penalty
All three candidates came out in favor of restoring the death penalty, which was abolished in 2007, during a discussion of the Newark 14-year-old accused of killing Newark Police Sgt. Joseph Azcona in March. After Ciattarelli said he would make sure the teen gets prosecuted as an adult, Spadea said he supports the death penalty for all cop killers. Ciattarelli said he supports the death penalty for serial killers, mass murderers, and terrorists. Bramnick, who voted against getting rid of capital punishment when he was in the Assembly, said it should be in place for certain instances, like for people who murder and rape children. “So I have a voting record on that, not a radio record,” he said, taking a swipe at Spadea.
Tax cuts
Bramnick doesn’t think much of Democratic governor hopeful Rep. Josh Gottheimer’s pledge to cut property taxes by 15%. “I’m going to put Josh on my tax reduction team,” Bramnick said. “He can serve with Houdini and other people who make stuff up, right? Look, Josh keeps saying that and I’ve been serving the Legislature and as the leader for 10 years — he’s talking nuts.”
Pronouns
Boy, Republicans do not like pronouns. Spadea and Ciattarelli mentioned pronouns four times last night, with Ciattarelli saying about Democrats, “They worry about pronouns, I worry about property taxes” (two pronouns in that sentence, by the way) and Spadea saying several times that schools and colleges are too focused on “pronouns and propaganda.” 
Pop-up parties
All three candidates came out strongly in favor of punishing juveniles who show up in large masses on boardwalks because of pop-up parties advertised on social media. Local authorities have griped that they can’t handle so many teens hanging out in one place at a time, and Spadea said kids should be punished. “There are local laws that are being violated in terms of the number of people that are gathering outside. We’ve handcuffed our police officers so, A, I believe we need to start charging 14-year-olds as adults,” he said. A wild response to large mobs of kids showing up and hanging out at beaches and boardwalks, some of our state’s most popular tourist destinations. Ciattarelli pledged, “We’re not going to have flash mobs on our Jersey Shore when I’m governor.”
Bramnick, meanwhile, said, “I would give no leeway whatsoever to rioting anywhere, especially on the sacred ground of the Jersey Shore.” Ah, yes, sacred. Exactly the word I think of when I’m stepping over someone puking on the boardwalk outside Martell’s on a Friday night in July.
Budget
Gov. Phil Murphy’s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins July 1 is $58.1 billion. The Republican candidates to succeed Murphy have all said they think there’s too much spending now — but how much do they think a state budget should be? Moderator David Wildstein of New Jersey Globe asked this question, and Bramnick sorta answered by saying he’d get rid of pork projects that he said have added $5 billion to the budget over the last seven years, while Spadea said the budget should be about $46 billion. Ciattarelli noted that budgets under Murphy’s predecessors included billions less in spending, though he did not specify what he thought the budget should be. “Jack’s going to have to check with his lobbyist before he’ll give you a specific answer on what he’ll actually cut,” Spadea said.
A missing candidate
There are two more candidates who will be on the June 10 GOP primary ballot: Burlington County contractor Justin Barbera and former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac. Neither of them raised enough money to receive matching funds from the state for their campaign, so they were barred from appearing at last night’s debate. Kranjac held counter-programming in the form of a tele-town hall with Clinton-era GOP hero Newt Gingrich. Barbera showed up last night and was escorted out by police after he verbally tussled with debate organizers (he wanted to be featured in the post-debate press conference). “I deserve to be up there,” he said. “You’re what’s wrong with this state.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved a $1.8 million grant to test surface waters for PFAS, the first known statewide effort to catalogue potential contamination from these “forever chemicals.”
PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of thousands of chemicals that don’t break down naturally and have been linked to a number of health concerns, such as cancer. Revelations of PFAS’ health implications — and how chemical companies knew for decades about the dangers they posed — have led to thousands of lawsuits, with many claiming it caused cancer. States, including Arkansas, have also sued.
The Division of Environmental Quality will use the funding to test surface waters for contamination. 
DEQ submitted a pilot project proposal to the commission last year requesting funds from the emerging contaminants allocation of the state revolving loan fund, said Melony Martinez, Department of Energy and Environment spokesperson. The multi-year project will use a “phased approach to evaluate potential sources of PFAS” along with how it enters state waters. 
“DEQ proposes to evaluate the status of PFAS in Arkansas’ waters before considering implementation of monitoring requirements, pretreatment requirements, or other permit conditions for PFAS as recommended by the EPA,” Martinez said.
The Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration moved aggressively to regulate PFAS in drinking water and surface waters, and classified the chemicals as a hazardous substance under the federal Superfund law. 
The Trump EPA has begun efforts to roll back some of those policies. The EPA announced last week that drinking water limits on four PFAS chemicals would be scrapped, while limits on PFOA and PFOS — two of the most common chemicals in the group — would be kept, but would not go into effect until 2031, two years later than originally scheduled.
However, the EPA also said in April that it plans to take extensive action on PFAS.
“We are tackling PFAS from all of EPA’s program offices, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable, and providing certainty for passive receivers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a press release.
The EPA plans to list PFAS on the Toxic Release Inventory, a list of hazardous chemicals and substances, while making efforts to hold polluters responsible for PFAS contamination, according to the release.
Arkansas, Tennessee, Wyoming and Washington D.C. do not have existing or planned PFAS standards or limits for drinking water, according to an April report by the Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit, nonpartisan association of state environmental agency leaders. 
Stacie Wassell, head of DEQ’s Office of Water Quality, told commissioners Wednesday that identifying and addressing PFAS contamination at the source was more cost-effective than trying to do so during the drinking water treatment process. 
“It would be much cheaper to prevent it from contaminating our waters of the state than to remove it on the backside after it’s already been contaminated,” Wassell said. 
State regulators have suspected that sources of PFAS contamination exist in the state, outside of two known sites — the Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville and a former BASF facility in West Memphis.
“There are likely numerous other AFFF contamination sites in Arkansas that are yet to be investigated,” according to a DEQ memo written in March 2023 that was obtained via an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request. 
“At present E&E has no information regarding dumping sites or industrial users of PFAs,” the memo reads. “Industrial contamination sites likely exist in Arkansas, but due to lack of funding, equipment and human capital, no concerted, widespread investigation of PFAs contamination has occurred. … To date no field work has been done regarding PFAs.”
AFFF is a type of firefighting foam used by the military and other entities due to its efficiency in putting out jet fuel fires, and is a leading cause of PFAS pollution.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LakeStumps-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 21:03:46.028913

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Unionized Butler Hospital workers are likely to see their final paychecks arrive Friday if the now seven-day long strike continues. Some now have another expense to handle: A possible $500 fine for allegedly violating one of the city of Providence’s noise ordinances.
A Tuesday press release from the Providence City Council praised the striking workforce for “their commitment to making their voices heard in a way that minimizes disruption for the surrounding neighborhood,” the release read, adding that organizers agreed to “observe quiet hours before 8:00 AM and avoid the use of bullhorns or other noisemakers during that time.” 
Yet Providence police issued four summons — three on Monday, and one more on Tuesday — to people demonstrating outside the private psychiatric hospital on Blackstone Boulevard. Josh Estrella, spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley, confirmed Wednesday that each fine was for $500. 
“While the City recognizes and respects Butler Hospital workers’ right to peacefully and lawfully strike, we have received multiple complaints from neighbors and providers in the area concerned about the excessive levels of noise resulting from this demonstration,” Estrella said.
Three of the fines were for striking workers who used megaphones without a permit, and the other summons was for a motorist who honked when passing the picket line. Estrella said in an email Wednesday night that the four people cited can pay the fine online or choose to contest the fine and get assigned a Municipal Court date.
“Warnings were given to all four individuals prior to issuing the summons and an explanation of the City’s noise ordinance policies was given to the organizers of the demonstration,” Estrella said. “Unfortunately after that engagement, summons were issued following a warning to individuals that were found in continued violation of ordinances in accordance with our standard enforcement practices.”
The city’s actions drew condemnation from Providence Democratic Rep. David Morales, who issued a news release and posted to Bluesky Wednesday morning that the Smiley administration had “chosen to punish” the workers, many of whom reside in Providence. Morales has marched with workers consistently over the course of their seven-day strike. 
“This isn’t leadership. It’s intimidation. This is a page out of the MAGA Republican playbook,” Morales wrote.

The city’s noise ordinance permits up to 65 decibels during the daytime and 55 decibels at night in residential zones. Areas bordering schools, churches and hospitals still need to stay under the 65 decibel limit, but violations can be issued for lower volumes considered “unnecessary, excessive or offensive” if “a person of reasonably sensitive hearing” at 200 feet away can hear them.
The Butler campus includes the hospital, elderly housing, and a child care facility. 
The open-ended strike began May 15 and the union, SEIU 1199NE, and Care New England, the hospital’s parent company, have yet to return to the negotiating table. The approximately 800 workers — who include mental health staff, nurses, and clerical, custodial and dietary staff — are demanding wage increases and safety reforms after their set of four contracts expired March 31. Both parties last gathered to discuss terms on May 7. 
Tensions have not subsided in the week since the strike began. The union announced Thursday that it plans to rally at the Rhode Island State House — for the second time in three days — with photos and testimonies about injuries they received at work.
Jesse Martin, executive vice president of the striking workers’ union SEIU 1199NE, said in a statement Wednesday that workers are exercising their First Amendment rights to “shine a light on the ongoing safety crisis at their facility that impacts workers and patients alike.” 
“They take care of all who need support, including those right here in this community,” Martin wrote. “Though it may be slightly inconvenient for some, it is vastly more uncomfortable for Butler workers who are forced to sleep in their cars because of poverty wages or have to take months off of work because they were assaulted at work.”
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in an email Wednesday that the citations misrepresent the municipal code.
“The police are blatantly misleading people by issuing citations that refer to $500 fines,” Brown wrote. 
The ordinance outlines penalties of $200 for first-time offenders or $300 for second-time offenders who plead their case, Brown said, citing section 16-106 of the municipal code. 
“Somebody who contests the charges in court can be punished with up to a $500 fine. This deceptive tactic is very disturbing,” Brown wrote, bolding the phrase “up to.”
But Estrella said Wednesday night the violations and fines were derived from ordinances about noise from bullhorns and vehicle horns — separate parts of the municipal code, located at sections 16-105 and 16-93, respectively. Of the four people who received summons, one person received three tickets for bullhorn use, categorized in the city code as “amplified sound.” There was one more amplified sound violation for a different person, and two people were ticketed under the “excessive noise” category, Estrella said.
Section 16-106 specifies the fine structure for violations within the entire set of laws on “noise control,” as the municipal code phrases it. Neither 16-93 nor 16-105 specify the fine structure for violations. The section on bullhorns does specify that use of such equipment must be registered at least five days in advance with local police.
Mary E. Marran, Butler’s president and COO, wrote in a statement posted online Monday that striking workers will receive their final paychecks on Friday, May 23, with hospital-sponsored health plans set to expire on June 1. Other benefits like life insurance have already lapsed because of eligibility rules tied to active employment, Marran wrote.

MASSACHUSETTS RENTERS ARE already grappling with sky-high housing costs. Now imagine trying to renew your lease, only to be hit with a $300 lease renewal fee.

Now imagine trying to renew your lease, only to be hit with a $300 lease renewal fee. Or needing to sublet your apartment for a few months and being told that’ll cost another $400. Or logging in to pay rent and finding there’s a $15 processing fee, with no way to avoid it.  These aren’t hypotheticals. They’re real charges to tenants across the Commonwealth, and they’re examples of a broken rental system filled with hidden, predatory fees. Throw on top of these charges – charges which buy the renter quite literally nothing – the broker’s fee that often adds a whole month’s rent on top of move-in costs like security deposit and first- and last-months’ rent and you see one of the reasons so many families and students are leaving the state for more affordable places to live. In 2024, more than half of all Massachusetts renters – 51 percent – were cost-burdened, spending over 30 percent of their income on rent. That number includes families in Gateway Cities, working professionals in Boston, and seniors in small towns. The weight of rent alone is enough to put many families on the brink when it comes to paying for utilities, prescriptions, and even food, yet tenants are being asked to shoulder, often unexpectedly, far more through unjustified add-on costs. There are solutions. Gov. Healey and the Legislature appear ready to repeal the broker’s fees paid by renters, and legislation that would get rid of other junk fees is now before the Legislature. H.1553/S.984 – An Act to Regulate Junk Fees in Rental Housing, filed by Reps. Sam Montaño and Amy Sangiolo, and Sen. Jamie Eldridge, is a targeted, common-sense solution that ends the nickel-and-diming of renters through junk fees that are both exploitative and destabilizing. The bill would stop landlords and brokers from gaming the system by charging for things they shouldn’t. For instance, landlords are already prohibited by law from charging certain upfront costs – but loopholes in the law allow the brokers to do so instead. This bill closes that loophole and limits permissible upfront charges to just first month’s rent, last month’s rent or a security deposit, and a lock change fee — nothing more. It also tackles lease renewal and subletting/assignment fees, which tenants often have no choice but to pay in order to keep a roof over their heads. I recently spoke to a tenant in Roxbury who was charged $350 simply for swapping roommates at the end of his lease term. The kicker? Nothing about the lease changed – not the rent, not the terms, nothing. That fee was pure profit. Another tenant in Worcester was forced to use the landlord’s online rent portal – which came with a $15 monthly processing fee.  This bill would prohibit these kinds of portal fees unless an alternative, no-cost option is provided. This bill also protects tenants from being charged for attorneys’ fees without court oversight to prevent what happened to a tenant recently, where even after her case was dismissed, she still owed her landlord $6,000 in attorney fees. Housing instability doesn’t happen in a vacuum – it’s often death by a thousand cuts. Junk fees are one of those cuts. The Legislature can offer renters a measure of relief, fairness, and predictability in an increasingly unpredictable housing market. Mark Martinez is a housing attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The post It’s time to rein in ‘junk’ rental fees appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Worcester_Housing_Triple_Three_Decker_Homes.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 20:05:59.003460

Public markets like ours are part of the civic fabric in many cities. They bring character and identity to a place, provide economic opportunity, and foster a sense of belonging. 
The post A decade of local flavor: What the Boston Public Market has taught us appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THIS SUMMER MARKS the 10-year anniversary of the Boston Public Market—ten years since a long-held vision for a year-round indoor public food market in downtown Boston finally came to life at 100 Hanover Street. Inspired by iconic public markets in other cities—like Pike Place in Seattle, Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, and the Ferry Building in San Francisco—the idea was to create a permanent home for New England food producers, connecting urban residents and visitors with the region’s bounty. Unlike many of its counterparts, the Boston Public Market was founded as a nonprofit and conceived as a “market on a mission.” Since opening in 2015, the market has been home to over 30 permanent vendors and more than 100 pop-up businesses each year. It supports local farmers, fishermen, bakers, cheesemakers, and other food entrepreneurs—many of whom face steep barriers to entering traditional retail. More than just a food hall, the Market was built to nurture small businesses, educate the public on nutrition and sustainability, and bring the community together around food.The impact of that mission is now being recognized nationally. Just this month, USA Today named the Boston Public Market the #3 public market in America—a jump from 7th place last year—outranking several of the very markets that originally served as its inspiration. For a nonprofit market that started with a bold idea and local ambition, it’s a meaningful milestone.That mission was tested like never before just five years into our story, when the COVID-19 pandemic turned bustling markets across the world into ghost towns. For a place that thrives on in-person connection and foot traffic, the early days of the pandemic were devastating. Our vendors rely on daily sales, and the disappearance of downtown workers and tourists meant that staying afloat became a daily challenge.Many public spaces and businesses closed permanently during that time. But the Boston Public Market made a different choice: to weather the storm as a collective. As CEO since 2016, I can say unequivocally that the Market’s survival—and its recovery since—has hinged on staying true to its core mission.We made the radical decision not to charge rent while our doors were closed. When we reopened, we introduced flexible lease terms tied to vendor sales, ensuring that their success was our success. We thought creatively—launching an outdoor farmers market on our patio, delivering groceries across the city, and reconfiguring our space to welcome people back safely.And it worked. Nearly all of our vendors made it through the pandemic. Community partnerships deepened. The City of Boston’s Resiliency Fund helped support vendors as they collectively prepared more than 32,000 meals for Pine Street Inn. We learned that when local government understands the central role small businesses play in a city’s vitality, good things happen.Public markets like ours are part of the civic fabric in many cities. They bring character and identity to a place, provide economic opportunity, and foster a sense of belonging. Boston deserves that same richness—and that’s what we’ve tried to build over the past decade.We’re still recovering from the long tail of the pandemic, but we’ve doubled down on our mission. In 2024 alone, we hosted over 650 community engagement events—92 percent of them free to the public. Not every idea was a hit (our comedy night was light on laughs, and a dog adoption day went sideways when the dogs didn’t show up), but every one of them brought people together and supported our vendors.Ten years in, the Boston Public Market is a thriving example of what’s possible when a city invests in its small businesses, local food systems, and public spaces. The biggest lesson from the challenges we’ve faced? If we want Boston to remain vibrant, diverse, and resilient, we must keep championing the small businesses that give it life.Cheryl Cronin is CEO of the Boston Public Market.The post A decade of local flavor: What the Boston Public Market has taught us appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BPM-Lunch-Rush-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 20:05:59.003460

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A bill that would exempt Umatilla County from the statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities has drawn the opposition of environmentalists, tribes, doctors and northeast Oregon community groups who showed up Monday at the Capitol in Salem to rally against it.
If passed, House Bill 2410 would allow the state’s Energy Facility Siting Council to approve development of a modular nuclear reactor in northeast Oregon’s Umatilla County. Oregon voters in 1980 approved a statewide ban on new nuclear development, barring the federal government creates a national repository for nuclear waste or voters decide to appeal. Neither has happened.
The bill’s architects characterize it as allowing a “demonstration project” of modular nuclear that would operate on a microgrid and support “community energy resilience.” Small reactors have about one-third the generating capacity of a traditional reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and can power individual neighborhoods, factories and facilities such as data centers that consume large amounts of energy.
Bill sponsor state Rep. Bobby Levy, R-Echo, has touted it in hearings as a clean energy solution to growing power demand in the state. Levy declined an interview Monday, but she told the Capital Chronicle in an email that local residents and the state would benefit from “reliable, carbon-free baseload power, job creation, and potential economic growth through new infrastructure investments.”
“At the broader level, small-scale nuclear would also contribute to Oregon’s clean energy goals, supporting a resilient and diversified energy mix across the state,” she said.
Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT.
But protesters Monday said they suspect House Bill 2410 is less about “community energy resilience” than powering Umatilla County’s booming data centers. The protesters said eastern Oregon lawmakers continue to treat the state’s northeast corner like an “environmental sacrifice zone,” noting that there is nowhere to safely store nuclear waste.
The bill passed 8-4 with recommendation in April from the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment, of which Levy is a vice-chair, to the Joint Ways & Means Committee. Another nuclear bill currently in the Ways & Means Committee, House Bill 2038, is also co-sponsored by Levy, and has drawn concerns from environmental and community groups as well as tribes. It would create a committee to study the benefits and risks of developing nuclear energy facilities in Oregon.
“The Umatilla Basin is one of the most polluted places in Oregon, some of the worst groundwater pollution in the state, some of the worst industrial air pollution in the state, and it just keeps getting worse. Now we’re talking about adding radioactive waste on top of that?” said Kaleb Lay, policy director at Oregon Rural Action, at the rally.
Representatives from nonprofit environmental groups Columbia Riverkeeper and the Sierra Club of Oregon and Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility also attended.
 Data demand

Demand for power from the Umatilla Electric Cooperative, which supplies electricity to the region, has grown 556% in the last decade according to recent analysis by the nonprofit research organization Sightline Institute. Nearly all of that is from Amazon data centers in the county. Amazon and Microsoft are investing billions in small scale nuclear reactors to power their data centers, including those in eastern Oregon, and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates last year invested $1 billion into a nuclear power plant in Wyoming, operated by his new company TerraPower.
Levy said it is an “oversimplification” to suggest data centers are the only or primary beneficiaries of modular nuclear reactors.
“The reality is that all ratepayers benefit from a more stable, reliable, and carbon-free energy supply — especially as demand across sectors continues to rise,” she said.
The bill has so far drawn 168 letters of testimony, about 75% of them in opposition to the bill. Many expressed concerns about where nuclear waste would end up and environmental concerns about uranium mining, especially on native land.
The bill would bar “high-level radioactive waste” from being stored at the demonstration project site after the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission terminates the project’s operating license, but it does not include details about where waste would eventually end up.
It’s supported by members of the Morrow and Umatilla county commissions.
“I’m very excited that someone else is willing to take on the experiment risk, and they’re close enough that we can, hopefully if it goes well, benefit from it,” Morrow County Commissioner Jeff Wenholz recently told Elkhorn Media Group.
 Across the river

Cathy Sampson-Kruse, 71, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, grew up in Umatilla County and went to high school in Echo. She said her family members that still live there do not support the bills.
“We have to ask ourselves, really, who is this supply for?” Sampson-Kruse said. “And what is it really taking away from generations of children that do not have a say in this — just like we’re going to have generations of children that are going to deal with the Hanford debacle.”
The problem with where to put nuclear waste continues to plague the Hanford Site across the Columbia River north of Richland, Washington, where the Washington Department of Ecology, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are trying to figure out how to move 56 million gallons of radioactive sludge. The sludge is a byproduct of World War II-era plutonium production that still sits 80 years later in 177 underground tanks, some of which are leaking.
The agencies are hoping to move at least 2,000 gallons of that sludge via rail or truck through Oregon to facilities in Utah and Texas that can process it into a grout cement and dispose of it. The proposal doesn’t yet detail a route, but critics have said it would most likely end up on major interstate highways through Oregon, or on a rail line through central Oregon along the Deschutes River, passing near areas like Bend and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation.
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek is opposed to the plan as proposed by the agencies.
House Bill 2410  is not the first time state or federal governments have proposed sacrificing the health of the environment for industry when it comes to power in the Northwest, Sampson-Kruse said. She was a child when the Dalles Dam was constructed, flooding the Celilo Falls where Northwest tribes traditionally fished.
“Now, one of our most beloved natural foods, the salmon, is on the list for extinction. It constantly begs the question, how much more? Where do we draw the line?” Sampson-Kruse said.

SPRINGFIELD — Lawmakers approved measures limiting AI instruction at community colleges, requiring seat belts on school buses, and mandating food handlers receive certain allergen training among dozens of bills Wednesday.

The Illinois Senate gave its approval to a bill that would prohibit community colleges from using artificial intelligence programs instead of human instructors to teach their classes.

House Bill 1859 would not entirely ban the use of AI as an instructional tool. Faculty members would still be allowed to use those platforms to “augment course instruction.” But it would prohibit colleges from using AI instead of human faculty members as the “sole source of instruction for students.”

The measure comes at a time when colleges and universities across the country have been struggling with the ethical issues raised by such platforms as ChatGPT and Copilot. Many schools have adopted policies prohibiting students from using those platforms to write papers or complete assignments while at the same time allowing their instructors to use them as teaching aids.

The New York Times recently reported a student at Northeastern University, in Boston, filed a complaint with the school and sought a refund for tuition she had paid for one class after discovering her professor had used ChatGPT to produce the lecture notes that were used in a business class.

The bill passed the Senate 46-12 with several Republicans objecting. Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, said she was concerned the bill goes too far in limiting the options of local community college boards that want to offer classes in subjects where human instructors are hard to find.

“I’m concerned that this bill will take local control away from the community college to be able to make decisions that are in the best interest of their students,” she said.

But Sen. Mike Porfirio, D-Lyons Township, the bill’s chief Senate sponsor, said the aim was to protect the interests of both students and human instructors.

“I think if anything we’re guaranteeing that our students receive proper instruction and also that we acknowledge the role that instructors, faculty, staff play in students’ lives,” he said.

The bill now returns to the House, which must concur on an amendment made in the Senate before it can be sent to Gov. JB Pritzker for his consideration.

Food allergen training for food handlers

A bill mandating food handlers undergo educational training on celiac disease and other food allergies passed the House unanimously on Wednesday.

Senate Bill 1288 was sponsored by Sen. Sally Turner, R-Beason, to provide food handlers with more knowledge about the disease in hopes that they’ll take allergies and cross-contamination issues more seriously. The training will include information such as the symptoms of celiac disease and ways to prevent cross-contamination.

The bill also mandates training on allergies related to milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, sesame and food ingredients that contain protein derived from those allergens.

Turner said the issue of cross-contamination was brought to her attention when she visited a restaurant with a friend who has celiac disease, an autoimmune disease linked to gluten. When they ordered their meal, Turner’s friend told their server she was gluten free and ordered a salad without croutons. Although the prepared salad didn’t have croutons on it when her friend consumed it, Turner said her friend had symptoms of gluten ingestion quickly after eating the salad.

Turner said she’s heard this issue before and began to wonder whether the cooks at some restaurants simply pick croutons off salads. After that, she said she wondered about how many food handlers take cross-contamination seriously.

“It was really an easy bill to pass, because so many people now have some friends, neighbors and relatives that have celiac and are recognizing that and they just want to make sure that everybody is going to be healthy when they go out to eat,” Turner said following the bill’s passage. “It just might encourage more people to recognize that.”

School buses requiring seat belts

Another bill that cleared the General Assembly would require all school buses in K-12 schools to have seat belts on them.

According to Senate Bill 191, any school buses made after 2031 would be required to have seat belts that go over the lap and shoulders of all passengers.

The bill doesn’t require school district staff, a contractor or any entity in charge of school buses to make sure students are wearing seat belts; it would just require new buses to have them.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration lists on its website that buses are designed so “children are protected from crashes by strong, closely spaced seats that have energy-absorbing seat backs.” Short school buses already require seat belts because they are closer in weight to normal cars.

Rep. Bob Morgan, D-Deerfield, said Wednesday on the House floor that he presumes school districts will have their own policies for how to handle seat-belt usage on buses.

“This might sound interesting, it's really not that notable in the sense that school buses are already pretty safe, and all new manufactured school buses already are really focusing on having a three-point seat belt,” Morgan said.

Morgan said there shouldn’t be an across-the-board price increase of buses, although Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, cited an estimated $7,000 to $18,000 increase in bus prices given by the Illinois School Transportation Association.

The bill passed with a vote of 83-27 and awaits the governor’s signature.

Gov. Greg Gianforte made decisions on four firefighting laws this week, signing two bills and vetoing two others.
The two bills Gianforte signed — House Bills 84 and 421 — dealt with wildland firefighting. The two he vetoed, House Bill 511 and House Bill 547, would have added $5 million in funding for local fire departments and another seeking to change a law preventing coordinated fire response in consolidated governments.
HB 84, called the Prescribed Fire Manager Certification and Liability Act, creates a certification program and outlines who is liable if a prescribed fire gets out of control. In 2022, a prescribed fire in New Mexico did, becoming the state’s largest in history.
The program will including training for fire managers and that their certification standards must match other states and organizations. A certified prescribed fire manager will only be able to be held liable for a wildfire getting out of control if, their actions “constituted negligence or a higher degree of fault.”
Fire scientists and proponents of HB 84 — brought by Rep. Steve Gist, R-Cascade — have pointed to prescribed fires as an important forestry management tool.
“I know it seems counterintuitive to fight fire with more fire, but the science is clear,” said Mike Schaedel, representing The Nature Conservancy and member of the state’s prescribed fire council. “It’s the best tool we have. We know what wildfires can do without prescribed fire. They damage our forests and all those values we hold dear. This bill protects our forests. It enables private landowners to manage their lands in a safe and effective way that keeps people working in the woods.”
Land management practices in the United States have led to some forests being overgrown and at risk for more intense wildfires, said proponents of the bill.
“To address the current forest health and wildland fire crisis, we need to get on this,” Gist said during a Senate hearing on his bill. “We need to do prescribed fire. We need to do fuel mitigation followed up with prescribed fire. Prescribed fire is one tool of doing fuels reduction. It’s essential.” 
HB 421, also sponsored by Gist, increased fire protection fees for land classified as forest from $50 to $58.70 for each landowner in a wildland fire protection district. For landowners with more than 20 acres of land, there’s an additional fee per acre which increased from $0.30 to $0.49.
  Two vetoes 

The two vetoed bills were brought by Anaconda Democrat Rep. Scott DeMarois, who is a career firefighter.
HB 511 would have taken $5 million from the general fund and directed it to a special revenue account for dispersion to local governments via grants. The money would have gone to training facilities.
“Training with the right equipment gives us critical knowledge of fire behavior and response techniques, along with that 3 a.m. muscle memory that saves lives,” DeMarois said in a press release. “With this veto, Governor Gianforte has shown us that he doesn’t really stand with first responders, and doesn’t really care about protecting firefighters or the communities that we put their lives on the line to defend.”
Gianforte’s veto letter pointed to the state needing a balanced budget and said instead of grants, should look at creating a low-interest loan program.
“The budget and other bills with hefty price tags that the Legislature passed, however, are not fiscally responsible,” the veto letter reads. “Therefore, I will keenly review the budget and spending bills the Legislature passed, making some difficult decisions to protect taxpayers and their hard-earned resources.”
The Butte-Silver Bow Fire Department also saw a setback in the form of a veto on HB 547. Due to a decision made in the 1970s to create a consolidated city-county government — only used by Butte and Anaconda — the Butte-Silver Bow Fire Department hasn’t been able to coordinate as well with its outlying volunteer fire departments.
The bill would have struck a clause and replaced it with language that said, “The fire department of the municipality must have a director of fire service or a fire chief, who shall manage and control the department in the manner prescribed by the ordinances of the municipality.”
Proponents said that would fix the problem. Butte-Silver Bow officials and firefighters lined up in support of the bill.
“We have great volunteers that work in Butte-Silver Bow, and this is not to take anything away from them,” J.P. Gallagher, Butte-Silver Bow chief executive said during a Senate hearing on the bill. “The director of Fire Services works directly for me and within the powers that are directed to the director of fire services, he has the ability to coordinate those services, but the unintended consequences of 1979 kind of stripped him of that ability to coordinate services.”
Members of rural fire associations across the state spoke against the bill during House and Senate hearings. Opponents included Jerry Brothers, who is the vice president of both the Montana State Volunteer Fire Association and of the National Volunteer Firefighters Association.
“We did not have a voice in the system at all,” Brothers said during the bill’s Senate hearing.
DeMarois said during his Senate testimony the change would only impact the state’s two consolidated city-county governments, but Gianforte, a Republican, disagreed in his veto letter.
“House Bill 547 raises more questions than it answers, and it introduces instability into the operations of rural fire districts, the backbone of Montana’s emergency network,” the veto letter reads. “Ultimately, House Bill 547 erodes the reliability and strength of rural fire protection throughout our state, while appearing to provide a one-sided resolution to a dispute within one consolidated government.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Crews-3-Horse-Gulch-715-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-21 20:05:59.003460

Pennsylvania is the fourth-largest recipient of aid under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), behind California, Texas and Michigan. Cuts to the USDA funding bill would have an outsized impact on the commonwealth, where 38,000 seniors receive monthly food packages through the program, Hunger-Free Pennsylvania said.
“We must at all costs preserve the critical and vital safety net that CSFP provides for our most vulnerable Pennsylvanians – our seniors,” Hunger-Free Pennsylvania Executive Director Stuart I.R. Haniff said.
According to the nonprofit Food Research & Action Center, the Trump administration proposes a $425 million cut to eliminate CSFP and replace the aid with Make America Healthy Again Food Boxes, which source food items directly from farmers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hunger-Free Pennsylvania, which represents the commonwealth’s 18 food banks serving all 67 counties, said funding should be maintained at current levels, at a minimum.
“If Congress fails to fully fund this program, our most vulnerable seniors will lose access to the nutritious food they need to live healthier lives,” Haniff said.
The CSFP delivers food packages designed to provide protein, calcium, iron and vitamins A and C to people 60 and older who have an income below 150% of the federal poverty level. For a single-person household, that’s about $23,500 a year, according to Hunger-Free Pennsylvania.
The network said the program has been a “resounding success,” recently surpassing 250,000 deliveries through the meal delivery app DoorDash’s Project DASH, which allows food banks and pantries to work with DoorDash drivers and technology to distribute aid.
“Often, the contact with a home delivery representative is the only human contact these seniors have – and sometimes the only eyes to check on them and their well-being,” Hunger-Free Pennsylvania said in a statement.  
The organization’s call for attention to the program comes as Pennsylvania officials fight with the Trump administration over the cancellation of an initiative that provides millions of dollars for farmers who provide products for food banks across the state. 
Along with a threatened lawsuit, Gov. Josh Shapiro has said the Trump administration broke a three-year contract between the federal government and the state.
The deal, the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA), was established in 2021 under President Joe Biden’s administration in response to the coronavirus pandemic. It supported about 190 farms and 13 food banks.
The latest contract was renewed in the final months of Biden’s term. However, Trump’s administration confirmed in March that the program was ending, impacting farmers and food banks across the nation.

Republicans in the chamber overwhelmingly rejected a bill from Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, to allow people convicted by non-unanimous juries before 2018 to petition for their cases to be reviewed. The proposal failed on a 9-26 vote despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, who’s long campaigned on a tough-on-crime platform.
Louisiana and Oregon were the last two states to allow split-jury verdicts in the prosecution of violent felonies. Voters in Louisiana amended the state constitution in 2018 to eliminate non-unanimous juries, though it didn’t apply to such convictions before the change.   
In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled split-jury convictions were unconstitutional, but justices allowed Louisiana and Oregon to determine if their ruling would apply retroactively to older cases. 
Split juries originated during the Jim Crow era, when the law was created to silence the voice of newly enfranchised Black citizens who were allowed to serve as jurors for the first time.

As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.

Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”

How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”

Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“I don’t think that is going to fix what ails Burlington.”That’s what Gov. Phil Scott told reporters Wednesday at his weekly press conference, speaking about a proposed change to the laws governing the state’s largest city that would ban guns from bars and other establishments that serve alcohol. He said he would veto the proposal — the only gun control measure legislators have advanced this year — if it makes it to his desk.The charter change, S.131, cleared the Senate late last month. It has since been in the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee, which took testimony on the proposal as recently as Tuesday afternoon. Asked if his committee would pass out the proposal in time to get it to the governor before the end of the session, Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, who is the panel’s chair, gave only a short answer: “perhaps.”Regardless, a veto may spell the end for the legislation, since it didn’t pass the Senate with enough votes — just 17 — to rebuke Scott’s red pen. Charter changes, after being approved by local voters, must get a sign-off from the Legislature and the governor before taking effect. The bill is Burlington voters’ second attempt in a decade at asking legislators to approve a ban on guns in bars. This year’s effort was prompted by a fatal shooting last summer outside a bar and nightclub in the city’s downtown that police said was preceded by a fight inside the venue. Backers of the bill in the Statehouse, top among them Burlingtonian and Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, have called the proposal a common sense change to keep bar patrons and staff safe. But the measure has drawn opposition from some gun owners’ rights groups, including the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs. Scott said his main issue with the proposal was that he did not think bar owners could effectively enforce it. He also said he was opposed to banning guns from bars in one municipality, while no such policy exists elsewhere in the state, though added he would oppose a statewide ban, too. “Like, who’s going to stand at the door and frisk people?” he told reporters Wednesday. “Are you going to have a metal detector?” (Proponents of the bill have said that enforcement would ultimately be up to the Burlington Police Department, whom bar owners could call if needed.)One reporter then contended that bars don’t often have someone posted at the door to check for other things that would be illegal to carry inside, such as illicit drugs. “Well, I don’t think they see that as a problem in Burlington,” Scott replied, referring to illicit drugs. “I mean, it’s pretty flagrant around the community.”— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowVermont legislators are struggling with what to do next with a major education reform bill, which Gov. Phil Scott is pushing them to pass this year. Sharp disagreements among lawmakers have emerged in the Vermont Senate over the past week, as education leaders publicly lobby against the chamber’s latest version of legislation. Both chambers of the Legislature and the governor see education reform as a key issue in response to last year’s double-digit average property tax increases. All three have put forward different versions of wide-ranging reforms. The proposal, H.454, was originally slated for a vote on the Senate floor Wednesday after passing out of a key committee last week. But at a tense caucus meeting of the Senate’s Democratic majority Tuesday evening, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, pulled the plug on those plans and conceded that a majority of the caucus was not willing to support the current version of the bill, even after taking weeks of testimony. “I made a promise to people in the caucus that I wouldn’t bring a bill that had a little bit of Democratic support and a lot of Republican support,” Baruth said Tuesday. “Currently, that’s the only way that (H.454) would make it through the process — would be for, you know, a handful, at best, of Democrats to support it, and then a majority of Republicans to support it.”Plans were for the education bill to come up for action on the floor Thursday, said Ashley Moore, who is Baruth’s chief of staff, on Wednesday afternoon.Read more about what educators and lawmakers are saying about the bill here. — Habib Sabet and Shaun RobinsonOn the moveA bill that would radically restructure Vermont’s response to homelessness is headed for a full vote in the Senate Thursday. But Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has expressed continued concern about the legislation, making its path to becoming law uncertain.Asked at the press conference whether he would support the bill, H.91, Scott said he hadn’t seen its latest iteration. But he noted that he could not greenlight a bill that continues allowing the mass use of motel and hotel rooms for shelter, and maintains historically high spending levels.“There’s a lot of conditions that have to be put into place before we do this,” Scott said.H.91 would shift Vermont’s homelessness response system from one centered on state government to one administered by private nonprofit organizations. It passed the House in early April.In its current form, the bill would make that transition in stages. Next summer, the statewide motel voucher program would end, and regional anti-poverty organizations would take over the task of providing emergency shelter under the banner of the newly-created Vermont Homeless Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program. The state would maintain an oversight role.Read more about the bill and its next steps here.  — Carly BerlinVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Gov.

In response to President Donald Trump’s tariff whipsaw, international cargo imports spiked in March and April as shippers tried to get ahead of anticipated tariffs. 
Traffic through the ports of Seattle and Tacoma dropped significantly in recent weeks, but forecasts now predict a rebound. Shippers are trying to rush goods after the United States agreed to lower import taxes on China from 145% to 30% for a 90-day truce, according to Seattle port commissioner Ryan Calkins. Businesses fear what could come after those 90 days.
The president’s on-again, off-again relationship with tariffs “is not the optimal way to operate a port facility,” Calkins said Wednesday. “We really want a steady stream, rather than peaks and valleys.”
The instability means inconsistent work for local longshoremen, truckers and warehouse workers. And it’s left businesses struggling to plan.
“You’re planting seeds now in the spring, for harvest in the fall. And if you don’t know exactly whether you’ll be able to sell your soybeans to China or your corn to Southeast Asia, what does that mean for how you plant now?” Calkins said. “And unfortunately, I think it means that a lot of businesses are choosing to be conservative, and the knock-on impacts of that mean a drag on our economy.”
This uncertainty led Washington leaders, including Gov. Bob Ferguson, the mayors of Seattle and Spokane, state legislators, union officials and business groups, to call on judges to block the president’s tariffs. 
Last month, a dozen states filed suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York in a bid to stop the tariffs. The lawsuit, in which Washington is not a plaintiff, argues Trump has circumvented the congressional power to set trade policy outlined in the U.S. Constitution in setting tariffs. 
The White House has said persistent trade deficits necessitated the tariffs. 
The states argued their case in court Wednesday. The day before, the Washington officials tried to show the three judges overseeing the case the harms Trump’s tariffs have wrought on the state.
Washington is the ninth-largest exporter in the country, according to the state’s brief filed by pro-bono attorneys from the Seattle law firm Corr Cronin. Last year, Washington exported $57.8 billion in goods, making up over 7% of the state’s gross domestic product. Retaliatory tariffs other countries have instituted in response to Trump’s actions hurt the competitiveness of Washington’s products and threatens trade relationships, officials say.
The three countries Trump has singled out — China, Canada and Mexico — account for nearly half of Washington’s imports.
At a press conference Wednesday at the Port of Seattle, Ferguson used the example of North Cascades Builders Supply to emphasize how tariffs are impacting Washington businesses. The Okanogan County-based company imports windows from Canada, but uncertainty from tariffs has cost the business $250,000 in lost projects, the governor said.

“These reckless, erratic and illegal tariffs have thrown the global economy into chaos,” Ferguson said. “American working people and consumers, including Washingtonians, are paying the price.”
Ferguson’s comments came the day after he signed billions of dollars in new and increased taxes, including on businesses, to address a major budget shortfall.
Washington companies last year paid $2 billion in tariffs on imports. Trump’s tariffs could cost 10 times that, according to the state’s amicus brief.
Ferguson said “history will judge Congress” for its inaction to stop what he sees as the president’s abuse of power.
“I’m a governor, not a member of Congress, thank God,” he said.
Vehicle purchases are one area where consumers will see rising prices due to tariffs, even if cars are manufactured domestically, a national policy expert told a state panel Wednesday.
“All vehicles are going to get more expensive, regardless of where it is finally assembled,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, in a presentation to the Electric Vehicle Coordinating Council. Panel members come from 10 state agencies leading the state’s efforts to transition to electric vehicles.
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, has filed bipartisan legislation looking to flex the legislative branch’s muscles on tariffs. The bill would require the president to notify Congress of the imposition or increase in a tariff within 48 hours. The notice must explain the rationale and analyze potential impacts to the country’s businesses and consumers.
Within 60 days, Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariff, or it would expire. Congress could also end tariffs at any time via resolution.
The proposal, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, has very little chance of success in the Republican-controlled Congress.

States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.


SC education changes
The following proposals involving K-12 public schools became law in 2025:
• Excused school absences, signed into law April 28. It requires school districts to excuse students for attending certain extracurricular events.
• K-12 scholarships for private tuition, signed May 7. It provides $7,500 scholarships for up to 10,000 students in 2025-26.
• “Educator Assistance Act,” also signed May 7. Its changes include providing teachers dedicated planning time, more information on and flexibility with their contract, and the ability to count district training toward the 120 hours of continuing education credits needed to renew their teaching certificate every five years.
• Work experience credit, signed May 12. It allows people who change careers and become newly certified teachers to count prior years of work experience toward their paycheck.
• Noncertified teacher pilot program, also signed May 12. It allows schools to fill up to 10% of its teaching slots with noncertified teachers who have at least five years of relevant work experience. The five-year pilot program sunsets June 30, 2030.
• An approved change that’s not yet law: The state budget will boost the minimum pay for teachers by $1,500 statewide across all experience levels. The floor for first-year teachers will be $48,500 in the coming school year.


A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

 How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
A South Carolina law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this month is testing the idea, starting smaller. It will newly allow districts to fill up to 10% of its teaching slots with noncertified instructors who have at least five years of relevant work experience in their subject. A proposal that died last year would’ve allowed up to a quarter of teachers to be noncertified.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
SC teacher vacancies decrease but remain above pre-pandemic levels, report finds

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
 Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide.
In South Carolina, the state-set minimum salaries for all teachers will increase by $1,500 in the coming school year. That will boost the floor for first-year teachers to $48,500, representing a 72% increase in teachers’ starting pay since 2017. McMaster has set a goal of raising that floor to $50,000 next year.
South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Kevin Stitt Wednesday to stop the names of Oklahomans receiving a private school tax credit from being included on a publicly available list of tax credit recipients. Students, parents and educators are pictured gathering at Oklahoma's state Capitol to celebrate the ""success"" of the program on March 12. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In an effort to “protect family privacy,” Oklahoma lawmakers fast-tracked a bill to the governor on Wednesday that will no longer allow the public to view the names of Oklahomans who received a controversial private school tax credit. 
If signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt, Senate Bill 684 would also remove individual names that were recently published to an existing state database of recipients of many tax credits. It listed those who received a share of hundreds of millions of state dollars allocated to the Oklahoma Parental Choice Tax Credit program. 
House Democrats opposing the measure said it doesn’t align with how other tax credit program recipients are treated and will create a lack of accountability on where tax dollars are spent and who receives them. 
The voucher-like program offers a refundable income tax credit of up to $7,500 to families who attend eligible private schools in the state. When creating the program, lawmakers gave priority to families earning $150,000 or less, and promised it would help lower-income students have the ability to attend private schools. A recent report showed over 46% of participants made over $150,000. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said the bill is about protecting the privacy of children and families. The publicly posted information does not list any children’s names or schools, just the taxpaying adult who applied for and received the funds and how much they received. 
“And while it does not list the names of students, it absolutely is to expose the students via their parents about the fact that they receive tax credits,” he said. 
The measure also requires participating private schools to be accredited by March 2027.
Democrats argued that the tax credit program has benefited high-income families, not underprivileged children. A recent analysis of the recipients by Oklahoma Watch found less than 3,000 of recipients had attended public school the year prior to the credit and only 9% were families that qualify for income-based public assistance programs. 
The recipients of other tax credit programs are publicly available online because that’s how tax credits in Oklahoma work, said Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City.
Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, said as a taxpayer he would feel uncomfortable not knowing where his tax dollars were going and who they were really benefitting. 
He said he was bothered by “dismissive” answers from the bill author to questions from other lawmakers on the House floor, specifically responses saying that questions weren’t specific to the bill language. 
“It behooves us, I think, to acknowledge that everything that we vote on is done in context,” he said. “And if I had a nickel for every time I have to talk about this issue, we could fund the voucher program, I think.” 
While most of the debate and discussion focused on the privacy aspects of the tax credit program, the bill also would give priority consideration for the credit to those who received it the prior year. 
First priority would go to families with income below $150,000 and second to any others who received the credit the prior year, regardless of income. 
The Senate unanimously approved the measure Wednesday morning, while the House voted 68-23 to approve the measure Wednesday afternoon.

Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments on May 21, 2025 | Kyle DavidsonAs Michigan Republicans continue to take a magnifying glass to economic development spending, the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments invited James Hohman of the free-market Mackinac Center for Public Policy to offer his analysis of the state’s Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund. 
Hohman, who serves as the Mackinac Center’s director of Fiscal Policy, walked committee members through a collection of several projects through the state’s critical industries program, comparing the number of jobs promised with the jobs delivered.
As he broke down each agreement, Hohman repeatedly noted that these deals were structured to deliver short-term payoffs for companies, and were not tied to job creation, with many deals tying the bulk of their funding requirements to a company’s capital expenditures, or money a company spends to buy, maintain or improve their assets.
  James Hohman of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy testified before the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments on May 21, discussing flaws with the state’s Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund. | Kyle Davidson
Additionally, not all deals move forward, with Hohman pointing to a $100.8 million dollar deal with Ford made in 2022 as an example.
Hohman urged lawmakers and members of the public to bring more skepticism to these deals, noting they often fail to deliver on their promises. 
“There’s a massive difference between what gets announced and what actually happens when it comes to living up to expectations,” Hohman said. 
“A lot of them wind up with no jobs at all. Some of them do meet [or] exceed expectations, but when you look at the rhetoric behind the deals, when they’re getting made, there’s rarely even an acknowledgement that deals might not deliver on their pledges,” Hohman said. 
If companies fail to create the jobs they promised, the state has to wait years before it can ask for its money back, Hohman said. If they eliminate jobs after the deal concludes, the state has no way of getting its money back, he said. 
Additionally when asked about the level of transparency offered into these deals, Hohman said they were meeting the minimum standard of transparency, publishing an annual report on how much money was offered, how much the company received and whether they created the jobs that were announced. However, the report’s schedule leaves the status of most current projects unknown, while sometimes forcing people to wait 18 months to learn an agreement didn’t move forward.
Overall the state has allocated $1.46 billion in taxpayer funds to create 14,779 jobs, Hohman said. While lawmakers clearly had ambitious plans for the program, those goals have not panned out, he said.
And while the companies receiving this funding will likely create jobs to fill the buildings they’ve built using state funding, the number of jobs they create will depend on an uncertain future, Hohman said. 
“My major takeaway for you is that if you’re going to continue operating the critical industry program, more of the deal needs to be based on actual job creation. When you have deals that consistently fall apart, that fail to deliver, you should not be paying them until they finally do the things they’re obligated or that lawmakers expect them to do,” Hohman said. 
This would not require a change to the law, Hohman said, only a change in expectations for lawmakers, asking them not to approve projects based on capital expenditures rather than job creation.
  State Rep. Laurie Pohustky (D-Livonia) calls for accurate criticism of Michigan’s Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund during a May 21 meeting of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments. | Kyle Davidson
While there are a number of areas where the Mackinac Center believes these dollars could better benefit residents, Hohman offered his support for House Republicans’ road funding plan, which draws the bulk of its funding by reallocating or eliminating funding set aside for economic development, including $500 million set for automatic deposits into the SOAR fund. 
Despite the issues with the program, State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) raised repeated concerns about ensuring criticism of the program was accurate. While some press releases may be disingenuous in promising to deliver jobs, SOAR funding that is allocated for site readiness should not be expected to create jobs. 
“You can’t put 2,000 jobs in a site that is not ready for 2,000 jobs,” Pohutsky said. 
While the SOAR program is not the best use of the state’s money, there are enough flaws that are not based around promises made in press releases, she said.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — “Total bunk” is what Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, called the notion from federal lawmakers that states can backfill potential cuts to public programs, which are part of a Republican budget proposal.
“We don’t have the money,” Kelly said on a press call Wednesday with Democratic governors from Colorado, Michigan and New Mexico.
The call came ahead of a determinative U.S. House vote expected this week on what’s been dubbed “one big beautiful bill.”
The budget bill could drastically cut public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kelly called the proposed bill “deeply unpopular.” Kelly, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham presented a united front of opposition to the bill.
“It is literally a tariff on every American, so that mega — the ultra rich — mega-billionaires and corporations get to have yet another tax break for many folks who already don’t pay taxes,” Lujan Grisham said.
The most recent version of the bill proposes around $700 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid subsidies, the largest in U.S. history, and $267 billion less in SNAP spending. A preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that states will have to increase spending by a combined $78 million to offset cuts. It also offers complicated tax code modifications and an elimination of taxes on tips and overtime.
The budget office wrote Tuesday that the bill increases resources for households in the highest 10% of earners, while household resources would decrease for those in the lowest 10% of earners.
SNAP in Kansas benefits around 190,000 people, 87,000 of whom are children, Kelly said. In New Mexico, SNAP has been crucial to reducing child poverty rates, Lujan Grisham said.
Lost Medicaid access would cause citizens to choose between which bills to pay and which medications households can afford, Whitmer, the Michigan governor, said.
“We should be working across the aisle to make health care better and easier to afford,” Whitmer said.
Polis, the Colorado governor, said each proposal this year to cut Medicaid has been “dangerous.” Echoing Kelly, he said states don’t have the money to mitigate cuts and rollbacks to health care.
“They’re basically asking states to do their dirty work for them,” he said.
The Republican Governors Association, in a Tuesday letter signed by 20 governors and addressed to President Donald Trump, remained in support of the bill.
“This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival,” the letter said. “It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
 
Medicaid ‘a lifeline’
Staff with Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, a statewide Medicaid advocacy organization, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to urge the state’s congressional delegation to expand Medicaid access. Kansas is one of 10 states in the country that have not expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act to include low-income adults. The state’s lack of expansion has been billed by Republicans as a benefit in the face of Congress’ drastic cuts.
“That is just false,” Kelly said. “The fact of the matter is we have left $8 billion Kansas taxpayer dollars back in Washington, D.C., that’s been distributed to 40 other states that did expand Medicaid for them to take care of their people and for them to expand their economies, while we sit here in Kansas trying to make do on what we’ve got.”
Millions across the country will lose coverage as a result of Medicaid cuts, said April Holman, executive director of the alliance.
The alliance visited with people in each of Kansas’ five congressional districts, speaking with more than 200 Kansans who informed a 12-page booklet that alliance staff gave to each federal representative.
“Medicaid is not just a budget line — it’s a lifeline,” Holman said in a news release. “We came to Washington to ensure that the voices of Kansans are being heard by federal lawmakers. The proposed House cuts will undermine Medicaid and put lives at risk.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-21-at-3.56.09 PM-1024x611.png,,,2025-05-21 19:08:47.319423

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont legislators are struggling with what to do next with a major education reform bill, which Gov. Phil Scott is pushing them to pass this year. Sharp disagreements among lawmakers have emerged in the Vermont Senate over the past week, as education leaders publicly lobby against the chamber’s latest version of legislation. Both chambers of the Legislature and the governor see education reform as a key issue in response to last year’s double-digit average property tax increases. All three have put forward different versions of wide-ranging reforms. The proposal, H.454, was originally slated for a vote on the Senate floor Wednesday after passing out of a key committee last week. But at a tense caucus meeting of the Senate’s Democratic majority Tuesday evening, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, pulled the plug on those plans and conceded that a majority of the caucus was not willing to support the current version of the bill, even after taking weeks of testimony. “I made a promise to people in the caucus that I wouldn’t bring a bill that had a little bit of Democratic support and a lot of Republican support,” Baruth said Tuesday. “Currently, that’s the only way that (H.454) would make it through the process — would be for, you know, a handful, at best, of Democrats to support it, and then a majority of Republicans to support it.”Plans were for the education bill to come up for action on the floor Thursday, said Ashley Moore, who is Baruth’s chief of staff, on Wednesday afternoon.Both chambers, and Scott’s administration, have broadly agreed that the state should transition to a new education funding formula and move toward consolidating school districts. But disagreements have developed over the details and the timeline. Moreover, the Senate’s version of the landmark legislation has faced sustained opposition from superintendents across Vermont, who have spoken out en masse against the bill over the last week, either in open letters to community members or in direct communications with lawmakers. At Tuesday’s caucus meeting, one Democratic senator described getting a rash of emails from school officials in her district in recent days condemning legislators’ recent work on the bill. Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, characterized their criticism as almost overwhelming.“I stopped doing emails when I didn’t feel I could bleed anymore,” she said. READ MORE
‘Our children deserve better than this political charade’School leaders have argued that the Senate’s proposed funding model could upend operations at schools across the state, slashing budgets unsustainably for some districts while spiking tax rates in others. “There’s something for everyone to dislike in the legislation,” John Castle, the executive director of the Vermont Rural Education Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group representing districts in the Northeast Kingdom, said in an interview. Castle said lawmakers were laboring under a “false narrative” that school consolidation could solve all of the state’s education woes while failing to tackle the root causes of education spending increases, like skyrocketing health care premiums and deferred facility maintenance costs. In a letter sent to members of the Senate Finance Committee last week, Brooke Olsen-Farrell, superintendent of the Slate Valley Unified School District in Rutland County, similarly expressed her concern about the “lack of long-term vision for education in Vermont” included in the Senate’s version of the bill.Although Slate Valley schools would receive an increase in education funding from the proposed spending model, Olsen-Farrell wrote that homeowners in the district could see property tax increases of up to 22%. “The Senate’s version of H.454 does not reflect the values or needs of our students, families, and communities,” Olsen-Farell wrote. “It jeopardizes our ability to deliver equitable educational opportunities and modernize our education system, while placing an untenable financial strain on Vermonters.”Olsen-Farrell’s sentiments were largely shared by superintendents in Franklin County, who collectively panned the Senate proposal in a scathing open letter to community members sent earlier this week.“The latest attempts at school funding reform are a stark reminder of how disconnected the current legislative process is from the realities facing our local districts,” wrote Maple Run superintendent Bill Kimball, Missisquoi Valley superintendent Julie Regimbal,Franklin Northeast superintendent Lynn Cota and Franklin West superintendent John Tague. Noting that the proposed model could yield tax increases of up to 30 percent for some homeowners in Franklin County, the superintendents wrote that the bill would do little to address the “core drivers” of increased education costs.“Until our elected officials demonstrate the courage to confront these fundamental cost drivers and craft equitable solutions, we’re simply rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship,” the superintendents wrote. “Our children deserve better than this political charade.”In a letter sent last week to Senate and House leadership, Burlington School District superintendent Tom Flanigan similarly wrote that the Senate version of H.454 would have “deeply harmful impacts” on the district, potentially costing it “many millions of dollars.”In an interview, Flanigan said that, rather than try to rush out a bill this year based on either the Senate or House proposals, legislators should now “take a step back” and consider delivering a more comprehensive, measured plan in the next legislative cycle. “It’s just clear to me that we’re not ready now,” he said. “There are some ideas there, and there is the need for change, but we need the right people at the table to determine what that change looks like and map out a responsible timeline to enact it.”‘Regardless of what bill we vote on, we lose’It’s unclear, though, whether lawmakers will heed that advice, especially with pressure from Gov. Scott to move forward. Baruth said Tuesday there appeared to be more support within the caucus for the House-passed version of H.454, and he proposed making a series of procedural moves on the floor Wednesday that would instead bring up the House language on the Senate floor, and allow senators to amend the language, also on the floor, from that point. Another option, he said, would be for the Senate to take up and pass its own version of the bill — with senators essentially holding their noses — so that the bill could go to a conference committee of House and Senate leaders to work out their differences. Amending the bill on the floor, per Baruth’s other suggestion, could lead to a conference committee being formed, as well. Senators were discussing both of those options on Wednesday, after Baruth postponed the vote, and it wasn’t clear that afternoon which, if either, they would take. Several senators pushed back during Tuesday’s caucus meeting on Baruth’s proposal to rely on floor amendments to alter the bill, saying that wouldn’t give them enough time to thoroughly vet the language being considered. “I get cold chills thinking about making floor amendments to address the biggest change that we can get to the entire education tax system,” said Sen. Nader Hashim, D-Windham.“To do a floor amendment on something that complicated — where we don’t have the time to really think about all the implications — is kind of scary to me,” added Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison. She called the Senate’s work on the bill “infuriating.”It wasn’t clear at the end of Tuesday’s hour-and-a-half meeting whether the caucus would come to any agreement on the proposal. Hardy suggested the Senate send H.454 back to a committee for further consideration and, potentially, not pass an education reform bill at all this year. “It sounds like regardless of what bill we vote on, we lose,” said Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast. “We put the House bill up, we lose. We put the Senate bill up, we lose.”But it’s possible Scott won’t let that happen. At his weekly press conference Wednesday, he urged legislators to get a version of the bill to the point of a conference committee to work out the House and Senate’s disagreements. He added, too, that he would use his power to call legislators back into session after they’ve adjourned for the year if they do not pass an education reform bill first. Baruth had indicated at Tuesday’s caucus meeting Scott would do that. “I’ll call them back — and we’ll keep calling them back — until we get something accomplished,” Scott said. “We can’t go home without this transformation.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Stuck between Gov.

Fred Eshelman's legal team asked for more time to petition the nation’s high court to take up the long-contested legal matter.
The post Ranch owner wants U.S. Supreme Court to hear corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","The Elk Mountain ranch owner at the center of Wyoming’s closely watched corner crossing case is preparing an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, new filings show.
Lawyers for Fred Eshelman asked the nation’s highest court Wednesday for a 30-day extension to file a petition seeking Supreme Court review of the case. At stake, they wrote, is “one of the broadest abrogations of private property rights in American history.”
Eshelman, through his company Iron Bar Holdings, sued four hunters in 2022, alleging they trespassed on his Elk Mountain Ranch when they passed through the airspace of his property while traveling to hunt on public land. The hunters were corner crossing — stepping from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, all arranged in a checkerboard pattern of ownership. They did not step on private land.
The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
Eshelman, a wealthy North Carolina pharmaceutical executive, lost his federal suit in 2023, but appealed the matter to the U.S. 10th Circuit in Denver. A three-judge panel sided with the hunters in March. Iron Bar was given until June 16 to appeal.
Now, Iron Bar wants an additional 30 days to file a petition seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the case.
“This case raises exceptionally important issues at the intersection of private property rights and public access that warrant this Court’s review,” Iron Bar attorney Robert Reeves Anderson wrote in his application.
“The Tenth Circuit’s decision has vast reach, covering a huge portion of the roughly 300 million acres of checkerboard land and affecting landowners throughout the American West,” he added.
The 10th Circuit ruling unsettled a long-established understanding that corner crossing constitutes an unlawful trespass, the lawyer wrote.
“This area of confusion and disagreement must be resolved to provide clarity to landowners and hunters alike,” Anderson wrote.
An extension would give Iron Bar lawyers time to “fully prepare the petition” to the high court while also handling a number of other pending matters, Anderson wrote. He did not immediately respond Wednesday to a voicemail and email seeking comment. 
Lengthy legal battle
The hunters — Bradly Cape, Phillip Yeomans, Zachary Smith and John Slowensky — corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, where Eshelman owns a 22,000-acre ranch. Carbon County Prosecutor Ashley Mayfield Davis charged the men with criminal trespass but they were found not guilty by a local jury.
The federal civil lawsuit followed, but the men again prevailed — first at the district court level, and later in the 10th Circuit. Their attorney, Ryan Semerad of Casper, said Wednesday they were prepared for the additional legal battle ahead.
“Mr. Cape, Mr. Slowensky, Mr. Smith, Mr. Yeomans, and our legal team stand ready to keep fighting for and defending public access to public lands,” Semerad told WyoFile.

Public land advocates cheered the quartet’s 10th Circuit victory. But Semerad, earlier this month, urged outdoor enthusiasts to exercise caution and goodwill if they attempt to corner cross.
“It doesn’t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else,” Semerad said during a May 1 panel discussion in Laramie. “What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you’re going and you respect that.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — With bipartisan support, House lawmakers on Wednesday sent a series of altered education rules to the governor that eliminate the requirements for public schools to collect proof of U.S. citizenship and for teachers to pass the U.S. Naturalization Test.
Lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Joint Resolution 22, which now heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt. The Republican has repeatedly vowed to block efforts by the state Department of Education to require schools to collect the immigration status of children.
With the same measure, lawmakers also rejected a rule requiring all public school teachers to pass a written version of the U.S. Naturalization Test to earn or renew their certifications. 
Rep. Molly Jenkins, R-Coyle, attempted to amend the measure to reinstate the controversial immigration rule, but it failed 75-12. 
Under the rule backed by state Superintendent Ryan Walters, districts would have been required to report to the state the number of children unable to verify U.S. citizenship or legal residency. The Republican said it would help schools accurately provide the resources needed to serve those students, but also said he would turn over such information to federal immigration authorities if asked.
Jenkins said the amendment would have collected “aggregate” data, not any individual student names, and would help to better allocate funding throughout Oklahoma public schools. 
Opponents on both sides of the aisle said the rule was unenforceable. The numbers could still be traced to students and could create a strain on the public school system, they said. Schools already provide services to immigrant students without requiring proof of citizenship. 
Rep. Gerrid Kendrix, R-Altus, said the immigration rule does not have statutory authority. Kendrix, the measure’s author, said the process is about ensuring the rules have statute backing them up, not about policy. 
State agencies are supposed to create rules that expand on existing law relating to the policy. The Legislature and the governor then review every agency’s rules and can accept or reject them. If approved, the rules have the force of law. 
The same measure also passed the Senate unanimously.

,DC,2025-05-21 22:27:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP revamps giant budget bill in bid to appease hard right,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-revamps-giant-budget-bill-bid-appease-hard-right,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republican leaders released changes to their “one big beautiful bill” late Wednesday after marathon negotiations with conservatives demanding deeper cuts to safety net programs, teeing up debate and a final vote likely sometime Thursday.The alterations, which will have to be adopted later, moved up implementation of work requirements for Medicaid by at least a couple of years and tossed out plans to sell some public lands. The new language also tightened the timeline for clean energy tax breaks and raised the ceiling for taxpayers who deduct state and local taxes.The package of adjustments — the manager’s amendment — must pass a House committee and then a procedural vote on the floor before lawmakers can take a final vote on the reconciliation deal.With a razor-thin margin, House Speaker Mike Johnson can only lose a handful of members on each vote. Democrats are expected to uniformly vote “no” in the procedural and final votes.MedicaidRepublicans moved up implementation of work requirements for Medicaid enrollees from taking effect after January 1, 2029 to no later than December 31, 2026. That could mean some states will make the changes before next year’s midterm elections.The provision would require those who rely on the state-federal health program for lower-income Americans and some people with disabilities, who are between the ages of 19 and 65, to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month.The language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant people, parents of dependent children, people who have complex medical conditions, tribal community members, people in the foster system, people who were in the foster system who are below the age of 26 and people released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.The GOP changes also would bar Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone in the program. The bill previously barred that type of treatment for anyone below the age of 18.Clean energy tax creditsRepublicans also tightened the timeline on the termination of clean energy tax credits enacted under President Joe Biden. Hardliners focused on reducing the deficit had demanded a quicker phase-out for the credits.The new language would accelerate phase-outs for clean energy investment tax credits to 2028, up from 2031, with special carve-outs for nuclear facilities. Companies that break ground on new facilities 60 days after the bill is enacted, if passed, will not qualify for the tax credits. The same applies to any facility placed into service after 2028.State and local taxesA separate contingent of Republican holdouts reached a deal with Johnson to raise the SALT cap to $40,000, up from the $10,000 lid enacted under the 2017 tax law. The SALT cap  — the amount of state and local taxes constituents can deduct from federal taxable income — is a top issue for Republicans who represent districts in high-tax blue states, including California, New Jersey and New York.The amount of SALT taxpayers can deduct decreases for those making more than $500,000 annually. The SALT cap and the income cut-off will increase by 1% each year from 2027 until 2033.Public lands saleThe amendment removed language that would have allowed the sale of public lands in Nevada and Utah.The National Wildlife Federation credited Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke with removing the provision.“Thank you to Rep. Ryan Zinke and his colleagues who listened to their constituents and worked with House leaders to eliminate the provision from the budget reconciliation bill,” NWF Associate Vice President for Public Lands David Wilms said in a statement. “We urge all members of Congress to refrain from similar attacks on America’s public lands.”Jessica Turner, president of the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, wrote in a statement that ""Congress avoided setting a dangerous precedent that lands can be sold anytime the U.S. Treasury needs a budget ‘pay-for’ and threatening outdoor recreation businesses and rural communities alike that need certainty, access, and long-term infrastructure.""The Center for Biological Diversity’s Great Basin Director Patrick Donnelly wrote in a separate statement that it was ""appalling that GOP leaders tried to get away with auctioning off some of our country’s most beautiful landscapes to fund tax cuts for billionaires and make developers richer. This is Gilded Age-level stuff, and I hope people remember it the next time Republicans try to pretend they care about public lands.”A separate provision in the amendment appeared to narrow the federal authorizations energy projects could bypass by paying a $10 million fee. The section had been attacked by environmental groups as a “pay-to-play” for energy companies.White House meetingThe changes come after Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and far-right holdouts huddled with President Donald Trump at the White House Wednesday afternoon.Johnson, speaking to reporters at the Capitol following the meeting, said that lawmakers had “a good discussion” and that he believes the GOP is “in a very good place.”“I think that all of our colleagues here will really like this final product, and I think we're going to move forward,” Johnson said.Johnson said members of the Freedom Caucus, who previously argued the legislation doesn’t go far enough to restructure Medicaid and reduce federal spending, may end up supporting the bill, in part because Trump plans to address their other concerns through unilateral actions.“You will see how all this is resolved. But I think we can resolve their concerns and it'll be probably some combination of work by the president in these areas as well as here in Congress,” Johnson said. “So there may be executive orders related to some of these issues in the near future.“And, you know, this is a commitment the president has made. He wants to go after fraud, waste and abuse.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt released a written statement saying the “meeting was productive and moved the ball in the right direction.“The President reiterated how critical it is for the country to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill as quickly as possible.”Complex processRepublicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship.Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Republicans are using the package to extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending on Medicaid.A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released late Tuesday projected the massive reconciliation package would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.Freedom CaucusEarlier Wednesday, members of the Freedom Caucus told reporters following a different meeting with Johnson that they believed negotiations were moving in the right direction, but were skeptical of trying to approve the entire package this week.Maryland Republican Rep. Andy Harris, chairman of the group, said they wanted the legislation to go further in terms of addressing “waste, fraud and abuse” within Medicaid, though he declined to elaborate.The Medicaid proposals in the version of the bill prior to the negotiated changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending during the next decade, under a CBO analysis. Democrats have warned the result would be millions of vulnerable people losing access to the health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities.Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy said during that same impromptu press conference that leadership and members of the Freedom Caucus had made “significant progress” toward a final agreement.“We're trying to deliver so that the people who are actually out there working hard can actually get the health care that they want to get, that they can get, and get it the best way possible,” Roy said. “That's what this is all about; changing a broken system, making sure we're saving taxpayer dollars and being able to provide a better environment for people to be able to thrive.”Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, who used to chair the Freedom Caucus, said that holding a House vote before Memorial Day was a made-up timeline and that if negotiations needed to last longer, they should.“This is a completely arbitrary deadline set by people here to force people into a corner to make bad decisions,” Perry said. “It's more important to get this right, to get it correct, than to get it fast.

Michelle Lujan Grisham, top right, joined other Democratic governors in Michigan and Kansas to decry the proposed Medicaid cuts. (Screenshot from DGA Zoom call)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Wednesday called on Congress to halt its effort to cut Medicaid, joining a handful of other Democratic governors to decry the cuts as a giveaway to the ultra-wealthy on the backs of the working poor.
As Lujan Grisham noted in the call with the Democratic Governors of America, 840,000 New Mexicans are on Medicaid, which is more than 40% of the state. That’s the highest per capita rate of Medicaid coverage in the country, according to recent estimates. 
In addition to people losing their healthcare, she predicted the cuts would spell the closure of several hundred hospitals nationwide. In New Mexico, which already faces healthcare shortages particularly in rural areas, that will result in less access to care, she said.
“That means you’re driving not one hour or two hours for care,” she said. “It means that you’re likely driving four or five hours for care.”
NM reps say GOP bill will gut Medicaid and also reduce oil money that could help state save it

According to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, more than 10 million people would lose Medicaid coverage by 2030 under the current version of the spending bill making its way through Congress. 
The bill also would impose work requirements for those receiving Medicaid. The other Democratic governors on the call, including Jared Polis of Colorado, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Laura Kelly of Kansas, had slightly different takes on what the work requirements could mean. 
Polis, for example, said the American people would be fortunate if Medicaid work requirements emerged as the worst thing to come out of Congress, so long as states had flexibility in how to administer it. 
Lujan Grisham spoke up after Polis’ comment, saying that Medicaid work requirements are “tried, not true,” and would ultimately impose a heavy administrative burden on states without spurring an increase in employment.
“You have many working poor people on minimum wage in any of our states, whether that’s a state minimum wage or the federal wage, it’s not enough to afford health insurance,” she said. “This notion that you’ve got all these folks who aren’t working, who willingly choose that, is also a false narrative.”
The governors expressed alarm at the proposed cuts, and said their states can’t afford them. A recent state estimate said New Mexico received nearly $9 billion for Medicaid in 2024. That’s equal to more than 80% of the state’s newly passed, record operational budget of $10.8 billion.
“We want every American to understand what this really means, and not let Congress off the hook in the dark of night to cut a backroom deal with this president on the backs of working American families, on the backs of New Mexico working families,” Lujan Grisham said. “Let’s tell Congress what we think of these outrageous cuts to basic necessities for everyday, hardworking families.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screen-Shot-2025-05-21-at-2.50.39-PM-1024x597.png,,,2025-05-21 19:08:47.319423

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Attempts to compromise haven’t appeared to reduce the state administration’s objections to reforming Rhode Island’s public records law.  
This year, advocates didn’t bother consulting with Gov. Dan McKee’s office for feedback prior to unveiling proposed changes to the Access to Public Records Act. Instead, they made the case directly to lawmakers, and the public, at a State House press conference Wednesday, one day before an initial Senate panel hearing on the legislation.
“Last year, we made a number of changes after dozens of meetings with the administration, and we still got opposition,” said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island. “We didn’t want to compromise against ourselves this year.”
Indeed, the companion bills introduced by Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, and Rep. Pat Serpa, a West Warwick Democrat, are nearly identical to the sweeping set of reforms pitched during the 2024 session. The bills failed to advance out of committee in either chamber last year, buried in a mountain of objections by state agencies.
Scott Pickering, publisher of East Bay Media Group and president of ACCESS/RI, called the administration’s past concerns “exaggerated” and “intended to create fear.”
“I don’t buy it,” Pickering said of arguments that the proposed reforms burdened state agencies and  jeopardized sensitive information. “Look at the groups supporting it. These are not radical groups hoping to undermine the government. These are groups devoted to the best interests of our democracy with noble intentions rooted in the public interest.”
Supporters also include the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, the New England First Amendment Coalition, the League of Women Voters of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Press Association, of which Rhode Island Current is a member.
McKee’s office did not respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday.
Despite Pickering’s adamant refusal to kowtow to “scare tactics,” one new addition this year aims to assuage objections by municipalities. Among the 48 proposed amendments to the 1978 law — last updated in 2012  — is a section addressing “vexatious requests.” The caveat weeds out requests intended to “disrupt government operations,” authorizing the chief administrator of any public body subject to open records laws to seek a Rhode Island Superior Court order exempting them from fulfilling a records request.
Across the country, and in Rhode Island, public bodies are seeing records requests for no other reason than to take them away from their regular duties. Marion referred to a coordinated effort on the heels of the 2020 election to bombard local elections officials with requests about voting equipment, with the intent to “gum up the works of election offices around the country.”
DiPalma stressed the “fine line” between nuisance requests and those with good intentions, but noted that the proposed bill still requires public bodies to proceed with filling “vexatious” requests if and until a court orders otherwise. Under the proposed legislation, anyone who obtains records through a request later determined to be vexatious will have to reimburse the public body for the time and cost to complete the task.
Reducing fees, adding clarity 
Much of the remaining reforms, however, aim to make it easier, and more affordable, for the public to request and obtain various forms of public information, including body camera footage, traffic accident data and investigations into police misconduct.
“We’re really here to make sure members of the public have access to public information without having to pay burdensome costs, and when the government withholds it, they do it for a good reason,” said Michael McDermott, a board member for ACCESS/RI.
For example, the reform bill clarifies that university police departments given power to make arrests are subject to the same public disclosure of arrest records as other public law enforcement groups. Brown University’s police department has argued it is exempt from the state public records law, said Steven Brown, executive director for the RI ACLU. 
Another paragraph specifies that traffic accident data is subject to public records laws, reflecting the Rhode Island Department of Transportation’s use of existing loopholes to refuse to provide crash data requested by community advocates with the Providence Streets Coalition.
Other changes reflect modern technology which was nonexistent, or at least less heavily relied upon, when the law was last updated more than a decade ago. Police body camera footage is among the new types of records that would be added to the law under the legislation, as well as text messages and emails sent in official government capacity — previously exempt but now subject to sharing unless they are unrelated to official government business. Another nod to the shift to the digital age: requiring public bodies to upload any documents related to their meetings online beforehand, like a contract for a new hire or a proposed policy change.
The proposal also reduces the cost charged for locating and sharing public records — increasing the number of free hours of work from one to two hours while cutting the cost-per-page for copies of information from 15 to five cents. And it specifies that fees for records requests “shall” be waived if the person requesting them can demonstrate the information is of public interest. The existing law offers the option that fees “may” be waived for public interest reasons.
Several tweaks aim to head off privacy concerns voiced by state agencies during the 2024 session hearings, narrowing the scope of medical records subject to public disclosure, for example, and allowing identifying information in police misconduct reports to be redacted to protect privacy.
Charlie Galligan, a criminal defense private investigator, was optimistic that the amendments would pass muster with McKee’s office.
“I can only imagine [the amendments have] addressed concerns and removed concerns by Governor McKee and other entities that have objected to previous versions of this legislation,” Galligan said.
New Senate leaders on board
DiPalma was less certain of the administration’s viewpoint, but pointed to the change in Senate leadership as a potential advantage; newly elected Senate President Valarie Lawson and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone are both co-sponsors on the Senate bill. The bill is scheduled to have a first hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary Thursday night.
“As a former history teacher, I am very mindful of the importance of robust public records laws to the strength of our democracy, and to maintaining public trust,” Lawson said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “I am grateful to Senator DiPalma for his passion and his tireless work on this issue. When concerns were raised with previous versions of this proposal, Chairman DiPalma worked to bring parties together and address those concerns. Subsequent to the Senate hearing tomorrow evening, I will review the testimony regarding this year’s version of the bill with an open mind.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, however, noted past opposition from the administration, without taking a position on the bill either way.
“I look forward to reviewing Senator DiPalma’s amended language after his bill is heard in the Senate,” Shekarchi said in an emailed statement Wednesday.
A hearing on the House companion bill has also not been scheduled as of Wednesday.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Farmers with Modern Ag Alliance, a coalition that has been pushing for the adoption of pesticide labeling policies that would make it more difficult to build cancer-related lawsuits against pesticides, fear the impact of an upcoming “Make America Healthy Again” report they believe will target pesticides. 
The farmers said on a press call Wednesday an attack on pesticide chemicals, specifically mentioning glyphosate in the widely used Roundup herbicide, would be “a terrible development for American agriculture” and lead to higher food costs for the American consumer. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday to U.S. senators and said there is not a “single word” in his agency’s upcoming report that “should worry the American farmer.” 
Scott Henry, a farmer from central Iowa, was not persuaded by the secretary’s remarks. He noted Kennedy’s past as an environmental law attorney who said, several years ago, he believed hog farmers were worse than Osama bin Laden. 
“I think it’s hard to have been compared to al Qaeda in the past and then be told that I’m a partner now,” Henry said.
Henry said if the report, which is anticipated to be released Thursday, contains anti-glyphosate guidance, and policymakers follow suit, it will cause commodity yields to drop, prices to increase and food inflation to “more than double.” 
A report on the impact of a farm bill that doesn’t allow the use of glyphosate found that consumer food inflation would increase 2.4 times. 
“The biggest thing that I want to make clear today is that if the MAHA commission’s report drives future policy decisions, food prices will go up, and instead of making America healthy again, we’ll be making America hungry again,” Henry said. 
Modern Ag Alliance reports input prices for farmers could more than double without access to glyphosate. Henry said these costs would be passed up the supply chain and to consumers. 
“The American farmer still has the best interest of the consumer in mind,” Henry said. “We want them to buy food, we want it to be cheap, we want it to be safe, because don’t forget, we feed our children these same products. So for somebody to tell us that we don’t care about them is a true slap in the face.” 
An executive order from President Donald Trump in February created the Make America Healthy Again commission and tasked it with developing a “Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment” to evaluate the chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food ingredients and other factors that contribute to childhood chronic disease in the country. 
Kennedy has spoken publicly in the past about glyphosate and alleged the common weed-killing chemical causes cancer and other health concerns. 
Roundup’s manufacturer, Bayer, holds that the product is safe to use, as does the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which reviews and certifies pesticides in the country. 
The company, however, has spent billions defending lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege the product gave them cancer. This led the company to partner with ag groups through Modern Ag Alliance and push for state legislation across the country, including in Iowa this year and last, to block lawsuits built on failure to warn claims. 
The bill did not advance through the House in Iowa, but has been signed into law in both North Dakota and Georgia.  
Modern Ag Alliance promoted the legislation, largely through ad campaigns. Elizabeth Burns-Thompson, the executive director of the alliance, said the attention to the MAHA report is much like the push for state policy on the issue. 
“No different than how we have been trying to work proactively in many of the state legislative chambers on providing clarity and consistency so that farmers have these tools available today, and in the future, we see similar themes here and why we’re working towards it at the federal level,” Burns-Thompson said. 
Henry said the report itself might not have a direct effect, but could lead to “shifts in policy” that would send farming back to the practices of his grandfather. 
“Today, hundreds of people can eat because of one individual farmer’s efforts, and it’s all due to tools like glyphosate and Roundup that allow us to do more with less and make safe, clean, affordable food available,” Henry said.

SPRINGFIELD — The Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that adds new anti-bias education requirements for providers of maternal health services.

The measure is aimed at combating maternal mortality in marginalized groups. If signed into law, it would mandate providers receive one hour of training prior to renewing a state license, starting in July 2026. The Senate passed the bill on a 44-12 vote, following its passage 82-29 in the House in April. It needs only a signature from Gov. JB Pritzker to become law.

The training required by House Bill 2517 would educate providers on historic racial discrepancies in maternal care in an effort to reduce implicit biases among providers. Health care professionals would be allowed to count completion of the course toward minimum continuing education requirements.

“As a country, the United States is the most dangerous place to give birth in the developed world, and it’s three times as dangerous for Black people,” said Kelly Hubbard, director of policy and advocacy at EverThrive Illinois, where she works to advocate for optimal maternal health policies. That statistic comes from the Illinois Department of Public Health’s 2023 Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Report.

Compared to white women in America who died at a rate of 14.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2023, Black women died at a rate of 50.3 out of 100,000 live births, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kimberly Collier, president of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Chicago Metropolitan Chapter, compared this level of mortality to the Middle Ages, when women had significantly higher maternal mortality rates.

“Childbirth killed women,” Collier said. “We’re not living in that world. But Black women are.”

Marianne Gray, a registered nurse who has a doctorate in education, came to Springfield to support the bill through its passage in the Senate Licensed Activities Committee earlier this month. She said part of the problem is that caregivers often do not listen to the health concerns of Black women.

“The moms need to be heard, and if a mom tells you, ‘I don’t feel well,’ or ‘something’s wrong,’ you can’t shrug that mom off and not listen to them,” Gray said. “And that happens.”

Gray spoke from her firsthand experience as a Black mother, recounting how during the birth of her first son, her providers did not listen when she said she felt the baby pushing. The baby came earlier than providers expected, resulting in her husband missing the birth of their first son.

The proposed law would mandate that health care professionals working on maternal health services and seeking to renew their license through the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation take one hour of training in implicit bias awareness prior to renewal. The training for prenatal and postnatal care providers should include information about potential risk factors for childbearing individuals in marginalized racial or ethnic groups with higher maternal mortality rates.

Part of the issue, advocates say, is the historical misconception within the medical field that Black people have a higher pain threshold or do not feel pain as acutely as others.

One example of such medical racism is that of J. Marion Sims, often called the “father of modern gynecology,” who conducted painful experimental surgeries on enslaved Black women without anesthesia.

“There is a mistrust,” Gray said, referencing the history of unethical medical testing on Black people. “A lot of times people in underserved communities, they don’t trust health care providers who don’t look like them.”

Rep. Lisa Davis, D-Chicago, introduced the bill in the House. Like Gray, Davis spoke from her own experience as a Black mother.

“When it comes to Black moms, sometimes those generalizations and attitudes can possibly have lethal consequences,” Davis said. “If a Black mom is complaining about pain, that could be ignored, and maybe something is going on with the baby.”

While pregnant with her first son, Davis was past due to deliver. She did not want to induce birth, but rather to let him arrive naturally, she said. She developed a plan with her primary OB-GYN provider, a Black woman who respected her wishes not to induce.

In a follow-up visit, Davis said her usual prenatal provider was unavailable, so she saw someone else, a white woman. Davis felt this woman to be less sensitive of her wishes, telling Davis she should schedule an induction.

Then, Davis said, the provider checked her cervix in a rough manner that caused Davis pain. When Davis expressed her discomfort, the woman told her the pain was common. After the visit, Davis realized her water had broken. She went to the hospital, where they kept her until she gave birth the next day.

Whether or not it was the outcome the provider intended, Davis said the interaction left her wondering if her race was the reason the provider seemed not to be attentive or listen to her concerns.

Lauren Sayah, a senior research specialist at the University of Illinois Chicago Center for Research on Women and Gender, said she hopes the training will make providers more aware of their own biases.

“Having health care providers learn about those biases and misconceptions will likely help them hopefully see their patients first as human,” Sayah said.

Sayah added that the training will help educate providers on the other social factors affecting maternal health outcomes for people of color. Access to healthy neighborhoods, green spaces, healthy food and affordable housing are all important aspects of “culturally competent health care,” Sayah said.

The measure passed the House with bipartisan support despite opposition from most of the Republican caucus. Senate sponsor Willie Preston, D-Chicago, said he believes the bill will make a difference in the experiences of mothers.

“Black women in Illinois are three times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes than white women. This is simply not acceptable, and it's not a mystery,” Preston said Wednesday during Senate floor debate. “It’s about how people are treated, who gets listened to and whether their pain is believed. This bill doesn’t ask for a heavy lift. It asks for awareness. It asks for education.”

Under the measure, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation will be responsible for developing the curriculum, but Sayah said she hoped the department would consult with community members when designing the training materials, which she said “adds value and is necessary in the influence of their care.”

Collier said the National Coalition of 100 Black Women is “ready to help with implementation” if the department is interested in partnering on curriculum development.

Although advocates said this bill is not a silver bullet that will fix the racial disparity in maternal health outcomes, many said it was a step forward that brought them hope.

“The war is not over, but this battle has been won,” Collier said. “And I think it is okay for us to be excited, be happy, to check it off and to celebrate the wins, because we have a long fight ahead of us.”

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)South Dakota’s governor and attorney general separately visited the U.S.-Mexico border this week and announced efforts to involve the state in federal immigration enforcement.
During a news conference Wednesday with a coalition of Republican attorneys general in Arizona, Attorney General Marty Jackley said he has authorized the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation, which he oversees, to pursue a 287(g) agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The federal agency is within the Department of Homeland Security led by former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)

The agreement would allow state agents, after receiving federal training, to “identify, process, and detain individuals for immigration violations they encounter during their regular law enforcement activities,” the Attorney General’s Office wrote in a press release.
“I applaud and encourage the Trump administration to continue its efforts to close this border and to enforce our immigration laws across the United States,” Jackley said.
Meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden was in Eagle Pass, Texas, on Tuesday visiting South Dakota National Guard soldiers from the 109th Engineer Battalion. They’re on a yearlong federal deployment as part of “Operation International Drug Trafficking.” Their duties include supporting U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Following his visit, Rhoden announced Wednesday that he sent a letter of intent to Noem requesting a 287(g) agreement for the South Dakota Highway Patrol, which is part of the Department of Public Safety in Rhoden’s executive branch.
Rhoden’s letter specifies that he is requesting a task force model agreement, which would allow trained officers to enforce immigration laws during their regular patrols or investigations. The Obama administration discontinued the model in 2012 due to concerns over potential civil rights abuses arising from local and state law enforcement officers stopping people on the street and inquiring about their immigration status. The Trump administration revived the task force model this year.

American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota spokeswoman Jana Farley said in a statement that 287(g) agreements have led to racial profiling, civil rights abuses and diverted resources from state and local law enforcement.
“Most of us can agree that the federal government needs to do much better on immigration policy and identify real solutions that are orderly, humane and fair,” she said. “Instead of imposing the federal government’s wishes upon every community in South Dakota, we encourage local control and support the right of local law enforcement to put the needs of their communities first by declining to participate in unnecessary, voluntary immigration enforcement.”
Taneeza Islam, CEO of South Dakota Voices for Peace, which advocates for immigrants, said the state’s pursuit of 287(g) agreements puts “politics over the best interests of South Dakota.” She predicted negative consequences.
“Victims of crimes will be scared to call law enforcement in fear of deportation. Labor and sex trafficking will increase as the perpetrators will leverage ICE working with law enforcement over their victims,” she said.
Rhoden, who is serving the remainder of Noem’s term after she resigned to serve in the Trump Cabinet, and Jackley, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2018, are both frequently mentioned as potential candidates for governor next year. Both are Republicans.
The announcements from both state leaders come amid an increase in immigration enforcement actions within South Dakota. Earlier this month, federal agents arrested eight immigrants in Madison for allegedly using fraudulent documents to gain employment. As of last week, more than two dozen people were being held in South Dakota jails for immigration matters.
Two local South Dakota jurisdictions have already signed 287(g) agreements. Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead and Hughes County Sheriff Patrick Callahan both signed on earlier this spring. The counties are participating in the warrant service officer program. It allows local jail staff to serve ICE-issued immigration warrants on inmates already in custody for other criminal charges, negating the need for ICE officers to serve those warrants themselves.

(Matt Weiner/Rapid City Journal)Luckily for Priya Saxena, Jim Leach doesn’t like bullies.
Saxena is a citizen of India who collected her doctoral degree in chemical and biological engineering from South Dakota Mines in Rapid City on May 10. Just one month earlier, she was facing revocation of her F-1 student visa and the very real threat of deportation, thanks to President Donald Trump and his Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the former governor of South Dakota. 
Apparently, Noem or someone who works for her believed that a four-year-old traffic violation was a good enough reason to deport Saxena and disrupt her hopes for post-doctoral work here in the United States.   
Leach is a Rapid City attorney who decided to represent Saxena in a lawsuit against Noem to prevent that from happening. 
Why?  
Because he believes due process under the law is essential. Because he knows democracy is worth protecting. Because he doesn’t like bullies. Because Priya Saxena needed his help. And because somebody had to.
International student recounts ‘numb’ feeling after receiving email about her potential deportation

Saxena was one of more than a thousand legally admitted international students who were suddenly targeted for potential deportation because of a check of their criminal records, or because the Trump administration didn’t like their participation in protests against the war in Gaza.
“I think it’s outrageous what this administration did to these students, and as soon as I looked at it, I discovered it was completely lawless,” Leach said. “That’s the modus operandi of this administration – lawlessness. In trying to get what they want, they have been lawless.”
Ever since Trump’s second inauguration and the blizzard of executive orders that followed it, I have put my faith in the power of the American legal system to be a bulwark of due process against presidential power run amok. I believe that our judicial system – and all those judges who demand that we stand when they enter a courtroom, want to be called “Your Honor,” and have a deep and abiding faith in the rule of law – may be the only thing that will prevent Trump and his cronies from dismantling our Constitution and trampling on the rights it guarantees.  
Many days, it feels like that belief hangs by a thin thread. But this past week my faith was rewarded, and my belief strengthened, thanks to the trio of U.S. District Court Judge Karen Schreier, Saxena and Leach.  
Schreier ruled that for now, Saxena has the right to stay in the U.S. under the terms of her F-1 visa. The judge basically told Noem, in no uncertain terms, to leave Saxena alone and let her continue to pursue her educational and employment goals. The temporary order secures Saxena’s status while the lawsuit proceeds. Leach immediately followed up with a request for a similar, permanent order, which Schreier will consider next.
Saxena and another lawyer who helps her with immigration matters have since submitted a work authorization application. Saxena hopes to do post-doctorate work in her field of expertise here in the U.S. for the next three years. 
Kudos to Schreier for issuing a preliminary injunction that protects Saxena’s status. Bigger kudos to Leach, who took Saxena’s case pro bono, meaning he’s providing his legal services free of charge to his client, with a possibility but no guarantee that the judge will order the other side to cover his fees and costs. 
At 73, Leach is a rarity – a sole practitioner who still loves the work and is financially able to do it for free if needed. He takes cases that interest him, including violations of free speech, public access and civil rights, and he counts himself lucky to do so.  
“I love what I do,” he said. “It’s a great privilege to do this work.”

Recently, Leach lost nearly $20,000 in fees and costs for his work representing a ballot question committee against petition restrictions imposed by Lawrence County. A district court awarded the money, but the legal basis for that award was wiped out by a new U.S. Supreme Court precedent established in February. 
All three Trump-nominated justices supported the Lackey v. Stinnie decision. It addresses cases that are resolved with a preliminary order, like the Lawrence County case, in which the county reversed course without the need for a permanent order. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs in those circumstances aren’t truly “prevailing parties” and therefore don’t qualify for court-awarded attorney fees. 
Leach knows that “to fight illegal action by the government, you need a lawyer.” So it comes as no surprise to him that justices appointed by Trump would weaken the pro bono system that helps provide access to the courts for people without resources.  
“I will stand up to bullies,” he said. “And this is the ultimate bully.” 
Pro bono is short for the Latin phrase “pro bono publico,” which translates as “for the people’s good.”   
When Priya Saxena’s rights were protected last week in a Rapid City courtroom, so were ours.

But the hospital management and the union have given conflicting accounts about plans for earlier negotiations. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)SEIU Wisconsin and Meriter hospital management confirmed Wednesday plans to meet on Thursday, May 29 to resume negotiation on a new contract covering about 950 nurses.
Talks ended Monday without an agreement, and the union said it would go forward on Tuesday, May 27, with a five-day strike.
On Wednesday, however, the two parties gave contradictory accounts of the conclusion of their talks and the prospect of further negotiations before the walkout begins.
In Meriter’s initial statement on Tuesday after the strike was announced, the hospital reported that a bargaining session was scheduled for Monday, May 26.
In a statement Wednesday, however, the union bargaining committee said they had never scheduled talks for that day.
UnityPoint Health-Meriter issued an updated statement Wednesday asserting that “SEIU Wisconsin notified Meriter on Tuesday that they are no longer available to meet on May 26 and are now offering May 29 as their first available date to resume negotiations.”
The management statement quoted Meriter’s vice president of human resources Shana Wuebben: “SEIU Wisconsin has declined the bargaining session previously set for Monday, May 26 and has rescheduled bargaining sessions to Thursday, May 29 near the end of the 5-day strike period,” Wuebben said.
The bargaining committee flatly disputed the characterization that the Monday date had been agreed to.
“There was no agreement between the parties to meet on Monday May 26,” the committee’s statement said.
In the hospital’s statement, Wuebben said, “Meriter is listening. We have made great strides in our proposals and tentative agreements to date.  And we are ready to continue bargaining.”  
The union, however, charged that management — not the union — was responsible for ending the talks Monday.
“At our last bargaining session on Monday May 19, the union bargaining committee offered to stay as late as needed to reach an agreement,” the bargaining committee statement said.
“The union was clear that management needed to make movement on our core priorities — priorities we have been crystal clear about since Day 1 — in order to avoid a strike,” the committee said. “Instead of engaging in discussions about our priority issues, management chose to end the bargaining session.”
Wuebben reiterated that Meriter’s management negotiators are “ready to return to the bargaining table at any time.” 
The union statement said bargaining team members are also ready to return to the table, but said they would need to see evidence that management was willing to move on their issues relating to staffing ratios, stronger hospital security and compensation.
“The union bargaining team has consistently made themselves available to meet with Meriter management, and we will continue to do so,” the union statement said. “If Meriter management would commit to make meaningful movement on our priority issues before the strike, we would consider scheduling a meeting with them before Tuesday May 27.”

Baraka appeared in federal court for a status conference on the Trump administration's charge that he trespassed last week at Delaney Hall, an ICE immigration detention center in Newark. (Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)A federal judge took federal prosecutors to task in astonishing fashion Wednesday over what he called the “hasty arrest” of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and their decision to drop his federal trespassing charge Monday, just 10 days after his arrest. 
U.S. Magistrate Judge André Espinosa told prosecutors that the swiftness of their decision to drop the charge “suggests a worrying misstep by your office.”
“An arrest, particularly of a public figure, is not a preliminary investigative tool. It is a severe action, carrying significant reputational and personal consequences, and it should only be undertaken after a thorough, dispassionate evaluation of credible evidence,” Espinosa said to Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Demanovich, who was prosecuting Baraka’s case. 
Espinosa said the government’s rush to charge Baraka culminated in the “embarrassing retraction” of the charge — which he said suggests “a failure to adequately investigate, to carefully gather facts, and to thoughtfully consider the implications of your actions before wielding your immense power.”
He emphasized the legacy of high standards of prosecutorial ethics and professionalism from prior U.S. attorneys in New Jersey, adding that charges are brought only after considerate and exhaustive fact-gathering. He noted Demanovich himself acted appropriately, but the office must “operate with a higher standard.”
“Let this incident serve as an inflection point and a reminder to uphold your solemn oath to the people of this district and to your client, justice itself, and ensure that every charge brought is a product of rigorous investigation and earned confidence in its merit, mirroring the exemplary conduct that has long defined your office,” he said. 
Demanovich responded that the office had conducted a thorough review of the claims against Baraka, and he agreed that it’s the goal of his office to uphold justice.
Thursday’s hearing, during which Espinosa formally dismissed the trespassing charge, capped a dramatic two-week period for Baraka, who is one of six Democrats running for governor this year (the primary is June 10).
Baraka was arrested May 9 while House members attempted to tour Delaney Hall, a recently reopened federal immigration detention center in Newark. Baraka had previously tried to gain entrance to the facility, which is engaged in a legal court battle with the city over whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits to open.
Baraka has maintained that he was invited onto the property by federal agents, and arrested even after he complied with agents’ request for him to leave. He posted a video last week on social media showing a guard opening a gate to let him in.
Though Demanovich told Espinosa during a hearing in the case last week that prosecutors had “clear evidence” Baraka was trespassing, the U.S. Attorney’s Office revealed in a criminal complaint filed against Rep. LaMonica McIver Monday that a guard allowed Baraka onto the property because the guard thought Baraka was a member of Congress with the power to inspect the facility.
After Baraka’s arrest, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said Baraka “has willingly chosen to disregard the law” and added, “NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.” Habba, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump, attended last week’s court hearing in Baraka’s case.
Rahul Agarwal, an attorney for the mayor, said Wednesday if the matter had gone to trial, he’s “confident” that the “charges did not and would not survive scrutiny.” Agarwal also said the dismissal of the charge doesn’t erase the five hours Baraka was detained and the public scrutiny the mayor faced.
When Habba announced Monday that she agreed to drop Baraka’s trespassing charge, she also said she would be charging McIver with a crime. Prosecutors allege McIver assaulted two federal agents while trying to prevent Baraka’s arrest.
McIver maintains the charges are politically motivated and said Tuesday she looks forward “to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”
After Wednesday’s hearing, Baraka was heard on a microphone acknowledging the admonishment from the judge, according to the New Jersey Globe. It’s not clear he knew he could be heard. 
“Jesus, he tore these people a new a**hole. Good grief,” Baraka said.

(Paige Eichkorn / Arkansas Advocate)Attorney General Tim Griffin on Wednesday substituted and certified the popular name and ballot title of a constitutional amendment proposed by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas aimed at preserving the state’s direct democracy process.
Griffin had rejected the proposal three times prior to Wednesday’s certification. In his most recent rejection, Griffin cited a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level as his reason for denying certification.
In Wednesday’s opinion, Griffin said he previously did not approve the League of Women Voters’ proposal because it ranked at grade level 12.2 on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
Arkansas attorney general rejects first ballot measure under new law

Additionally, the attorney general identified two other “minor issues” —  a grammatical error in the text and the proposal’s “failure to mention any standards upon which a popular name could be challenged.”
Griffin noted in Wednesday’s opinion, which Assistant Attorney General Kelly Summerside prepared, that the League of Women Voters had corrected both issues and rewrote the ballot title so it ranks at an 8.5 grade level on the Flesch-Kincaid test. 
“With regard to your proposed ballot title, I have made several minor changes to ensure that the ballot title clearly and accurately sets forth the purpose of your proposed initiated amendment to the Arkansas Constitution, while remaining at an eighth-grade reading level,” Griffin said. 
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and its ballot question committee, Save AR Democracy, said they were pleased with “this long-awaited approval,” in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon. 
“This victory belongs to every Arkansan who believes in the power of the people to shape their own government,” said Bonnie Miller, president of the League. “Despite the challenges, we refused to give up because the right to direct democracy is worth fighting for.”
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas submitted its first proposal in March. The amendment’s goal is to “restore Arkansans’ constitutional right to direct democracy by preventing legislative interference, streamlining legal reviews, and simplifying the citizen-led petition process while ensuring that the fundamental rights of the amendment are subject to strict scrutiny by the courts in order to be valid,” according to a Wednesday press release.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The nonpartisan LWVA, which submitted its most recent proposal on May 7, is proposing a constitutional amendment to prohibit state lawmakers from changing the Arkansas Constitution themselves and require that any new law affecting the initiative and referendum process must be approved by voters at the next general election.
Additionally, the ballot measure would only permit voters, not state lawmakers, to propose changes to Article 5, Section 1 of the state Constitution, the section that outlines the initiative and referendum process. 
Under the proposed constitutional amendment, the General Assembly would determine the name and title of referendums, and votes on a bill with an emergency clause (a provision that allows laws to become effective immediately) would have to occur at least 24 hours after the bill passes.
Additional provisions of the proposal address the signature-gathering process, as well as the process for certifying and challenging ballot titles. 
These reforms are essential to ensuring Arkansans can continue bringing issues “directly to the ballot without unnecessary obstacles,” according to the release.
“This is about protecting the voice of the people,” Miller said. “It should be the voters, not politicians, who have the final say in how Arkansas is governed.” 
Preserving Arkansans’ right to propose state laws and constitutional amendments became a priority for several groups after lawmakers approved about a dozen bills related to direct democracy during the recently concluded legislative session. The bills’ sponsors said they will ensure integrity with the process, while opponents have argued the new laws make it nearly impossible for Arkansans’ proposed measures to qualify for the ballot.
Arkansas coalition submits proposal to protect ‘fundamental right’ to direct democracy

The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a federal lawsuit in April alleging that eight of those laws are unconstitutional. Two ballot question committees, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, filed a motion to intervene in the case last week because they want to challenge additional laws not included in the original suit, including Act 602 of 2025, the law that prohibits initiative petitions from being written above an eighth-grade reading level.
Protect AR Rights also submitted its own proposed constitutional amendment Monday that would protect Arkansans’ “fundamental right” to direct democracy. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families is a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition, and Executive Director Keesa Smith-Brantley said Monday that the group’s goal is for its proposal and the League of Women Voters’ to work together.
“There were things that we felt like we needed to equally add to make sure that we enshrine the rights of Arkansans in the Constitution, but we are hopeful to be able to work together in this process and talk about ways that we can make sure that both of the measures that we’re working on get passed,” she said. 
Under state law, the attorney general’s office has 10 business days to approve or reject a proposed ballot measure. The deadline for a response on Protect AR Rights’ proposal is June 3.

The private medical university announced Wednesday the launch of the Dr. Robert and Brenda Good Faculty Development Academy, a campus-wide initiative to “advance excellence in teaching, educational research and leadership among its faculty members,” according to a news release.
“This is a bold, forward-looking initiative designed to support faculty throughout their professional growth,” said DMU Assistant Vice President for Academic Innovation and Enhancement Nehad El-Sawi in the release. “From peer-led consultations to faculty workshops on cutting-edge topics like artificial intelligence and enhanced preceptor development, the academy fosters a collaborative ecosystem for academic excellence.”

According to the release, the initiative will focus on six areas relating to faculty training and development, including improving onboarding, offering continuous professional development, encouraging educational research, furthering collaboration across campus and bettering teaching skills.
El-Sawi said in the release this initiative will help the college invest in the future of health care by investing in its own faculty.
A gift from 1977 DMU graduate Robert Good and his wife, Brenda, is funding the program, the release stated. DMU Director of Marketing and Communications Denise Lamphier said in an email the university is not providing the gift amount at the request of the donors.
The Goods said in the release DMU needs to give the students who will eventually be caring for Iowans and others the best start they can, and a way to do that is to ensure faculty have the best training and skills to pass onto their classes.
“Their generosity will ripple through future generations and help prepare the health care heroes our world so urgently needs, including rural physicians, groundbreaking researchers and compassionate therapists,” said DMU President Angela Walker Franklin in the release. “This is more than a gift. It’s a promise of hope and innovation. The entire DMU community is grateful to the Goods for believing in our mission and investing in its future.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Massachusetts company accused of dumping thousands of tons of contaminated soil during construction of the Route 6/10 Interchange in Providence and lying about it has paid $11 million to settle criminal charges set to go to trial next month. 
Nearly all the money will go toward funding dental care for Providence children living in neighborhoods near the highway, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in announcing the settlement with Barletta Heavy Division Inc. during a news conference at his Providence office Wednesday. The settlement was signed May 15.
Complaints over contaminated soil surfaced in the summer of 2020 after workers voiced concerns about excessive dust. Barletta, based in Canton, Massachusetts, claims such allegations were the result of a scheme involving extortion and bribery by its now-defunct competitor, Cardi Corp. 
The AG’s office filed criminal charges against Barletta in early 2023 after the company 
had agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle federal charges over the issue. The state charged Barletta with two counts of illegal disposal of solid waste, one count of operating a solid waste management facility without a license, and one count of providing a false document to a public official.
Neronha said the $1.5 million federal fine wasn’t enough to deter future use of contaminated fill in Rhode Island.
“For there to be any hope that Barletta learned their lesson, they would have to pay a lot more,” Neronha said. 
Under the settlement, Barletta will contribute $10 million toward a newly-created Attorney General’s 6/10 Children’s Fund, which will be managed by the Rhode Island Foundation to address health needs and concerns of children in Providence. Priority will be given to children living in the Olneyville, Silver Lake and West End neighborhoods.
Rhode Island Foundation CEO David Cicilline lauded the state’s settlement agreement, noting that Neronha’s goal is central to the nonprofit’s work.
“Focusing the funding on neighborhoods where health disparities are high won’t just close gaps in access to care; the benefits will spill over into their everyday lives,” Cicilline said in a statement. “Children who are healthy can concentrate on school, enjoy play and contribute to their communities, creating pathways to a brighter future.”
Another $750,000 will go to the AG’s office to pay for investigation and prosecution expenses. The remaining $250,000 will go to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which investigated the contamination claims.
“Getting them to this point was not easy,” Neronha said. “Barletta knew what it did a long time ago, and it was not necessary for them to take this long.”
Under the terms of the settlement, Barletta admitted to all the claims made in a civil complaint filed on Tuesday. The state alleged that Barletta dumped more than 4,500 tons of stone and soil containing arsenic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the Pawtucket/Central Falls Commuter Rail Station and a stockpile from Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood at the Route 6/10 Interchange construction project.
The Route 6/10 project reconstructed the interchange at Interstate 95 and involved replacing or removing seven structurally deficient bridges. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation awarded Barletta a $247 million in 2017 contract to rebuild the interchange.
“It wasn’t hazardous, but it was contaminated for certain,” Neronha said of the soil.
Barletta attorney Shannon Reilly said the company is eager to move forward from the case, which was scheduled to head to trial in Providence County Superior Court June 9. The case is now permanently closed and cannot be brought back to court.
“With today’s settlement agreement and the dismissal with prejudice of all criminal and civil charges in this case, Barletta is pleased to put this matter behind us and looks forward to continuing our long history of successfully and responsibly delivering world class public infrastructure projects,” she said in an emailed statement. “We will not have any further comment on this matter.”
Barletta has claimed it is no longer able to obtain work in Rhode Island because of the use of contaminated soil on the 6/10 project.

‘Proud of their smile’
Neronha cited a 2024 Providence Journal article on rising tooth decay among children in low-income and immigrant neighborhoods in Providence as his motivation for using the settlement funds toward a grant program.
“There’s no child in Rhode Island that should face that experience,” Neronha said. “I want every kid to be proud of their smile.”
Neronha said he chose to have money administered by the Rhode Island Foundation rather than go to the state’s general fund because he felt Barletta’s impact was neighborhood specific, rather than an entire state issue. 
“$10 million is a lot of money, and I wanted it to be used for kids who are facing a crisis but live in that area,” Neronha said.
Unlike multistate lawsuits, the Barletta settlement does not have to go directly into state coffers, Neronha said. He noted his predecessor Peter Kilmartin disbursed proceeds to nonprofit environmental groups from the state’s 2017 settlement with Volkswagen over misrepresenting emissions.
Neronha said he hopes funds from the Barletta settlement will start covering kids’ dental care before his term as the state’s top prosecutor wraps up in 2026.
“I’ve got 18 months to go. I want to see movement,” Neronha told reporters.
Details for how the money will be disbursed are still to be determined. 
Greg Stepka, a North Smithfield-based dentist who attended the press conference, told Rhode Island Current he would like to see the $10 million go toward more community health centers and dental buses that visit schools, along with the creation of a centralized surgical center.
“This is a win-win,” he said. “The kids need this.”
Barletta is among 13 contractors the state is suing for negligent work on the westbound Washington Bridge. Seven defendants, including Barletta, tried to get the case dismissed, but Judge Brian Stern denied their petitions on Feb. 27.

Kevin Stitt laughs when answering a question during a press conference on Wednesday, May 21, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Wednesday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt a measure that would make it more difficult for residents to put things on the ballot.
Critics said the measure is an unconstitutional legislative power grab, while supporters said it is necessary to ensure  more input from rural counties and prevent fraud.
Currently, state law requires 97,263 signatures to get statutory changes before the voters and 172,993 for constitutional amendments. 
There are no restrictions on where the signatures are collected.
But Senate Bill 1027 would put limits on how many signatures could come from counties.
For a statute change, no more than 11.5% of votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election could come from a single county. That signature threshold increases to 20.8% for a constitutional amendment.
“This forces them out to 18 to 20 different counties,” said Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, the bill’s author. “It doesn’t even force them out to all 77 counties. We’re just asking that you go to 18 to 20 different counties to gather these signatures and get various opinions on whether or not this is something you want to do.”
Oklahoma has more than 2.3 million registered voters, of which 1.15 million voters cast ballots for governor in the 2022 general election, according to the Tulsa-based Oklahoma Policy Institute. 
The bill’s requirements would exclude 2.2 million registered voters, or 94.4% of them, from signing a petition for statutory changes, according to the organization.
It would exclude 2.1 million registered voters , or 89.8% of them, from signing a petition for constitutional amendments, according to the organization.
The measure would prohibit the payment to circulators based on the number of signatures collected. It would require sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bar out of state interests from donating. 
Bullard asked why Oklahomans would want “massive liberal organizations coming in here and shoving this stuff down your throat.” 
It would require petition circulators to be registered Oklahoma voters. Finally, it would require a political appointee, the Secretary of State, to approve the gist, the brief summary of the ballot measure that voters see at the top of the signature sheet.
Critics say the process has been used to get needed reforms on the ballot, such as Medicaid expansion, medical marijuana legalization and criminal justice reform, when lawmakers declined to act.
The bill will “suppress and subvert what we used to know as democracy,” said Sen. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa.
Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, called the measure “a power grab.” 
“It takes power away from everyday Oklahoma voters,” he said “It silences the voice of everyday citizens.”
Mann said the bill is likely unconstitutional and violates a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says out-of-state money from corporations can be spent on elections and ballot initiatives.
He said the artificial signature cap also discriminates against voters in Oklahoma and Tulsa counties, whose residents combined make up 40% of the state’s population, but can comprise only 23% of the total signatures collected. 
“It violates the one person one vote principle,” he said.”
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the measure establishes barriers that make it nearly impossible to get issues on the ballot.
Bullard said the state Constitution says laws shall prevent corruption in the referendum process.
“Let me be very clear,” Bullard said. “If you are willing to go to two or three counties to gather those signatures and completely willing to completely ignore 97.5% of the state counties, that’s corruption.”
The measure passed by a vote of 39-7.
Stitt said Wednesday that he will review the measure before deciding whether to sign it.
He said it is easier to get something on the ballot in Oklahoma than in other states, and lawmakers are trying to find a balance.
It would become effective immediately with Stitt’s signature.

Ron DeSantis signed Wednesday.
The change is part of an expansion of the school guardian program that already allows public and private school employees to act as law enforcement when an active shooter enters their campus. The Florida Legislature established the program after the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people.
Currently, 53 counties participate in the program, which requires volunteer school employees to undergo a 144-hour training, according to a legislative analysis of the bill, SB 1470, which lawmakers passed unanimously.
“I think that’s going to be something that people are going to like,” DeSantis said of the program expansion during a Wednesday press conference at Winter Haven Senior High.
Additionally, the law revises school door locking requirements, appeasing sheriffs’ concerns. The new law allows classrooms to use temporary locks, requires school safety protocol to apply for 30 minutes before and after school, and exempts door locking for career and technical education classrooms where ventilation is required.
“I think what the Legislature did is they tweaked this. They made sure that, yes, we want to be able to create blocks to keep bad guys out, but we also want it to be practical,” the governor said. “We want to make sure people are able to do their daily tasks and get to where they need to go.”
Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd previously told Florida Phoenix that the door-locking law passed in 2024 was “clunky and difficult to understand and easy to violate it even without the intent to violate it.”
DeSantis signed two other bills. HB 279 brings harsher penalties for false reporting of a crime, and HB 1099 gives police officers discretion over whether they should immediately arrest someone in a hospital, nursing home, or assisted living facility.

(Photo courtesy of Jason Christensen, Yellowstone to Uintas Connection) What happens when government agencies try to sidestep the law and exclude the public on major projects? Well, sometimes they get away with it — but not this time. The Forest Service tried to secretly log and burn a roadless area in northeast Utah but the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, one of the most successful environmental and conservation watchdogs in the West, sniffed out the plan and stopped it.
Here’s the story.
The project calls for logging and burning 4,400 acres (about 7 square miles) of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest in the Soapstone Basin area about 20 miles southeast of Kamas. This area in the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah is known for its abundant recreational opportunities, scenic beauty, and pristine wildlife habitat.
This land is particularly sensitive since its Inventoried Roadless Areas include habitat for lynx and wolverines, which are listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, as well as elk and mountain lions. The area is of great interest to the public, including the Alliance, which regularly comments on projects affecting national forests throughout the Northern Rockies.
The Forest Service neither informed nor gave the public an opportunity to comment on the project, it wasn’t listed on the agency’s projects page nor Schedule of Proposed Activities on its website. Nor was a legal notice published in area newspapers informing the public of the project as required by law.
Yet, on May 8, Deputy District Ranger Kenneth G. Verboncoeur, signed the decision memo authorizing the project.
We found pages 19-24 of the decision memo after it was posted on the agency’s website on May 9. But the first 18 pages were mysteriously missing — including maps and locations for the logging and burning or how many miles of logging roads would be bulldozed into the Inventoried Roadless Area.
Because the Forest Service never informed or gave the public an opportunity to comment on this project, we informed the agency that it was violating the National Environmental Policy Act and the decision memo must be withdrawn or we would take prompt legal action.
Due to the obvious violation of these laws, the Forest Service notified the Alliance by email on Friday, May 16, that the agency rescinded the decision memo authorizing the secret logging and burning project.
The Alliance appreciates the Forest Service for withdrawing their decision after we pointed out that they were breaking federal law and didn’t make us take them to court. But we think the Forest Service should always follow the law like most Americans do, and not just when they get caught breaking the law.
Fortunately for the American public, the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Forest Management Act and the Endangered Species Act are still on the books. We are a democracy, and according to the Constitution only Congress can change laws, not federal agencies, and not the president.
National Forests do not belong to the Forest Service; they belong to all Americans who have a right to review and comment on projects on national forests. Congress passed these laws because the Forest Service was destroying our public lands by putting clearcutting ahead of preserving habitat for biodiversity, preservation of species, hunting, fishing and the clean, vital watersheds national forests provide.
But bureaucrats can’t just operate in secret and pretend laws don’t exist when those laws get in the way of logging and burning the National Forests that belong to all Americans.
For now this decision has been rescinded. The Forest Service could sign a new decision in the future, but the Alliance will be watching — and holding the agency’s feet to fire to follow applicable federal laws.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Three years after a hazing scandal within New Mexico State University’s men’s basketball team, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez says the university has taken “valiant” steps to improve safety and accountability.
Three former NMSU basketball players were charged in late 2023 after several other younger student athletes revealed they were forcibly restrained and sexually assaulted on multiple occasions during the season. Deshawndre Washington, Doctor Bradley and Kim Aiken Jr. were all charged with various counts including criminal sexual penetration, false imprisonment and criminal sexual contact. 
According to court documents, Bradley and Aiken pleaded guilty to several of the lesser charges and await sentencing, while prosecutors dismissed the rest of the charges. Washington’s trial was set to begin in mid-April, but he appealed several of the lower court’s rulings to the state Supreme Court.
The New Mexico Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the university’s athletics department and released a full report of their findings in December 2024. The report included seven areas of concerns and 35 recommendations to improve student safety, university accountability and compliance with federal laws. 
Areas of concern include: institutional governance and student engagement; university policies; reporting; training; culture and recruiting practices within the athletics department; resources for sexual assault victims; and coordination between university departments. The DOJ provided NMSU with a checklist of 35 recommendations for improvement.
This week, Torrez released a statement commending NMSU for completing two-thirds of the recommendations so far and making progress toward the rest of the list. 
“NMSU has taken swift and decisive action,” Torrez said in a statement. “I encourage every university in New Mexico to review this report and adopt similar reforms to foster safer, more supportive environments for their students.”
The DOJ pointed out in the report that New Mexico is one of six states that lacks anti-hazing laws and recommended lawmakers pass legislation criminalizing hazing practices during the most recent legislative session. Lawmakers introduced two bills addressing hazing and one proposing criminalizing cyberbullying. However, all three bills died in committee.
During the interim, the DOJ has encouraged other state universities to implement the recommendations from the NMSU report to help further safeguard students from hazing acts and ensure the university’s system of reporting and investigating such instances are satisfactory.
“We want to thank the Attorney General’s Office for its support in helping us understand these challenges,” NMSU President Valerio Ferme said in a statement. “There’s still work to be done to ensure our campuses are places where everyone, especially students, can safely pursue their educational and professional goals. We have an incredibly devoted group of leaders who are committed to making us better, and we will continue to dedicate time and resources to address hazing and harassment to the best of our abilities.”

Administration officials have been pressuring lawmakers to speed up the transition away from the emergency motel housing program, and cut down on costs. Despite winning some concessions, the governor’s administration wouldn’t say whether it was satisfied.

Phil Scott speaks during his weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, April 2. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A bill that would radically restructure Vermont’s response to homelessness is headed for a full vote in the Senate Thursday. But Gov. Phil Scott’s administration has expressed continued concern about the legislation, making its path to becoming law uncertain.Asked at a Wednesday press conference whether he would support the bill, H.91, Scott said he hadn’t seen its latest iteration. But he noted that he could not greenlight a bill that continues allowing the mass use of motel and hotel rooms for shelter, and maintains historically high spending levels.“There’s a lot of conditions that have to be put into place before we do this,” Scott said. H.91 would shift Vermont’s homelessness response system from one centered on state government to one administered by private nonprofit organizations. It passed the House in early April.In its current form, the bill would make that transition in stages. Next summer, the statewide motel voucher program would end, and regional anti-poverty organizations would take over the task of providing emergency shelter under the banner of the newly-created Vermont Homeless Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program. The state would maintain an oversight role.The following year, a separate state program that doles out funding to build and operate shelters and run homelessness prevention programs would also dissolve and get folded into the new regional setup. Local shelter directors have pushed back against shifting this program’s current form, arguing the move could destabilize their work.READ MORE
Legislators and state officials have generally agreed on the prospect of shifting the state-run motel voucher program over to the five regional community action agencies – something that was contemplated for years even before the Covid-19 pandemic put the safety-net program in the spotlight. Scott has long called for the program’s pandemic-era expansion to come to an end.As outlined in the bill, the regional agencies, along with the statewide nonprofit focused on domestic violence, would undergo a planning process to figure out how best to use the funds that had historically gone toward the voucher program. But administration officials have expressed concerns that these groups might turn around and use the funds on hotel and motel rooms for unhoused people when traditional shelters are full.Meanwhile, the Scott administration has pressed lawmakers to speed up the transition process. In a last-minute memo to a key Senate committee last Friday, Jenney Samuelson, secretary of the Agency of Human Services, wrote that “we cannot defer all reform” until fiscal year 2027. She urged legislators to make more changes to the motel program in the fiscal year that begins this July, including “verification of residency, homelessness, and income,” prioritizing those most in need when motel capacity is limited, and shifting eligibility “to better target the most vulnerable.”Without these changes, and others, “the administration will have a hard time supporting the bill in its current form,” the Friday memo read.Members of the Senate Health and Welfare Committee bristled at officials’ eleventh-hour requests. But they acquiesced, to a point, by adding a study to the bill to consider shifting responsibilities to regional providers before next July.It’s unclear whether this change will suffice. Scott administration officials did not make anyone available for follow-up interviews about the current status of the bill Wednesday, despite multiple interview requests.Some directors of the nonprofit agencies that would take over the state’s homelessness response have balked at the prospect of a faster transition.“It is hard to understand how we’re going to create a community-based system, have some innovation, and shift the system thoughtfully around homelessness if we don’t get the resources and the timing,” said Paul Dragon, executive director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, earlier this week. “It doesn’t seem like this latest version allows for that.”The Scott administration has also taken issue with a $10 million allocation – anticipated in the already-signed state budget – intended to aid the transition to a community-based system. Samuelson’s memo demanded that funding “must be greatly reduced,” but did not provide specifics. That $10 million in transition funding remains in the version of the bill set for a Senate vote Thursday. But after the administration said the bill directs too much spending in the long term, the Senate Health and Welfare Committee removed references in the bill to a roughly $82 million baseline for the new program’s first year.Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, the bill’s architect in the House, took issue with that change – and expects the bill to land in a conference committee, where House and Senate lawmakers can hash out their differences.If the two chambers can’t come to a place of agreement with each other – and the administration – by the end of the session, Wood said she doesn’t expect to put forward similar legislation next year. H.91 is the Legislature’s last-best shot at shifting away from the motel voucher program, she indicated.“I just need to be clear that if we don’t have this, then what we have is the program as it stands right now – which nobody is satisfied with,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Just before a key vote, Scott administration’s position on motel program overhaul is unclear.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/samuelson-winters-1-20250402-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-21 18:10:16.245823

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis called the investigation by a state attorney into First Lady Casey DeSantis’ Hope Florida Foundation a manufactured political operation during a press conference Wednesday afternoon,
The governor spoke at more length Wednesday than he’d done Tuesday when the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald first reported the open investigation by State’s Attorney Jack Campbell in Tallahassee into the transfer to the foundation of $10 million from a $67 million Medicaid overpayment settlement with the state.
After signing three bills in Winter Haven, DeSantis answered questions about the Hope Florida investigation by insulting Pensacola Republican Alex Andrade, chair of the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee, who launched a legislative probe into the settlement during this year’s legislative session.
“You have one Jackass in the legislature — I’m sorry, it’s true — who’s trying to smear her, smear good people, and just understand what happened,” DeSantis said. “He took documents and he dropped them in a prosecutor’s office that is not an organic investigation, that’s a manufactured political operation. That’s all this is: Somebody with an agenda dropped off documents, and that’s all that.”
Hope Florida Foundation steered the funds to two groups that sent a combined $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to oppose Amendment 3, the failed 2024 ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana. The governor’s then-chief of staff and current attorney general, James Uthmeier, chaired that committee.
Andrade responded to DeSantis’ comments on X, stating, “I can feel the love…”

Photo by Alex Driehaus/Valley NewsThis story by John Lipmann was first published in the Valley News on May 20.BURLINGTON— When it comes to a doctor’s wrongful termination lawsuit against Dartmouth Health, legal fees could end up costing the state’s largest health system more than the financial judgment itself.Attorneys for Dr. Misty Blanchette Porter are seeking to recover $1.7 million in legal fees “and related expenses” from DH for their work representing the fertility doctor during the nearly seven years she battled the hospital over her 2017 firing.A jury determined last month that DH violated Vermont’s disability protections for employees and awarded a total of $1.125 million in damages to Blanchette Porter, who was a specialist in Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center’s now-shuttered reproductive endocrinology and infertility unit.The jury sided with DH in the five other claims Blanchette Porter had alleged. DH’s attorney’s have not responded to the motion for attorney fees. DH still has until Thursday to file motions to set aside the verdict or to reduce the amount of damages. The judge presiding over the case will determine the question of attorney’s fees.Geoffrey Vitt, lead attorney for Blanchette Porter, said it likely would be “late June or early July before the judge makes any decision.” If granted, the $1.7 million in legal fees would be shared by law firms Vitt & Nunan in Norwich and Langrock Sperry & Wool in Burlington, who jointly represented Blanchette Porter, according to the filing.In addition to recovering their legal fees from Dartmouth Health, attorneys for Blanchette Porter are asking the court to award $241,000 in “pre-judgment interest,” which is an amount equivalent to the statutory annualized 12% allowed under Vermont law based upon the $1 million in economic damages awarded to the plaintiff.Dartmouth Health’s attorneys are opposing the motion seeking the pre-judgment interest award, arguing the presiding judge should either reject it out of hand or “significantly” lower the amount, according to court documents. Blanchette Porter was awarded an additional $125,000 in non-economic damages such as “lost enjoyment of life, mental anguish, or pain and suffering.”Motions by plaintiff attorneys to recover fees on prevailing claims against defendants are typical in civil lawsuits and require attorneys to submit detailed records of the hours they worked, the tasks they did and rates they charged in the case.Judges have the discretion to grant the motion as submitted, amend it or reject it.The trial jury found Dartmouth Health had failed to meet Vermont Fair Employment Practices, relating to Blanchette Porter’s disability. In 2015, she suffered a cerebral spinal fluid leak that required multiple surgeries at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and two lengthy leaves of absence from work.A “preponderance of the evidence” showed Blanchette Porter’s disability was a “motivating factor” in her firing, the jury determined. (Since Blanchette Porter lives in Norwich, she could file her lawsuit in a Vermont federal court).Blanchette Porter, a graduate of Hanover High School and a 1998 graduate of Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, is now a fertility specialist with the Reproductive Health and Infertility Center at the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Former Dartmouth Hitchcock fertility doctor seeking $1.7 million in legal fees.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/misty-blanchette-porter.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

Montana health officials on Wednesday confirmed a case of measles in Flathead County.
The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services along with the Flathead City-County Health Department in Kalispell confirmed the state’s 9th case of the highly infectious disease in a county resident. Eight cases have been reported in Gallatin County, which marked the first outbreak of measles in Montana since 1990, and all eight individuals have recovered.
The Flathead County resident is an adult, of unknown vaccination status, who is currently isolating at home. The individual reported recent travel outside of the Flathead, but “there is no clear indication of the exact point of exposure,” according to a press release from the Flathead City-County Health Department.
“Our staff swiftly conducted the investigation upon receiving notification from the state and were able to quickly identify close contacts to prevent further spread,” said county Health Officer Jan Rankosky. “Staff are diligently working with local healthcare providers to remain in communication.”
The Flathead City-County Health Department disease investigation staff determined the individual was not in any public settings while infectious, and there are no known community exposures related to the case, including no known cases or exposed individuals associated with schools or daycares. Health department staff are providing people potentially exposed with information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch out for.
Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads when an infected individual coughs, sneezes or talks. Measles can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Symptoms typically begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body.
Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:


Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

A measles infection is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97% to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.
For more information about measles and the measles vaccine, visit the state health department’s website. Additional information can also be found on the CDC’s website.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1196157315-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) gave preliminary approval Wednesday for the first bear hunt in Florida in nearly a decade, to take place later this year. Commissioners will return for a final vote in August.
Their decision followed several hours of comments both for and against the FWC’s proposed rules for a 23-day bear hunt, tentatively proposed to take place in December, plus annual hunts from October through December beginning in 2026.
There hasn’t been a bear hunt in Florida since 2015, when a scheduled week-long hunt was shut down in just 48 hours after more than 300 bears were killed. That’s also the last year that FWC counted the bear population, which it estimated at approximately 4,050 bears statewide.
In justifying the need for a hunt, the agency has said that since that 2015 count, they believe that the four largest subpopulations of bears have grown annually and no subpopulations have shown evidence of decline.
The FWC’s plan is to remove 187 bears from four “Bear hunting zones”: 68 in the East Panhandle area; 46 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in the South hunting area. As of now, the plan calls for the permits to be issued through a random drawing and they would cost $100 for a Florida resident and $300 for those from out of state. The applications for those permits would cost $5.
‘Gun-toting individuals 
That was the backdrop of Wednesday’s meeting, held at FWC’s headquarters in Ocala, where the public was limited to just one minute due to the large number of people who signed up for public comment.
Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods supports the hunt. He said that in the past nine months there have been 107 reported interactions between bears and human beings in his county but that he believes there were at least three times as many, or at least 300 human-bear interactions.
The elimination of black bears should be regulated, Woods said, adding of his residents that “they’re gun-toting individuals, and I love them for it. They will protect their selves. They will protect their property. And they will have my support.”
“Emotions don’t drive wildlife policy. Science does,” said Travis Thompson, executive director of the conservation group All Florida. “It’s time to have a bear hunt.”
Thompson’s comments that the decision by the FWC was based on science and not emotions was a common theme among those who supported a bear hunt.
“What we need to do is follow the science. It’s that simple,” said Thomas Van Note, with the South Florida chapter of Safari Club International, who added that through his Ring door camera he now sees bears on a regular basis at his home in Ocala.
“This is getting to the point where something needs to be done. Science-based hunting is the answer,” he asserted. “This isn’t a political issue, this is a science issue, and we need to follow the science.”
Elizabeth Bland, Florida chapter president of American Daughters of Conservation, disputed the notion that bear hunters are unethical. “We are not evil, vile monsters that some may portray us to be. We genuinely want the habitat, and the species sustain and thrive.”
‘Trophy hunt’
Critics assailed the proposal, arguing that in fact the science isn’t settled.
“I do agree that science should drive actions, ” said Gina Camilleri. “The data that you are using for a data-based decision is over 10 years old. My question — why hasn’t that data been updated in time for a proposed hunt?”
“This is a trophy hunt and there is no good reason to hold it,” said Megan Sorbo. “The proposal for this bear hunt is unethical and unpopular. Hunting does not regulate bear-human interactions. The answer to this problem is reducing attractants in human areas. There is no scientific backing to this suggested trophy hunt. It is rooted in emotion and the desire to hunt.”
Another opponent was Diamond Bergeron, daughter of “Alligator” Ron Bergeron, who served two terms as an FWC Commissioner. Although she is a hunter herself, she might be able to support the plan if it were “clearly grounded in science and demonstrated to be in the best long-term interest of the bear and our ecosystem. This is a comment about rushing a premature decision,” she said, adding that “much of the data appears outdated and incomplete.”
Bobbie Lee Davenport from Collier County said there are “thousands” of people like herself living in a “bear habitat” and that the real issue is a lack of a sufficient trash receptacles. “The problem is with trash, that’s why the bears are coming.”
  Public opinion survey on a bear hunt that was posted during FWC hearing on bear hunt on May 21, 2025 (Screenshot from the Florida Channel broadcast)
The idea of a bear hunt is not popular with the public. In a survey conducted by the FWC by UCF that was displayed on Wednesday of more than 13,000 self-selected participants, 75% opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support.
Other polls, such as a Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals showed that 81% of Florida residents opposed the reopening of a bear-hunting season.
The FWC ultimately voted, 4-1, to support what was labelled as “Alternative 2,” which includes the option of allowing bear hunting with dogs and the taking of bears at game feeding stations, where food is displayed to attract the animal.
Morgan Richardson, FWC’s director for hunting and game management, said that when a bear comes to a feeding station, hunters can judge the size of the bear. He noted that most female bears weigh 250 pounds or less, while most males weigh more than that.
“When they’re at the feeder, hunters can see them for an extended period of time and judge their size, and they’re less likely to take females — particularly less like to take females with cubs — because they would see the cubs with her. So it’s a more selected method.”
The vote came less than two weeks after the FWC confirmed the first Florida black bear fatal attack of a human being in state history. The death involved an 89-year-old man in a rural area east of Naples, just south of the Big Cypress Wildlife Management Area, according to WESH-TV.

CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security […],"Sacramento police have accused a California state senator of driving under the influence of a drug following a Monday afternoon crash a few blocks from the Capitol that occurred less than an hour before she was supposed to be on the floor of the state Legislature.
CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security camera that appears to show Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, 37, wasn’t at fault in the crash that occurred around 1 p.m. Monday. 
The footage shows a white SUV rolling through a stop sign and careening into Cervantes’ black sedan at the intersection of 14th and S streets in midtown Sacramento. Cervantes appeared to have had the right-of-way as she drove east on S Street.
In a written statement to Politico, Cervantes said she “did nothing wrong” and the crash wasn’t her fault. Her office did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
“The lab results I sought in the hospital show conclusively I had no alcohol in my system. I expect this to be quickly and justly resolved,” the Riverside Democrat told Politico.
“I was accosted by Sacramento Police Department officers, falsely accused of driving under the influence, and involuntarily detained for several hours at the hospital. This ordeal was deeply distressing and left me even more shaken. As a senator, wife, and mother, I hold myself to the highest standard and expect others that serve our communities to do the same,” she said in the statement.
Prosecutors are waiting for toxicology results before deciding whether to file charges, the Sacramento County District Attorney’s office said.
Police say it was a drug, not booze
Sacramento Police Department spokesperson Anthony Gamble said Cervantes was cited under a California statute that prohibits driving under the influence of “any drug.” That includes prescription or even over-the-counter medications. 
“Sen. Cervantes was cited for suspicion of driving a motor vehicle under the influence of a central nervous system depressant,” Gamble told CalMatters Wednesday in an email. 
At the hospital where police met Cervantes, they “observed objective signs of intoxication and conducted a DUI investigation,” then cited the senator on suspicion of DUI, a misdemeanor, Gamble said.
“Based on the objective signs, officers believed that Cervantes was under the influence of a central nervous system depressant,” Gamble said. “Blood was drawn and it will take time for the results to come back.”
Gamble declined to say what the “objective signs” were and did not address Cervantes’ claims. CalMatters has filed a public records request seeking body camera footage and police reports.
Asked why officers did not take Cervantes into custody, Gamble said “every investigation is different.” State law gives a wide range of reasons for police to release people cited for misdemeanors.
Other lawmakers’ DUI arrests
Gamble said the senator was driving a state-owned vehicle, a Toyota Camry, when she was struck in the intersection by a Ford Explorer. The cause of the collision was still under investigation, he said.
The state fleet manager called police to report the collision, Gamble said, and told police that Cervantes’ chief of staff drove her to the hospital. 
The footage CalMatters reviewed shows Cervantes speaking with the other driver and waiting near her vehicle until men in business attire arrive. They remove a suitcase and other items from her vehicle before departing. 
Cervantes’ chief of staff, Cesar Anda, did not immediately respond to CalMatters today.
The Explorer’s driver did not show signs of intoxication or injuries, Gamble said. 
Cervantes moved to the Senate last year after serving in the Assembly since 2016.
Cervantes is hardly the first member of the Legislature to be accused of driving while under the influence. 
Former Sen. Dave Min, a Democrat from Irvine who was elected in November to Congress in another close race, also was cited in 2023 for driving drunk in Sacramento. He pleaded guilty. 
Former Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo, a Los Angeles Democrat, also pleaded no contest last year to a DUI she received the previous year in Los Angeles. 
She lost a race last year for Los Angeles City Council. She later introduced legislation to educate students about the harms of excessive drinking. Carrillo told CalMatters last month that she’s been sober ever since. She said she plans to run for state Senate.

Included in the bill revising various criminal statutes is a provision allowing “any aggrieved person” to seek an injunction against a municipality or its agents, including police and school employees, that do not follow the Trust Act.
Without the provision, advocates say, municipalities can ignore the state law that limits the circumstances in which police and others can alert federal agents to the location of an undocumented immigrant or detain them for deportation.
The bill would not provide recourse to a migrant detained after a municipal official violated the Trust Act; an injunction would apply to future cases. If found in violation, a municipality would have to pay the plaintiff’s court costs and legal fees.
The legislation, House Bill 7259, passed the House on a largely party-line 96-51 vote that highlighted the wide divide between Democrats and Republicans on deportations in the years since the original Trust Act was unanimously passed during the Obama administration in 2013.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who voted for the 2013 law, said the current bill broadened the reach of the Trust Act to other municipal officials not enumerated in the previous versions, and it could expose them to legal costs.
“It’s not enough that municipalities and our public safety cannot communicate with ICE for them to do their job. They’re now going to allow these same individuals to sue our towns and cities,” Candelora said.
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said the original bill, a revision passed in 2019 during the first Trump administration and the current proposal all are intended to ensure an undocumented immigrant will feel safe reporting a crime or seeking aid from police without fear of being turned over to ICE.

At the same time, local authorities must honor any court-issued warrant seeking custody of an immigrant or hold them for ICE if they are arrested on one of a list of serious charges, Stafstrom said.
“We’re trying to strike the right balance,” Stafstrom said.
The reach of the Trust Act and the politics surrounding immigration have changed since 2013, and Republicans elected after their GOP colleagues voted for the original law were scathing in their appraisal of the latest revision and what preceded it.
“The Trust Act is a travesty. It is an insult to the people of this state. The only purpose that the Trust Act serves is to hide criminals from law enforcement,” said Rep. Doug Dubitsky, R-Chaplin, who was elected in 2014.
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, questioned the original intent and name of the Trust Act, a measure described 12 years ago as engendering trust by immigrants in local law enforcement.
“A lot of times these bills get wrapped in a package, a public relations term,” said Fishbein, who was elected in 2016. “It really should be called the Anti-Trust Act. Do we trust the government to use the statutes that are in place to protect us?”
The anti-commandeering clause of the Constitution bars the federal government from forcing local and state authorities to act as agents of the federal government, meaning they are under no legal obligation to report encounters with undocumented migrants.
Stafstrom said the Trust Act reassures immigrants and keeps law enforcement focused on their primary duties.
“The intent and goal of the Trust Act was to make sure that our local law enforcement was focused on prosecuting crimes and protecting the citizens of Connecticut for offenses that occurred In the state of Connecticut,” Stafstrom said.
Rep. Tom O’Dea, R-New Canaan, complained that the new bill could put municipal officials in jeopardy of facing federal prosecution, as has happened to a judge in Wisconsin.
The judge, Hannah C. Dugan, was accused of actively obstructing the federal authorities, not simply refusing to assist them, by allegedly directing an undocumented immigrant down a hallway away from the agents. She denies any wrongdoing.
Stafstrom bore the responsibility of responding to Republicans who criticized the bill as drawn to frustrate ICE agents trying to lawfully do their jobs.
But Rep. Farley Santos, D-Danbury, rose to offer a personal perspective as, most likely, the only member of the House who once was an undocumented immigrant, albeit one brought to the U.S. from Brazil as a child.
Too much of the debate, he said, focused on criminals, not the people like his parents who fled poverty, overstayed a tourist visa on a trip to the U.S., and built a life. He said he thought of the girl in Danbury who told him her fears of coming home one day to find her parents gone.
“They are the next doctors, they are the next entrepreneurs, they are the next public servants,” he said. “I urge my colleagues to have some compassion.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fishbeincandelora-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686
,DC,2025-05-21 20:54:49+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Democrats on U.S. House spending panel grill Education Secretary McMahon over planned cuts,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-us-house-spending-panel-grill-education-secretary-mcmahon-over-planned-cuts,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon took heat from U.S. House Democrats on Wednesday over the drastic cuts and proposed changes at her federal agency in the months since President Donald Trump took office.Democrats on a panel within the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations expressed dissatisfaction with McMahon’s education initiatives so far, as well as Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request released earlier this month. The request calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the department.McMahon appeared before the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies to outline the budget request as part of the panel’s work to write the bill to fund the department for the coming fiscal year.McMahon told the panel that the department aims to “shrink federal bureaucracy, save taxpayer money and empower states — who best know their local needs — to manage education in this country.”“We’ve reduced a department that was overstaffed by thousands of positions, cut old contracts that were enriching private parties at taxpayer expense, suspended grants for illegal (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs and now are putting forward a budget request that reduces department funding by more than 15%,” she said.Trump and his administration have sought to dramatically reshape the federal role in education, including an executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department, the gutting of more than 1,300 employees at the agency, threats to revoke funds for schools that use DEI practices and a crackdown on “woke” higher education.‘Disdain for public education’Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the full panel and the subcommittee, called McMahon’s actions at the department “lawless,” adding that they “reek of disdain for public education” and are “hurting the most vulnerable in our nation.” “Under your leadership of the department, hundreds of millions of dollars have been frozen, and entire programs have been terminated,” the Connecticut Democrat said. “Funding for vital research, protection of students’ civil rights and programs that support the recruitment and professional development of effective educators have been terminated.”DeLauro also lambasted the budget’s proposal to consolidate 18 grant programs for K-12 education and replace them with a $2 billion formula grant that would give states spending flexibility.A White House document summarizing major changes in the budget request said the consolidation would cut spending by more than $4.5 billion, a point DeLauro emphasized.“Yet at the same time, you propose that we provide $4.5 billion less to educate our nation’s children overall,” she said. “A block grant is a cut — all of my colleagues here know that the states cannot afford to pick up the slack.”In another exchange in the lengthy hearing, McMahon pushed back against New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman’s assertion that the department’s Office for Civil Rights is “being decimated.” The unit has seen significant staffing cuts as part of the department’s reduction in force effort along with the closure of several regional offices.“Well, it isn’t being decimated,” McMahon said. “We have reduced the size of it, however, we are taking on a backlog of cases that were left over from the Biden administration and we’re working through those.”Watson Coleman proceeded to press McMahon on why the department would reduce its resources if the agency has a backlog in addition to confronting cases that will come before it now. “Because we are working more efficiently in the department,” McMahon replied.Prioritizing school choiceMeanwhile, Republicans focused largely on school choice initiatives and how McMahon and the department are prioritizing those efforts.  The term “school choice” applies to alternative programs to a student’s assigned public school. Proponents say school choice programs are necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools, though critics argue these efforts drain critical funds from school districts.Rep. Robert Aderholt, chair of the subcommittee, said “too many schools, encouraged and facilitated by federal funding, have let things like social justice advocacy and divisive issues crowd out the focus on teaching students and the core subjects.”“Thankfully, some states have pursued choice options for students whose traditional public schools have not served them well, including through charter schools,” the Alabama Republican said.McMahon said increasing school choice was one of her priorities as secretary and highlighted the budget’s proposed increase of $60 million to expand the number of charter schools in the country, according to the budget request.“The president absolutely believes, as do I, that the more choice that parents have, the better off the students are, and we’ve seen that repeatedly in different states,” she said.",,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Lawmakers who heard hours of public testimony on transgender rights in schools were divided on whether transgender girls should be allowed to compete on girls’ sports teams. But they overwhelmingly rejected broader efforts to roll back rights for transgender students, including bills that would restrict pronoun use or remove gender identity as a protected class under Maine law.
The legislative debate unfolded amid national attention, fueled by President Donald Trump’s administration claiming that Maine is violating Title IX — the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education — by allowing trans girls to compete in girls’ sports. The discussion included how the proposed bills would impact the state’s compliance with Title IX, with several legal experts explaining to committee members Tuesday that affirming trans students is not a violation of federal law, despite the administration’s interpretation and threats.
Transgender teens and allies crowd State House to fight anti-trans bills

To what extent Title IX protects trans students’ rights in schools per legal precedent is unclear, according to Mary Bonauto, acclaimed civil rights attorney and senior director of civil rights and legal strategies at GLAD Law.
“I think this raises the bigger issue, which is what constitutes sex discrimination, and is it sex discrimination to exclude a transgender student from a meaningful opportunity for girls and young women,” she said. 
She pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which found that discrimination based on sexual orientation or transgender status is inherently rooted in sex, and therefore violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is related to employment law.
“When you want to forbid somebody from participating in sports…because they’re transgender, the first thing you’re thinking about is their sex,” she said. “You essentially, at that point, are penalizing somebody for a trait or action that would be acceptable if they were the other sex.”
Bonauto noted that while Bostock applied to employment law, its reasoning has significant implications for education law under Title IX. 
Alternately, Erica O’Connell from the conservative Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom told the committee that Bostock decision can’t be applied to Title IX directly, because girls have been historically discriminated against, and allowing trans athletes to participate in girls’ sports takes away opportunities from cisgender girls. 
“One boy taking a part on a team that belongs to a girl, is eroding that equal protection in education,” she said.
Judiciary Committee members were split on that issue, with a 6-6 vote on two bills restricting the rights of trans athletes — LD 233 and LD 1134. These bills would cut funding to school districts that allowed trans girls to participate on girls teams and use school facilities aligned with their gender identity, including bathrooms and locker rooms. Rep. Dani O’Hallaran (D-Brewer) broke from the Democrats on those bills, although she voted against all other anti-trans legislation.
Debate centers on fairness and safety during hearing on transgender sports bills

“You’re making a choice to transition. And I’m struggling to understand why that person’s choice has the ability to take away a right position from a biological girl,” she said. 
“To me, in some sense .. I guess the phrase is ‘you can’t have it all.’” 
A third bill, LD 868, proposing co-ed teams as an alternative for trans students was defeated 7-5, but O’Hallaran said she would have voted in favor of the bill if it was amended.
Other Democratic lawmakers on the committee raised concerns about the lack of options for trans students, and the dangerous precedent these bills set for scrutinizing all girls and targeting those that don’t present as stereotypically feminine. 
“There is no choice in this. For those who do not identify according to their biological marker, they get one choice, and that’s called co-ed,” said Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross, explaining her opposition to the bill. “And if the school does not have the resources or can’t put a regional team together, then we have de facto just discriminated against those students because we have not given them choice — choices.”
Rep. Ellie Sato (D-Gorham) said her concern was with the enforcement of the bills. 
“It would backtrack the progress that we’ve made in how we’re surveilling girls’ bodies, because I’m very concerned that girls that do not present feminine with feminine attributes — cis or trans — will be targeted regardless, because they don’t fit into the model of what we believe a woman or a girl should look like,” she said.
Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) voted to support the restrictions on trans students because she said she believes in ​​“the truth of the biological reality of two sexes,” although the American Medical Association recognizes trans people and supports their right to affirming spaces.
“My hope is that my vote on these doesn’t define me as someone who hates members of the LGBTQ community or wants to be cruel towards minors who are struggling with gender ideology, because it’s simply not true,” Henderson said.
Some Republican lawmakers including Henderson voted against the broader rollback of trans rights. These included LD 1002, which would mandate that educators use the name and gender listed on a students’ birth certificate even if it doesn’t align with their gender identity, and two bills (LD 1337 and LD 1432) that aim to remove gender identity as a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act.   
Those bills will head to the full Legislature with a recommendation from the committee to reject them. .
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Phillips) said the intention behind LD 1432 is to retain gender identity protections under the umbrella of sexual orientation under the Maine Human Rights Act, but not designate gender identity as a separate protected class. He said he wanted to make the change to align with Title IX.
Barbara Archer Hirsch, executive director of the Maine Human Rights Commission, which enforces the act, disagreed. She said she doesn’t think removing the gender identity language “does anything to align or not align with the current administration’s interpretation of Title IX.
Since gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same thing, she said protecting gender identity under the broader umbrella of sexual orientation would make complying with the Human Rights Act harder if the bill were to pass.
“I think that would create a lot of confusion,” she said. “I think we would be getting more and more calls from folks not knowing what’s covered and what’s not, which was what was happening beforehand.”
O’Hallaran asked whether there was a way to retain gender identity protections while still making it clear that trans girls can’t play in girls sports. As an example, Hirsch pointed to religious schools, which because of exemptions do not have to follow the protections for gender identity and sexual orientation, as long as they don’t receive state funding.

(Submitted) TOPEKA — Last week’s news that the U.S. and China had reached a 90-day tariff deal elevated the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s trade war.
But at Wichita State University’s Center for Economic Development and Business Research, director Bekah Selby-Leach watches the trade war with the interest of an economist whose deep knowledge helps her interpret what’s happening.
She answered questions about tariffs, their impact, and what it would look like to strengthen the manufacturing economy.
What is a tariff?
“A tariff is a tax on the businesses that are bringing goods and services into the country,” Selby-Leach said. “It really is a tax levied against domestic businesses to encourage them to not import as much but rather produce locally.”
“Oftentimes, people who don’t understand tariffs think it’s going to be paid by the other country,” she added. “It might indirectly be paid through a reduced amount of purchasing from those countries, but in this case it really is trying to threaten them with reduced purchasing to get them to change their own policies.”
What is the goal of putting tariffs in place?
She said Trump administration policies could address trade imbalances.
“About one-third of goods and services are being produced out of the China region,” she said. “That puts them at a huge advantage in terms of their control of global markets, and the United States wants to reclaim some of that control. It is really just a strong arm move, I think. I don’t think they really want to damage the global economy. It doesn’t make sense for any governmental entity to put any country or the whole world into a recession.”
Selby-Leach and economists nationwide are seeing slow-downs indicative of an approaching recession. The short-term China trade deal led some analysts to reconsider but that news was quickly followed by a U.S. credit rating downgrade from Moody’s. That news caused mortgage rates to jump up near 7%. Yet inflation also increased at a lower-than-expected rate, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
Much depends on how Trump trade deals benefit the United States, Selby-Leach said.
“If it doesn’t go right, it could very well lead to a deepening recession. It is a risky move, but if it does pay off and advanced manufacturing does relocate to the United States, that could have long-term gains,” she said.
Have tariffs previously been put in place like they are now?
Current tariff policies in the United States are reminiscent of a similar situation from the past.
“The Smoot-Hawley Act, just after the Great Depression, was the closest version of this as a country,” Selby-Leach said. “It wasn’t worldwide, but it was a substantial number of tariffs that were levied. We do know from history what to expect from these types of policies.”
The act passed in June 1930, under President Herbert Hoover, and it increased U.S. tariffs on agricultural imports and thousands of imported goods. Many economists credit it with deepening the Great Depression because of retaliatory tariffs and causing decreased U.S. exports.
What effects do you typically see from tariffs?
“The economist in me knows very much how tariffs play out in terms of taxes — it almost always leads to inflation in prices. There’s really no case in which prices won’t change if these tariffs take effect,” Selby-Leach said.
Almost all goods the United States consumes have some portion of their supply chain that will be affected by tariffs, she said. For instance, the truck that transports products may have parts that are imported.
“That global connection has really helped us grow as a country,” Selby-Leach said. “Every step of the way, there’s an international component that’s going to increase the total cost.”
In terms of global economic power, Selby-Leach said, there is value in reclaiming and maintaining the country’s status. Global economic power has shifted toward China for some time, and pulling some of that back would add more democracy to the global markets, with less centralization in one country, she said.
“It also reduces risk, so if there’s something massive that happens in that one country, it won’t damage the entire world as much,” she said. “I can see the reasoning for it, but I don’t think the current actions are consistent with the reality of what it would take to shift that manufacturing back to the United States.”
What does this mean for consumers?
Selby-Leach said consumers will “most certainly” see rising costs of items typically purchased from abroad, even if companies move manufacturing to the United States.
“Take, for example, a T-shirt produced in China. Their labor costs in China are considerably lower, so they’re able to produce that T-shirt at a remarkably low cost,” she said. “Whereas labor laws in the United States, as well as our history of higher-wage jobs, do mean that when that production happens it necessarily will increase in the labor cost to produce that thing.”
What does it look like to expand U.S. manufacturing and import fewer goods?
Bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. isn’t as simple as it may appear to be, Selby-Leach said.
“Most countries start off predominantly agricultural,” she said. “On average, we typically see this movement from agricultural to industrial and manufacturing and then into the service industry, what we would typically think of as part of economic growth, a shift towards services as we become higher educated.”
“Manufacturing is then located in areas that are at that stage in their economic development,” she added.
Most of the richest countries in the world do not have a lot of production, Selby-Leach said.
“They offer an incredible amount of service, and that’s what economists would say is a natural progression. Whether it’s good or not good, that’s just the way it works,” she said. “Moving the opposite direction, I don’t know if a country’s ever done that without some sort of massive wartime event. During World War II, for example, we produced a lot of goods and services.”
High-tech manufacturing, though, can be considered its own new industry, which could complicate the understanding of what a shift toward manufacturing would mean for the United States. Selby-Leach said maybe it means delving into quantum computing or things as yet unknown.
Would this be a difficult shift?
Multiple factors influence how the United States would manage a return to manufacturing, Selby-Leach said. China has a head start, as the country has been working on advanced manufacturing for at least a decade.
Advanced manufacturing refers to the use of robotics, artificial intelligence, automation and other high-tech advances.
“They have a tremendous investment into high-tech manufacturing that a lot of Americans don’t even understand,” she said. “We often think of their manufacturing as traditional manufacturing but a lot is really high-tech, and they have a lot of investment that went into it. They have some production centers that have 500,000 workers. That’s the entire city of Wichita.”
How challenging are the workforce issues that plague many industries?
Selby-Leach said she’s not sure the U.S. could sustain large production centers. Low unemployment rates already create challenging workforce issues.
“You also have to develop the talent pool,” she said. “There aren’t people who know how to do those things in the United States because we haven’t done them for so long. So you’d have to go through a huge human training program to develop those skills. That will take at least a couple of years.”
Although there might be ways to train existing manufacturing workers and move them around to fill positions, there isn’t an available labor pool to reskill and place into newly created manufacturing jobs, Selby-Leach said.
Places like Wichita, with its highly skilled workforce in the aerospace industry and other advanced manufacturers, would have an advantage, she said.
“Fortunately, we have a big innovation with AI occurring simultaneously, and I think that can add efficiency into some of this, so that we can do more with fewer workers,” she said.
How does the uncertainty and complexity of all of this affect consumers?
“On the economic side of things, uncertainty has a very known effect and people tend to consume less and save more,” Selby-Leach said. “They tend to invest less and hold onto their money in what they consider to be more stable places, such as a savings account, or even cash and assets like that.”
Such individual decisions impact the economy, she said.
“The way we measure economic activity is through spending,” Selby-Leach said.
In her opinion, that’s the biggest concern right now — people are so uncertain that they’re just pulling back from economic activity.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bekah-at-GWP-1-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

(Photo by Michael Swensen/Getty Images)An initial state assessment finds it could cost more than $59 million to clean up more than 1.5 million cubic yards of debris from buildings and vegetation damaged by a tornado that tore through Somerset and London last week.
That’s according to a letter that Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear sent to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, requesting approval for an expedited major disaster declaration to help recover from storms across the state. The letter noted the damage and 19 deaths were primarily from an EF4 tornado with a maximum wind speed of 170 miles per hour that tore through Pulaski and Laurel counties. The letter also estimated around 1,500 homes have been destroyed or have sustained major damage.
“With just one day of assessments performed, and more assessments to be performed, the results clearly demonstrate severity, impact, and need,” Beshear wrote in his letter. “Without assistance, it is improbable that recovery will be fully realized.” 
Beshear’s letter mentions the estimate of homes destroyed or with major damage comes from comparing aerial footage with pre-disaster photos and records from county property valuation administrators. “That number can soar to over 5,000 when all impact levels are considered,” he wrote. 
The letter also details expected impacts to the region’s economy, which Beshear wrote “will be extensive and long lasting” with “many businesses severely impacted or destroyed.” 
“Laurel and Pulaski counties are situated in an area that relies heavily on tourism. Tourist season is just beginning and the area’s lodging inventory will be filled with survivors, curtailing the normal seasonal tourist income. It is likely that many tourists, hearing of this disaster, will opt to vacation elsewhere,” Beshear wrote. 
The governor also wrote more than 800 people are being sheltered in travel trailers, Airbnbs and motels following the disaster. Nineteen people have died as a result of the storms, almost all in Laurel County. 
Beshear in his request asked that residents of Laurel, Pulaski and six other counties be made eligible for  individual federal disaster assistance, which can provide individuals with money for post-disaster shelter and housing. He asked that 22 counties received public federal disaster assistance, which can help pay for infrastructure repairs.
In other areas of the country impacted by last week’s storm system, complaints have surfaced about Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials not being present or helping disaster survivors. The mayor of St. Louis complained this week about the absence of on-the-ground help from FEMA after a tornado there damaged thousands of buildings and killed five people. The storm that spurred the EF4 tornado hitting Pulaski and Laurel counties originated hundreds of miles away in Missouri. 
Beshear, a Democrat, has been critical of other actions and policies taken by the Trump administration. But in a video posted Wednesday to the social media platform X, he said he was “grateful” for the federal response to natural disasters in Kentucky.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2215237419-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between April 17 and May 13. (In March, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure, for eight days past the date of inspection, all food-safety inspection reports.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
Dairy Queen, 1100 N. 2nd St., Cherokee — During a May 13 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector cited this restaurant for seven risk-factor violations, noting that chili that had been left to cool from the previous day had not been reheated to 165 degrees within two hours as required. The inspector allowed the establishment to correct the violation by reheating the chili in a microwave oven.
The inspector also noticed that “various items” — including lettuce and ranch dressing that was made on site — were dated in a manner that suggested the items could be used past the maximum of seven days. Also, the ice machine was visibly soiled, and there was no hot water or soap at the handwashing sink near the front counter. In addition, a box of ice cream cones was stored directly on the floor, the front-counter coolers were visibly soiled and there was some sort of buildup on the cake-making table.
The inspector also reported that condensation in the walk-in cooler was not draining, resulting in a “visible water buildup” on the floor, and there was some sort of unidentified “visible buildup observed on flooring throughout kitchen area.”
King Buck’s, 6719 University Ave., Cedar Falls — During a May 13 visit, a Black Hawk County Health Department inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number.
Among the problems: The person in charge was not ensuring proper food safety in the areas of handwashing and proper holding temperatures; frozen foods were left uncovered in the freezer, risking contamination; pulled pork that was sitting in a warming unit was measured at 111 degrees, and burgers sitting in a warmer were measured at 125 degrees, both of which were too cool to ensure food safety.
Also, homemade sauces were left unrefrigerated, unspecified food items inside the walk-in cooler had been held for more than the seven-day maximum, the ice machine had an unidentified buildup of black debris, and there was no hot water supplied to the handwashing sink behind the bar.
The inspector also made note of “fly activity” in the kitchen. The inspector observed that the establishment used to be a Burger King and the hot-holding equipment left behind by Burger King was not keeping items at or above the minimum of 135 degrees.
Tapz Pub, 8450 Hickman Road, Clive — During a May 13 visit, a state inspector reported that wings prepared in a kitchen owned by someone other than Tapz Pub were being transferred into the pub. The wings were discarded, as were four tubs of wings that had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. Other foods were dated in a manner that suggested they had been kept longer than the seven-day maximum, including sausage that was dated April 29 and shredded cheddar dated May 1.
In addition, the dishwashing machine was not properly sanitizing dishes and was in need of service. The inspector also noted that the restaurant was operating without a license, having opened before obtaining approval from the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing.
Three Samurai, 1801 2nd St., Coralville — During a May 13 visit, a Johnson County Health Department inspector found pho broth holding inside a walk-in cooler at 44 degrees after being placed in the cooler the day before. The broth, which had yet to cool to 41 degrees, was discarded. Also, several items in the sushi food line were not being held at 41 degrees or colder, including raw tuna, salmon, beef and white fish. In addition, containers of house-made sauces, roasted garlic cloves, kimchi and milk were not date-marked t ensure freshness and safety.
The inspector also observed that the establishment lacked a thin-tipped, probe-style thermometer to check food temperatures, there was a hole in the ceiling with insulation hanging down, and there was a heavy buildup of debris on the ceiling vent and ceiling tiles. The restaurant’s posted license was expired, and the most recent inspection report had not been posted for public viewing. (The previous routine inspection had resulted in the business being cited for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number.)
Sisters African Food Market, 2210 Edgewood Road, Cedar Rapids — During a May 12 visit to this grocery store and meat-processing operation, a Linn County Public Health Department inspector reported that he discussed with managers the fact that “meat processing must be in a cooler temperature area — not 80 degrees — or chilled quickly.”
The inspector also observed that employees appeared to lack knowledge as to how to prepare sanitizing solution for use in the kitchen and lacked knowledge as to effective sanitization methods for meat processing. The workers also appeared to lack knowledge as to the proper methods of thawing frozen food, storing food and handling ready-to-eat food items.
The meat table and food-preparation areas were marred by debris and unnecessary equipment, such as maintenance tools, linens and bags, the inspector reported, and the was no handwashing soap at the handwashing sink in the meat-processing area and no paper towels in the employee or customer restrooms. In addition, various packaged foods were being stored on the floor in the freezer, cooler and kitchen. The store’s last routine inspection was in August 2022.
Biaggi’s Ristorante Italiano, 320 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids — During a May 8 visit, a Linn County Public Health Department inspector reported that several employees were observed changing gloves without first washing their hands, and that raw meats were being stored above ready-to-eat food inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination. Also, steam-table sauces were being held at 98 to 130 degrees and had to be discarded, and a mixture of fresh garlic and butter was being stored at room temperature rather than being refrigerated.
The inspector also reported that food items were being stored past the seven-day maximum, including pastrami that was dated April 29, langostino sauce dated April 19, and ham that was dated April 28. Also, the walls and ceilings in the bar area and the walk-in cooler were soiled. The visit was in response to an illness complaint. The complaint was deemed unverified.










“Entire premises has mouse-like droppings on the floors and on shelving ... Floors, walls and ceiling throughout the facility has excess grease and dust.


– Inspector's findings at Tommy's Cafe in Davenport


Tommy’s Café, 916 W. 3rd St., Davenport — During a May 6 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector reported that employees of Tommy’s Café were “not washing hands and using gloves” when touching raw and ready-to-eat foods and that several food items were left uncovered in a cooler, risking contamination.
In addition, several unspecified food items in the cooler were not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety. The inspector also found an opened can of applesauce dated April 10, and reported that “all kitchen equipment” was marred by excess food debris and grease. In addition, a metal plate inside the bulk ice chest had a pink substance on it.
“Entire premises has mouse-like droppings on the floors and on shelving,” the inspector reported, and shelving throughout the business was marred by dust and debris. “Floors, walls and ceiling throughout the facility has excess grease and dust,” the inspector added. The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint of some unspecified nature. The complaint was deemed verified.
La Casa Azul, 708 1st Ave., Coralville — During a May 1 visit, a Johnson County Public Health Department inspector noted that raw beef steaks were stored above cooked chicken within the walk-in cooler, risking cross-contamination. Also, shrimp was being cooked to an internal temperature of only 120 degrees and had to be returned to a flat-top grill and cooked until it reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees.
In addition, cut lettuce was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and house-made ranch sauce dated April 23 had been held longer than the maximum of seven days. The inspector also reported finding “multiple bottles of Raid” pesticide not formulated for use in food-service establishments, and noted there was no thin-tipped, probe-style thermometer on site for checking the internal temperature of food. In addition, there were bags of whole onions and canned foods stored “on the ground outside,” and the previous inspection report had not been posted for public viewing.
Back Berner Bar & Grill, 607 E. Marengo Road, Tiffin — During an April 30 visit, a Johnson County Public Health Department inspector reported that multiple house-made sauces — including garlic parmesan dated April 16, buffalo sauce dated April 11, and secret sauce dated April 21 — had been held past the seven-day maximum and had to be discarded. In addition, the thin-tipped, probe-style thermometer used to check food temperatures was inoperable, and there was an excessive buildup of debris on the soda dispenser at the bar. Also, the most recent inspection report had not been posted for public viewing.
Beach Pub, 1022 Front St., Buffalo — During an April 29 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector noted the people in charge were “not ensuring that dishes throughout the facility are being properly sanitized” and failed to ensure that food items were being date-marked to ensure freshness and safety. Also, vegetables were mingled with raw fish inside a bag within the walk-in cooler, and various, unspecified items inside the cooler had no date-markings on them – a repeat violation.
The Fountains Assisted Living Center, 3752 Thunder Ridge Road, Bettendorf — During an April 29 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector noted that a server was eating in the independent living kitchen in violation of regulations. Also, one large plastic container of potato soup prepared the day before had yet to cool to 41 degrees and was discarded. In addition, a small cooler was holding multiple food products, including cut tomatoes, cheese and dressing at 46 to 50 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder.
“Multiple prepared or opened food products were observed throughout the independent living and assisted living kitchens without proper date-marking,” the inspector reported, adding that the undated items included taco meat, cubed ham, corned beef, meatloaf and deli meat. The inspector also found egg salad with a preparation date of April 21 and which had to be discarded.
“Multiple food-contact surfaces were observed throughout the facility with a buildup of soil, grease, and food debris,” the inspector reported. A “used cigarette butt” was found in the bin used to store clean kitchen utensils, and several pieces of equipment required additional cleaning and sanitizing.
Also, salmon was being improperly thawed in a manner that would make spoilage hard to detect; the stainless steel shelves, dish carts, stainless steel rack all had a buildup of soil and debris, and a handwashing sink was clogged and not properly draining.










No roaches were observed but mouse droppings were observed, as were ants ... There are several areas in need of cleaning and sanitizing.


– Inspector's findings at Golden Corral in Davenport


Golden Corral, 5202 Elmore Ave., Davenport — During an April 29 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector cited this business for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector noted there were “ants present in the dining area,” and “mouse droppings were found in all cabinets under the hot- and cold-holding areas.” In addition, ventilation hoods, floors, fryer cabinets, gas lines, and the walk-in cooler racks were marred by “dust, debris and gunk.”
Also, cans of beans and green chiles were either dented or were bulging. The inspector also reported that the compressor in the walk-in cooler was leaking fluid onto packages of food — a repeat violation. Ant spray that was not approved for use in food establishments was sitting next to the coffee creamer in the area set aside for waitresses.
The visit was in response to a complaint alleging there were cockroaches and mice in the restaurant, the building was not clean, and the staff was not cooking food to the proper temperature and was storing out-of-date food. “No roaches were observed but mouse droppings were observed, as were ants,” the inspector reported. “There are several areas in need of cleaning and sanitizing. Raw fish and chicken were stored at room temperatures with an internal temperature of between 55 degrees and 58 degrees, (but) all food was at the proper date range.”  The complaint was deemed verified.
Pho Viet, 5002 E.P. True Parkway, West Des Moines — During an April 29 visit, a state inspector cited this business for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector noted the restaurant did not employ a certified food protection manager as required, and that food-service employees were cutting raw jalapeno garnish with their bare hands. Also, the kitchen’s handwashing sink was being used as a dump sink for food, dishes or utensils and access to it was obstructed by large buckets of cut salad.
In addition, raw eggs were being sourced from an unlicensed vendor; cooked chicken was measured at 71 degrees; cut lettuce was stored at 65 degrees; and multiple house-prepared food items had no production dates to ensure freshness and safety. The inspector also reported finding shrimp that was “thawing directly on the floor, beef thawing on a countertop, and several bags of partially frozen chicken wings thawing on a tabletop.” Throughout the kitchen, various sauces, shrimp, lettuce and stocks were being stored directly on the floor.
Iowa 80 Kitchen, 755 W. Iowa 80 Road, Walcott — During an April 23 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector cited this business for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number.  “Witnessed employee removing an English muffin from customer plate and then scraping off butter and placing it back on the plate to be served,” the inspector reported. The inspector noted that the cold salad bar was holding items at 46 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder, and so all of the items in the salad bar had to be removed.
Also, unspecified food items inside the walk-in meat cooler were marked with dates to ensure freshness and safety, which was a repeat violation. “All plastic food carts in kitchen area has excess food debris,” the inspector reported. “Inside kitchen coolers and freezers has excess food debris. Microwave in kitchen has excess food debris inside … Mouse-like droppings found in cabinet underneath the coffee machine in wait service area out front.”
Indian Garden, 2503 E. 53rd St., Bettendorf — During an April 22 visit, a Scott County Health Department inspector cited this restaurant for 12 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Food products pulled from the freezer and placed in the walk-in cooler had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety; a container of mint yogurt was marked with a preparation date of April 10, indicating it was held for longer than the seven-day maximum; and some kitchen utensils or equipment were marred by “dried food debris, soil and/or grime.”
Also, a cooked container of tofu was sitting out at room temperature and was measured at 69 degrees, “stuffing for bread that contains cooked onions” was observed sitting out at room temperature, and packages of raw chicken breasts were left to thaw at room temperature. The inspector also observed that the flooring between and behind the cooking equipment had a buildup of grease and food debris, as did the sides of the fryer and the containers holding clean dishware. “Urine spots were observed on the toilet seats in both the women’s and men’s restroom,” the inspector added.
The inspector also noted that although the establishment was barred from serving mixed drinks until it had a handwashing sink in the bar area, there were bottles of liquor seen in the bar area.

(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)Michigan House lawmakers are trying again to make sure the game isn’t rigged for ticket buyers with reintroduced bills to ban the use of software or bot programs to scalp online tickets and purchase them in large quantities.
The initial bills, sponsored by Rep. Mike McFall (D-Hazel Park) and Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford Township), were passed by the House last session, but died in the Michigan Senate. They were reintroduced in March and were back up for a first round of testimony on Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee.
Live Nation, a major player in concert promotion and ticket sales, said it supports the bills, but the secondary ticket reseller StubHub remained neutral.
Overall, the bills would ban people from creating bots that scrape websites for tickets and purchase them in large quantities. They would also ban users from using multiple accounts to buy tickets to circumvent or disable security features on websites to control sales volumes.
“We all have experience with trying to attend a concert or sports event only to be told that the event is sold out and only resale tickets are available at extreme markups,” McFall said. “Bad actors will purchase excessive amounts of tickets, commonly using bots with the intent of selling the tickets at prices that can be multiple times the original face value for popular artists like Taylor Swift. Tickets with value of $250 to $500 have been commonly resold for $5,000 to $10,000.”

McFall noted one instance of a ticket being resold for $17,000 in Arlington, Texas, for Swift’s widely popular Eras tour. He said it harms the entertainment industry but, more importantly, harms consumers by creating an unnecessary financial barrier.
The representative added that the bills would provide the Department of Attorney General with the means to investigate consumer complaints regarding scalped tickets and act against those who are misusing bots to buy several tickets at once.
Harris said a staffer wrote him a script to read in committee rife with Swift lyrics. He didn’t read it, much to the dismay of Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi), but said the package prioritizes the consumer.
“I think most of us here have constituents that have made comments or complaints about this,” he said.

Harris said his bill would empower the attorney general to investigate consumer complaints on ticket sales and provide clear penalties. If passed as written, the legislation would carry a civil fine of up to $5,000 for each violation.
Harris noted that one ticket sale purchase by a bot equaled one violation.
“These people are frauding the system and making it hard for the rest of us to actually take our families out and enjoy a good time at the concert,” he said. “As a father of six, yes, I have attended a Taylor Swift concert. That was my duty as a father of four girls. I believe these are meaningful safeguards that will increase transparency and ensure a much fairer purchasing process for people here in Michigan.”
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said that as a big Jimmy Buffett fan, she had a hard time getting tickets to his shows before she got on a special list, but could even then find them on a secondary reseller like StubHub. She wondered how the attorney general would begin to investigate instances where a show sold out quickly, and how would their office know if it was a case of a bot purchasing several tickets at once.
McFall said a person would have to file a consumer protection complaint and that the platform, whether it be Ticketmaster, Live Nation or some other seller, would have access to information on whether a bot or multiple accounts owned by the same person purchased the tickets.

Lawyers argued for a day and a half in a Jackson federal courthouse about the national park’s burden for enforcing proper trail use where Sunseri took a shortcut during his fastest-ever climb of the Grand Teton. 
The post Grand Teton switchback-cutting trial concludes; judge promises verdict soon appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON—The trial of the United States v. Sunseri in a courtroom here delved deep into the minutiae of trail management, proper signage, law enforcement protocol and what is quickly becoming Wyoming’s most notorious switchback cut.  
After a day and a half of testimony, the trial concluded Wednesday without a verdict. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick told the courtroom she will take the matter under advisement and review the copious exhibits and arguments before issuing a finding of fact. 
At issue: Whether ultra-runner Michelino Sunseri was properly cited for cutting a switchback during his 2024 fastest-ever out-and-back climb of the iconic Grand Teton. 
On its surface, extensive debate about a trail in the lofty and scenic Teton Range may appear frivolous. But the case has drawn intense attention in the world of alpine athletics, and the testimony underscored that both sides believe a great deal is at stake: from the preservation of a natural park landscape to the ability of public lands visitors to move about reasonably freely, how historic trail use plays into current rules and what factors should contribute to a federal misdemeanor citation. 
In her closing argument, prosecuting attorney Ariel Calmes said that just because something has historically gone unpunished — in this case, climbers using the switchback in question so extensively that it became an established singletrack — doesn’t mean it can’t be punished now.
“This is somebody who made a deliberate decision to make that cut,” Calmes said of Sunseri. “He intended to do what he did.”
Jackson attorney Ed Bushnell, who represented Sunseri, said the government did not fulfill the obligations required to enforce trail closures. Those include proper notification with conspicuous signs, he said, which the NPS did not install. He refuted that Sunseri had any criminal intent. 
The verdict could have implications for park law enforcement and trail norms in the increasingly popular world of elite mountain sports. 
A consequential route
On Sept. 2, Sunseri ran and scrambled the 13.2 miles from the Lupine Meadows parking lot to the summit of the 13,775-foot Grand Teton and back with a time of 2:50:50 — a stunning feat that broke a 12-year-old record.

The news made waves in the mountain sports world. One of Sunseri’s sponsors, The North Face, posted an announcement to its more than 5 million Instagram followers in the days following the achievement.
But on his way down the mountain, Sunseri cut a switchback while following the route of other previous record holders. He acknowledged his decision in a post on the sports tracking platform Strava, which also published a GPS track of his route showing where he cut the trail. Fastest Known Time — the organization that arbitrates and tracks official speed attempts — rejected his submission due to the offense. Not long after, park rangers issued him a citation.
Grand Teton National Park rangers gave Sunseri a ticket for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation comes with a maximum penalty of $5,000 and six months in jail. 
When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor conviction, five-year ban from the national park and a fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges, and the trial opened Tuesday morning in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson.
Witnesses and semantics
Over the day-and-a-half trial, eight witnesses took the stand. They included current professional athletes and older climbers who climbed the peak hundreds of times, park rangers and a trails management expert. 
Their testimony offered details on the historic conversation around and use of the switchback-cutting route; the procedures by which park rangers discern whether a citation is appropriate; the private conversations Sunseri had regarding his route and the semantics around trails considered either “established,” “maintained” or “designated.” 
While Calmes laid out evidence that rangers issued the citation simply because a violation occurred and Sunseri made a confession, Bushnell argued that the closure was not signed adequately enough to communicate the established route was closed.
This is a breaking news story and a follow up is planned. -Ed.

(Photo by Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)The U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced Wednesday it will close its investigation into the Memphis Police Department and retract a December 2024 report addressing constitutional violations by police. 
The DOJ found police in Memphis used excessive force, engaged in unlawful traffic stops and routinely discriminated against Black residents after a 2023 investigation spurred by the death of 23-year-old Tyre Nichols when he was beaten by police officers during a traffic stop. 
In addition to ending the Memphis case, the DOJ said in a press release it will close investigations into local law enforcement agencies in Phoenix; Oklahoma City; Trenton, New Jersey; Mt. Vernon, New York; and into the Louisiana State Police. 
The agency also will dismiss lawsuits against the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments, accusing the Biden administration — which filed the suits — of using flawed data to impose orders on the two departments to stop discrimination. 
Department of Justice opens civil rights probe of Memphis after Tyre Nichols death case

“Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division’s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
Louisville police came under investigation after the shooting death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, who was in her apartment with her boyfriend when seven officers forced entry as part of a search for drugs. An investigation following the incident found the police had targeted the wrong apartment. 
The DOJ opened an investigation into police in Minnesota when a bystander’s video showed officer Derek Chauvin applying a chokehold to George Floyd — who was Black — in May 2020, killing Floyd. Chauvin was convicted of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represented the families of Nichols, Taylor and Floyd, called the move by the federal agency a “slap in the face” to the families. 
“By walking away from consent decrees in Minneapolis and Louisville, and closing its investigation into the Memphis Police Department while retracting findings of serious constitutional violations, the DOJ is not just rolling back reform, it is attempting to erase truth and contradicting the very principles for which justice stands,” Crump said in a statement.
“These consent decrees and investigations were not symbolic gestures, they were lifelines for communities crying out for change, rooted in years of organizing, suffering, and advocacy,” said Crump.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Almost a year after Oklahoma lowered the bar for public school students to achieve a proficient score in reading and math, a state commission has raised academic expectations again.
The Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability voted unanimously Wednesday to throw out performance expectations, known as cut scores, that the state set in 2024 and to restore the nationally aligned standard used from 2017 to 2023. Cut scores define what knowledge students should demonstrate on annual state tests to be considered proficient, or performing on grade level.
Maintaining high academic expectations, commissioners said, would shine a light on children who are struggling. 
Lowering expectations only masks poor performance and causes long-term harm to students, said Oklahoma Education Secretary Nellie Tayloe Sanders, who leads the commission.
State records show the now-discarded cut scores labeled students as proficient with significantly worse test results.

“We are committed to being a commission that is working very hard to provide truth and transparency that families can depend on to find out whether their children are ready for life after school,” Sanders said.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education developed the 2024 cut scores with committees of teachers last summer. State records show the Education Department provided the teacher committees with benchmark scores to use as guideposts. 
Although state Superintendent Ryan Walters said he wanted the agency to avoid putting a “thumb on the scale,” those guideposts suggested to the committees that they set lower expectations for student achievement on annual reading and math tests.
The commission approved the resulting cut scores in July, sending proficiency rates spiking statewide. No announcement from the Education Department explained the abrupt increase, leaving school officials suspicious and families unaware that the rising proficiency rates were a result of different scoring methods, not genuine academic improvement.
It wasn’t until news reports, including from Oklahoma Voice, revealed the cut score change that the Education Department acknowledged what happened.
Walters has since urged the commission to recalibrate the cut scores, claiming the process suffered from “political interference.”
“I’m glad that they’re taking action now,” Walters said Wednesday. “I mean, it took them forever to do it. It was pretty common sense. But look, they need to quit shifting the blame and actually do their job.”
The commission hired testing experts to study the process that produced the 2024 cut scores. 
The experts found the Education Department gave incomplete information to the commission when asking for approval of the cut scores in July.
“My opinion is you probably had less than half the information that you probably really needed to make an informed judgment,” said Chad Buckendahl, a testing expert from ACS Ventures who presented to the commission Wednesday.

Crucial information the commissioners were missing, Buckendahl said, was how the new cut scores would widen the difference between Oklahoma’s performance expectations and standards used for national testing. 
That divergence is known as the “honesty gap.”
In 2017, Oklahoma officials sought to limit the “honesty gap” by aligning the state’s cut scores with the national standards used for the Nation’s Report Card, which tests reading and math levels in all 50 states.
While national standards were integral to developing the 2017 cut scores, state documents show the Nation’s Report Card wasn’t considered when the 2024 expectations were developed.
Limiting the honesty gap is “probably the most substantial thing we could do to course correct,” Sanders said.
The Education Department should have included the commissioners and their corresponding state agency, the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability, from the beginning of the cut score setting process, Buckendahl said.
The commission is meant to give input on policy goals that are foundational to setting academic expectations for students, he said. The experts reported the Education Department still hasn’t disclosed what policy objectives it followed when directing the cut score setting process.
The commission’s vote to reject the 2024 cut scores now puts last year’s test results in doubt. 
OEQA executive director Megan Oftedal said her agency will work with the Education Department to decide how to interpret students’ scores from 2024.
She said the previous cut scores, now restored, will apply to 2025 test results.

“Congratulations!” the protesters called out to the cadets and their family members as they passed by on the sidewalk. Some of the graduation attendees thanked the protesters for their presence outside the academy. 
The protesters carried signs calling out various actions by the Trump administration, including the unlawful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, the Trump administration’s cuts to veterans services, the recent federal budget proposal that includes cuts to Medicaid, the administration’s position on Ukraine and the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University student who played a strong role in pro-Palestinian protests.

While demonstrators protested right outside of the campus, Noem got a polite and warm reception from Cadet Memorial Field as she delivered a 20-minute keynote address.
“You’re the first graduating class of a brand new Coast Guard,” Noem said. “I want to share with you today what part of President Trump’s vision is for the future of this force. With your help, President Trump and I are going to make America’s Coast Guard the strongest, the most capable, the also most effective military service in the entire government.”
She highlighted recent conversations with President Donald J. Trump from the Oval Office about the needs of the Coast Guard, which, unlike other military branches, is overseen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And she detailed how the administration plans to “transform” the service through a new effort called “Force Design 2028.”
Protesters, meanwhile, uniformly told The Connecticut Mirror they had no problem with the Coast Guard. In fact, they expressed admiration for the service. 
“[I] highly respect the Coast Guard,” said Janet Bannister of Coventry. “I’ve known a lot of young people who have made it through. I’m just so proud of them. So yes, we hope it’s clear to people that we are pro-Coast Guard and celebrating the graduates, but … here we are.”

Montville resident Linda Ness said she was against the current federal budget proposal, particularly cuts to Medicaid and the amount of money it would add to the national debt. 
“It’s where they’re putting their money. It has nothing to do with the country[’s] needs and the people. They’re taking care of corporations, they’re taking care of the ultra-wealthy. That’s not democracy,” she said. 
Ness held a sign listing police, fire departments, hospitals and utilities as some of the benefits that the wealthy use and said she was opposed to the idea of them receiving tax cuts. 
Claudia Allen, a resident of Thompson, told CT Mirror that she’d been attending protests since Ronald Reagan was elected president. 
“ My son was sent to Iraq, and I’m a peace activist. That was horrifying, with George Bush. But even that, there were some people who were competent and who were not aligned [with] him instead of the U.S. Constitution,” said Allen. “This is the Constitution state, and she’s not upholding the Constitution, nor is that administration. That’s a big reason that I’m here.”

Immigration enforcement was another common theme among the protesters. They mentioned the violation of court orders, instances of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apprehending people, and deportations to countries like El Salvador and South Sudan without due process. 
“[The administration] is so incompetent,” said Denise Weinschenker of Salem. “ He was supposed to drain the swamp. Instead he went into the swamp and pulled all those people out.” 
Joanne Sheehan, one of the protest’s organizers and a member of the Unify & Resist Coalition, told CT Mirror that they have organized protests in the past against U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement speakers. She said they had counted 250 people present at the protest today but estimated that there were more. 
Sheehan said the protests were different sizes each year. Some years, only a few dozen people showed up, and others counted protesters in the hundreds. The largest, she said, was the spring after Trump was elected for the first time.

Other protesters mentioned the abrupt firing of Admiral Linda Lee Fagan in late January, a day after Trump’s inauguration.
They criticized the administration for Fagan’s dismissal, noting that she was the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces and praising her focus on diversity in the Coast Guard. 
“Sexual assault has been endemic and such a problem here. And they finally get someone to clean it up, and he fires her immediately. Day one,” said Mystic resident Martha Crum. 
The firing drew condemnation from some of Connecticut’s congressional delegation at the time.
DHS officials cited issues with deployment of the Coast Guard to assist with border security, dissatisfaction with recruitment and retention, efforts surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and cost overruns on icebreakers and helicopters used in the Arctic region.
They also raised concerns about the handling of Operation Fouled Anchor, an investigation into decades of sexual misconduct claims at the Coast Guard Academy and past leaders’ decisions not to disclose a report about it to Congress. Fagan did not serve as commandant at that time but had apologized for not acting on it until CNN broke the story in 2023.

In addition to a shift in top leadership, the Coast Guard and its New London service academy have already undergone other structural changes.
Since Trump’s executive order taking aim at DEI policies, the Coast Guard has shuttered a number of DEI-related programs and offices, including the Academy’s Office of Culture and Climate.
The Coast Guard had prioritized DEI as a way to boost recruitment and retention among cadets as well as within the force. In a Coast Guard Academy diversity report submitted to Congress in 2024, Fagan wrote that such initiatives show progress was made “in attracting a workforce that is representative of the nation and preparing culturally competent leaders for the future.”
Recruitment was a big part of Noem’s keynote address Wednesday, pointing out the current shortfalls in the enlisted workforce as well as ships with incomplete crews. According to Admiral Kevin Lunday, who is currently serving as acting commandant, the Coast Guard has surpassed its annual recruitment goal and has so far recruited 4,700 new members, Noem said.

Along with recruitment, Noem said, “Force Design 2028” will aim to reorganize the service by reducing the number of admirals by 25%, replacing outdated technology, fixing crumbling infrastructure and increasing the number of icebreakers. She said the goal over the next four years is to increase the size of the Coast Guard by at least 15,000 personnel. 
“Those needs represent the biggest Coast Guard readiness crisis that we have seen since World War II,” Noem said. “That may have been the Coast Guard of the past, but that will not be the Coast Guard of the future.”
As her speech concluded, Noem made an initially unplanned announcement about the new leadership team at the Coast Guard. Among other promotions, Lunday will now be nominated for the commandant role permanently. He spoke shortly before Noem and praised the administration for its “inspiring leadership and remarkable advocacy” of the Coast Guard.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USCGA-GRAD-0521-SR-9-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 17:09:47.183686

(VCU Capital News Service)Members of a Metro task force including Northern Virginia leaders reached a consensus to avoid a uniform sales tax and instead contribute to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s capital projects to improve service. But some argue such a tax could be inevitable.
The urgency of the situation is highlighted by the need to address Metro’s “capital cliff,” and the ability to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure. 
On Friday, May 16, Metropolitan Washington area task force leaders supported “Option A,” which requires jurisdictions to generate sufficient revenue to cover their share of $500 million to $600 million starting in fiscal year 2028, and growing 3% each year.
The second concept, “Option B,” would have required jurisdictions to enact a sales tax.
Paul Smedberg, task force co-chair and WMATA Board of Directors First Vice Chair, said although the task force members came to a general consensus, they want to see more detail.

“They’re gonna want to see some of the algorithms or models that were used to develop this because they want to feel comfortable with it,”  Smedberg told reporters last Friday. “There’s still work to be done.”

The discussion about developing a regional Metro funding source is part of a yearlong effort to collaborate through an initiative called DMVMoves, led by Metro and the Council of Governments.
Several state lawmakers who represent the areas serviced by the transit agency urged the task force to consider taking a region-wide approach to transit workforce development by creating a partnership among multiple regional employers, and continuing the region’s commitment to providing dedicated capital funding for WMATA since 2018.
“Without future proofing the region’s capital contributions, WMATA will hit a fiscal cliff that would prevent it from tackling its backlog of state of good repair projects or from creating the fleets of the future for bus or rail operations that our region needs and deserves,” wrote Sens. Jennifer Carroll Foy, Danica Roem, Saddam Salim and Stella Pekarsky, and Dels. Michelle Maldando and Joshua Cole in a May 15 joint letter.
 How funding could help

As part of the proposal, Virginia could be responsible for an estimated $150 million to $180 million annually starting in fiscal year 2028, and that amount is likely to grow. The funding would be separate from what Metro receives from ridership, fare revenue, and contributions from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Northern Virginia — members of the WMATA Compact.
“With this funding, either option, we are creating a sustainable revolving bond program that can meet the state of repair needs of the system, as well as implement rail operation,” said Nick Donohue, principal at Capitol Transportation Consulting.
If successful, the region would reinvest in and modernize Metro’s system. Funding could help reduce rail travel times with rail automation and advanced signaling, and improve bus services.
Rail automation would increase capacity with faster travel and more trains per hour, improve service reliability, and is projected to grow ridership and revenue.
Supporters of rail automation also say operations would be safer by reducing staff on the roadway, keeping trespassers off the tracks, and reducing track fires. But the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission said automation has contributed to train overruns — when a train doesn’t stop within the station’s platform area.
Metro is still seeking to expand automation across the entire rail system. Automation is currently only used on the red rail line, which does not run through Virginia. Automation will expand to the green and orange lines starting Friday, the transit announced on Tuesday. While the green line does not run in the commonwealth, the orange line operates from New Carrollton in Maryland to Vienna in Northern Virginia.
If automation is fully implemented, Metro would mirror rail systems in several countries where automation is already in use.

Virginia lawmakers in their letter said any plans for automatic train operation or signalling improvements must be done with “safety” and “workforce considerations” in mind. 
“All technology improvements should be paired with redundant safety features for the time when, not if, they fail to perform as expected,” the group wrote. “Workers who gave their careers to public transit should not be an afterthought in WMATA’s rush to implement cost-savings from automation.”
Funding could also improve Metro’s signal system, which guides and controls train movement, ensuring efficiency and safety. 
Metro said maintaining the system can be costly, because few vendors have parts and signals, and the infrastructure and technology are obsolete. 
 Support for investment concepts

Most task force leaders supported the option of a regional commitment. But a few said the plan could be in jeopardy if new jurisdictional leaders have different policy ideas. 
Loudoun County Supervisors Chair Phyllis Randall feared this and supported the sales tax option as jurisdictions, some of which can’t afford to pivot financially, are facing large deficits.
“If we want to use the word ‘dedicated source of revenue,’ then you get a dedicated source of revenue through a sales tax. I don’t know how you can actually literally say you get there any other way but by enacting a sales tax,” Randall said. 
“Nobody, no political official wants to say ‘Hey, we have a new tax coming up,’ but I don’t think you get there any other way. And quite frankly if we’re talking about FY28. I don’t think there’s an elected official who even knows if we’re going to be here in FY28 — I mean, we just don’t — and so we’re making promises we’re telling other people to keep and that’s never a wise thing to do either,” Randall added.

Donohue said the tax rate would not change as part of the sales tax option concept. But Fairfax County Supervisors Chair Jeff McKay, who prefers jurisdictions to commit to paying a specific amount, argued that a potential sales tax could be insufficient, which would bring everyone back to the drawing board.

The other knock against the sales tax option is that jurisdictions must manage their own revenues, McKay said, as the cost of capital projects has constantly changed. He said if the region is going to support the regional commitment option, everyone has to be on the same page, showing cooperation and protecting jurisdictions.
“The whole region has to be in on Option A because we have to go out and sell this as a regional solution,” McKay said. “The solutions are different among the jurisdictions, that’s fine, but we have to be as a region talking about a package that portends to accomplish Option A.”
 What’s next

The task force will review a full proposal for approval in the fall, allowing members to share this with jurisdictional leaders and lawmakers. Virginia’s legislature returns for its full session in January.Simultaneously, Virginia lawmakers created the Northern Virginia Growing Needs of Public Transit Joint Subcommittee, studying long-term, sustainable, dedicated operations and capital funding for Metro.

,California,2025-05-21 20:00:28+00:00,CalMatters,Google follows Newsom in reducing support for California local news,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/05/google-california-local-news/,"To avoid regulations, Google and California agreed to commit $45 million in one year to prop up local news outlets. The new program is starting with just  half that amount.","In summary
To avoid regulations, Google and California agreed to commit $45 million in one year to prop up local news outlets. The new program is starting with just  half that amount. 


Google will pay $5 million less than it promised to a fund intended to help struggling California news outlets stay afloat, less than a year after committing to pay $15 million. 
The company will now pay $10 million into the initiative to fund local news which will be distributed among California news publishers, according to the office of Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who has been involved in setting up the program. 
The announcement Wednesday came a week after Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed cutting the state’s own share of the first-year commitment to $10 million from $30 million, as California faces a $12 billion budget deficit. 
The new California Civic Media Fund will be administered by the California State Library, which will set up a board of publisher representatives to determine how to distribute it with the goal of “sustaining and enhancing community news coverage in California,” according to a news release from Wicks’ office. The library will also assess the regional availability of news coverage across California to help divvy up the money.
Library officials will oversee the fund’s public dollars to provide public oversight, while Google’s share of the money will be housed in a separate nonprofit. 
“Sustaining local journalism will take all of us — government, philanthropy, and the tech sector — stepping up together,” said Wicks.
Proponents of the new program described the money as “seed funding” and said it would attract other donations from philanthropies interested in funding local journalism — a shift from lawmakers’ initial efforts to fund local news through regulations on the tech sector. Google said it would contribute more money if the state receives private donations.
Jaffer Zaidi, a vice president at Google’s parent company Alphabet said in the release that the company is “committed” to the agreement it made last year. 
Google and California both pledged much more
In their original agreement, the state and Google each agreed to pay $10 million into the fund annually for four more years, for a total of $125 million. The funding now pledged amounts to less than half of what was promised for the program’s first year. The amount paid in future years could still change, depending on the state budget.
The tech titan agreed to the deal last August, having spent a record sum to lobby California lawmakers as they considered two bills that would have forced the company to pay to use news outlets’ published content. 
Advocates for publishers and local news have honed in on the search engine’s ability to profit from links and snippets of news content as one factor that has diminished the news industry nationwide over the past two decades. California has lost one-third of its newspapers since 2005, in a trend experts say worsens civic engagement, polarization and misinformation.
In exchange for lawmakers killing the bills last year, the company agreed to instead help the state start a fund that would have given $125 million to news outlets across California over five years. Most of that money would have come from state taxpayers, while Google also agreed to continue paying its existing grants to news organizations and to pour tens of millions of dollars into an unspecified new artificial intelligence program. 
The company will continue paying those grants, Wicks said Wednesday.
Proponents of the legislation, including news publishers, journalists’ unions and local news advocates, criticized the handshake deal for being too modest. By contrast, one of the bills would have garnered about $500 million a year in fees from Google and other platforms that link to news content, to pay for a tax credit for local journalists. 
Wicks, the author of the other bill which would have required Google, Meta and other platforms to negotiate payments directly with news outlets, said the deal was the best possible outcome in the face of stiff tech industry opposition. 
When Newsom announced the state would reduce its share of funding for the new program last week, it gave Google the opportunity to do the same: The company had only agreed to put money into the fund as a match to state dollars.

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey touted the state’s new “Troops to Teachers” program that aims to put veterans in classrooms while the state struggles with a teacher shortage. 
The governor called the program a “common sense solution.”
“Let’s get really smart, talented people into the classroom as quickly as possible,” Morrisey said. “It’s going to help veterans navigate the certification process, and it’s going to allow them to get into the classroom faster … It’s going to reduce some of the bureaucracy.”
He announced the program Wednesday at Hedgesville Middle School in the state’s Eastern Panhandle. 
“Veterans have certainly proven their worth for our state and for our country,” Morrisey said before ceremoniously signing the Republican-sponsored measure, Senate Bill 765, into law that created the state- level program.
The Troops-to-Teachers program helps veterans get classroom experience while they complete necessary requirements to become employed as K-12 teachers. 
Participants are required to have a bachelor’s degree and pass the state’s skills and subject matter tests in the area for which licensure is being sought. The state schools superintendent will issue teaching certificates to eligible participants.
Del. Bill Ridenour, who retired from the U.S. Marine Corps, has supported the legislation for years after his own experience looking for a career following his military service. He had hoped to be a teacher but wasn’t able to finance his education.
“West Virginia has one of the larger veteran populations in the country. We are not exploiting that resource,” said Ridenour, R-Jefferson.
He has worked on the legislation for several years ahead of its passage this year. The House of Delegates and Senate unanimously passed the bill earlier this year.
“I’m very, very proud we’re going to do this for our kids,” Ridenour said. 
Bill sponsor Sen. Tom Willis, R-Jefferson, is a West Virginia National Guard Green Beret.   “Veterans are uniquely suited to bring those qualities into our classrooms — to lead, inspire, and shape the next generation,” he said. 
Low teacher pay, PEIA issues continue 
West Virginia has the lowest teacher pay in the nation, which has contributed to the teacher shortage, particularly in border counties.
Morrisey has said he’d like to see a pay raise for teachers but hasn’t suggested legislation to accomplish it. This year, a Republican Senator proposed a bill that would have implemented locality pay for teachers; teachers in half the state’s counties could have seen a raise based on their area’s median home value. The bill didn’t get up for a full vote in the Senate, and this year’s legislative session ended without any action on teacher pay.
The state’s Public Employee Insurance Agency, which offers insurance to school employees, will see premium increases in July of 14% for state employees and 16% for local government employees in addition to out-of-pocket and copay increases. 
Union leaders representing West Virginia’s public workers have called on lawmakers to stabilize the rising costs of health care coverage for state employees. 
In April, Morrisey said he’d call a special legislative session for lawmakers to address the rising costs of the program, but no further details have been released ahead of the July price hike. 
The governor has signed several other education-focused bills this spring, including a key measure bolstering elementary teachers’ ability to remove disruptive and violent students. Other bills mandate that counties ban cell phones during classroom instructional time and that schools display a framed poster of “In God We Trust.”
West Virginia public schools continue to have some of the country’s lowest academic outcomes while serving many children in poverty, raised by grandparents and in the state’s foster care system.
“I’m committed to seeing our education system improve,” Morrisey said.

Bird is the third Democrat to announce a bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican who was elected in November 2024. 
“Colorado families are being squeezed by rising costs and broken promises from politicians like Donald Trump and Gabe Evans,” Bird said in a statement announcing her run. “While Trump and Evans push an agenda that’s making lives harder, I’ve dedicated my career to fighting for hardworking Coloradans. From city council to the state capitol, I’m battle-tested with a record of showing up, listening, and delivering real results. That’s what the people of Colorado deserve, and that’s what I’ll do for them in Congress.”

The district is Colorado’s newest and most competitive, drawn by an independent redistricting commission after Colorado was awarded an additional congressional seat following the 2020 census. The district encompasses parts of Denver’s northern suburbs as well as more rural areas in southern Weld County.
Evans unseated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who was the first person to represent the district. She announced she would seek reelection in April, and Colorado state Rep. Manny Rutinel, a Commerce City Democrat, announced a bid for the seat as well. 
Bird serves on the Colorado Legislature’s powerful Joint Budget Committee, which drafts the annual state budget. She was first elected to the Legislature in 2018 after a stint on the Westminster City Council. 
With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House, the 8th District race could again prove crucial in determining control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. The National Republican Congressional Committee said the Democratic primary in the district is “a sprint to the left” and called Bird “the latest far-left liberal trying to out-extreme her opponents.” 
“Whether it’s Bird, Caraveo, or Rutinel crawling out of the wreckage, voters in Colorado will reject them just like they reject the Democrats’ extreme and out of touch agenda,” NRCC spokesperson Zach Bannon said in a statement. 
Since he was elected, Evans, who also served in the Colorado Legislature, has affirmed his support for Trump’s plans to carry out mass deportations of tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and remained silent on the administration’s effort to end birthright citizenship. Last month, Evans voted for House Republicans’ sweeping budget resolution to cut taxes and slash social spending, and he has since falsely claimed that the plan would not force drastic cuts to Medicaid, as nonpartisan congressional budget analysts conclude that it would.

At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

According to a news release from the Indianola college, no timeline for the search has been established, but the college’s board of trustees expects to have appointed an interim leader in time for the 2025-2026 school year to begin.
Until an interim president is found, former board of trustees chair Terry Handley will continue to serve as acting president of the institution, the release stated. He was chosen for the role days after he and the rest of the campus community heard the news that Jay Byers, who had served as president since 2023, died in the president’s residence on campus.
“Our intent is to move forward with both prudence and expediency,” said Board of Trustees Acting Chair Terry Lillis in the release. “We will leverage our extensive network of contacts to identify strong candidates who would be best positioned to lead Simpson through this challenging time of transition.”

Free.,"Trump administration violated order in deportations to South Sudan, judge says",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-violated-order-deportations-south-sudan-judge-says,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Boston Wednesday found the Trump administration violated his preliminary injunction barring third-country removals of migrants without due process, after immigration lawyers say their clients were placed on deportation flights to South Sudan.“It was impossible for these people to have a meaningful opportunity to object to their transfer to South Sudan,"" U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy said. “The government’s actions in this case are unquestionably violative of this court's order.”Murphy said he will narrowly tailor a remedy to the violation of his April order. He said the Trump administration must give proper due process to the eight men who were placed on deportation flights on Tuesday and given less than 24 hours to challenge their removal to South Sudan.South Sudan, in East Africa, is violence-ridden and the U.S. State Department advises against travel there.Department of Justice attorneys would not confirm where the plane landed, but according to flight tracking data reviewed by the New York Times, there is a chartered plane owned by a company used in the past for deportations that has landed in the East African nation of Djibouti.Murphy did not detail what contempt charges would look like, but asked Department of Justice attorneys for a list of names of people involved in the flights for potential consequences.The hearing in Massachusetts is one of several clashes between the Trump administration and the judiciary branch over the issue of due process in immigration enforcement, as the Trump administration aims to enact mass deportations.The White House in a statement attacked Murphy as a “far-left activist judge” trying to protect migrants with criminal convictions. The list of individuals the White House said were on the flight were from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma and Vietnam.Flight originated in TexasAn hour before Wednesday’s hearing, top Department of Homeland Security officials at a press conference defended the decision, but declined to confirm if the migrants were sent to South Sudan and argued the country was not their “final destination.”However, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said that South Sudan had agreed to take the men.“We conducted a deportation flight from Texas to remove some of the most barbaric violent individuals illegally in the United States,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said at the press event.McLaughlin said that the men were still in DHS custody.Murphy, appointed by former President Joe Biden, has not ordered the Trump administration to return any of the men. At the hearing, he did question a top ICE official in Texas, Marcos Charles, and directed him to find out if it were possible to hold credible fear interviews for the men instead of requiring they be returned to the U.S.Immigration attorneys who last night had asked for the emergency hearing pushed for the immigrants to be brought back to the U.S.DOJ attorney Drew Ensign disagreed and said that any remedy from Murphy should be narrowly tailored and that ordering the men to be returned would be “too broad.”Ensign also said the Trump administration’s position is that 24 hours is enough time for an immigrant to challenge their removal to a country that is not their home.Trina Realmuto, of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, argued 30 days is preferable, because many of those removed do not have legal representation and need time to find an attorney and determine if they could face possible harm in another country.Murphy said that he would clarify how much time is appropriate. He directed DOJ attorneys to make sure that everyone involved in third-country removals, from pilots to immigration officers, to be aware of his order and the possible criminal contempt charges if it’s not followed.On late Tuesday, in an emergency hearing, Murphy ordered the government to keep the eight migrants in DHS custody until more details could be revealed in Wednesday's hearing to determine if his April order was violated.In that earlier order, Murphy barred the Trump administration from removing individuals from a country that is not their home country without giving them time to raise any concerns that they might face harm in the country they would be removed to.Repeated conflicts between administration and judgesSending migrants to South Sudan would bring the same concerns as sending them to Libya, another third country with a history of clashes.The Trump administration extended Temporary Protection Status to nationals of South Sudan for six months to remain in the U.S., meaning those immigrants were granted work permits and deportation protections because their home country was deemed too dangerous to return to. In early May, Murphy warned Trump officials that any deportations to a third country such as Libya and Saudi Arabia — countries with human rights violations that the Trump administration was considering for deportations — would have clearly violated his April preliminary injunction. It’s not the first conflict between federal judges and the Trump administration.A federal judge in Maryland grilled Department of Justice lawyers and accused the administration of stonewalling information on its efforts to return a wrongly deported man from El Salvador. Another federal judge in Maryland ordered the return of a separate wrongly deported man to an El Salvador prison, an order that the DOJ is currently appealing.A federal judge in the District of Columbia ordered the administration to return deportation planes to the U.S. carrying men removed under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798, but the planes landed in El Salvador to take the migrants to the notorious prison CECOT. The judge threatened possible contempt against the Trump administration.The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday again rejected a request from the Trump administration to remove its block on using the Alien Enemies Act over concerns about due process.The Trump administration in March invoked the Alien Enemies Act to apply to Venezuelans 14 and older with suspected gang ties to rapidly deport them, raising concerns about a lack of due process.",,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157
,California,2025-05-21 19:35:35+00:00,CalMatters,Fraud pushes California’s community colleges to consider an application fee. Is it worth it?,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/05/community-colleges-california/,"Faced with increasing financial aid fraud, the board of California’s community colleges is considering ways to charge students an application fee and tighten its identity verification process. Students are pushing back.","In summary
Faced with increasing financial aid fraud, the board of California’s community colleges is considering ways to charge students an application fee and tighten its identity verification process. Students are pushing back. 


Under scrutiny from state and federal lawmakers, California’s community colleges are trying to crack down on financial aid fraud. Scammers have increasingly infiltrated the state’s 116 community colleges, posing as students in an effort to steal financial aid from the state and federal government.   
At a meeting Tuesday, the board that oversees California’s community colleges voted to require all students to verify their identity, which is currently optional for most applicants. The board also considered asking the Legislature for approval to charge students a nominal application fee — which many said should be no more than $10. But after more than two hours of debate, the board rejected that proposal and instead asked staff to “explore” a fee policy.
“Some of you were asking questions, ‘Why is this happening so fast?’” said California Community Colleges Chancellor Sonya Christian. “Because on April 8, CalMatters ran an article that got national press. Guess what happened after that? Nine of our congressional leaders emailed the Secretary of Education of the United States and emailed the Attorney General asking them to start an investigation of the California Community Colleges.”
State representatives from both parties have since called for an audit of the community college system’s financial aid process. Christian said those audits are likely to happen. “We’re on a national stage right now.”
Students from across the state told board members that they were against imposing a fee, sharing stories of times when they were so poor that they didn’t have a bank account or $10 to buy lunch. Many had personal experiences with fake students. 
“A bot once took my seat in a class that I needed to graduate and transfer. That fraud almost cost me my future,” said Flo Cudal, a student at Santiago Canyon College in Orange County. “I understand the need for strong protections, but they must not come at the expense of excluding a real student.”
When Love Adu, a student and board member, tried to enroll at Moorpark College, she said she was unable to verify her identity online, so she had to drive five hours to present her documents in person. Incarcerated students, undocumented students, homeless students and students under 18 all struggle with the current ID verification software, she said. “These proposals would make it harder for students to get the very education that we’re trying to serve to them.”
Application fee delayed
California’s community colleges have a mission to serve every Californian and they’re funded primarily based on the number of students they enroll. When applying, students sign an affidavit affirming that their personal information is true. But besides that, only a few college districts mandate online identity verification. There is no fee to apply to community college and tuition is free for low-income students. Once enrolled, a student can obtain thousands of dollars in financial aid, money that can be used to cover the cost of books, housing, food and transportation. 
That aid has become an easy target for scammers, who often submit dozens or hundreds of applications at a time, using real California addresses and Social Security numbers in order to create fraudulent college accounts. Last month, CalMatters reported that roughly one-third of community college applicants were fake. The state chancellor’s office said it removed all the fraudulent applicants it detected but many scammers evaded detection and stole taxpayer dollars. In the last 12 months alone, colleges have lost more than $10 million in federal aid to fraud and $3 million in state aid, according to state reports, which CalMatters obtained through a public records request.  
Allowing fraud to continue to rise is “irresponsible,” said board member Amy Costa before voting in favor of Christian’s proposal. These “bots” are after government entitlement programs, such as Pell Grants and Cal Grants, and it’s the state’s job to help steward the use of those taxpayer dollars, she said. “We need somebody to say ‘I’m a real person,’ and payment is sort of one of the ways we do that.” 
In the proposal, Christian said her office would consider refunding or crediting the application fee to any student with “a demonstrated financial hardship.” Roughly 40% of California’s community community college students qualify for free tuition because they’re considered low-income, according to state data.
Even if the fee proposal had passed, Christian would still need the Legislature’s approval. It would have taken a year and involved many more discussions, including at the board level, Christian said.
But if lawmakers continue to keep the spotlight on this issue, changes could still happen, said Chris Ferguson, an executive vice chancellor with the state chancellor’s office. “If financial aid fraud were to continue to increase, I assure you, at a certain point, there will be measures, whether it’s at the state level or the federal level, that are implemented on us.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/053023_Community-College-Budget_LJ_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

The committee voted unanimously to advance Bradbury’s nomination for a seat on the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. (Screenshot/Capitol TV)Gov. Dan McKee’s pick to fill the open seat on the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) won easy approval from a Senate panel Tuesday.
The Senate Committee on Commerce’s unanimous vote advances Karen Bradbury’s nomination to the full Senate for a confirmation vote, likely next week, said Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson. If approved, Bradbury, who works as a program administrator for the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, would fill the $139,000-a-year post on the PUC, left vacant after former commissioner John Revens resigned in December.
Bradbury’s experience and leadership in government and energy programs drew praise during the brief Senate panel hearing Tuesday. Supporters spanned her 20-year career in state and federal government work, including 14 years with U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, according to her resume, obtained by Rhode Island Current. She joined the state energy resources office in December 2022, earning $108,900 as legislation and programs administrator. 
Neither Bradbury nor state lawmakers mentioned her marriage to Pat Crowley, president of the influential Rhode Island AFL-CIO. Crowley in an interview Wednesday declined to comment on her appointment. Crowley referred additional questions to McKee’s office.
“Ms. Bradbury’s qualifications spoke for themselves,” Olivia Da Rocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in response to questions Wednesday.
DaRocha did not comment on how many other candidates were considered for the position.
Former colleagues from Providence law firm Duffy & Sweeney Ltd, where Bradbury worked as a paralegal from 2004 to 2008, also spoke and wrote in favor of her nomination to the PUC.
“I’ve known Karen over 20 years,” Jean Harrington, partner at Duffy & Sweeney, told the committee Tuesday. “She has an uncanny ability to enter a chaotic situation, stand back, and say, ‘OK, this is what we need to do.’ She doesn’t get frazzled.”
That calm-under-pressure personality proved particularly important during her two-and-a-half years with the state energy resources office, which included overseeing renewable energy rebates funded through Biden-era congressional spending. Chris Kearns, acting director for the energy resources office and Bradbury’s boss, described her ability to manage abrupt federal funding cuts, grant applications on tight deadlines, and readying fuel supplies with local terminal providers ahead of winter snowstorms.
“Karen has all the personal and professional attributes you would want in a commissioner for the PUC,” Kearns told the Senate committee.
The high-profile appointment to the three-person regulatory body carries extra weight amid rising frustration over utility costs and profits held by Rhode Island Energy. Addressing the panel Tuesday, Bradbury acknowledged the struggles faced by working families and frontline communities while advancing the state’s greenhouse gas emission reductions. 
“If confirmed, it will be my job to ensure all the pieces fit together in a way that is beneficial to ratepayers and businesses,” Bradbury said.
However, she stopped short of making promises on rate cuts when Rhode Island Energy submits its biannual electric rate prices this fall. 
“I don’t want to prejudice any proceeding,” Bradbury said in response to questions by Sen. Victoria Gu, a Westerly Democrat. “I will keep all of that in mind, and look at the evidence presented before the commission.”
The utilities commission by law cannot reject the state utility provider’s proposed supply-side prices, as long as they do not include an extra markup beyond what it costs to purchase power directly from third-party suppliers. However, the commission has more authority over service-side charges and has scaled back Rhode Island Energy’s proposed investments in capital infrastructure projects in acknowledgement of the extra costs to customers.
In announcing Bradbury as his pick to the commission on May 14, McKee touted her experience in state and federal energy policy.
“Karen’s expertise in energy policy, combined with a proven track record of delivering real results for Rhode Island—from securing major federal funding to launching innovative programs—makes her uniquely qualified to take on this role,” McKee said in a statement. “Her commitment to advancing clean, affordable energy will be an asset to the Commission.”
A lifelong Rhode Islander, Bradbury has a bachelor’s degree in political science from Providence College and a master’s degree in labor and industrial relations from the University of Rhode Island.
If confirmed, Bradbury will fill the rest of Revens’ six-year term, which expires March 1, 2027.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Four days before the five-year anniversary of the police murder of George Floyd, the Trump administration’s Department of Justice said it no longer intends to enforce Minneapolis Police Department reforms agreed to by the Biden administration. 
In the aftermath of Floyd’s murder, the Biden-led DOJ spent two years investigating the Minneapolis Police Department. Investigators found that the department routinely deprived people of their rights and discriminated against Black and Native American people. Investigators estimated MPD stopped Black people at 6.5 times the rate at which it stopped white people and Native American people at 7.9 times the rate at which it stopped white people. 
The investigation culminated in an agreement — called a “consent decree” — between the DOJ and the city of Minneapolis on a set of reforms. 
The Trump DOJ’s decision to drop the consent decree — and with it, close supervision of MPD — underscores the administration’s desire to give a freer hand to police. The department is also backing out of a similar decree in Louisville, where police shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her apartment in March 2020.
“The United States no longer believes that the proposed consent decree would be in the public interest,” DOJ attorneys wrote in a two-paragraph motion asking a federal judge to toss out the agreement with the city of Minneapolis. 
For years, Trump has derided efforts to rein in police brutality and scorned the rights of the accused. “(T)he laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years, they’ve been made to protect the criminal … [n]ot the officers,” he said during his first term.
The DOJ’s heel-turn on racial justice in law enforcement is showing up in Minnesota in other ways. 
In early May, the DOJ opened a civil rights investigation into the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office and County Attorney Mary Moriarty, after Moriarty instructed prosecutors to consider the racial identity of defendants when deciding how long of a sentence to ask for. Moriarty said the policy is constitutional and is meant to combat systemic racism in the criminal legal system that leads to longer sentences for Black and Indigenous defendants. 
“As a longtime prosecutor, I firmly believe in the paramount importance of a colorblind criminal justice system,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a news release. “This Department of Justice will avail itself of every tool at its disposal to protect all Americans from illegal DEI discrimination.”
While the federal consent decree is on its way out, a similar agreement at the state level will remain in effect. The state Department of Human Rights also entered into a consent decree with the city in 2023.
The state’s court-enforcable consent decree limits officers’ use of force; requires police to de-escalate; prohibits certain pretextual stops; and restricts the use of chemical irritants and Tasers.
The nonprofit firm Effective Law Enforcement For All, which was hired as an independent monitor, released a semi-annual report this week. The report said progress toward the consent decree’s goals has been steady, if slow at times, the Star Tribune reported. 
Among other provisions, the federal consent decree would have prohibited: 

Handcuffing children under the age of 14. 
The use of neck restraints and choke holds.
The use of some tear gases, including Mace. 
The initiation of foot chases just because a person runs away when they see an officer.
Off-duty jobs for officers who are under investigation or suspended from the force.

It also set guidelines for misconduct investigations, requiring them to be completed within 180 days, with some exceptions. MPD’s disciplinary process had been notoriously slow and ineffective, as the Reformer reported in 2020. 
The DOJ’s investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department revealed systemic problems: racist policing practices; use of excessive force, including against restrained people; failure to address bias; and failure to intervene or investigate when an officer violates the law or department rules. 
The department failed to provide medical aid to people it injured. When police shot a Black man in 2018, officers waited at least 11 minutes — when video of the incident ended — to help him. 
Investigators found that officers fired weapons in situations that posed no threat to their lives. A “significant portion” of the 19 police shootings that occurred between January 2016 and August 2022 were unconstitutional uses of force, according to the DOJ report.
The 17 DFL state lawmakers representing Minneapolis condemned the DOJ’s motion to toss out the consent decree.
“We are deeply disappointed that the federal government is abandoning its responsibility to drive reform at the Minneapolis Police Department,” the Minneapolis delegation said in a joint statement. “For years, Minneapolis community members have spoken out to make their voices heard as part of this process, and now their work and commitment have been disregarded by the federal government.”
The DOJ’s refusal to enforce the consent decree comes as the city of Minneapolis prepares for a potential pardon of Derek Chauvin, the former MPD officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Right-wing figureheads like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Georgia, and commentator Ben Shapiro have asked Trump to pardon Chauvin in recent weeks.
Chauvin was sentenced to 22 ½ years in prison on state murder and manslaughter charges in 2021. The following year, he pleaded guilty to federal charges, and a judge ordered him to serve 21 years in federal prison, concurrent with his state sentence. 
A presidential pardon would only erase the federal charges; Chauvin would then return to state prison to finish his sentence. 
Trump has repeatedly shown a willingness to pardon his political allies or at the behest of his political allies. Among the first acts of his second term was the blanket pardon of some 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters.
Among the injured that day were 140 police officers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P1208011-2048x1365-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar / NC Newsline)Immigrant rights advocates called on a crowd of about 100 to stand up against bills targeting undocumented immigrants in the state as part of an Immigrant Rights Advocacy Day demonstration outside the North Carolina General Assembly Wednesday.
Speakers from the ACLU of North Carolina, the Education Justice Alliance, the Carolina Migrant Network, Muslim Women For, and El Pueblo rallied on the lawn of the Legislative Building and denounced a set of four bills as part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda by lawmakers. After the demonstration, they split up into groups to talk to legislators and leave informational materials with their offices and marched to the Governor’s Mansion to deliver a petition demanding the veto of the bills.
The four bills seek to crack down on undocumented immigrants in a variety of ways: House Bill 318 requires sheriffs cooperate with ICE; Senate Bill 153 does the same for state law enforcement; House Bill 261 increases the felony level of criminal charges against defendants with past immigration-related offenses; and House Bill 690 requires state agencies and universities to vet the immigration status of benefit recipients.
Fernando Martinez, an organizing director with the Education Justice Alliance, urged lawmakers to “stop playing politics with our families.” He denounced North Carolina politicians for “painting us as criminals” who are “invading this country” and stressed that immigrants are neighbors, colleagues, and classmates who make up a fundamental part of the community.
“We go to prayer houses together. We serve and produce food. We are teachers, we are nurses, we are building this state — literally,” Martinez said. “Immigrants belong here, [we] are North Carolinians — and stop pushing us out.”
America Juarez, a coordinator for the Carolina Migrant Network, said families in Charlotte are living in fear of ICE, alleging that agents in unmarked vehicles have been detaining employees at their places of work and children at school in an expansive operation that began May 12. She said her organization has received more than 133 calls for help in just over a week, and warned that provisions in the bills expanding cooperation with ICE would only worsen this crackdown.
“When federal agents in unmarked vehicles and civilian abduct members in our community, our neighbors, our coworkers, our families, it does not make North Carolina safer, it makes us all less safe,” Juarez said. “For our elected officials, your silence is complicit. Will you stand by as children in your district lose their parents?”
Nora Khalifa, an organizer with Muslim Women For, said such “intimidation tactics” have had a tangible impact on her community. She said she’s noticed people who no longer come to worship services out of fear that they might be detained by ICE and has heard from people who avoid public spaces as much as possible for the same reason.
Closing the demonstration, Maria Fernanda Najera-Aguilar of El Pueblo said she prays for the safety of her family and friends every day amid the ongoing mass detention of immigrants, and in particular, last year’s House Bill 10, which required sheriffs to follow ICE detention orders. She urged lawmakers to take a stand for “basic human rights.”
“How can we pursue happiness and achieve aspirations when peace and security are constantly under threat?” she asked. “I stand here today not just to speak, but to remind you that we are watching, we are organizing, and we are not going anywhere.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5211878-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota lawmakers continued meeting mostly behind closed doors Wednesday to come to an agreement on the biggest budget bills to fund state government, including education and health and human services.
Lawmakers have a self-imposed deadline of 5 p.m. Wednesday to finish their work, which they will likely blow through. They are trying to come to an agreement on over a dozen budget and policy bills after the narrowly divided Legislature adjourned Monday.
Gov. Tim Walz has said he will not call legislators back for a special session until all the budget bills are agreed to in the tied 67-67 House and in the Senate, where Democrats have a one seat majority. Only Walz can call lawmakers back into session, but only legislators can adjourn once they’re in session.
Lawmakers are working to pass a $66 billion to $67 billion two-year budget that will fund everything from schools to parks to health care and services for people with disabilities. The state is grappling with a structural deficit that’s arisen from the rapidly increasing costs of special education and caring for an aging population. Given the Republican refusal to agree to any new tax revenue, lawmakers are looking to trim spending.
Most consequentially, Gov. Tim Walz and DFL leaders agreed — at Republicans’ behest — to remove undocumented adults from MinnesotaCare, the state’s subsidized health insurance for the working poor. Children will still be enrolled.
Lawmakers have to pass a budget by June 30 or the government will shut down.
Legislators over the past few days have been meeting in informal “working groups,” which include members of both parties from the House and Senate. If the working groups can’t come to an agreement by Wednesday, legislative leaders and Walz will take over negotiations.
The only working group to meet in public has been taxes; Senate and House members have exchanged several offers. But the working group has frequently adjourned on recesses to consider the offers in private.
Open government advocates have criticized the private nature of the legislative work.
“The public has ZERO way of knowing who to hold accountable,” Common Cause Minnesota wrote on X.
The Star Tribune reported that one of their reporters was kicked out of a working group meeting.
House DFL caucus leader Melissa Hortman told reporters on Monday that negotiations must occur behind closed doors, especially among leadership, so they can speak candidly.
“It just doesn’t work. You need people to be able to say what’s their bottom line and to make their emotional pitch,” Hortman said. “People have to really show their cards, so that is a space that has not ever and probably will not ever be transparent.”
Hortman said that if lawmakers can’t reach a deal by Friday, they will have to work over Memorial Day weekend. The earliest a special session could occur is Friday, she said, though next week is more likely.
Walz said he would like to pass a budget before June 1, because that’s when the state will be obligated to send layoff notices to state employees if there is no budget by then, and leaders want to avoid that.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250507_0817-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 16:06:54.990157

The Indiana Office of Energy Development launched the $182 million federally funded program last week, aimed at reducing utility costs, improving home comfort and boosting energy efficiency for homeowners, tenants, landlords and contractors. 
According to the release, this first-come, first-served program aligns with Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s mission to enhance affordability and promote sustainable living across the state. 
“Cutting energy costs is at the very heart of what we are focused on,” Braun said in the release. “The Indiana Energy Saver Program prioritizes practical solutions to improve energy affordability and deliver quality products.”
Starting this summer, eligible applicants can receive a no-cost energy audit to find potential energy-saving improvements. Following the audit, participants can access two rebate programs: the Home Efficiency Rebate and the Home Appliance Rebate. Each rebate amount depends on household income and project type. 
The HOMES program funds energy efficiency upgrades including insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, and Energy Star-certified heating, cooling, water heaters, appliances and lighting. Low-income households earning less than 80% of the county’s area median income can receive rebates up to 100% of project costs.
The HEAR program targets households earning less than 150% of the area median income. It provides subsidies for energy-efficient appliances and systems such as heat pump water heaters, HVAC systems, clothes dryer, electric stoves, cooktops, ranges, ovens and electrical system enhancements. 
“The Indiana Office of Energy Development is committed to affordable energy solutions to all Hoosiers,” said Jon Ford, executive director of IOED. “The Indiana Energy Saver Program is an important instrument in our all of the above strategy that strengthens our efforts to decrease energy costs and enhance home comfort for consumers.”
The IOED is partnering with Vincent Village, Inc., a Fort Wayne organization that provides housing and supportive services for families experiencing homelessness. Together, they are launching the program’s first pilot project, investing $60,000 to upgrade four homes with energy efficient improvements. 
Hoosiers can learn more about the required documentations needed for the application and apply here.

(AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star) Though there are still funding details to sort out, a slate of proposals brought forward after 1,500 gallons of toxic firefighting foam concentrate spilled in Brunswick last August have been backed by the Maine Legislature. 
“Since August 19, 2024, hardly a day has gone by where our delegation hasn’t put work into an entire suite of legislation both to help Brunswick recover and, even more importantly, to make sure that what happened to us cannot happen anywhere else,” said Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) on the House of Representatives floor earlier this month.
On Wednesday, the Senate passed the last of a package of three bills that Ankeles crafted in the aftermath of the spill to help rid Maine of Aqueous Film Forming Foam, also known as AFFF, which was historically used for firefighting and has been linked to harmful effects to humans and the environment. 
Accidents not waiting to happen

The final proposal to receive initial passage votes would establish a voluntary, statewide takeback program for the foam. The Senate approved LD 222 30-0, and it will now go back to each chamber for final enactment votes. 
AFFF contains perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, which has been linked to serious long-term health problems including cancer. Knowing these concerns, the state restricted use of the foam in 2021, but it is still stored at airports, fire stations and other industrial sites throughout the state.
Ankeles’ bills received sweeping bipartisan support from the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee, as well as the chambers at large. However, two of the bills have been sent to the budget committee to determine whether they will be funded. 
Another bill in the package, LD 407, directs the quasi-governmental agency that manages the airport where the spill happened, called the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, to stop using and get rid of the toxic firefighting foam that is still at the site. Since the bill doesn’t tap into state funds, Ankeles said he’s working with the agency to secure the funding it will need to get rid of the chemicals. 
“Getting this resolve to the chief executive’s desk will help my constituents — and Rep. [Cheryl] Golek’s constituents just a couple of streets over — rest a tiny bit easier knowing that the toxic AFFF will never again be deployed in our community,” Ankeles said last week before the bill received a 128-14 vote in the House.
LD 407 received final enactment votes this week and will be sent to Gov. Janet Mills for her approval. 
Ankeles’ two bills awaiting funding are meant to not only protect Brunswick but all Maine communities from future toxic spills. 
Those two proposals are LD 400, which will create a publicly available inventory of the firefighting foam in the state, and LD 222. These will not only help the state know how much of the toxic foam still exists, but also assist fire departments that don’t have the budgets to properly dispose of it. 
After approval from both chambers, LD 400 was placed on the special appropriations table in late April with a fiscal note of about $86,000 annually for the next two years. That money would be used to cover the cost of a new position to compile the inventory. 
While it is now up to the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, Ankeles said he is hopeful it will get funded after he worked with the Department of Environmental Protection to find a way to fund the proposal without using the state’s general fund. 
With a $5 million fiscal note, LD 222 will likely also end up on the appropriations table. It will first go back to the House for a final enactment vote and then return to the Senate. 
Since the bill asks for one-time funding rather than ongoing support, Ankeles hopes that will put it in a better position to be funded in a tight budget-cycle. However, he said he is also going to advocate for the Environment and Natural Resources Committee to rank LD 222 as the committee’s top priority to receive funding from the budget committee. 
Of all the bills the committee worked on this session that will cost money, Ankeles said this takeback program could have the “biggest impact.” 
“It will create the infrastructure with a single spending action that is not ongoing and the state will be able to get rid of every drop of this terrible poison,” he said.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s strict new law on ballot initiatives faces its first test in court on Thursday when Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker hears arguments about whether to block provisions in HB 1205.
Several groups — including the organization that wants voters to expand Medicaid in the state — have challenged the law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature that was a top priority for Gov. Ron DeSantis. Critics of the new law contend it will make it nearly impossible for outside groups to place initiatives on the ballot.
In filings with federal court in Tallahassee, attorneys for Florida Decides Healthcare asked the court to block a requirement that sponsors deliver completed petitions to the voter’s supervisor of elections office within 10 days after the voter signs the petition. 
Florida Decides and Smart & Safe Florida, the group behind a push to legalize marijuana, also want the court to enjoin the fines for delivering completed petitions late or to the wrong supervisor’s office; signing another person’s name or a fictitious name to any petition, or filling in missing information on a signed petition.
Lastly, the groups are asking the court to enjoin the state from enforcing criminal penalties for violating sections of the law, arguing it is vague and overly broad.
Voters in Florida over the last two decades have passed a number of initiatives that were opposed by GOP legislators, including measures that raised the state’s minimum wage and allowed for the use of medical marijuana. Last November, two initiatives — including one on recreational marijuana and another on abortion — fell just below the 60% margin needed to win.
Lawmakers responded with a bill that completely overhauls the process used to collect signatures.
The first legal skirmish centers on whether to block the law while the underlying court battle moves on.

William H. Stafford III, representing Attorney General James Uthmeier, has countered in his motion to dismiss that plaintiffs lack standing to bring the case because Florida Decides and Smart and Safe wouldn’t be subject to the fines they are seeking to waive.
 “[A]s far as the Secretary and Attorney General can tell, not one of Plaintiffs declarants stated that they have ever signed another person’s name or a fictitious name on a petition, or filled in missing information ‘on a signed petition’ , or ever intend to.”
Stafford argues that the fines are optional and “may” be waived — another reason the groups lack standing, meaning they have a stake in the outcome.
Stafford additionally defended HB 1205.
“Florida’s initiative petition process has a problem. Circulators sometimes forge voters’ signatures on petitions. Sometimes they sign for the deceased. Sometimes they misappropriate voter information. Some commit identity theft,” he wrote. 
“Petition sponsors fail to timely submit completed petitions to supervisors of elections, resulting in thousands of dollars in penalties. And the problems are magnified when petition sponsors use out-of-state petition circulators, contractors, and subcontractors, who lack ties to Florida and don’t respect its law enforcements’ subpoena power.”
Set up to fail
In her response to the state, Matletha Bennette, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center representing Florida Decides, agreed with Stafford one one point: “As defendants say, Florida’s petition process has a problem — namely the State sometimes passes laws illegally restricting it.”
Bennette argued that the state’s position that the group lacks standing is incorrect. “Plaintiffs need not show that they have violated or intend to violate the law, or that it is ‘guaranteed’ that the State will impose penalties,” she wrote.
Additionally, citing the arguments of Smart & Safe in its filing, Bennette argues: “Even if it were logistically possible to consistently comply with the ten-day return rule, it is impossible to do so (a) without incurring significantly greater costs and diverting organizational resources and (b) forgoing quality control measures to guard against HB 1205’s other penalties,” she wrote.
“The First Amendment bars the Hobson’s choice HB 1205 demands: curtail core protected speech in an attempt to comply with the law, and likely fail to collect enough signatures for a successful campaign, or risk criminal liability and severe financial penalties that would bankrupt the organization. Defendants’ suggestion that the State may, in its beneficence, waive penalties it has otherwise assessed does not ‘ameliorate’ Plaintiffs’ harm.”
Florida Decides has been working for more than a year to get its proposed constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid on the statewide ballot in November 2026. 
It filed the underlying lawsuit three days after DeSantis signed the law.
Smart & Safe, the group behind the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational use of cannabis in 2024, is actively working to place another measure on the ballot in 2026 
The new law stems from a January report published by the state’s Office of Election Crimes and Security asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights amendment last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
The bill:

 Prohibits felons, noncitizens, and non-Florida residents from acting as petition circulators.
Requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for petition circulators.
Requires the sponsor to deliver petitions to supervisors of elections in the counties in which the voter resides within 10 days after the voter signs the form.
 And says that anyone who doesn’t register with the state as a signature-gatherer and possesses more than 25 signed petitions beyond their own and immediate family members’ faces a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

As Congress considers a bill backed by President Donald Trump that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid over the next decade, Farmer shared her concerns for Michigan’s Medicaid-funded Home Health program, which has allowed her to care for her son Omar.
Her goal was to help Omar, now 40 years old and living with autism, to live as independently as possible, Farmer said. It took years of patience and love, and he’s learned many life skills to keep him healthy and happy, but Farmer said Omar will always depend on her and without Medicaid, families may not be able to tell their stories of triumph through care.
“Medicaid is part of many of the stories and we cannot allow them to lose their lifeline. To be a home care worker, you must understand and believe that the core that all people deserve, love, respect, dignity, health and opportunity to live their life on their own terms,” Farmer said. “Care is a blessing, not a burden, and we are called to serve others. I wish more people understood, and that I wish more people felt the way that I do.”

On Tuesday, Trump met with U.S. House Republicans, pushing a unified front for a speedy passage of legislation he has called a “big, beautiful bill,”that would, amongst other financial reforms like extending his 2017 tax cuts, axe more than $800 billion in funding, slated to mostly come from Medicaid.
House Speaker Mike Johnson has chosen Memorial Day as the deadline for the House to pass the bill off the floor, but a consensus amongst Republicans hasn’t been reached yet.
Talking to the media Tuesday on Capitol Hill, alongside Michigan U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Bruce Twp.), chair of the House Republican Conference, Trump stumped for his tax bill slamming the few Republicans that haven’t backed the effort, namely Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie.
“We don’t want any waste, fraud or abuse. It’s very simple, waste, fraud, abuse, other than that we’re leaving it, Medicare, we’re leaving it,” Trump said Tuesday.
Medicaid and Medicare are different programs, Michael Daeschlein, Long-Term Care Policy Specialist for Michigan Elder Justice Initiative said on the panel. Daeschlein pointed out Medicare, which provides health insurance for people who are 65 years old or older does not cover the long term care many Michiganders need as senior citizens, whereas Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for individuals with low-incomes, does cover such care.
Michigan has an aging population, Daeschlein said, and many of the direct care worker jobs in the state are remaining open as those in the industry are doing the work of multiple professionals in an “unsustainable” system.

Medicaid covers three in five nursing home residents, or 33,000 Michiganders, Daeschlein said, which is many families’ last option to ensure their loved ones are safe and taken care of.
“It’s important to understand that over 300,000 Michiganders on Medicare rely on Medicaid to pay their out-of-pocket expenses, their co-pays, their deductibles… if it wasn’t for Medicaid, 300,000 people wouldn’t be able to make Medicare work for them,” Daeschlein said.
Cutting Medicaid would perpetuate cycles of addiction and incarceration, working against efforts around the state to help Michiganders heal and contribute in their communities, Nathan Dunbar, a mental health worker with Community Mental Health Authority of Clinton, Eaton, and Ingham Counties said.
By the time someone goes into rehab or goes to prison, they likely don’t have a job anymore and will require Medicaid in order to access recovery resources to get their life back on track, Dunbar said. 
The best available access to treatment is through Medicaid, Dunbar said, adding that private insurance companies don’t “roll the dice” on people who are battling addiction.
“…but those people still need help and those people’s kids still need help,” Dunbar said. “I resent people calling my fellow Michiganders waste, and I resent people calling my fellow Michiganders abuse, and I resent people calling my fellow Michiganders fraud. None of those things are what’s happening. What is happening is our government is being unresponsive to the needs of its people.”

(Jemma Stephenson/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A federal judge said Wednesday she would consider sanctions on attorneys who filed a motion that used artificial intelligence and cited legal authorities that do not exist.
U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco told attorneys representing the state in the lawsuit — claiming corrections officers failed to protect an inmate — that lawyers continue to use artificial intelligence even after other courts have imposed corrective measures throughout the country.
“Generally, this has occurred in other cases where the courts have imposed sanctions and standing orders,” Manasco said during the hearing. “This incident is proof-positive that those sanctions were insufficient. That causes me to consider a fuller range of sanctions.”

Attorneys Matthew Reeves, the attorney who used AI; Bill Lunsford, the attorney overseeing the case, and litigants from Montgomery-based Butler Snow, the firm where Reeves and Lunsford are employed, expressed remorse and publicly apologized to both the plaintiffs and the court regarding the incident.
“I had limited use of artificial intelligence products such as Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel and ChatGTP,” Reeves said to Manasco during the hearing Wednesday. “I first used it related to dietary matters. That is how I started to use it.”
Reeves then said he began querying artificial intelligence to research colleges for his son before applying the technology professionally for research into policies and practices related to different issues. It then culminated in using it to obtain citations for the case.
He said he was aware that using artificial intelligence to obtain citations did not comply with the firm’s policies and that he did not verify the citations during the two instances that he relied on AI for the citations.
Reeves, who according to his LinkedIn profile has been a partner with Butler Snow since April 2023, said Manasco is within her discretion to impose sanctions.
“My only request, since I am the only one responsible, is not to punish my colleagues,” he said.
The incident involves five citations that Manasco characterized as “hallucinated” across two documents filed with the court. The court was made aware of the fabricated citations after the attorneys for Frankie Johnson, the plaintiff in the case, filed a document to oppose the state’s request to have their client available to give testimony on a certain date.
“As discussed below, Defendant has cited no legitimate authority to support his proposition that ordering a deposition before an anticipated document production is appropriate,” the filing said. “Instead, Defendant appears to have wholly invented case citations in his Motion for Leave, possibly through the use of generative artificial intelligence.”
Lunsford and Butler Snow have been awarded millions of dollars to represent the Alabama Department of Corrections in cases alleging abuse within Alabama’s prison facilities.
In December 2024, the Contract Review Committee approved contracts totaling $4.8 million to Lunsford and Butler Snow. The committee had previously approved $14.9 million in July 2023 and another $7.68 million in June of that same year.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

Manasco listed several possible consequences, from continuing education seminars and fines to referrals to the Alabama State Bar or even temporary suspensions.
Johnson, currently incarcerated at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer, said in the lawsuit that he was attacked by as many as 13 people and stabbed at least nine times in the prison in December 2019. Johnson said that despite the attack, staff at the prison failed to properly protect him afterward.
“As a consequence of their individual and collective failure, on or about March 5, 2020, while restrained in shackles and handcuffs during a therapy session, Mr. Johnson was stabbed repeatedly by another prisoner at Donaldson,” the lawsuit states.
The attorneys for ADOC filed a motion to compel Johnson to testify the week of June 3. Johnson’s attorneys said that they would not have enough time to prepare their client to give testimony.
In response, Reeves and Lunsford filed another document stating that other courts have required people who are incarcerated to give their testimony during a deposition when they are given the appropriate notice, which they argue was done in this case.
“Defendant bolstered this assertion with a lengthy string citation of legal authority and parentheticals that appeared to support Defendant’s proposition,” Johnson’s attorneys said. “But the entire string citation appears to have been made up out of whole cloth.”
Johnson’s attorneys noted four of the citations in the ADOC filing. One included an appropriate case but was not relevant to the issue that Reeves and Lunsford claimed in the document they filed.
A second case, Kelley v. City of Birmingham, was said to be decided in the U.S. Northern District of Alabama in 2021, when it was actually a Alabama state case from 1939. Two other citations referred to cases that did not exist.
Attorneys for Johnson began to review other documents that Lunsford and Reeves filed with the court in the case.
They then found another citation that was fabricated in a different document in which “Plaintiff’s counsel found a string of similarly named opinions, none of them stood for the proposition Defendant represented, and Plaintiff’s counsel could not identify any case using the citation Defendant provided,” Johnson’s attorneys said in their filing.
The plaintiffs in the case agreed to allow Reeves to refile the document to have Johnson testify by the original date that he and Lunsford requested, but this time with the appropriate citations.
Manasco will allow the leadership at the Butler Snow law firm another 10 days to review its policies and practices pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence before considering the matter further.

Jane Raybould of Lincoln talks with State Sen.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A week after the procedural failure of a proposal to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases, Nebraska lawmakers on Thursday will reconsider the final vote.
If the bill’s previous supporters hold, the measure would have enough support to pass. State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, a freshman lawmaker, missed the final vote to pass Legislative Bill 258, from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. 
That’s because the vote came up about two hours earlier than expected after lead opponent State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln realized Sorrentino’s absence and changed tactics. 
The bill failed 31-17. Amending a law that voters enact requires at least 33 votes. LB 258 would make annual bumps to the minimum wage smaller and more predictable, supporters say, and create carveouts to pay teen workers less.

One listed “no” vote, State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, supported the bill originally but tried to sit out the vote to let lawmakers reconsider the vote. He was marked as a “no” vote under a rule change in January. A reconsideration motion requires a senator on the “prevailing” side to want to change a vote, or the requesting senator must have missed the vote.
Sorrentino missed last Wednesday’s vote, because he was escorting colleagues he met through business to a meeting across the street. Of opponents who consider the issue decided, Sorrentino said, “We all have to learn the rules of the Legislature.”
Multiple senators said such a reconsideration motion on a bill from final reading, while likely allowed under the legislative rules, hadn’t been used since 1984.
The effort could ignite a rules fight over whether the reconsideration should be allowed.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista confirmed this week that a reconsideration motion would come Thursday, though he said he couldn’t say when. The Legislature will take up either Ballard’s motion or a new reconsideration motion Sorrentino filed Tuesday, the final day he could do so under the Legislature’s rules. At least 30 senators must agree to reconsider.
Asked to comment on the reconsideration, Raybould said, “No.” 
She said a reporter should ask Conrad for comment, who Raybould said was already discussing the motion. Last week, she said she thought Democratic-aligned lawmakers were acting in “goodwill,” because they knew Raybould had the votes.

The fight has been personal for Raybould, a longtime grocery store executive, who views the legislation as creating a “balance” that progressives, including Conrad, have rejected.
“I have never seen such a blatant, bald-faced, self-serving, self-dealing, selfish, unethical example of self-dealing as this bill in the Legislature,” State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said during an April 1 debate.
Sorrentino, a former business owner, said he’s personally not in favor of a legislated minimum wage, describing himself as a “true fan of supply and demand.” He said the market is a better indicator.
Sorrentino said it’s not a vote about “putting people in poverty, because frankly, I’ve seen cases where minimum wage is never going to fly, it’s way too low.”
LB 258 is Raybould’s 2025 priority bill. She is the lone Democrat in favor of LB 258 as well as a separate LB 415 to weaken a voter-approved paid sick leave framework that takes effect Oct. 1, after 2024 passage. Republican State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont opposes LB 258 and the current version of LB 415. There are 33 Republicans in the officially nonpartisan body.
There were some initial conversations about attaching LB 258 to LB 415. That approach heightens the risk that voters could repeal the legislative changes and go back to the voter-approved language, which some advocates have discussed as a response to LB 415.






What LB 258 would do
Legislative Bill 258, related to the state minimum wage, would remove inflationary bumps after the base wage rises to $15 on Jan. 1, which voters approved in 2022. Future increases would be fixed at a 1.75% annual rate beginning in 2026. That was a deal struck between State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, the sponsor, and Stan Clouse of Kearney to provide “certainty.”
Average inflation, as calculated by the ballot measure’s current language, was 2.6% last year and 4.18% for the past five years. Over the past 10 years, inflation was 2.63%. And over the past 25 years, it was 2.39%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Midwest.
LB 258 would also create a “youth minimum wage” for workers aged 14 or 15. Beginning next year, those young workers could be paid $13.50 (the current minimum wage), which would increase by 1.5% every five years, beginning in 2030.
The youth minimum wage would stay below $15 — the floor that voters created for all workers beginning Jan. 1 — until 2065 under LB 258, according to a Nebraska Examiner analysis.
Teen workers aged 16 to 19 could still be paid a “training wage,” which would no longer apply to 14 or 15 year olds with the creation of the “youth minimum wage.” The training wage allows employers to pay teen workers a lower rate for up to the first 90 days of employment.
Current law allows the training wage to be 75% of the federal minimum wage, so as low as $5.44. LB 258 would increase the training wage to $13.50 beginning in September. The amended training wage would rise by 1.5% annually beginning in 2027.

The Brownfields Grants will use funding from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and are meant to help remediate sites and prepare them for redevelopment and safe use.
“Redevelopment of Brownfields properties is often an insurmountable challenge for many communities, which may lack the resources to assess and clean up these contaminated properties,” Tracie White, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division director, said in a statement. “The award of EPA Brownfields funds is an exciting opportunity for the recipient communities, allowing them to return blighted properties to productive use and provide community benefits.”

The largest share of funding, at $4 million, will go toward cleaning asbestos contamination at the Sunset Park Apartments in Denver. The building has 242 units for people 62 years and older and people with disabilities. It is owned by the Volunteers of America.
The City of Fountain will get about $2 million to complete asbestos abatement on a 9-acre site that the city wants to redevelop into a community center, multifamily housing, outdoor recreation space and offices for medical services and childcare.
About $1.9 million will go to treat asbestos contamination at the 142-year-old Jaffa Opera House in Trinidad. Cañon City will receive about $1.5 million for two contaminated sites, including a former dry-cleaning business contaminated with tetrachloroethylene and a previous steel manufacturing site that is contaminated with heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which can cause health problems like cancer and kidney damage.
The other grants will go to the Cortez Municipal Airport and two buildings in Lamar.
CDPHE will also get $1 million for its revolving loan funds, which finance environmental cleanup activities.
“This Brownfields grant funding is a smart investment in Colorado’s future — cleaning up historic contamination while laying the groundwork for economic growth,” EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western said in a statement. “By empowering communities to turn abandoned properties into productive assets, we’re strengthening local economies and ensuring clean land for generations to come.”
Colorado’s grants are part of about $224 million of awards throughout the country.

(Screenshot via YouTube)Kentucky Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman joined some of his counterparts from other states at the U.S. border with Mexico Wednesday to back Trump administration efforts to bolster security at the site. 
In a press conference live streamed by the Republican Attorneys General Association, Coleman said the attorneys general heard in an earlier briefing that during the Biden administration, the border had an average of 1,500 illegal crossings a day, now down to an average of four a day — the result, Coleman said, of “solid leadership” by President Donald Trump. 
Coleman pointed to Trump administration efforts to tackle smuggling illegal drugs like fentanyl across the border and thanked border agents for their work. In 2024, 1,410 Kentuckians died from a drug overdose, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report. While that report found Kentucky’s overdose deaths have declined over the last three years, the state still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder in the United States. 
“The lack of border security has resulted in empty chairs at kitchen tables, empty seats at pews and workers not clocking in in the Commonwealth of Kentucky,” Coleman said. 
Ahead of the press conference, Coleman said in a post on X that he and the other attorneys general are joining Trump “to secure the southwest border and keep deadly drugs and violent criminals out of Kentucky.” 
Coleman led a coalition of attorneys general earlier this year asking Trump administration officials via a letter for greater scrutiny of an import pilot program, Entry Type 86. It allows small packages to enter the U.S. with minimal customs screening. A press release from Coleman’s office argued the program could be “used by adversaries and drug traffickers to flood deadly fentanyl into the United States.” 
The Republican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA, backs Republican attorneys general candidates across the country. 
Coleman, who was elected as Kentucky’s attorney general in 2023, ran on national issues like securing the southwest border. Last year, he was among Republican attorneys general and Kentucky politicians voicing solidarity with Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott against the Biden administration over blocking U.S. Border Patrol access to part of the border with Mexico. This year, Coleman joined other Republican attorneys general in court to back the Trump administration’s efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants.

The provision, part of Senate Bill 639, would remove responsibility from pesticide manufacturers and sellers to disclose a product’s risks as long as the pesticide container bears a label indicating that it has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
The bill’s language would also remove the ability of individuals and families harmed by pesticide exposure to seek justice in court, according to Toxic Free NC.
“This is a direct attack on our community’s right to hold chemical manufacturers accountable for the harm they cause,” Toxic Free NC Policy Manager Kendall Wimberley said. “This is not something communities are asking for.”
Bayer, a Triangle-based global pesticide manufacturer, has supported the language in the bill as it has moved through several committees in the North Carolina Senate. The bill was withdrawn from the chamber’s floor and referred to the Senate Rules Committee last week.
Similar bills have been introduced in other states. Eight have failed thus far in 2025 — in Iowa, Tennessee, Florida, Wyoming, Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Idaho — although North Dakota and Georgia passed their versions of the legislation.
In Iowa, critics branded the proposal as the “Cancer Gag Act” due to the dangers it allegedly posed.
“Evidence presented in the courts is showing that Bayer has failed to warn consumers about the harms of their products,” Wimberley said. “They are facing billions of dollars in settlement lawsuits, and they are now spending millions of dollars lobbying efforts to try to stop that.”
Section 19 would shield pesticide companies from responsibility even when their products pose high risks for cancer, brain damage, infertility, or developmental harm in children, according to Wimberley, as these specific health risks are not required to be included on pesticide labels.
The North Carolina Farm Act has come under fire for another portion of the bill as well. About 100 activists gathered in Raleigh at the start of the month to advocate against banning raw milk sales as the bill was heard before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Delaware drivers can now support animal welfare while on the road, thanks to a newly released specialty license plate unveiled by the state’s Office of Animal Welfare (OAW).
The Animal Welfare License Plate, now available through the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), is designed to raise funds for initiatives that promote the health and safety of companion animals throughout the state.
Featuring vibrant illustrations of animals set against a scenic backdrop, the plate allows residents to show their support for animal welfare in a visible and meaningful way.

“This initiative not only shows OAW’s commitment to animal welfare but also provides a unique way for residents to drive with a purpose and support the cause,” said Christina Motoyoshi, director of OAW. “We are looking forward to seeing the community embrace this opportunity to make a difference.”
The plate costs $50, with $35 from each sale directed to the State Spay Neuter Fund.
The fund supports efforts to reduce animal homelessness by making spay and neuter services more accessible.
“Spaying and neutering are the most effective and humane ways to control pet populations, but the services can be out of reach for some pet owners,” said Joanna Miller, deputy director of OAW. “Revenue is used to provide spay and neuter surgeries for low-income pet owners, community cat programs, and to supplement spay and neuter funds for Delaware shelters and rescues.”

Homanit announced Wednesday it will build its first United States manufacturing facility on 140 acres near the small community of Alcolu — population 425.
The company pledged to employ 300 people in the area located off Interstate 95, about 40 miles north of its intersection with I-26.
“This investment marks a significant milestone for our company, and we’re proud to become part of such a vibrant and forward-looking region,” Homanit Managing Director Fritz Homann said in a statement. “The area’s skilled workforce, strategic location and strong infrastructure make Clarendon County the ideal foundation for our next phase of growth in North America.”
The announcement marks the largest in Clarendon County economic development history, according to Central SC Alliance President Jason Giulietti.
“Homanit’s announcement to establish such a large operation in Clarendon County represents a tremendous vote of confidence in our state’s forestry and manufacturing industries,” Secretary of Commerce Harry Lightsey said in a statement. “This significant $250 million investment and the opportunities it brings to a rural area will have a lasting impact.”

When it begins operations in 2028, Homanit will make wood paneling for furniture, vehicles and doors. It’s product line is of particular importance to a state timber industry that has been struggling amid closures of major paper mills.
“Homanit’s sizable investment — the largest forest products manufacturing announcement in the state in more than three years — is welcome news, particularly for our pine pulpwood markets,” State Forester Scott Phillips said in a statement.
The company currently operates production facilities in Germany, Lithuania and Poland.
In exchange for Homanit’s investment, Clarendon County officials approved a deal offering the company a reduced property tax rate of 4% for 40 years.
By state law, manufacturers without such an arrangement pay a 6% rate. (Industrial property owners previously paid a 10.5% rate, but state laws passed in 2017 and 2022 effectively lowered it to 6%.)
Clarendon County Council also approved $2.1 million in grants and $2.2 million in reimbursements for the company.  And the state approved the company for income tax credits worth $20,250 per each new job.
“The economic impact of a project of this magnitude will be felt throughout our community for generations to come,” Clarendon County Council Chairman John Johnson III said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wood-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 15:08:09.376083

Emanuel Cleaver speaks at Uptown Theater on Nov. 8, 2016 Kansas City (Photo by Whitney Curtis/Getty Images).Missouri’s Democratic members of Congress decried the proposed GOP cuts to Medicaid in a press briefing Wednesday, calling the move a handout to the rich that would harm the state’s most vulnerable. 
The U.S. House is debating a massive reconciliation package that, as written now, would slash roughly $800 billion from Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions, and $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who represents a district which includes Kansas City, said the proposed changes would have “disastrous consequences” in Missouri, where Medicaid access can be a “matter of life or death” for millions of enrollees.
“It will lead to sicker and more pain-filled communities. It will be a massive economic weight holding down Missouri families and small businesses alike, as more of our neighbors are stricken with increased medical debt,” Cleaver said.
The Congressional Budget Office found the House’s plan would result in the lowest-earning households seeing resources decrease while the highest-earners gain.
One in five Missourians is on Medicaid, or over 1.2 million people. Missouri’s Medicaid program covers 39% of all children in the state and pays for two-thirds of nursing home care.
Congressman Wesley Bell, a Democrat who represents the district including St. Louis, said Medicaid cuts would cause people to delay care.
“Medicaid serves as a stabilizing force for entire communities, and when it’s cut, the consequences show up everywhere, from overcrowded ERs to delayed treatment and preventable illness,” Bell said. “And when those folks don’t have access to quality health care and preventative medicine, they go to the ER so we’re going to pay for it one way or the other.”
  U.S. Rep. Wesley Bell speaks Weds May 21, 2025 at a virtual press conference about Medicaid cuts (screenshot).
The GOP budget includes adding work requirements and other changes to Medicaid that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would boot millions nationally from the rolls. 
In Missouri, work requirements alone could kick over 90,000 people off the rolls, many of whom would be working or eligible for an exception but get caught up in red tape. The changes taken together, including proposed increased eligibility checks and limitations on state-levied provider taxes, could remove around 166,000 people from the rolls in Missouri, a KFF analysis found. 
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has been a rare Republican voice against Medicaid cuts, calling them morally and politically wrong.
“Far be it for me to agree with Senator Hawley, but his point is well taken,” Bell said. “This is a slap in the face. It is an attack on working class families.”
The bill is still being hashed out. It would also cut billions from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides food aid to low-income people and families.
“We all know what’s at stake,” Bell said. “We all know the folks who are at stake are some of our most vulnerable folks, seniors, children, working families. So we hope and expect that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle do the right thing.”

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Republican Party has decided not to pursue any post-trial motions or appeals of a civil defamation case that awarded a former GOP legislative candidate $500,000 in damages.
The state party lost a lawsuit that awarded former candidate Janet Palmtag of Nebraska City damages for the impact on her business and personal life from mailers a jury determined had crossed the line. The mailers had claimed she “broke the law” and “lost” her real estate license and was unfit to become a state senator.
“Although neither my immediate predecessor, Chairman Eric Underwood, nor I was involved in the 2020 actions that led to Janet Palmtag’s civil lawsuit and subsequent judgment,” Nebraska GOP Chair Mary Jane Truemper said. “We are both, nonetheless, sympathetic to the harm it caused her.” 
The decision effectively ended neatly a decade-long legal battle between the state GOP and Palmtag, a long-time GOP volunteer. The former party leadership has said it based the mailer’s claims on a 2017 case before the Iowa Real Estate Commission in which Palmtag, the owner of a real estate firm operating in Nebraska, Missouri, and Iowa, agreed to pay a $500 fine on behalf of her firm to resolve a mistake made by one of its agents. At the time, as Palmtag testified, the agent was gravely ill and had failed to obtain all the signatures necessary to transfer an earnest deposit for the sale of a home in Iowa.

Truemper recently became state GOP chair after Underwood decided not to seek reelection. Underwood and a group of populist Republicans, with old-guard help, took over in 2022 from a party leadership team loyal to then-Gov. Pete Ricketts. 
It was the Ricketts-favored team who made the decision to attack Palmtag, who in 2020 ran against a Ricketts appointee, former State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar. Palmtag was backed by former Gov. Dave Heineman and other prominent members of the party, including former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb.
Palmtag lost to Slama in the GOP-on-GOP race. But the party’s decision to take sides in the race upset some Republicans.
After the verdict, Palmtag’s attorney said he hoped the decision would serve as a warning to political consultants, professionals and candidates about the claims they make in campaigns.
“We cannot have ‘our facts.’ Facts are facts — not yours or mine,” Palmtag’s attorney David Domina said, “It is long past time for our discourse to return to this essential home base.”
Truemper said the party’s apology may not be satisfactory to Palmtag, but she hopes she knows the party wishes “for her healing and peace as she moves forward.”

Meerman is the sponsor of legislation to get rid of Michigan's one-man grand jury process.  | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsA Republican lawmaker is trying to strike the state’s one-man grand jury process from law, a move that would prevent local prosecutors and the Department of Attorney General from bringing criminal charges against defendants with just one judge as the sole juror.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Luke Meerman (R-Coopersville), would repeal several sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure allowing just one judge to review evidence and greenlight charges as a grand juror.
The process was ruled unconstitutional by the Michigan Supreme Court during the failed Flint water criminal prosecution against former Governor Rick Snyder and several other members of his administration. 
The court specifically called out the prosecutorial team – led by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy and former Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud – for engaging in a type of “Star Chamber,” a reference to the corrupt backroom English courts of the late 15th Century. That doomed the prosecution and the court eventually dismissed the charges. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Meerman’s bill was up for testimony on Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee. He said the grand jury was a hallmark of the judicial process, one that helps decide probable cause of a crime, but the difference with a one-man grand jury is that it is not composed of several citizens or local officials, but rather one judge.
“A one-man grand jury violates due process, as evidence in these proceedings is not made available to the defense,” Meerman said, who also claimed that Michigan was one of the only states that maintains a one-man grand jury process under law. “The use of this legal maneuver erodes public trust and confidence in the impartiality of the justice system.”
Touching on the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling, Meerman said the main takeaway was that a single judge cannot currently issue an indictment authorizing charges against a defendant. His bill would remove the portion of the criminal code that allows for a one-man grand jury, preventing it from being reactivated if the high court somehow overturns its precedent founded in the Flint water cases. Laws that remain on the books even though there is a court precedent deeming them unconstitutional or void are sometimes referred to as zombie laws.
Rep. Brian BeGole (R-Perry) and Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) both asked how often this process was used and in what kinds of cases, and how widely it was utilized by prosecutors across the state.
Meerman indicated that it happens infrequently. Although prosecutors did not give testimony before the committee on Wednesday, Meerman said it was his understanding through conversations with prosecutors that they would still like to keep it in their tool box, even though those prosecutors couldn’t use it anyway, given the Supreme Court’s ruling in 2022.
Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said it was her understanding that the process was mostly used in sensitive felony cases.
Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan said it supported the bill but did not wish to speak during committee.
A spokesperson for the Prosecuting Attorneys Association of Michigan told Michigan Advance that it does not have a stance on the bill, and that the only county that had been using the law in any capacity was Wayne County.
As it stands, it does not appear that the bill is a priority for PAAM to weigh in on, support or oppose.
A spokesperson with Worthy’s office deferred comment on the bill to PAAM. The office did not respond to additional questions posed by Michigan Advance regarding how often the county used the process prior to the Supreme Court’s ruling or how difficult it is for the county to navigate complex cases without the use of a one-man grand jury.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Facetune_11-12-2024-06-07-25-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 14:11:36.981093

Brad Little is among 20 Republican governors who have sent a letter to President Donald Trump expressing support for his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill that’s been held up as U.S. House Republicans continue to fight over it.
“As Republican Governors, we stand UNITED in strong support of your One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” the governors wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. “This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival.”
They added that the bill “truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”

The massive, 1,116-page bill package includes sweeping tax breaks and controversial cuts of more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health program for low-income individuals and those with disabilities. However, negotiations continue over the bill and it’s not yet clear whether it has the support it needs from the U.S. House Republicans’ slim majority.
Earlier Tuesday, Republicans who have yet to rally behind the bill huddled in Speaker Mike Johnson’s office to hash out agreements on Medicaid and other outstanding issues. Johnson said he hopes to pass the legislation this week, though he didn’t appear to have the votes as of Tuesday afternoon.
Even as the bill remains snagged, Republican governors signaled to the president that he has their support, writing “after four long years of tremendous hardship under President Joe Biden and (Vice President) Kamala Harris, the American people cannot wait any longer for Congress to enact the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”
“The American people have witnessed the tireless work undertaken by you and your administration to reverse the disastrous consequences of President Biden’s failed and often illegal policies,” the governors’ letter says. “You have demonstrated a commitment to using every ounce of Executive authority available to reinstitute fiscal sanity, fight the deep state, secure our borders, and achieve energy dominance.”
Little and other governors also called on Congress to act to “fully and permanently implement” Trump’s “America First agenda.”
“Thankfully, your One, Big, Beautiful Bill would accomplish this,” their letter continues. “It would provide you with the resources you need to permanently secure the border, remove barriers needed to truly unleash American energy production, protect Americans by making a once-in-a-lifetime investment in military technology that once seemed like science fiction, give working class families tax cuts worth thousands of dollars each, and ensure your administration has the tools needed to deport illegal alien murders (sic) and rapists.”
They concluded their letter saying they agree that Republicans must “UNIFY around this unprecedented piece of conservative legislation.” They added that “we cannot miss this chance to save taxpayers $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.”
“We stand by your side and will support you in any way to ensure this necessary piece of legislation is enacted,” the governors wrote.
The 20 governors who signed the letter include:

(Photo provided by ND Game and Fish Department)A North Dakota wildlife group is worried federal funding cuts could affect a renowned wildlife research center at Jamestown and is urging people to contact Congress.
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, which is facing a recommended $564 million budget cut proposed by the Trump administration. A May 2 letter from Russell Vought, director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, says some cuts are aimed at programs that “focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change).”
John Bradley, executive director of the North Dakota Wildlife Federation, said with those cuts, it would be “miraculous” if the center was able to stay open. 
Bradley put out a call last week for conservation groups to contact members of Congress to maintain funding for the research center. 
“There’s probably cuts that do need to happen to rein in the federal budget, but doing so with kind of a shotgun approach isn’t the best way forward,” Bradley said. 
Gary Krapu, a retired researcher who still has an office at the research center, said the downsizing has already started. 
“A number of people have already left,” Krapu said. 
Krapu said the Trump administration had offered research center staff an incentive to leave and administrators have warned of layoffs.

The U.S. Geological Survey falls under the Department of the Interior. A U.S. House Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday questioned the deep cuts proposed for the Interior department and told Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that Congress would likely provide more funding than the Trump administration requested.
Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said the proposed budget cut “eviscerates” the U.S. Geological Survey. 
“Without these programs at USGS, our communities will be left vulnerable to natural disasters and deprived of the scientific data that guides responsible land management,” Pingree said.
A statement from the office of Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the Department of the Interior, “is evaluating their facility options and no budget decisions have been made at this point regarding staffing or funding.”
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center first opened in 1965, focusing mainly on migratory waterfowl. 
Its research has helped set hunting regulations, helped guide conservation groups on where to focus their efforts and protected habitat for bird species such as the sandhill crane. 
Krapu said federal funding has ranged between $7 million and $10 million in recent years, with partner organizations such as conservation groups also funding projects. 
While its staff of about 40 employees is based in Jamestown, its research has stretched from Mexico into the Arctic. 
The center’s early research focused on migratory waterfowl, but it diversified over the years to studying wolves, pollinators and invasive species. 
The Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center referred questions to the Geological Survey, which said questions about the center’s budget would have to be answered by the Office of Management and Budget. The OMB did not reply to an emailed request for budget information. 
U.S. House spending panel indicates it will boost Interior funding above Trump request

Dave Brandt is a North Dakota Wildlife Federation board member who retired from the research center last year. 
Brandt said Jamestown would feel the impact of closing the research center. 
“It’s a huge economic driver for the community there,” Brandt said.
Brandt started at Northern Prairie by taking a seasonal position in 1990.
“Northern Prairie was world renowned for its waterfowl biology,” Brandt said.
Krapu is holding out hope for Northern Prairie, where he worked for more than 40 years before retiring in 2012. He said he still has data to enter on sandhill crane research in Russia. 
If the center does close, it’s Krapu’s hope that it is only temporary. 
“It’s a very unfortunate situation that’s developed, but there’s a lot of other federal workers in the country that are facing the same kinds of problems,” he said.

School of Social Work Director Johanna Thomas will lead a team of UA experts who will create the hub, which will serve Arkansans with behavioral health needs. 
“Currently, Arkansas does not have a coordinated statewide system of crisis care to address behavioral health needs for children and adults to this extent,” Thomas said. “What we’re creating together begins with prevention and early intervention, and then focuses on crisis intervention and guidance to follow up with treatment available for those who need it.”

Thomas and her team will partner with DHS to coordinate the program and determine subgrants. They’ll also implement DHS’ strategic plan for statewide prevention, early intervention and crisis services, with an emphasis on infant mental health, school-based behavioral health and mental health, and substance abuse treatment for adults, with a focus on pregnant and postpartum women, according to the release. 
The UA team will also design a “unified crisis hub model” for the state in collaboration with DHS, schools, community stakeholders and partner agencies.
“Mental health and addiction are statewide issues — so our response has to be statewide too,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “Through programs like the new crisis hub, we can address both adults’ and children’s needs early and often. These challenges aren’t unique to Arkansas, but we do have a unique opportunity to address them collaboratively to prevent and treat all Arkansans.”
Seven areas of the state will serve as pilot sites for the crisis care continuum, which officials expect will allow for unique specializations within each region, the release states.
“This work will address gaps in our system and ensure that services are available both to prevent situations from escalating to crisis level and to support Arkansans in need in times of crisis,” said Paula Stone, director of the DHS Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health.

(Getty Images)I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about why Democratic politicians struggle so much to connect with working-class voters. That’s for the party leaders and candidates to figure out. But it’s entirely possible that Fyodor Dostoyevsky partially diagnosed the problem almost 150 years ago, when he wrote in “The Brothers Karamazov”: “The more I love humanity in general, the less I love man in particular.”
Recent Republican success winning over the working class is a little easier to understand considering America’s Puritan roots. The right has long made political hay by convincing millions of voters that the degradation of society is most evident not in corrupt fiscal policies but in expressions of human sexuality. Every legislative session has its examples, and this year one of them is a book banning bill now headed to the governor’s desk.
House Bill 324 is touted by conservatives as “parental rights” legislation meant to keep certain books out of the hands of impressionable young people. It reads: “This bill prohibits material that is obscene or harmful to minors in schools and creates a procedure for removal and cause of action.”
“Obscene,” of course, always refers to sexuality and not the cherished Americana of extreme violence. And, importantly, it does not encompass the most glaring national obscenity: economic inequality. 
Whether or not you buy the Republican argument that HB 324 targets only “flat-out pornography” in schools — which seems unlikely because that’s already covered under New Hampshire’s existing obscenity laws — author Jodi Picoult is correct in her assessment of the bill’s true intent and the price we all pay for censorship: “These parents will tell you that the books are exposing kids to topics that are salacious or revolutionary. What kids are really being exposed to are lives and mindsets different from their own, which creates compassion and empathy.”
The bottom line is that what Republican New Hampshire lawmakers — and many conservative parents — don’t like is LGBTQ themes in literature. Why? Because they are convinced that the four horsemen of the American apocalypse will ride into town dressed in drag. But the riders they should worry about have always been with us, gulping the rarefied air of Pullman palace cars and private jet cabins.
The American right’s fixation on sexuality is bad enough on its own, but it is downright confounding when coupled with Republican-backed efforts that exacerbate economic inequality. Only one of those things is an existential threat to the American experiment, and I promise you it’s not Picoult’s “Nineteen Minutes.”
HB 324 is an unnecessary bill that exists only to scratch the Republican itch to crush content it deems symbolic of Western decline. But the real threats to society are found elsewhere.
For example, consider New Hampshire Republicans’ myopic repeal of the Interest and Dividends Tax, an action undertaken in service to the state’s economic elite. That move should be constantly discussed and dissected in this state, especially now as lawmakers work at cutting hundreds of millions from the next state budget. But conservatives would rather fish in libraries for words and themes to be offended by. Meanwhile, those with the least in New Hampshire are on the threshold of fresh harm from the right’s cold budget priorities.
If you want more evidence of this dynamic, consider the “big beautiful bill” now in the works in Washington, D.C. Once again, a few will win and the struggling many will lose. But the trick to sneaking garbage like that through is to make people look for threats in the wrong places. Immigrants, diversity programs, books with titles like “Gender Queer.” Republican voters are made to believe that those are the issues pulling at America’s seams and not the obvious culprit: the 1 percent’s scorched-earth pursuit of limitless wealth. 
Riding shotgun with all of this is the rot of hypocrisy. The far right now dominating the American Republican Party is selling an idea of liberty that in practice amounts to unfettered freedom but only for the like-minded. That is why the party so consistently defends bigots and punches down on the vulnerable. You can see evidence of this in the always-uneven Republican application of “local control.” How is HB 324 in alignment with local control? How are any of the laws targeting transgender rights in alignment?
Well, they’re not, because “local control” isn’t a Republican principle. It’s a label applied or removed as a matter of philosophical convenience.
The New Hampshire Legislature’s latest go at book banning is unsurprising, considering the puritanical forces as old as the nation itself that continue to influence conservative ideology. But if they’re as concerned about the degradation of society as they say, one can only hope that they’ll realize before it’s too late that the call is coming from inside their house.

U.S. District Judge Susan P. Watters presided over both cases.
Renee Esperanza Arambula, 27, of Billings pleaded guilty in November to possession with intent to distribute fentanyl and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.
According to a Tuesday U.S Attorney’s office press release, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency began investigating Arambula for suspected drug trafficking in 2023. Agents discovered through financial documents that between May 2020 and January 2023, Arambula deposited more than $230,000 of cash into a bank and received thousands more through electronic payments, but was making only a fraction of that through formal employment income.
Based on financial analysis, witness interview, surveillance and other investigations, the DEA learned Arambula was trafficking fentanyl and other drugs around Billings, with several individuals admitting to purchasing drugs from her.
According to statements made at the sentencing hearing and in court documents, in January 2023, Arambula used a firearm to shoot two unarmed men while trafficking, shooting one in the neck and leaving him a partially paralyzed, and shooting the second in the abdomen. Law enforcement recovered fentanyl pills and a firearm in Arambula’s possession.
The investigation was conducted by the DEA and Billings Police Department.
Livingston resident Jennifer Michelle Hall, 44, pleaded guilty in January 2025 to possession with intent to distribute meth and prohibited possession of a firearm.
The government alleged in court documents that Montana law enforcement had identified Hall as someone selling methamphetamine for “more serious distributors” in the Livingston area.
In December 2021, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Hall’s residence and recovered methamphetamine, fentanyl pills and a semi-automatic pistol. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also recovered Halls’ phone and iPad.
In an interview with law enforcement, Hall admitted to possessing the meth and firearm, but denied she was selling drugs.
However, text messages on Hall’s electronics, obtained through search warrants, showed Hall was both using and selling drugs.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Godfrey prosecuted the case. The investigation was conducted by the ATF and Park County Sheriff’s Office.

Delaware hunters achieved a historic milestone during the 2024-25 hunting season, setting new state records for both wild turkey and white-tailed deer harvests, the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced Tuesday.
This marks the first time in state history that record harvests for both species have been recorded in the same season — a reflection, officials say, of both strong wildlife populations and the popularity of hunting throughout the state.
During the spring wild turkey season, which ran from April 12 to May 10, hunters harvested 800 birds, breaking the previous record of 723 set in 2024.
That’s an 11% increase and a significant milestone for a species that only saw its first regulated hunting season in Delaware in 1991, following a restoration effort.

“Delaware’s turkey hunters continue to play a vital role in wildlife conservation,” said Joe Rogerson, DNREC Wildlife Section administrator. “This season’s record numbers reflect not only favorable habitat conditions but also the commitment of hunters and landowners to sustainable game management.”
Sussex County led the state’s turkey harvest with 369 birds, followed by Kent County with 338 and New Castle County with 93.
Most turkeys — 630 — were taken on private land, but hunters also set a record on public land, bagging 170 birds.
Meanwhile, the state’s white-tailed deer season, which ran from Sept. 1 through Feb. 2, saw hunters harvest 18,823 deer — shattering the previous record of 17,265 set during the 2020-21 season.
The new record represents a 29.4% jump from the 2023-24 season, when 14,451 deer were harvested — the lowest total in recent years.
“The historic deer harvest also highlights continued success in wildlife conservation and management efforts across the state,” Rogerson said. “Indicative of both the resilience of Delaware’s deer population and the dedication of our hunters at pursuing our state’s big game animal, it also highlights the success of ongoing management strategies aimed at maintaining a healthy and balanced deer herd in Delaware.”
Sussex County again led the deer harvest with 9,628 deer. Kent and New Castle counties followed with 6,140 and 3,055, respectively.
The top-producing wildlife management zone was Zone 7 in southwestern Kent County, where hunters harvested 1,609 deer.
Among the season’s highlights was the harvest of a doe estimated to be 14.5 years old — likely one of the oldest deer ever recorded in the state.
The DNREC cited ongoing programs, including its deer damage assistance partnership with the Delaware Department of Agriculture, as instrumental in balancing herd management with agricultural needs.
The department also credited extended seasons and increased public land access for expanding hunting opportunities.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deer-Turkey-Main.jpg,,,2025-05-21 13:13:45.013260

The House aid package, announced Wednesday, comes one day after Gov. Josh Stein asked for $891 million in new relief. He warned of slow and dwindling federal aid, saying the state would likely have to shoulder more of the burden going forward.
Inside the $450 million House plan is $60 million to send disaster grants to small businesses in western North Carolina. Businesses could see up to 25% of their economic loss or $75,000, whichever is less, according to the bill.
A grant program has been the number one request of the business community since Helene hit last fall. Lawmakers have previously opted to create loans, but many regional business owners have said they could not take on any more debt.
Local governments would also see $50 million in grant money to help repair and replace infrastructure. That could help offset mounting costs for those governments as they face looming budget shortfalls, driven by both damages and lost tourism revenue.
The money for the new aid package would come in part from the private nonprofit NC Innovation. Republican lawmakers have for months said they plan to claw back public dollars from the group to fund other priorities.
Also included in the House’s aid package:

$70 million to qualify for continued reimbursement from the feds.
$30 million to continue repairing private roads and bridges.
$30 million for debris removal, including on farms.
$25 million for construction on destroyed schools.
$25 million to “improve airport infrastructure” for the region to better respond to disaster.
$25 million to rebuild farm infrastructure.
$20 million for volunteer organizations aiding in recovery.
$18 million for grants to fire stations and EMS.
$15 million for firefighting equipment and Forest Service contract workers.
$8 million to repair damaged schools.




Lawmakers have thus far spent $1.4 billion total on relief for Hurricane Helene. Their last aid package, passed in March, laid out $524 million. That package prioritized aid for farmers and spinning up a state homebuilding program.
The House plan is set to be considered by the appropriations committee Wednesday afternoon. Lawmakers in the chamber are also advancing their proposal for the state budget this week.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dji_fly_2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-21 13:13:45.013260

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Attorneys for unaccompanied migrant children in New Mexico say a federal judge’s order keeps in place money for their legal representation for now — or at least until the Trump administration appeals to the nation’s highest court.
For decades, Congress has required the federal government to ensure that children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian have legal representation in immigration proceedings. The government has done this by paying immigration lawyers through federal grants.
However, on Feb. 18, the U.S. government ordered Acacia, the primary grant recipient, to stop working on the cases, according to court records.
The government rescinded the stop-work order a week later, but on March 21 terminated the contract altogether, which stopped all funding for legal representation going to the organizations.
Any child who was not already represented prior to the termination could not be represented in court, said Imelda Maynard, legal director at Estrella del Paso, which works with children released to their guardians in Doña Ana County and west Texas. This impacted a couple dozen children’s cases that Estrella would have handled, she said.
“During that time, we had kids who definitely needed legal representation, but because we couldn’t do it, some of them ended up with removal orders,” Maynard said. “There were children going to court that we could not represent, so they were sitting through their hearings by themselves.”
After the legal organizations sued, a federal judge in the Northern District of California issued a temporary restraining order at the beginning of April and, at the end of that month, the government provided instructions to the legal organizations about how to continue to pay for the representation.
U.S. District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín then issued a preliminary injunction on April 29, ruling that the government cannot depart from its prior policy without a good reason, and they haven’t shown that good reason in this case.
“The Government offers no evidence that it found pro bono counsel or even sought out alternative representation for the unaccompanied children,” Martínez-Olguín wrote.
“There’s no substitution for having legal representation,” Andres Santiago, managing attorney for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center’s children’s team, said. “To expect a kid to navigate the system on their own is absolutely crazy.” NMILC works with children released to their guardians in every county in New Mexico.
The government appealed the judge’s order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied its request. Maynard said the government might appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court but, as of Tuesday, they had not done so.
The injunction bars the government from withholding the funds until Sept. 29.
NMILC is not a named plaintiff in the case but is affected as one of the legal service providers under the grant.
“We’ve seen things go up to the Supreme Court, so right now, it’s a tenuous situation where we have funding for now,” Santiago said.
Someone on their side
Some unaccompanied children are eligible for asylum, Santiago said, while others are eligible for other kinds of immigration relief. Some are also victims of commercial sex trafficking or labor trafficking, he said.
A lot of the children had very traumatic experiences that caused them to flee their countries, Maynard said, and a lot of them experienced further trauma on their journey here to the United States.
While every now and then some very bold children are able to advocate for themselves, most are very disoriented and scared, she said.
Federal law requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to transfer unaccompanied children to the Department of Health and Human Services and release them to juvenile shelters.
Attorneys connect the children to services, help them apply for visas, navigate their immigration cases, conduct know-your-rights training and represent them in immigration court.
“Their counsel, essentially, it’s the only time that they’re really hearing, ‘Hey, someone’s on your side, and someone’s here to look out for you and your interests, and listen to you,’” Maynard said.
As a result of the disruption in funding, Santiago said some NMILC staff are considering whether this kind of work makes sense for them in the long-term, though as of yet they haven’t yet lost any staff members. The children’s team has six attorneys, one legal representative and then four support staff.
The team is representing more than 200 children through the program, Santiago said. Last year, 235 children were released to sponsors in New Mexico, he said. But so far this year, there have been only 73 children released, he said.
The gap could be explained by the stop-start nature of the funding, or constraints on shelters’ ability to refer children to the attorneys, he said.
Estrella del Paso had to furlough about 18 of its staff because the flow of children coming into the shelters was so low, Maynard said.
The government argued in the case that it needed to cut the funding because of “fiscal constraints” and concerns about the “sustainability” of the program. Santiago said the funding is still needed.
“There are children that are continuing to be released to family in New Mexico, and they’re going to continue to need legal representation,” Santiago said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CB_FamiliesShelter-9441-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 13:13:45.013260

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Aspiring statewide 2026 Democratic candidates David Jolly and Josh Weil addressed approximately 200 people Monday night in Pinellas County — just weeks before both say they will formally open campaigns, respectively, for governor and U. S. Senate.
Jolly, the former Republican turned independent who became a registered Democrat less than a month ago, said he likely will announce his candidacy for governor in mid-June.
“I anticipate I will be getting into the governor’s race, and that announcement will be coming very soon,” he said at the conclusion of his 4o-minute appearance as the headliner of the event, sponsored by the Largo Mid-Pinellas County Democratic Club.
One thing the former congressman and longtime MSNBC political analyst (whose contract with the cable network as an analyst has been paused, according to an MSNBC spokesperson) says he will bring to the race is a dash of enthusiasm — which has been lacking in Florida Democratic circles since last fall.
That’s when their top-of-ticket candidates (Kamala Harris for president and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell for Senate) both lost by 13 percentage points. In that same election, Democrats lost seats in the Florida House of Representatives and then two party members bolted to join the majority Republicans in the state House in December.
And with the Democrats’ popularity nationally hovering in some polls in the upper 20s, these haven’t been the best of times for the party. Still, Jolly insists there is a growing national revulsion to the actions the second Trump administration has undertaken during its first four months in office, and he believes it will bolster the party’s chances next year.
“There’s movement going on. A rare time in American political history where there is a movement, a coalition that is growing, that is saying, ‘We are concerned about the direction of the country and about the direction of our state,'” he said. 
“People who have never been involved in politics, who are no longer worrying about their partisan registration or political identity, they just know we’re going in the wrong direction and they want to stand up and fix it.”
The country, in fact, is going through a “constitutional crisis.” Jolly said.
“When the president of the United States looks at Congress and says, ‘I don’t care about the budget you passed. I’m not going to spend the money as directed by law,’ that’s a crisis. When he looks at the courts and he says, ‘I’m not going to follow your orders,’ that’s a crisis. We cannot normalize that. It’s right that that we stand up at that moment, stand in the gap and say, ‘We’re going to do our part to stop this.'”
Crises
Jolly, 52, cautioned that Democrats shouldn’t be all about bashing Trump — and even mentioned at about 20 minutes into his speech that he hadn’t uttered the president’s name once.
(Which was not exactly accurate — he used the president’s name when he said that Trump had elevated Elon Musk and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and mentioned “the president” when discussing the “constitutional crisis.”)
Jolly talks often about the “affordability crisis” in Florida, and on Monday night referred to the GOP-controlled Legislature’s proclivities toward preemption of local governments on a variety of issues as a persistent problem. He also discussed expanding Medicaid, investing in affordable, renewable, clean energy, and being tough on crime.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Whether you’re a native-born citizen, whether you came here, or whether you’re a Republican politician, if you break the law, you should be prosecuted,” Jolly said, eliciting one of the loudest cheers of the evening.
Gun safety is another major issue in Jolly’s platform — he advocated for universal background checks, including for transfers of guns between family members.
The Democratic Party needs to go to places where their candidates haven’t ventured in a long time, Jolly said, “and speak the language on the ground of a community just looking for answers.”
Close to his home in Pinellas County, Jolly didn’t encounter any dissenting voices when he took questions. But that won’t be the case once the self-described “Bush 41 Republican” gets called to account for some of his former more conservative political positions, such as opposition to abortion rights.
In retrospect, Jolly says, he wrongly conflated the idea of being “pro-life” with being “anti-Roe” in 2012. He reminded the audience that even when he had a different stance on abortion rights, he was the only Republican in the House who voted against a proposal to investigate Planned Parenthood (a statement verified by PolitFact).
And he says that post the 2022 U.S.Supreme Court Dobbs decision, which overturned a federal right to an abortion, he is now a “full proponent of codifying the Roe-Casey framework at the national and state level.” (“Casey” being the Supreme Court’s 1992 ruling Planned Parenthood V. Casey affirming a constitutional right to an abortion but allowing states more leeway to regulate abortion).
Unlike other famous party-switchers like Ronald Reagan or Charlie Crist, however, he’s not claiming that his former party left him.
“Folks, David Jolly left the Republican Party,” he declared, generating another healthy cheer from the partisan audience.
Now representing a party that lags more than 1 million voters behind the GOP in registrations across the state, Jolly said he hopes to build a coalition extending to independent voters and “common-sense Republican friends” who want reform, particularly of the property insurance situation.
At this early stage, no major Democrats have entered the gubernatorial contest for 2026. One Democrat who was expected to run for governor, state Sen. Jason Pizzo, recently announced that he will do so as a non-party-affiliated candidate, declaring the Florida Democratic Party “dead” in a speech on the Senate floor late last month.
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited and thus will not be back on the ballot last year, said in Tampa on Tuesday that Pizzo is running as an independent “because people know if you have a ‘D’ next to your name in this state you are dead meat. Because this party is a disaster.”
“You’re seeing an effort for people to try to think that if they move the albatross around their neck, that somehow they’re going to be viable,” DeSantis said. “But here’s the thing: You can dress it up anyway that you want. If you put lipstick on a donkey, guess what? It’s still a donkey.”

Young voters
Jolly’s opening act, as it were, on Monday was Josh Weil, the 40-year-old Central Florida public middle school instructor who was the Democratic nominee in the Congressional District 6 special election in Northeast Florida that became vacant after Trump selected GOP incumbent Mike Waltz as his National Security Adviser.
(Waltz subsequently has been transferred to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, pending Senate confirmation).
Although Weil lost to Republican Randy Fine by 14 percentage points in the April 1 special election, 57%-43%, the margin was 18 points closer than the previous Democratic candidate received in losing to Waltz in the same district just five months earlier.
Weil said the experience showed him that Democrats have too often written off congressional districts that they don’t believe they can win. And with Republicans holding 20 of the state’s 28 seats, that’s roughly 70% of the state that the party hasn’t competed for in recent election cycles.
That’s particularly hurt them with young voters, Weil said.
“That means that if you’re 25 or under, living in that 70% of the state, you have never had a Democrat knock on your door,” he said. “We have to get out there. We have to re-engage them, to go to where they are. They’re not coming to us. We have to get out to where they are.”
Weil was able to raise considerably more cash than Fine in that race, and he now appears emboldened to help fundraising efforts around the state. He said Monday that he and his “team” have a plan to raise $10 million for voter registration efforts across the state over the next 16 months, with a particular interest in Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties.
“We are committing to invest $1 million in the field, for every congressional district in this state, to make sure that we carry the message to voters where they are, in every district in every county, in ways that our party has been unable to cycle after cycle,” he said, adding that CD-13 is “up for grabs.”
That remains to be seen. Despite a focus by Democrats on flipping the seat last fall, Republican Anna Paulina Luna cruised to more than 9-point victory in November.
Regarding his own candidacy, Weil said he will announce on June 21.

Sussex County officials on Tuesday introduced a proposed $285.1 million budget for Fiscal Year 2026, a plan that increases overall spending while significantly lowering the property tax rate, the first such adjustment in more than three decades.
Driven largely by capital investments in wastewater infrastructure and supported by increased assessed property values, the proposed budget reflects a 7.3% increase — or nearly $20 million — over the current year’s spending. Still, the County is aiming to keep operations modest, with the general fund growing just 4.4%.
The most notable change in the plan is a major cut to the property tax rate, which would drop from 44.5 cents to 2.14 cents per $100 of assessed value — the result of a recent court-ordered property reassessment. The lower rate is designed to keep overall property tax collections “revenue neutral,” despite new construction adding to the tax base.

“There’s a lot to take in with this year’s budget, but the bottom line is Sussex County continues to deliver the best services at the best possible value,” said County Administrator Todd F. Lawson, who presented to County Council the proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. “Through all the change, that’s the one constant our constituents can count on.”
Key Investments in Budget
The budget proposal includes substantial investments in infrastructure, public safety, and community development:

$76.7 million for wastewater system upgrades, including treatment plant expansions and new service areas.
$7.4 million for farmland and open space preservation.
$5.8 million to fund 25 supplemental state police troopers — up from $4.6 million last year.
$2.4 million for planning and construction of paramedic stations in Dewey Beach, Lincoln, and Milton.
$6 million to support local fire companies and ambulance squads.
$1.25 million for affordable housing initiatives, including home rehab and settlement assistance.
Increased municipal law enforcement support, growing from $920,000 to $1 million.

Some modest fee increases are also proposed, including a $12 annual hike for sewer services and a $33 increase for unmetered water users. Fees for services from the Sheriff’s Office, GIS, and Engineering departments are also slated for adjustment.
Council President Doug Hudson commended the budget team, calling the plan a “balanced” and “team-driven” effort.
“That’s no easy feat, trying to satisfy a lot of competing interests, but this team always seems to pull it off,” President Hudson said. “It’s not magic. Just good teamwork and expertise. We appreciate it, and I know the taxpayers do, too.”
Public Input Invited
A public hearing on the proposed budget will be held at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, June 17, in the County Administrative Offices at 2 The Circle, Georgetown.
Residents can also submit feedback via email to budget@sussexcountyde.gov.
By law, the budget must be adopted by June 30. A full copy of the proposal and presentation materials is available online at here.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/360_F_113685937_MBNS5fdmR1Zm16okcaYXWFsL6k2zonX1.jpg,,,2025-05-21 13:13:45.013260

Louisiana State Police arrived on the accident scene at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to a news release. State Rep. Kyle Green Jr., D-Marrero, reportedly veered off U.S. Highway 90 Business in West Jefferson near Ames Boulevard and struck a concrete barrier with his 2023 Honda Accord. 
Green and the children were uninjured, according to police. The children were released to a relative.  
“Troopers noticed signs of impairment and conducted a series of standardized field sobriety tests. Green was subsequently placed under arrest,” the State Police release said.
Green was taken to the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center, where troopers said he refused to take a breath test. A judge’s warrant allowed investigators to obtain blood samples and, based on the results, Green was booked for first offense DWI, three counts of DWI with child endangerment, careless operation, improper lane use and a traffic attachment from Jefferson Parish.

House Bill 819, brought by Flathead Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell, puts strict stipulations on what flags can be displayed at schools and other government buildings.
Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the legislation late last week. It’s unclear what penalties, if any, there will be for violation of the law.
“Allowing nongovernmental or politically charged symbols on state property creates inconsistency in enforcement, legal challenges, and public divisiveness, undermining the neutrality and inclusivity of government spaces,” the law reads.
The bill passed along party lines in both the House and Senate. During his testimony for the bill, Mitchell said it was about fairness and neutrality in government.
“I don’t think in Flathead County they should be flying a Trump flag,” Mitchell said. “I don’t think in Missoula County they should be flying a Kamala Harris flag.”
The flags that are now allowed include the United States flag, as well as Montana’s, and any other state, city, tribal, and military flag.
There’s also a specific stipulation which states: “Flags honoring law enforcement officers, military service members, and public service organizations provide appropriate, nonpolitical recognition of their contributions to public safety and national defense.”
It’s unclear if that includes the Thin Blue Line flag, which honors law enforcement but can be viewed as political. That flag wasn’t brought up in either hearing.
The flag law also says any “federally recognized” nation’s flag can be flown as well as school mascots. So while Taiwan’s flag could not be flown, a high school football team is protected if they run onto the field before a game with their flag. And, since Iran and North Korea are recognized as nations by the federal government, those flags technically could be displayed under the new law.

It is, however, unclear if a Confederate flag would be protected as it is both politically charged, and a flag of historical significance, for which the law has a stipulation. The Gadsden flag — or the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag — is specifically protected under the law. 
Other questions, such as if a flag in support of a labor group would be allowed, are unanswered in the new law. Opponents of the bill, which included ACLU Montana and the Montana Gender Alliance, pointed to some of the questions the bill left open.
“It’s broad and contradictory, which means that certain beliefs are able to be promoted over others,” said Henry Seaton, an ACLU lobbyist who testified against the bill. “It eliminates the ability for people to show support for particular, marginalized communities.”
Other states, including Idaho and Utah, have passed similar legislation. Some cities in those states have pushed back, with Salt Lake City adopting three new city flags to circumvent the law: One in support of the city’s Black and African American residents, a trans flag rights and a Pride flag.
Classrooms were also a target, something Mitchell had on his mind during the hearings for HB 819. He said that teachers were acting as “state officials” in the classroom and pointed to his experience.
“I know when I went to school in 2018 they had Black Lives Matter flags,” Mitchell testified to the Senate State Administration Committee on April 2. “I don’t think that’s something that should be something that should be pushed in a school. There were some teachers that had pride flags.”
While Mitchell says court cases back up the state’s ability to regulate speech in public buildings, students, at least, don’t lose their rights at the schoolhouse gate, which the U.S. Supreme Court found in Tinker vs. Des Moines.
The bill says it does “not infringe on private speech or individual expression, as they apply solely to government-controlled displays, ensuring personal freedoms remain intact while maintaining a neutral public environment.”

It’s unclear how this law will be enacted in schools. Missoula County Public Schools Superintendent Micah Hill said his district will follow the law. In an email, he said no flags have been taken down.
He added he assumed “that if we’re out of compliance, we would request that any flag as defined by the new law be taken down.”
The state’s public universities and colleges could also be impacted by the law, though they’re not specifically mentioned in the legislation. Montana State University school officials referred questions on the law to the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
In Montana, the state Constitution gives the Board of Regents the authority to supervise the Montana University System, but the Commissioner’s Office did not respond to a question Tuesday seeking comment on the legislation.
Flags have been a topic of conversation in Bozeman before. In 2021, an MSU student living in university housing displayed a Black Lives Matter flag in plain view outside of a window. The student was told to take it down because it was a “fire hazard” and briefly did, before putting it back up.
It’s likely not to impact the University of Montana, UM spokesperson Dave Kuntz said, who added they’d been in contact with the Commissioner’s Office about the new law. The flags UM flies are already on the list outlined in the new law. He said the university does not plan to regulate flags in offices or in dorm rooms.
“That’s just an area of personal privacy,” Kuntz said. “As the law is passed right now, it just doesn’t have a large impact on the campus.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1753030050-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 12:23:53.624235

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters).A financial agency that recently downgraded Maryland’s bond rating drew sharp words Wednesday from Treasurer Dereck Davis (D) and a suggestion that Maryland might break from the company.
The state’s decades-long string of holding AAA ratings from all three bond-rating agencies ended a week ago when Moody’s, one of the three top rating agencies, downgraded Maryland to Aa1. Davis, whose office is responsible for issuing the bonds that help pay for major projects, including schools and infrastructure, said he takes the downgrade personally.
“So, you know, to hell with Moody’s,” Davis said at the outset of Wednesday’s Board of Public Works meeting with Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D).
Davis also suggested the agency had other considerations as it issued its report last week.
“I know in the case of Maryland, when you’re paying $229,000 they got to give you something. They’re not going to just hand out, as we say in school, A’s for nothing,” Davis said, adding that the company was selling subscriptions to investors and “you know, you got to give people a reason to buy it.”
Davis’ comments underscore a deep frustration and concern about how transparent the Moody’s review process has been.
The downgrade by Moody’s was the first from that agency since it gave Maryland a AAA rating in 1973. The change meant the state lost its treasured triple, triple-A creditworthiness rating — Standard & Poor’s has given Maryland an AAA rating since 1961, while Fitch Ratings has graded Maryland’s bonds AAA since 1993.
Fitch last week reaffirmed the state’s AAA rating, just one day after the Moody’s downgrade. Standard & Poor’s, is expected to release its newest rating before the state’s scheduled June 11 bond sale.
Maryland uses the three agencies to annually assess the state’s creditworthiness. The ratings determine how much interest the state — and taxpayers — will pay for the money it borrows through annual bond issuances. Each of those agencies is paid by the state to do the ratings.
Officials have not expressed concerns that the Standard & Poor’s report will come with a credit downgrade for Maryland.
Davis, however, strongly implied Moody’s services may no longer be needed.
“Now you’re seeing why, if you also do some research, more and more states are also moving away from Moody’s,” Davis said. “They’re not the standard-bearer” they once were.

Jim Pillen has squashed, at least for now, a legislative effort to help Omaha public housing residents get rid of a persistent bed bug problem, vetoing an Urban Affairs Committee bill pushed by a North Omaha lawmaker.
Legislative Bill 287 sought quicker and better remedies to bedbug infestations and other concerns voiced by low-income residents of the Omaha Housing Authority, primarily those who live in publicly subsidized apartment towers.
The proposed intervention followed public outcry by OHA residents and advocates, including a class-action lawsuit led by a group of current or former residents of 10 public housing high-rise apartments and represented by attorney and former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha and two Iowa lawyers that specialize in bedbug cases.
State Sen. Terrell McKinney, who has pushed the legislative effort, said Wednesday that he was disappointed by Pillen’s veto — and is submitting a motion to override it.

McKinney, chair of the Urban Affairs Committee, said that he resorted to legislation because residents were not seeing relief they wanted through any other level of government.
“This bill was introduced in response to the complete lack of accountability regarding the Omaha Housing Authority both from HUD and the City of Omaha,” he said Wednesday, referring to the federal U.S. Housing and Urban Development, which is the primary funder of OHA. “It was meant to assist and help people who have been living through horrible conditions.”
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha remarked from the legislative floor Wednesday that it “should not go unnoticed” that the two bills vetoed in recent days by the governor were championed by Black men.
Last week, the governor vetoed a bill by State Sen. Victor Rountee of Bellevue on expanding SNAP benefits to people with certain drug pasts. The Legislature upheld the veto Monday.
In a letter laying out his objection to the bedbug bill, Pillen said it created “needless duplicative government mandates and regulatory bureaucracy where none is needed.”
Pillen said he believed local governments should possess the authority to enforce basic sanitation and anti-infestation standards for dwellings within their jurisdiction. He said that the City of Omaha already possessed that authority.

He also said the legislation imposes “a redundant solution in pursuit of a problem” that federal oversight is legally equipped to address. He said OHA, which manages the units that residents say are infested, is subject to “rigorous federal oversight.”
OHA tower residents and their advocates have said in court documents and media events that the infestation dates back to 2016.
OHA officials have said that they have been working on the problem, and have implemented various measures. Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and several city council members objected to the bedbug-focused legislation.
Among key elements of the bill is an option for the City of Omaha to step in and regulate OHA in areas such as providing for pest control, inspections, penalties for code violations and requiring monthly updates to the city council.
During legislative debate, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, a member of the Urban Affairs Committee, told his colleagues that the option allows the city discretion to pass an ordinance to take more local control. There’s been “a lot of kicking back and forth of who’s responsible” and the option, he said, would eliminate the reason the city has given for not engaging more in an oversight role.
“They claim they don’t have the authority this bill would grant them,” Cavanaugh said. “It just takes away their opportunity to say, ‘We can’t do that.’”
City Attorney Matthew Kuhse previously wrote a two-page letter to lawmakers saying that the housing authority is a separate legal entity and that any additional oversight or regulations should be done by the Legislature, not the City of Omaha. Omaha’s mayor appoints OHA board members, and the city council confirms them.
McKinney on Wednesday reiterated that the bill gave the City of Omaha the option to take action if they chose it. “It does not mandate anything.”
He said, “The residents of OHA deserve better, and the governor chose not to support their right to safe, accountable housing.”

(Photo: Screenshot from event video stream)A panel of speakers at a Tuesday “Voices for Veterans” event in Fayetteville agreed that America has a moral obligation to care for members of the military after they have completed their service.
The panelists’ remarks were in response to a question by moderator Michael McElroy, a political correspondent at Cardinal & Pine, the online publication that hosted the event for the purpose of “supporting North Carolina’s veterans and military families.”
 Big VA cuts spark big worries
The comments come amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a VA nurse.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The nation must do for veterans what it said it would do with “no strings attached, with no arguments, with no pushback,” Patterson-Powell said.
Dr. Kyle Horton, founder of On Your Side Health, a nonprofit that addresses health care disparities and works to improve veterans’ health care, said the nation has a sacred obligation to protect those who serve.
“Those who wrote a blank check in service to this country with their lives do not deserve to be penny-pinched by Washington bureaucrats,” Horton said.
Horton added: “They don’t deserve to be penny-pinched by Captain Bone Spurs in the White House [a reference to President Donald Trump, who obtained a medical excuse from serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs] right now and they don’t deserve to be penny pinched by DOGE [the so-called Department of Government Efficiency] and  [Elon] Musk who don’t even know what they’re doing. Period.”
Patterson-Powell said there is a push by the Trump administration to privatize the VA. That could be harmful to veterans who wouldn’t receive the specialized care they now get at the VA, she said.

Scott Peoples, a retired Army captain, member of Veterans for Responsible Leadership (VFRL) and an advocate for free and fair elections, noted that America fights its wars with volunteers. The proposed budget VA budget cuts could make people think twice about making a commitment to serve, Peoples said.
“How we take care of them after service is kind of our Number One recruiting tool as well for future people who want to join the military,” Peoples said.
He said the Trump administration’s firing of VA staff members made him angry.
“Every single one of those people got into it for the right reasons; wants to serve their country by taking care of our veterans and the way they have so inhumanely shrugged off cutting people with no transparency, just people receiving emails, people having moved their families across country [to work at the VA], is just despicable,” Peoples said.   
  Grier Martin (Photo: Screenshot from event video stream)
Grier Martin, Secretary of the NC Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, said the cuts would have a devastating impact on rural communities.
“If these cuts go through, you’re going to see the VA’s presence in rural areas start to dry out,” Martin said. “These are areas that are already starting to see their civilian hospitals close also.”
The state’s decision to expand Medicaid has been helpful in helping some rural hospitals remain open, he said, but veterans will have difficulty finding care near home if the VA’s presence is diminished.
“If you live on the coast, you’re not going to drive to Durham and you’re probably not going to drive to Fayetteville to the VA hospital to get your care,” Grier said.
Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe) said the outpouring of concern and support for veterans gives him cause for hope amid threats of major cuts to the VA.
“That is how change happens,” Ager said. “It may not be immediate. It may not always be completely satisfying. But the fact that veterans are coming together, that the community is coming together to support veterans, I think will eventually lead to change.”   
Threats to democracy
A second panel discussion moderated by Cardinal & Pine’s managing editor Billy Ball, focused on threats to democracy and the evolving role of veterans as defenders of democracy.
  Bobby Jones (Photo: Screenshot from event video stream)
Panelist Bobby Jones, president of VFRL and retired Navy commander, said he could see the cost of freedom in the faces of the veterans in the audience. Jones said the services the VA provides are essential to national security.
“I know this panel is about national security, but my thing is you cannot have one without the other,” Jones said. “The VA has to be sound in order for us to have a proper national security apparatus.”
Jones was critical of Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He said neither man understands the concept of service to country.
“For the first time, I believe in American history, we have leadership that doesn’t get it, that thinks the Constitution is nothing more than a suggestion,” Jones said. “Hell, even the South for the Civil War had the good sense to defect and secede before going against the Constitution.”
America is in “unparalleled, unprecedented times” and veterans must step up to lead the country out the quagmire, Jones said.
Ball asked the panel to discuss the much-watched North Carolina Supreme Court race between Republican Jefferson Griffin and Allison Riggs, a Democrat. The outcome of the closely contested race wasn’t resolved until this month after nearly six months. Griffin conceded after a federal judge ordered the state to certify Riggs’ election victory.
Military and overseas votes were at the center of the election dispute. Griffin challenged the validity of some military and overseas absentee ballots in the 2024 contest.
“To protect military and veterans’ families’ votes, really has to come from the voters, really has to come from political pressure,” said Sean Wright, a former Army medic. “We have to make it, as voters, unacceptable to take away the right to vote.”
Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) said men and women who serve overseas have expectations that they will be treated with a certain amount of respect.
“This election really showed how little the powers that be cared about that,” Brown said. “I like to think about it in terms of people that talk a good game, but they don’t back it up.”
Brown said Americans can’t afford to take a day off defending democracy.
“We have to make sure that’s it’s not just doing election season, it’s not just when there are votes on the line, it’s not just when a bad thing happens,” Brown said. “It’s all the time that we’re making sure that y’all are laser-focused on protecting against threats to our democracy.”
Jay Carey, leader of Resist & Persist, a nonpartisan veterans advocacy organization, said the challenge to the state Supreme Court election was a test by the GOP to determine how much the judicial system and voters could stomach.
Carey, who garnered national attention after he was escorted out of U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards’ townhall meeting in Asheville in March, said there will be more challenges to valid election victories.
“They’re [the challenges] are going to get more and more ridiculous,” Carey said. “It’s going to tie up time and waste more money Like I said, it was a test. They just wanted to see what they could do.”
The discussion turned to talk of Trump’s removing the military’s Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) and replacing them with what some panelists said are loyalists to the administration. JAGs advise commanders on legal matters and oversee the military judicial system.
Jones said the legal protections provided by JAGs are critical to defending the nation against internal threats he fears are coming from the Trump administration.
“I can’t stress the panic level enough on this,” Jones said. “All of the dominoes are falling. To those of us paying attention, it’s blatantly obvious. Any time there’s a voice of dissent, they shut it down.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-1024x694.png,,,2025-05-21 12:23:53.624235

Brendan Boyle, ranking member on the House Committee on the Budget, said in a statement late Tuesday that “Donald Trump and House Republicans are selling out the middle class to make the ultra-rich even richer.”“This is what Republicans are fighting for—lining the pockets of their billionaire donors while children go hungry and families get kicked off their health care,” said the Pennsylvania Democrat.The bill as written now would slash roughly $800 billion from Medicaid and Affordable Care Act provisions, and $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Lawmakers on the House Committee on Rules — the final stop for the 1,116-page package bill before it reaches a House floor vote — have been debating the measure since 1 a.m. Eastern Wednesday, while House Speaker Mike Johnson huddled separately with far-right deficit hawks.Far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus remained skeptical the bill could reach the House floor by Johnson’s goal of Wednesday.The Louisiana Republican leader also faces opposition from GOP lawmakers who represent high-tax blue states who want an even higher ceiling for the amount of state and local taxes, or SALT, their constituents can deduct from federal taxable income.Lifting the ceiling, which lawmakers already proposed boosting from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples filing jointly, will increase the cost of the bill.Johnson needs nearly every GOP lawmaker to support the bill once it hits the floor as House Republicans have an extremely thin 220-213 majority.",,,,2025-05-21 12:23:53.624235

Delaware has become the latest state to legalize medical aid in dying, following the signing of House Bill 140 on Wednesday.
The new law, titled the Ron Silverio/Heather Block End-of-Life Options Act, permits mentally capable, terminally ill adults with a prognosis of six months or less to request and self-administer life-ending medication. Named for two late advocates, the measure follows years of public debate and legislative effort.
“Today I’m going to sign a bill that speaks to compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice,” said Governor Matt Meyer before signing the bill into law. 
“This signing today is about relieving suffering and giving families the comfort of knowing that their loved one was able to pass on their own terms, without unnecessary pain, and surrounded by the people they love most,” he said.

The legislation includes various safeguards, including confirmation of eligibility by two healthcare providers, mental health evaluations when needed, and multiple waiting periods. Patients must make a written request witnessed by two individuals, and providers must inform them of all other end-of-life care options, including palliative and hospice care.
“Thanks to this signing today, all Delawareans can now have merciful deaths and leave life-affirming legacies,” said longtime Wilmington advocate Judy Govatos, who has incurable lymphoma.
Participation by providers is voluntary, and healthcare institutions may prohibit the practice on their premises. The law protects patients and providers acting in good faith from legal liability and explicitly states that actions taken per the law do not constitute suicide, homicide, or euthanasia.
“There are no losers here with this bill. Delawareans with six months or less to live can choose to fight for their lives to their very last breath, and those of us who prefer a more peaceful death can request a prescription that will ease our last breath,” said Govatos. 
Set to take effect January 1, 2026 — or earlier if regulations are finalized — the law tasks the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services with implementation, including rulemaking, data collection, and annual reporting on use and compliance.

The measure has been a central focus of Compassion & Choices and its affiliate, the Compassion & Choices Action Network, which supports legislation that expands end-of-life options nationwide. The organizations provide legal, medical, and advocacy resources for patients, families, and lawmakers seeking to establish or implement medical aid-in-dying laws. In Delaware, they have worked alongside patients, families, and local advocates for over a decade to support this bill. 
“By signing the Delaware End-of-Life Options Act into law, Governor Meyer demonstrates profound compassion and leadership, recognizing the courageous decade-long advocacy of Ron Silverio, Heather Block, Tom LaFollette, Chuck Knothe, Diane Kraus, and countless other terminally ill advocates who fought tirelessly for their right to die peacefully on their own terms,” said Kevin Díaz, Interim President/CEO for Compassion & Choices and Compassion & Choices Action Network. 
“Delaware voters and physicians overwhelmingly support this critical legislation, as does the rest of the nation,” said Diaz. “Compassion & Choices remains committed to expanding access and ensuring all terminally ill individuals have the compassionate end-of-life care options they deserve.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gov-matt-meyer.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 12:23:53.624235

Jerome Zeringue, R-Houma, and Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, in the Louisiana House of Representative, Feb. 2, 2022. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) Legislation to convert Louisiana’s insurance commissioner from an elected office into an appointed one stalled on the state Senate floor Tuesday when the author of the proposal realized it was likely to fail. 
Senate Bill 214 would have let the next governor, subject to Senate approval, appoint the state’s next insurance commissioner to a six-year term, with a limit of two terms. Under current law, the commissioner is chosen every four years through the same statewide election when voters select a governor. It is one of only two statewide elected offices that can be changed into an appointed position without a constitutional amendment though still requires two-thirds support from lawmakers. The other is the commissioner of agriculture.
The proposal would have allowed current Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple to run for re-election before the move to an appointed office holder. 
Just a week ago, the bill cleared the Senate Committee on Insurance with unanimous support. On Tuesday, however, its author, Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, pulled the bill as opposition mounted from certain Republicans. In an interview, he said he started counting votes and decided it might be better to replace his bill with a resolution that would create a task force to study the issue. 
“It was never a bill that I thought would have unanimous support,” Duplessis said. “Some people want the status quo … I just don’t think I had the numbers. It would have been close.”
While presenting the bill on the floor, Duplessis told colleagues there’s good reason for certain state officials to be appointed rather than elected. He mentioned the secretaries of the health and environmental quality departments as important offices that should be insulated from the politics of elected office.
“I think that some roles are so specialized and technical that they shouldn’t be politicized,” he said.
Very few voters pay attention to the office of insurance commissioner, Duplessis said, pointing out that Temple ran for office unopposed. 
Republicans have generally been supportive of Temple, a former insurance executive who is opposed to Duplessis’ bill and has lobbied for legislation with the backing of insurance companies.
Democrats, on the other hand, have been critical of the commissioner’s cozy relationship with the industry he’s charged with regulating and believe Temple could do more to rein in high premiums. 
The one big exception to that partisan alignment is Gov. Jeff Landry, who has been publicly feuding with Temple over the causes of the insurance crisis in Louisiana. Even with his reelection bid still two years away, the governor has incentive to deflect any blame voters might lay at his feet for insurance costs even though the crisis began before he took office in 2024. 
Temple and the companies he regulates have long claimed personal injury lawsuits are driving the state’s high insurance premiums. He has advocated for so-called “tort reform” laws that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation. Tort reform efforts in previous years have failed to reduce insurance rates, though Temple and his supporters have said those measures were not strong enough. 
Gov. Landry’s approach to lower insurance rates could cast his political fate

Duplessis’ bill had the backing of some conservative Republicans, such as Sen. Stewart Cathey of Monroe. Cathey added the amendment to require Senate confirmation of the governor’s pick for commissioner. 
But as other Republicans lined up to speak against the bill, debate started to sour when Sen. Adam Bass of Bossier City accused Duplessis of trying to strip away voters’ rights. 
“What other voting rights are you interested in taking away from the citizens?” Bass asked Duplessis.
Duplessis rejected the characterization and said he only wants to address the state’s insurance crisis with novel proposals. He noted 39 other states have appointed, rather than elected, insurance commissioners. Among the 10 states with the lowest auto insurance rates in the country, nine of them have appointed commissioners, he added.
“I am someone who generally believes in the power of elections and the will of the people,” Duplessis said. “But when something isn’t working and the outcomes are consistently failing consumers and driving up costs, we have to be honest enough to say it’s time to do something different.”
Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, spoke against the bill, though he said he authored similar legislation years ago. He said he studied the issue and eventually concluded the elected system “was the better way to go.”
Talbot repeated a statistic that Temple often cites from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which indicates there were more bodily injury claims from auto accidents in Louisiana with a population of roughly 4.5 million, than there were in the state of New York with a population of over 19 million in 2021, which is the most recent data available. 
“That’s what needs to be addressed, not this,” Talbot said. “And that’s what we are addressing with this vast package of tort reform bills that the commissioner has supported.”
Still, that same source indicates the dollar value of the incurred losses of Louisiana’s claims was less than half that of New York’s and roughly equal to the losses in Arkansas where liability premiums were the lowest out of all the southern states. 
Other states with more injury claims than New York included North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California.
Louisiana’s insurance commissioner was originally an appointed position when the post was created in 1957. Gov. Earl K. Long supported the launch of a state insurance department, separating its functions from the office of one of his political adversaries, Secretary of State Wade O. Martin. The very first appointed commissioner, Rufus Hayes, became the first elected one for his second term.

Months of protests following her death in 2020 led to yesterday's U.S. Justice Department report exposing a culture of unconstitutional abuse in the Louisville police. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice is pulling back from a consent decree aimed at reforming the Louisville Metro Police Department, saying such actions are “handcuffing local leaders.” 
The consent decree — which was in response to the police killing of Breonna Taylor and an investigation that exposed a pattern of constitutional violations by Louisville police — was meant to last five years. It required the police department to focus on de-escalation, work to “reduce unlawful racial disparities in enforcement,” provide training and support to police officers and more.  
About six months after the DOJ announced the consent decree — under former Democratic President Joe Biden — the Justice Department under Republican President Donald Trump says it is “confident that the vast majority of police officers across the nation will continue to vigorously enforce the law and protect the public in full compliance with the Constitution and all applicable federal laws.”
The DOJ is also dropping a similar consent decree in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where white police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd, a Black man, by kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes. 
Louisville Police Department enters consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice

“When bad actors in uniform fail to do so, the department stands ready to take all necessary action to address any resulting constitutional or civil-rights violations, including via criminal prosecution,” the DOJ said Wednesday. 
The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division is beginning the process of dismissing the lawsuits against the police departments in Louisville and Minneapolis, according to a news release.
Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement that “overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda.”
“Today, we are ending the Biden Civil Rights Division’s failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments with factually unjustified consent decrees,” Dhillon said. 
The Lantern has asked the Louisville Metro Police Department for comment. 
Why the Louisville consent decree? 
The consent decree came in December 2024 in response to a series of controversies — including the killing of Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who police fatally shot while serving a no-knock warrant in 2020. Her killing sparked months of protests. It late was revealed that police had used falsified information to obtain the warrant. 
 In 2022, two LMPD officers received federal prison sentences for throwing slushies and drinks from unmarked squad cars at residents in the predominantly Black West End, the Louisville Courier Journal reported. 
In August 2024, the DOJ released a separate report saying it had “reasonable cause” to believe Kentucky is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act in Jefferson County. That finding came after two years of investigation “focused on whether Kentucky subjects adults with serious mental illness to unnecessary segregation in psychiatric hospitals in Louisville.”
Kristen Clarke, then assistant attorney general for civil rights with the Justice Department, said at the time of the decree that police “used excessive force, unlawfully executed search warrants without knocking and announcing, carried out unlawful stops, searches and arrests, engaged in discriminatory policing with respect to low-level traffic stops and other offenses, violated the rights of people engaged in protected speech during demonstrations critical of policing and treated people with behavioral health disabilities unlawfully.”

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
 Dollars

Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
 Mission

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
 Governance

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Home to the state capitol and fueled by renewed focus and strategic investment in economic development, Richland County is setting the tone as a rising hub where innovation, opportunity, and community converge to shape a vibrant economic future.
To meet the moment, Richland County is proudly embracing this next chapter by celebrating the creation of the Columbia Area Development Partnership.
This is a public-private partnership between Richland County government and private industry, a vision first approved by County Council in 2024.
The partnership will work collaboratively to strengthen Richland County’s competitive edge and open doors for a new generation of workers, entrepreneurs, and residents.
Backed by a skilled workforce and access top-tier universities and four major interstates, plus offering close proximity to both the ports of Charleston and Savannah, Richland County is well-equipped to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving economy. Overall, it is this access that enhances Richland County’s appeal as a logistics and distribution hub.
We’ve seen this public-private partnership model succeed in the Greenville and Charleston areas — and now, it’s Richland County’s turn to evolve.
Through the partnership’s efforts, the county is well-positioned to meet the needs of today’s businesses while building a foundation for the next decade, drawing on the proven successes of our neighbors.
To aid this new vision, the Columbia Area Development Partnership board is a private nonprofit composed of esteemed, forward-thinking business leaders across a broad spectrum of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, higher education, tech, and financial services.
This partnership will serve as a catalyst for attracting businesses to the area by providing them with the infrastructure, resources, and support they need to thrive.
We’ve had incredible success in the past several years in the Midlands.
BlueCross BlueShield, Scout Motors, Mark Anthony Brewing, Ritedose Corp., US Brick, and Schneider Electric, to name a few, have already chosen our region to launch and expand their businesses.
The groundwork is set, but we are only scratching the surface of what is possible.
Richland County is truly an incredible family-friendly community with a host of offerings — from workforce housing, outdoor adventure, collegiate sports, and a thriving arts and culture scene.
It is an ideal county to live and grow. The partnership will propel Richland County forward, helping to build a resilient, future-ready region.
With our moment upon us, we are excited to continue to drive economic growth and ensure a high quality of life, not only for our residents who love calling Richland County home but also for those looking to build a life here.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/columbia-skyline-scaled-e1747840034615-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-05-21 11:07:25.203958

The scope of the story is massive, affecting the constitutional rights to educational opportunities for North Carolina’s 1.5 million public school students. And the story is juicy, rife with mystery, lawlessness, and government corruption. 
The lack of coverage is strange. Newspaper readers are more likely to have read about efforts to ban cellphones from classrooms or to name “Raise Up” as the state’s official hip-hop song.
If you haven’t guessed yet, the big, strangely unmentionable issue is Leandro. Leandro is the 31-year-old lawsuit about the state’s unwillingness to provide our public school students with the “sound basic” education that they’re guaranteed under our state constitution. Despite students’ multiple victories in state courts, state leaders have yet to provide students with the quality schools and educational opportunities they are owed.
From January 1 to May 1, the word “Leandro” has shown up in just one news story that ran in the state’s two largest newspapers serving Raleigh and Charlotte. The term has failed to appear in any news stories from the major newspapers serving Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, Wilmington, or Asheville.
It’s difficult to imagine an issue in state politics that is having a bigger impact on North Carolinians. There are currently 1.5 million children in our public schools who are having their constitutional rights violated. Millions more have had their rights violated since the case was originally filed in 1994.
Every court that’s weighed in on this question from 1997 to 2022, regardless of ideological makeup, has agreed that students’ constitutional rights are being violated by the state. When the nation’s leading nonpartisan education researchers completed a years’ long study of North Carolina’s education system in 2019, they reached the same conclusion, noting also that the state has been moving backwards. 
The General Assembly’s strategy of pairing austerity budgets with unregulated, low-quality privatization schemes has been making things worse. Test scores have fallen, particularly for students of color and students from families with low incomes. Teacher vacancies are at record levels.
The courts have tried to fix things. In 2020, they ordered the state to develop a detailed plan for the state to provide students with the types of schools promised under our state constitution. In November 2021, a Superior Court judge ordered the state to fully implement the Leandro Comprehensive Remedial Plan – a research-based blueprint for achieving constitutional compliance by the 2028 school year. 
The Leandro Plan makes several important steps to dramatically improve schools, including:

Expanding NC Pre-K so more students from families with lower incomes can enter kindergarten ready to succeed,
Investing in teacher training programs and improving teacher pay, training, and mentorships to address our record-high teacher vacancies,
Staffing nurses, psychologists, counselors, and social workers at recommended levels to manage students’ physical and mental health needs, and
Dramatically increasing supports for disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English language learners.

The Supreme Court reaffirmed the state’s responsibility to fully fund the eight-year Plan in November 2022.
That is where the story became particularly interesting.
First, the mystery. Why did a Roy Cooper appointee try to kill Leandro? Per the Supreme Court’s November 2022 court order, State Controller Nels Roseland was supposed to transfer money from state coffers to the schools for the first years of the Plan. He refused, citing “unresolved” legal issues. The Supreme Court cited Roseland’s motion in halting the transfer of funding and for re-hearing the case in February 2024.
There’s a juicy story in there for an enterprising investigative journalist. Until Roseland’s appointment, Governor Cooper had seemingly been a staunch advocate for Leandro. His staff created the Leandro Plan. Each of his budgets recommended full funding of the Plan. Yet his nominee for State Controller fought against the Plan. Roseland’s opposition was known prior to his nomination, having publicly indicated that he opposed Leandro and wouldn’t transfer the funding owed to students. It remains a mystery why Cooper didn’t pull Roseland’s nomination or remove him from office for his actions harming students.
While the Supreme Court halted the transfer of funds for years 1-3 of the Plan in early 2023, its order still requires the state to fund the Leandro Plan going forward. Rather than following the law and implementing the Leandro Plan, legislative leaders have simply ignored the court order. They don’t dispute that students’ rights are being violated. Nor have they put together an alternative plan to improve schools. They’ve simply said, “you can’t make us.” One would think that such wanton lawlessness would be a frequent subject of reporting from the capitol.
If that’s not juicy enough, there’s also blatant corruption. That corruption has taken two forms.
First, in early 2023, Senator Phil Berger and former Speaker of the House Tim Moore appealed to get the case back in front of the Supreme Court. Why did they want to do that? Well, that court now has a 5-2 Republican majority. One of those five justices is Senator Phil Berger’s son, Phil Berger, Jr. 
Junior, along with four of his hyper-partisan colleagues agreed to rehear the Leandro case mere months after the November 2022 ruling. In agreeing to rehear the case just months after a decision, the high court ignored foundational legal concepts such as respect for precedent and the rule of law. The facts of the case hadn’t changed. Only the partisan makeup of the court had changed, allowing Junior a second chance to rule on whether Daddy can continue to ignore students’ constitutional rights. This collusive, nepotistic relationship between the judicial and legislative branches has removed a foundational element of our system of checks and balances
The second form of corruption lies in how legislative leaders have spent the money that is supposed to be supporting public school students. They’re spending over $920 million this year for vouchers that mostly subsidize wealthy families who have their kids in private schools. They’ve also passed a series of tax cuts disproportionately benefiting corporations and wealthy North Carolinians. It’s no coincidence that these corporate and wealthy beneficiaries happen to be the same people who fund reelection campaigns. School children, alas, do not.
Given the above, it remains baffling why the press continues to ignore Leandro. The Leandro Plan would have a far greater impact on student achievement than any of the “big” issues being discussed this session such as cell phone bans or school calendar flexibility (which, incidentally, is part of the Leandro Plan, and was supposed to have been passed in 2021). The failure to fund the Plan is undoubtedly suppressing student achievement, particularly for historically underserved populations.
Meanwhile the lawlessness and corruption mirror what we’re seeing at the federal level from the Trump administration. It’s a major deal that General Assembly leadership believes they can simply ignore the parts of the state constitution that they don’t agree with or find inconvenient. That puts all of our basic rights as North Carolinians at risk. It’s also a big deal that the Supreme Court is likely to tarnish its legitimacy and credibility to rubber stamp the legislature’s absurd position. The decision from the re-heard case is expected any day now.
If you’re a journalist, please let me know, why aren’t you covering this issue? Is it not a big deal that 1.5 million children are having their basic rights violated? Is it not a major scandal that the General Assembly has been openly violating a court order for the past 1,283 days? Are we not in the midst of a constitutional crisis when legislators argue that they can simply ignore the parts of the constitution they disagree with?
If the answer to any of those questions is “yes” then I implore you to start centering Leandro in your reporting.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/News-300x218-1.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 11:07:25.203958

With demand far outstripping supply, more than 40 percent of the roughly 20,000 eighth grade students who applied to a vocational high school in 2023 were turned down under a system that lets schools rank applicants by middle school grades, attendance records, and discipline history. Tuesday’s vote to switch to a lottery system came after years of complaint from civil rights and education advocates that the use of selective criteria was disproportionately denying seats to low-income students, students of color, English language learners, and students with special needs.  State admissions data show those students, on average, receive offers of admission at lower rates than their peers. Critics argued that by locking out students who struggled with traditional academics in middle school or had poor attendance or discipline records, the entry standards were denying vocational seats to some of the very students who might benefit most from the hands-on learning at vocational schools.  The changes approved by the education board will replace the current ranking system with a lottery that gives extra weight to students with better attendance records, no history of major disciplinary infractions, and a strong demonstration of interest in attending a vocational high school.  Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler, who led the push for the changes on the board, said they reflect “a set of core values” centered on “the belief that every student deserves a fair shot at exploring their passions and building a future that they’re excited about.”  Board member Ericka Fisher, who voted for the changes, said she would have preferred a “blind” lottery in which all students have an equal chance at a seat. “I feel strongly that this proposal doesn’t go far enough,” she said. “I’d prefer an unweighted lottery. However, that being said, this is great progress.”  Another board member who also supported the change, Marty West, said “it is not exactly where I would have landed on my own, and probably from a different side than member Fisher.”  West suggested such differences, and the criticism the proposal received in public comments submitted from those on both sides of the debate, are to be expected when the proposed resolution to an issue involves a compromise.  While several board members suggested the change was a positive –, if imperfect –, reform, leaders and staff at the state’s vocational schools slammed the move as a misguided effort that will set back schools that have been acclaimed nationally for their success in combining high-quality academic study with vocational instruction.  Steve Sharek, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Vocational Administrators, voiced disappointment in the board vote and said, in a statement, that it was a mistake to “diminish the role of merit and student effort in the admissions process.”  Scott Keeler, an instructor at Nashoba Valley Technical High School in Westford, testifying at the meeting prior to the board vote, decried the fact the proposal would give students who had missed weeks of school the same chance at a seat as students with perfect attendance. Meanwhile, he said, eliminating middle school grades as an entry factor “tells students they do not need to try, and as a teacher and as a parent this is deeply concerning.” While the vote marked the end of a drawn-out review of vocational school admission policies by the education board, it may not be the last word on the issue.  The House version of the 2026 state budget includes a provision halting changes to vocational admission policies and establishing a new task force to review the issue. A similar amendment has been filed to the Senate budget, which is being debated this week. If it’s not adopted, the issue will still be among those that House and Senate leaders will have to hash out in a conference committee that will be charged with resolving differences in their spending plans.  Gov. Maura Healey seems likely to veto any effort to upend the changes her administration has backed, so the bar is set high to reverse the changes to vocational admissions that the state education board finally agreed to nearly a decade after the debate began.  The post State board approves lottery admissions for vocational high schools  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SERSD-e1606928390644.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 11:07:25.203958

(Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-21 14:57:19+00:00,CT Mirror,The EPA is rolling back drinking water limits for 4 PFAS. Thousands more remain unregulated.,Joseph Winters | Grist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/21/epa-pfas-drinking-water-limits/,"Environmental groups decried plans from the EPA to rescind and 'reconsider' drinking water limits for four PFAS, compounds linked to cancer.","This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

Last week, environmental groups decried plans from the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind and “reconsider” drinking water limits for four per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, compounds linked to cancer and damage to the immune and endocrine systems, among other health effects. 
The limits had been finalized by Joe Biden’s administration last April as part of an effort to limit people’s exposure to hazardous “forever chemicals.” Out of a total of more than 10,000 known PFAS, they targeted just six of the most concerning ones. The Trump administration’s EPA said it would retain the limits for two of the PFAS but give utilities more time to comply with them and scrap the others. One advocate called the EPA’s move a loss for public health and a “victory for chemical companies.” 
But how protective were the Biden regulations to begin with? And how much of a difference will it make to pare them back?
On the one hand, experts agree that backtracking is not in the public’s interest. Virtually everyone has PFAS coursing through their veins, and specific kinds like PFOS and PFOA are known or likely to contribute to kidney and testicular cancers. The other compounds originally regulated by the Biden administration have been linked to elevated cholesterol, heart disease, and an increased risk of diabetes.
The chemicals have become so ubiquitous in people and the environment because of their use in everything from outdoor clothing to cooking utensils and food packaging. Runoff from firefighting foam, infused with the chemicals, has contributed to widespread drinking water contamination, along with manufacturers’ deliberate dumping of the chemicals into rivers — despite knowing about their health risks. 
Once they’re created, PFAS don’t break down naturally; hence the moniker “forever chemicals.” Regulating them is an “important win,” experts have said, one that “allows the country to begin cleaning up the mess in its water.” 
But the fight over drinking water limits for individual PFAS distracts from the larger context that there are thousands of types, and scientists suspect they all have similar health effects. Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis. “The EPA is trying to regulate six forever chemicals. Just 10,000 to go,” as the title of an op-ed by one Harvard researcher put it.
Erik Olson, a senior strategist for the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the U.S. is “stuck in a Whac-a-Mole game” with PFAS, in which only the best researched compounds are regulated. Lesser-known compounds may be just as toxic — thanks to their similar chemical structures — but escape regulations just because they haven’t been studied, he added. “What we need to do is control PFAS as a class.”
Of the six forever chemicals targeted by the Biden administration’s original policy, PFOA and PFOS are the most prevalent and, consequently, they’ve been researched the most extensively. Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists’ understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them. Three additional compounds — PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX — were given a contamination limit of 10 parts per trillion. Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.
The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029. The rules for the other four compounds will be scrapped and reevaluated. The EPA said it intends to finalize its replacement regulations by next spring.
A statement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the extended timeline for PFOA and PFOS would provide “common-sense flexibility” to utilities, some of which sued the EPA over its regulations last year. The utilities said the EPA’s new rule was too strict and would cause unreasonable compliance costs. 
A spokesperson for the EPA told Grist that the process by which the agency had “promulgated the preliminary regulatory determinations simultaneously with the proposed regulation” for PFNA, PFHxS, GenX, and PFBS under the Biden administration “was inappropriate and may not comply with the statutory requirements of [the] Safe Drinking Water Act.” With regard to the rescissions, they said that “while EPA cannot predetermine the outcome, it is possible” that the agency will issue more stringent requirements this spring.
Daniel Jones, an emeritus professor of molecular biology at Michigan State University, said the impacts of the Trump administration’s reversal will depend on geography. Communities primarily affected by PFOS and PFOA may not be greatly affected, since the standards for those chemicals remain in place — albeit with an extended timeline for compliance. To meet the standards, water utilities will likely have to install something like an activated carbon filtration system, he said, which is effective at removing “long-chain” PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, which have a larger chemical structure than compounds like GenX.
Putting these filtration systems into place will thankfully sweep up more PFAS than just PFOA and PFOS, Jones said.
States like North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia, however, face disproportionate contamination from GenX due to production facilities concentrated there. This contamination could continue unabated if the standard for the compound is eliminated. According to Olson, some of the technologies that remove PFOS and PFOA are not as effective at attracting GenX. “To really control the full suite of PFAS, we need to go to more advanced technologies like tight membranes, like reverse osmosis,” he said.
Some water utilities may opt for these more advanced — and expensive — technologies if they believe that they will eventually be required to test for and limit a much larger number of PFAS, Olson added.
Although Jones is disappointed that the EPA intends to drop regulations for the four PFAS, he said he is more concerned about a single clause in the EPA’s press release, about the EPA’s intent to establish a “federal exemption framework” for the PFOS and PFOA limits. The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether. “It seems that an exemption framework is likely to open the door to say, ‘This is going to cost too much, you don’t have to do it,’” he said.
The EPA spokesperson said exemptions would not allow utilities to violate regulations: “Rather, they allow additional time to find a compliance solution.”
Jones also raised concerns about funding for further PFAS research, including investigations on how exposure to mixtures of the chemicals may impact human health. One of his federal grants for PFAS research was recently cut by the Trump administration, he said, and a colleague at Michigan State University studying PFAS on farms has also had his funding rescinded.
In addition to regulating PFAS by groups or as a class, Jones said the EPA should set pollution standards using what’s known as the “precautionary principle,” which doesn’t require definitive evidence about a chemical’s harms before it can be regulated. “In some countries, if you want to release a chemical into the environment you have to show it’s safe,” he said. “The U.S. usually takes the opposite approach and says, ‘You can use these chemicals … and if we find that there’s a problem, then we’ll come up and regulate [them].’”
Olson believes the EPA’s alterations to the PFAS rules are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision,” which says any revision the EPA proposes to a drinking water standard must be at least as protective of public health as the previous one. The law also caps compliance timelines at five years, whereas postponing the PFOS and PFOA compliance deadline to 2031 would give water utilities seven years. 
“Ultimately, we need to be phasing these chemicals out,” Olson added. “We have to turn off the spigot and stop using these things so that five generations from now, our great-great-great grandchildren won’t be dealing with them.”

The Senate Ways and Means Committee proposed an underlying budget that started at $61.32 billion, as Democrats forge ahead with their spending appetite despite modest state tax revenues and federal funding uncertainty.
The post Senators get “enough yeses” to add $43.5 mil to budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SENATORS PLOWED through more than half of their 1,000+ budget amendments during their first full day of deliberations Tuesday and recessed just before 8 p.m.The additions tacked on roughly $43.5 million onto the budget’s bottom line, according to Senate President Karen Spilka’s spokesperson Gray Milkowski. The Senate Ways and Means Committee proposed an underlying budget that started at $61.32 billion, as Democrats forge ahead with their spending appetite despite modest state tax revenues and federal funding uncertainty.The branch tackled 671 amendments Tuesday, adopting 301 proposals while rejecting 208 others, Spilka’s office said. Successful amendments included ones directing the Department of Public Health to create a task force focused on the continuity of abortion and abortion-related care in “the event of a loss of federal funding,” $150,000 for the Reproductive Equity Now Foundation to operate its free abortion legal hotline, and $220,000 for new perinatal mental health support programs for new parents, the office said in its end-of-day recap.Senators will resume deliberations Wednesday, with a new bundle of amendments available for review at 9 a.m. to address the remaining four budget categories, Majority Leader Cindy Creem said from the rostrum. Those topics include transportation, judiciary, public safety and local matters. Debate is planned to resume at 10 a.m.When senators recessed for their dinner break just after 5:30 p.m., Sen. Will Brownsberger told his colleagues they were at “mile 13” of budget deliberations. Leaning into his Boston Marathon reference, the Belmont Democrat said they had made it to the Scream Tunnel in Wellesley.The Senate had handled 530 out of 1,058 amendments before dinner, budget chief Sen. Michael Rodrigues told the News Service around 6:20 p.m.“So, it’s going very smoothly,” Rodrigues said. “Of course we can’t say yes to everything, but we say enough yeses that members are happy, and we’re accomplishing some great things.”Senators installed some guardrails around Department of Mental Health case managers without directly protecting endangered jobs. Gov. Maura Healey wants to slash that workforce in half to save money, and DMH is also eyeing a more flexible, open-access care model in which case managers are no longer paired up with specific clients.Under Sen. Cindy Friedman’s successful budget amendment (#536), DMH must submit monthly reports to the Legislature on the number of active and inactive client cases; the active and inactive caseload among workers; the number of case manager positions that are filled, vacant or on extended-leave status; target caseloads and encounters to meet client needs; the waitlist for case management services; and the number of applications that are accepted or denied for services, among other information. DMH must also notify the Legislature 90 days before changing its care delivery model and submit a “report and a catalogue of best practices for publicly-operated case management services.”Friedman, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Health Care Financing, told the News Service her amendment would not block the 170 case managers from being laid off.“Look, if they’re going to cut case managers, they’re going to cut,” Friedman said. “There’s not a whole lot — I mean, we could pass an amendment, but I think the Senate feels that there’s a labor dispute going on. But I’m much more focused on what they’re doing, and what they’re trying to do, and why they’re cutting caseworkers.”She called DMH’s open-access care model “absurd.”“The people that are DMH clients are the people who are the most vulnerable and have the most serious needs. It’s very hard to become a DMH client — they don’t make it easy,” Friedman continued. “So if you’re in that cohort of people, you are there because there is a crisis. And if you help people by giving crisis management and then you take it away, they’re going to go back to being in crisis.”Ahead of the debate, Sen. John Keenan withdrew his budget amendment (#433) that would have prevented DMH from reducing the workforce “below fiscal year 2025 case manager staffing levels.” The House had adopted that language in a consolidated budget amendment.“It was clear that there wasn’t enough support for that,” Keenan told the News Service. “So what we heard was that Sen. Friedman’s amendment would most likely pass.”The Senate Ways and Means Committee budget already allocated money to maintain operations at two health care facilities that Healey initially proposed closing: Pappas Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Canton and Pocasset Mental Health Center on Cape Cod. But senators more explicitly pledged state funding support Tuesday, as they unanimously voted for a Sen. Dylan Fernandes amendment (#543) to dedicate $31 million to Pappas and $4.8 million to Pocasset.Rodrigues said the amendment will not increase the budget’s bottom line, though the language clarifies the funding levels for the facilities in the budget.“We have really dire need for mental health resources,” Fernandes of Falmouth said on the Senate floor. “The Cape and Islands has one of the highest suicide rates in the commonwealth, 50 percent higher than the state average. In Plymouth County, we continue to see incidents of suicide above the state average, and people struggling with substance misuse disorder.”Working groups are also navigating the future of Pappas and Pocasset. Fernandes said stakeholders may evaluate how to handle the partial hospital program — which functioned similar to an outpatient program — that the state closed at Pocasset last year.“Does that mean expanding services? Around a third to a half of the Pocasset site was closed,” Fernandes told the News Service. “Does that mean that we can expand services there that have higher reimbursements to help sustain this facility in the long-term? What does it mean for interconnection with Cape Cod Hospital and other inpatient beds in the region?”Through a series of amendment bundles Tuesday, the Senate also added:$50,000 for the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence for “comprehensive educational programming”;
$250,000 for the Brookline Community Mental Health Center;
$300,000 for the International Institute of New England for “culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health services”;
An infectious disease elevated risk community outreach pilot program at the Department of Public Health for schools or early education programs that have not reached herd immunity against one or more “vaccine-preventable infectious diseases”;
$330,000 for a pilot program at Community Services to provide “medically-tailored” meals for veterans;
$25,000 for North Suffolk Community Services to coordinate and implement eviction sealing outreach;
$150,000 for a Greater New Bedford Community Health Center program to treat patients with “co-occurring mental health disorders by a nurse practitioner”;
$75,000 for Labouré College of Healthcare in Milton for an advanced Vocational Nursing English for Speakers of Other Languages program to boost the nursing pipeline;
$150,000 for the Southcoast Health New Beginnings Moms Do Care Program in New Bedford, which supports mothers and infants affected by perinatal substance exposure;
$75,000 to OpenCape Corporation to support “high-speed internet access” in Plymouth and Falmouth;
$250,000 for a grant program to support youth sports nonprofit programs primarily serving low-income or marginalized students;

Glenn Youngkin speaks with reporters in Richmond on May 2, 2025. (Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed onto a joint letter with other Republican governors in support of a “big beautiful bill” backed by President Donald Trump that is currently advancing through Congress and would cut $625 billion from Medicaid over the next decade if passed. 
The federal program helps states provide health care coverage to low-income people and those with disabilities. Democratic lawmakers, advocacy groups, Medicaid beneficiaries and some Republicans have cautioned against the proposal for months. 
“As Republican governors we stand UNITED in strong support of your One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” they wrote to Trump on May 20, with capitalization for emphasis. “This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival. It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
With billions in cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, education and clean energy programs funding potentially on the chopping block, the huge bill aims to bolster funding for border security efforts and military spending and support tax cuts elsewhere. 
While political opponents of Trump have lambasted his proposal for its tax cuts for the country’s highest earners, Youngkin and other governors in their letter state that “we cannot miss this chance to save taxpayers $1.6 trillion over the next ten years.”
They stressed in their letter how the overall package can “give working class families tax cuts worth thousands of dollars each.”
Those cuts could be achieved by expanding the standard deduction and the fulfillment of Trump’s campaign goals to eliminate taxes on tips or overtime pay for hourly and tipped workers. 
While eliminating taxes on tips has been hailed as a clear win for workers, the policy’s broader impact remains uncertain. Economists have raised concerns that employers would exploit the measure by shifting more of workers’ compensation to tips than wages. Late last year Youngkin announced plans to mirror Trump’s proposal in the state budget, but it didn’t prevail.
McClellan, Virginia Democrats warn of dire impact to state if proposed Medicaid cuts materialize

U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, has been a staunch critic of the cuts to Medicaid. She warned in a press call last week, after the proposal advanced through a committee she serves on, that “when you kick people off of their health insurance, that raises the cost for everybody else.”
She’d noted how uninsured people are more likely to avoid regular doctor appointments for checkups or to treat chronic conditions — resulting in emergency room visits when dire situations arise. As emergency rooms are federally-required to treat all patients, care for uninsured patients who cannot pay can become a shared financial burden on taxpayers.
Shortly after Youngkin’s joint letter was published, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger weighed in on social media Tuesday night. In a post to X, she emphasized that thousands of Virginians “will lose their healthcare because of this bill.”
“Virginians deserve a Governor who will stand up for their access to affordable healthcare,” she wrote. 
A spokesperson for Republican governor nominee and current lieutenant governor Winsome Earle-Sears declined the Mercury’s request to weigh in on the letter. 
Either Spanberger or Earle-Sears will become governor and each woman could play a role in shaping Virignia’s future state budget, which would likely need to address federal funding cuts to Medicaid if the bill succeeds this year.

Ainsworth, who is term-limited in his current office, said he would campaign for GOP candidates next year. 
“I will be on the campaign trail working alongside President Trump to help elect a strong, conservative governor and other Republican elected officials who will keep Alabama moving in the right direction,” he wrote. 
Though the lieutenant governor’s office is relatively powerless, Ainsworth had managed to raise large sums of money over the years from the Big Mules on Goat Hill, taking in $4.8 million between 2017 and today. 
According to campaign finance records, Progress PAC, the fundraising arm of the Business Council of Alabama, gave Ainsworth over $170,000 from 2017 to 2022. Alabama Forestry PAC gave Ainsworth just over $186,000 during that time; Alabama Power’s Employee PAC had given him $152,000. The Alabama Builders Association gave him $150,000.
Ainsworth had $1.3 million in his campaign account at the end of January, according to campaign finance records.
Ainsworth, 44, was first elected as lieutenant governor in 2018 after serving in the Alabama House of Representatives and re-elected in 2022. His term is set to end on Jan. 18, 2027. The Guntersville resident served one term in the Alabama House before becoming lieutenant governor.
Gov. Kay Ivey, who has served in the office since 2017, is term-limited. 
U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville has expressed interest in running for the governor’s office.

The state sees lower use each time it increases tobacco taxes. (Alvaro Medina Jurado/Getty Images)There’s no debate that significant price increases on tobacco products reduce smoking among adults and children.
A 2014 report by the Office of the Surgeon General called raising prices on cigarettes “one of the most effective tobacco control interventions” — especially among kids. Every 10% increase in the price of cigarettes reduces consumption by about 4% among adults and about 7% among youth, according to the American Lung Association.
But Nebraska hasn’t raised our cigarette tax since 2002, and this failure to act is costing Nebraska lives. At 64 cents per pack, Nebraska’s tobacco tax remains one of the lowest in the nation. We’re well behind peer states like Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota and Colorado and far behind the national average of $1.97 per pack. When considering inflation, Nebraska’s tobacco tax has actually decreased.
This is concerning because data show fewer adult tobacco users are seriously considering quitting, according to the 2023 Nebraska Adult Tobacco Survey. One of the key findings of the 2020 Smoking Cessation: A Report of the Surgeon General was that adult smoking cessation can be increased by raising the price of cigarettes.
While overall youth tobacco use in Nebraska has continued to decline, according to results of the 2023 Nebraska Youth Tobacco Survey, we at the Metro Omaha Tobacco Action Coalition (MOTAC) know that vapes and nicotine pouches in particular are designed to appeal to young people. Nebraska must remain vigilant to continue our momentum.
Tobacco’s impact on the health and well-being of Nebraskans is dire. In Nebraska, an estimated 2,500 people die prematurely as a result of tobacco use each year, resulting in an average loss of 10 years off their lives, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. At least 75,000 Nebraskans are suffering from at least one serious smoking-related illness.
Even people who do not use tobacco experience health effects. Secondhand smoke, which contains more than 7,000 chemicals and chemical compounds, is a proven cause of lung cancer, heart disease, serious respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis and asthma, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome. The U.S. Surgeon General has found that secondhand smoke is responsible for tens of thousands of U.S. deaths each year.
These health consequences extend to young Nebraskans, too. E-cigarettes, the most commonly used tobacco product among Nebraska middle and high school students, contain a high amount of nicotine, which is highly addictive. Nicotine harms the parts of an adolescent’s brain that control attention, learning, mood and impulse control, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Aerosol from e-cigarettes can also contain harmful, potentially cancer-causing chemicals and tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into lungs.
These health effects cost Nebraska taxpayers. Every year, Nebraska spends $900 in taxes per household for smoking-related costs, such as health care and loss of productivity. Smoking-related health care costs about $924 million in Nebraska each year.
Thus, significant increases in tobacco taxes not only save lives — they can help address Nebraska’s persistent property tax crisis, bringing in tens of millions in dollars in the coming years. Tobacco tax increases are a reliable, predictable source of substantial new revenue. And for current tobacco users who are impacted by increased taxes, it is imperative that the state continue the current state funding level to help Nebraskans quit and keep young people from starting.
Current proposals in the Nebraska Legislature to increase taxes on cigarettes, vapes and cigars are a clear win-win for public health and the public pocketbook. Raising the tax on a pack of cigarettes by $1 is projected to result in a 7.5% decrease in youth smoking. About 4,000 adults would quit smoking, and roughly 1,300 premature smoking-caused deaths would be prevented. Nebraska should keep taking proactive steps to prevent tobacco use, save lives and protect the health of our communities.

However, the end of the program does not mean the city’s pipes are lead free, and with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Monday decision lifting the emergency order placed on the city’s drinking water, Pastor Allen Overton of Concerned Pastors for Social Action said the hosts were conscious of how they used the word celebrate. 
“We’re here today to celebrate a huge milestone in the case that we brought back in 2016 against the city of Flint and the state of Michigan officials. After more than eight years, the court ordered lead pipe replacement program has been completed, with nearly 11,000 lead pipes removed. That should be the point,” Overton said.

While this milestone is not all of the justice the community deserves, it is a huge achievement, he said. 
“This community has been through so much. We were misled by our leaders. We had to take matters into our own hands by collecting water samples, educating ourselves about lead contamination and ultimately suing to force the government to fix the problem that they created. Thanks to the persistence of the people of Flint and our partners, the Natural Resource Defense Council and the ACLU, we are finally at the end of this project,” Overton said. 
In April of 2014, the City of Flint switched its water source from Detroit-supplied Lake Huron water to the Flint River but failed to properly treat the water with corrosion control, corroding the pipes and leaching lead into the city’s water. Failure to treat the water with proper levels of chlorine also led to outbreaks of Legionnaires’ Disease, killing 12 and sickening at least 87 people between June 2014 and October 2015. 
In March 2016, Flint resident Melissa Mays, alongside the NRDC, the ACLU of Michigan, the NRDC and Concerned Pastors for Social Action filed a suit in federal court to compel the city and the state to comply with federal testing and treatment requirements for lead and to replace all lead pipes within the city. That November, federal judge David M. Lawson ordered city and state officials to provide residents with either a faucet filter or regular door-to-door deliveries of bottled water. 
In March 2017, residents secured a settlement agreement with Flint and the state of Michigan, promising to replace all lead lines within the city. While the initial deadline for replacing the lines was set for early 2020, residents repeatedly found themselves back in court, with Lawson in 2024 finding the city in contempt of a previous court order requiring the city to meet certain milestones in replacing lead pipes. 
After replacing nearly 11,000 lead lines, ACLU of Michigan Acting Legal Director Bonsitu Kitaba said the city has nearly completed its obligations for the settlement. However, it has not replaced every lead line in the city, with several hundreds of pipes left to replace in vacant homes and some residents declining to have their home checked or their pipes replaced, Kitaba said.

The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years, with the city committing to replacing any remaining lead lines this year, Kitaba said, encouraging any residents who need their lead lines replaced to call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.nrdc
Addie Rolnick, an attorney with the NRDC noted that the settlement requirements will remain until March 2026, meaning the city must continue providing filter cartridges and water test kits until then. After the settlement concludes, the city will still be required to replace all lead pipes and must monitor lead levels in the water and keep them below the state’s 12 part per billion threshold under the Michigan Lead and Copper rule. 
While taking questions from community members, Rolnick emphasized that there is no safe level of lead in the drinking water, encouraging residents to continue using EPA-certified filters. 
As long as there is lead attached to the system, it will continue to impact pipes throughout the city, Mays said.

EPA announcement leaves residents seeking answers
While Mays, Overton and members of the NRDC and ACLU answered resident’s questions, Aonie Gilcreast, 74, said residents were getting mixed messages about their water with the EPA’s latest announcement. 
 “Collectively, we don’t really know what to believe. We don’t trust the system,” he said. 
While Overton clarified that the agency still held some concerns, that issue was a fight for the next day. 
“If there’s a problem with the EPA and the decision that the EPA has made, then we need to have a conversation with them offline to find out what it is that we can do, if there’s something that we can do,” Overton later told attendees, emphasizing that that work would be driven by community members and their relationship with the attorneys. 
Overton later told the Michigan Advance that they had some concerns about the EPA’s decision, agreeing with the NRDC that residents should continue to use filters as long as there’s any level of lead in the system. 
“Because we do have lead that still remains in our system, it would be destructive to tell people that we don’t need the filters anymore. So we’re going to begin that fight to find out exactly what is going on with that, to make sure that we keep things above board, that our residents are protected [and] taken care of,” Overton said.

“We’ve been bamboozled by the EPA as well as EGLE. So we want to make sure that what they’re saying are the facts, they have the documentation that they’ve done, all the checklists are checked off, everything’s been checked off to make sure that what they’re saying is correct and it’s best for this community,” he said. 
Mays additionally raised concerns about President Donald Trump and his administration’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations, including a potential roll back of requirements for all the lead pipes in the nation to be replaced over the next 13 years, accompanied by lower limits for lead in drinking water.
“Flint is an example of right now what’s happening in the country. We have people trying to run government as a business, and who are appointing unelected, uneducated people like Elon Musk and [the Department of Government Efficiency] to go in and gut all these regulations,” said Mays, who likened the government initiative’s cost-based decision making to the decisions made by Flint’s emergency manager, ultimately sparking the water crisis.

Bill Lee is declining to give death row inmates a reprieve as they challenge the state’s new protocol for lethal injections.
Attorneys for Oscar Smith, who is to be put to death Thursday for the 1989 murders of his estranged wife and her two sons, said the governor denied the request this week of death row prisoners even though a trial on the execution process won’t be held until January 2026. Inmates are raising questions about the protocol’s constitutionality and say “serious questions” remain about the safety and efficacy of the lethal chemicals and the execution team’s qualifications.
Lee put a hold on executions in 2022, just minutes before Smith was to be executed, because of errors in the Tennessee Department of Correction protocol. 
“Gov. Lee, has in the past, used his power to prevent Tennesseans from making irreparable mistakes. We had hoped he would do it again. There is no principled reason to allow the state to resume executions before the court has an opportunity to hear all the evidence about whether TDOC is sourcing its lethal chemicals legally, whether those chemicals are contaminated, unexpired, and undiluted, and whether the execution team is capable of carrying out its duties competently and constitutionally. Tennessee can do better than this,” said Kelley Henry, an attorney for the prisoners.
A Davidson County chancellor turned down the state’s request May 15 to dismiss most of the prisoners’ claims, including a constitutional challenge to the lethal injection protocol. A court order also is pending on a state request for a protective order that would shield the identity of the supplier of lethal drugs and execution team members.

Gerry Connolly, D-Va., has died, after an extended battle with cancer that weeks ago prompted him to not seek reelection to Congress. He was 75 and “passed away peacefully at his home” Wednesday morning, according to a statement from his family. 
Connolly was elected to Congress in 2008, representing Virginia’s 11th District, anchored in Fairfax County. He had previously served on the Fairfax Board of Supervisors from 1995 to 2008, spending the last five years of his term as chairman. He leaves a 30-plus-year legacy as an advocate of progressive legislation, and served as ranking member of the U.S. House Oversight Committee until weeks before his death.
Longtime NoVa congressman Gerry Connolly will not seek reelection after cancer resurgence

Democratic Party of Virginia Chairman Lamont Bagby joined a chorus of state and federal lawmakers expressing condolences over Connolly’s death Wednesday morning. 
“Congressman Gerry Connolly embodied what it means to be a public servant. Over decades of leadership — first as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and then as a Congressman for 16 years — he demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the people of Fairfax County, Northern Virginia, and beyond,” Bagby wrote.
U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner, D-Va., said in a statement he was “heartbroken” over Connolly’s death.
“I’ve known Gerry for more than 35 years. To me, he exemplified the very best of public service. Just this past Sunday, I was honored to join his wife Smitty, daughter Caitlin, and the Fairfax community in celebrating his decades of service. While Gerry couldn’t be there in person, his presence was felt throughout the room. He was there in spirit, as he always is when people come together in the name of service and progress.”
Despite his declining health, in his last months Connolly pushed to maximize public access to information that impacts the average American’s life. 
Less than a month ago, Connolly sharply questioned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after thousands of the public health agency’s staff was terminated, including the entirety of personnel responsible for responding to Freedom of Information Act requests. The layoffs were part of President Donald Trump’s administration’s massive slate of federal spending cuts, facilitated by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
“The elimination of staff responsible for facilitating FOIA strongly implies an effort by the Administration to prevent the public from obtaining information about their government that they are entitled to request. I urge you to provide detailed information responsive to the requests included in this letter to bring transparency to the FOIA operations within the CDC,” Connolly wrote.  
U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Va., who represents the state’s 4th District, called Connolly a “servant leader” who “fought for pragmatic policies that would improve the lives of his constituents.”
“Throughout my time in elected office, Gerry has been a defining and passionate voice in Virginia politics. I am grateful to have been able to call him a friend, mentor, and colleague. I will always treasure our talks on the House floor and will miss him greatly,” McClellan wrote in a statement.
Connolly’s time in federal office was defined by his focus on government reform, technology and international affairs. He served as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation in previous years, helping to craft legislation on cyber security, digital privacy and government-wide federal information technology management and innovation.
Many of the political leaders commenting on Connolly’s death Wednesday said although his federal service and policies helped improve public life nationwide, his service to the state of Virginia remains preeminent in his legacy. 
“From transforming Northern Virginia’s transportation infrastructure – making transit more accessible for all – to shaping America’s role on the global stage, Gerry’s legacy reaches from local neighborhoods to the halls of Congress and across the world,” Virginia House Speaker Don Scott wrote in a statement. “It is with profound sadness that I mourn the passing of one of Virginia’s most dedicated public servants.”
Connolly, who lived in Fairfax, is survived by his wife Smitty and daughter Caitlin.

Shigellosis is a highly infectious gastrointestinal infection caused by a type of bacteria called Shigella. New Mexico recorded more 202 cases during the outbreak, including more than half in people experiencing homelessness, while others included daycare workers and attending children.
Nearly 70% of people with the infection were hospitalized, and there was one death. Research published Tuesday found the infection spread into the zoo, causing six primate deaths.
The outbreak is the first to be caused by drug-resistant bacteria and was the largest in the state.
The study’s researchers urge further surveillance due to the “threat of antimicrobial resistant organisms to vulnerable human and [non-human primate] populations.”
The infection is passed through contact with the bacteria — found in feces —including contact with other surfaces; contaminated food or water; or person-to-person contact. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to treat severe cases, but growing drug resistance is limiting treatment options.
Anti-microbial resistance is growing in the U.S. Shigella populations. In 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned  that about 5% of Shigella infections resisted antibiotic treatments compared to 0% in 2015.
That figure included the New Mexico outbreak, from which researchers found that the bacterial infections were resistant to multiple drugs including the “first line treatment option which led to treatment failures in human and [non-human primate] populations.”
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the Shigella strain in the New Mexico outbreak, which included the 202 New Mexico cases, 15 out of state cases and four non-human primates, to help understand how the outbreak spread.
Shortly after human cases were identified in May of 2021, 15 primates at the zoo displayed shigellosis. Four primates —  a gorilla and three siamangs, including a mother and her 2-month old baby — died of Shigella infection. Almost a year later in July 2022, a chimpanzee tested positive and also died.
The only surviving siamang was transferred to another zoo, but despite testing negative, infected others there with shigella, was transferred back and ultimately euthanized.
Researchers don’t have an answer for how the infection spread from humans to primates in the zoo, hypothesizing it could have spread through objects or from houseflies as a vector. Further tests ruled out municipal water and zoo staff did not report Shigellosis-like illness.
“It may have been introduced, indirectly, when a zoo visitor threw a contaminated item into the enclosure,” researchers wrote. “It may also have been introduced on cardboard tubes used as enrichment items, although this common zoo practice was discontinued as part of the initial response to the 2021 primate infections, and cannot explain the 2022 chimpanzee infection.”
The latest update in the outbreak was in September 2024, when the the New Mexico Department of Health reported four additional Shigella cases, mostly impacting people experiencing homelessness. The study’s authors included researchers from the state Department of Health, the University of New Mexico, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the City of Albuquerque.

They have different ideas about how to do so.,"Federal lawmakers from New York and Connecticut want to regulate the cryptocurrency stablecoin. They have different ideas about what that should look like.
On Monday, the U.S. Senate advanced legislation to create the country’s first regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to the value of a stable currency, like the U.S. dollar. The legislation is supported by the crypto industry.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a former securities lawyer, is the lead Democratic co-sponsor of the bill.
“A product of months of bipartisan negotiations, the GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar,” Gillibrand said in a statement. “The bill takes aim at illicit finance, places limitations on Big Tech, puts in place ethical guardrails and defends national security.”
Monday’s vote was for cloture, which doesn’t pass the legislation out of the Senate. It limits debate on the bill and makes way for it to go to a final vote.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) voted against the bill, citing that it didn’t do anything to prevent President Donald Trump from profiting off his stablecoin, USD1. Murphy wants to add amendments to that extent, but Republicans control the Senate and are unlikely to advance them.
“The GENIUS Act exempts President Trump from the ethics laws on stablecoin. It allows him to continue his corruption,” Murphy posted on X. “Some of the Democrats who voted to advance the bill tonight want this changed before the final vote. So there is still time to fix this – if we speak up.”
U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) also voted against the legislation.

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, pointedly shares budget insights on agriculture and law enforcement budget priorities with Trump administration officials.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, pressed U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel to consider implications of Trump administration budget decisions on the future of the state's agriculture economy and the necessity of emphasizing collaboration among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran pressed Trump administration officials on federal budget and personnel decisions by framing inquiries in terms of potential threats to the farm economy and public safety in Kansas.
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins were on the receiving end of Moran’s questions during recent Senate hearings.
Moran inquired during an appropriations subcommittee hearing about implications of a recommended $545 million cut in expenditures that could eliminate 1,300 FBI jobs. The GOP senator said lawmakers were told reductions would be accomplished by ending duplicative intelligence gathering, initiatives tied to diversity, equity and inclusion, and projects championed by Democratic President Joe Biden.
“Is that accurate?” Moran said. “Is that capable of being done? We can find this in what I suppose most people around here call waste, fraud and abuse? Or, does it have real consequences to the level of personnel and the capabilities of meeting the mission of the FBI?”
Patel said the objective of reorganization at the FBI was to “make the mission work on whatever budget we’re given.”
Moran said an overall force reduction at the federal law enforcement agency could weaken public safety in Kansas.
“Fewer FBI special agents, intelligence analysts and professional staff could hinder the bureau in executing the president’s commitment to making our communities safe,” Moran said. “Our law enforcement, whether state, local or federal, keep our nation safe and carry out justice.”
 
‘Is that true?’
Moran, chairperson of the Senate’s commerce, justice and science appropriations subcommittee, asked about Patel’s initiative to move FBI positions out of Washington, D.C. The senator said the FBI might shift up to 40 agents to Kansas.
Moran urged Patel to not concentrate new personnel in FBI offices in Garden City, Manhattan, Wichita and Topeka or to curtail collaboration with local law enforcement.
“While your decentralizing Washington, I don’t want to shortchange the field office, but I want to make sure the field office doesn’t then shortchange the other aspects of law enforcement in our state,” Moran said. “We should see an increase in FBI participation, in partnership, with local law enforcement as a result of this change in policy? Is that true?”
Patel said the FBI didn’t intend to transfer agents by “throwing darts on a map.” The FBI would concentrate staff transfers in areas with higher incidence of violent crime, he said. The director said geography of sparsely populated states would be a factor in assignment of agents.
“We aren’t sending more agents to LA just because it’s LA,” Patel said.
 
Insufficient USDA personnel
In terms of agriculture policy, Moran shared with USDA Secretary Rollins a perspective on President Donald Trump’s decision to terminate thousands of probationary federal employees. The senator emphasized the detrimental result of personnel cuts designed to “right-size, downsize, whatever the right words are” the Farm Service Agency and other USDA offices in the state.
“We love the circumstance when a young man or woman out of college returns home and goes to work for USDA in the county office,” Moran said. “We do not have sufficient personnel in those county offices today. Secretary Rollins, will you pay particular attention to making certain that county offices, where farmers sit across the table from USDA employees, are sufficiently staffed?”
Hollins said it was important to keep in mind USDA was formed to serve interests of farmers and ranchers. The Trump administration was focused on delivering economic prosperity to agriculture, she said.
“As President Trump is working to make America great again and restore prosperity across the country, my role in that is to ensure that rural America sees a level of prosperity that perhaps we haven’t seen in our lifetimes,” she said.
Moran asked Hollins to outline USDA’s vision for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan. The $1.2 billion federal laboratory was built to research biological threats transmitted from animals to humans, including foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever.
“Tell me or get me a report on NBAF’s operational status,” Moran said.
Hollins said the Trump administration was committed to moving NBAF forward “in a way that serves all of America.”
 
Mission ‘more urgent’
Moran, who co-chairs the Senate Hunger Caucus, asked Hollis to provide assurances USDA was interested in preserving the U.S. Food for Peace program and the McGovern-Dole Food for Education program in wake of the Trump administration’s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Hollis said she’d spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about the programs, which had for decades relied on surplus U.S.-grown food to save lives abroad. She said USDA would comply if Congress passed and Trump signed a bill authorizing the transfer.
“No surprisingly,” she said, “I don’t want to get ahead of my boss.”
Moran said the U.S. food programs were “the difference between life and death for millions of people around the world and has made circumstances better for farmers here at home.”
He argued the mission of international food distribution was increasingly urgent with more than 730 million people facing chronic hunger.
“It was Kansas farmers who came up with the idea for Food for Peace as a moral and commonsense solution to prevent excess American food from going to waste and using it to feed the hungry across the globe,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jerry-Moran-at-KU2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 10:06:27.646028

(By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The only Maine police department that has contracted with federal authorities to assist with immigration enforcement is pausing its agreement to see if the Maine Legislature votes to ban such contracts.
Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam announced Tuesday night during a Select Board meeting that her department is adopting a “wait-and-see approach” to credentialing its officers under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program.
“This decision reflects the need to see how the legislation ends up playing out in Augusta,” Putnam said, referencing LD 1259, which had a public hearing on Monday. 
Two bills, LD 1259 and LD 1971, would prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities. LD 1259 would do so by explicitly prohibiting contracts with such authorities, while LD 1971 would place restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements.
Based on Putnam’s brief comments at the meeting, it is unclear exactly what the pause means. Putnam could not be reached by the time of publication. In early May, she told Maine Morning Star that Wells officers had begun the training for the program, which is online.
After the 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling, President Donald Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. 
Immigration enforcement hearing highlights lack of protocol for local, federal collaboration

Putnam and Police Capt. Kevin Chabot previously told Maine Morning Star that they entered into the agreement to take advantage of a training opportunity and streamline work.
On Tuesday night, Putnam said, “I would like to reiterate one more time that at no point was there ever any intent on doing proactive immigration enforcement.”
Wells remains the only local agency to have entered the program in Maine. Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, applied for the program but withdrew its application after community pushback.
Community pushback in Wells is continuing in light of the pause.
“Our group, although appreciative of a pause, really is looking for Wells Police to withdraw from the contract,” Wells resident Peg Duddy told Maine Morning Star Wednesday morning. 
Duddy and other residents have been calling for termination of the agreement during Select Board meetings, including Tuesday night after Putnam announced the pause. The group has also been collecting signatures from Wells residents in favor of withdrawing and had more than 350 as of Wednesday morning, Duddy said.  
These residents have said they don’t want their local force collaborating with an agency that has been accused of disregarding due process, for local police funding to go toward federal enforcement and possibly litigation, or for Wells to be known as an unwelcoming place for immigrants. 
However, other residents have commended local police for entering the federal partnership, showing that the matter has divided the community. 
The two bills heard on Monday come after Republican legislators presented a conflicting bill last month that would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law. 
None of these bills have received votes yet and there is only a month left until lawmakers are expected to conclude their work for the first year of Maine’s two-year legislative session. One of the bill sponsors, Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor), told Maine Morning Star that the intention is for the Legislature to make its decisions on the issue this year.

Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, speaks to the Alaska House of Representatives on Friday, April 25, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature adjourned its regular session on Tuesday without finishing work on a major elections bill or a bill reimposing limits on cash donations to election candidates.
House Bill 16, the campaign finance bill, and Senate Bill 64, the elections reform legislation, are expected to return when the Legislature resumes work in January, and they could be part of a wave of major legislation that advances through the Capitol early next year.
“We got really close with the election bill, and I think the prospects for passing next year are good,” said Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham.
“I expect that we may have a legitimate shot at passing that bill early next session,” he said.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, said that both bills could have gotten legislative approval, but they would have been vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
“We were told flat out, the governor would veto it, by someone in the governor’s office,” Wielechowski said.
The governor’s communications office did not respond to an email asking whether Wielechowski’s statement was accurate.
If enacted, HB 16 would, among other things, limit Alaskans to $2,000 in donations per candidate in each two-year election cycle. Alaska currently has no limit on the amount of money a person can donate to a candidate. A ballot measure is slated for the 2026 election, but the restrictions could come into place earlier, if the Legislature approves.
SB 64, as currently written, is a broad election reform bill that includes significant changes to the way the state deals with absentee voting.
“I think we are poised and in a position where there will be a number of pieces of significant legislation passed next year, probably early on in the session, and we will be dealing with a number of veto overrides during the session,” Wielechowski said. 
Wielechowski said the possibilities include an elections bill, a campaign finance bill, the long-awaited pension restoration bill and a bill taxing businesses whose owners are taxed separately from the businesses, known as C-corporations.
To avoid a veto, Wielechowski and others said they intend to work with Republicans in the House and Senate minorities to try to garner support for a compromise that could win a veto-proof majority of votes in the Legislature.
It takes 40 votes to override a policy veto; the coalition majorities in the House and Senate have a combined 35 members, meaning that additional Republican support would be needed.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said she thinks changes to Senate Bill 64 are needed for any compromise.
“I was really proud of our finance team for helping stop that version of the bill, because it really had some things in there that were not productive and were not representative of our values and what we think should be in an elections bill,” she said. 
“I do think there is room to make it better. I just think we weren’t a part of that discussion (on advancing the bill), but I think they realized that we have to be, moving forward.”
On the campaign finance bill, getting a veto-proof majority is “possible,” said Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage and the bill’s sponsor. 
“I’ve personally spoken to a number of minority members who recognize the need for limits. They were disappointed as well that the bill wasn’t taken up. We do have a very high veto threshold, so it’ll be a challenge,” Schrage said. “But as I remind legislators all the time around here, this is going to happen one way or another when this goes to the ballot, so I think we have an opportunity to save the time and expense and put this in place ourselves. If we don’t, Alaskans will take action.”

State legislators are clashing with Gov. Gavin Newsom and his call to speed up a $20 billion state water project. 
During the unveiling of his updated state budget plan last week, Newsom called for legislation that would accelerate the Delta Conveyance Project, which aims to reroute more water from Northern California southward. That water would bypass the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and reach about 30 million people living mostly in Southern California, as well as farmland. 
Because the immense project faces several legal, environmental and permitting hurdles, the governor wants the Legislature to pass a bill that would, among other things, simplify the permitting process and expedite judicial reviews of lawsuits challenging the project.
But legislators whose districts would be affected by the proposed tunnel object because they say it is too costly and would have devastating effects on the environment and nearby communities without providing more water storage.
On Tuesday a handful of lawmakers from the 15-member bipartisan Legislative Delta Caucus, as well as environmental advocates and tribal leaders from the Delta, gathered at the state Capitol to denounce Newsom’s directive. 

Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Suisun City Democrat and co-chairperson of the Delta Caucus: “Shifting water from one farming region to benefit another farming region doesn’t solve our water crisis. It only makes it worse.”

The caucus also sent a letter last week to the governor and other legislative leaders pushing back against the bill proposal.
But some do support the governor’s call to action, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker. Though they were outnumbered at an Assembly budget hearing Tuesday by those who opposed the project, proponents include water agencies in the Bay Area and Southern California, which argue that the Delta Tunnel would make their water supplies more reliable.

Study finds ‘forever chemicals’ in SF Bay fish

The next time you eat fish caught in the San Francisco Bay, you could also be consuming a mouthful of harmful contaminants.
Striped bass, white sturgeon and other fish collected throughout the San Francisco Bay between 2009 and 2019 contained potentially harmful levels of “forever chemicals,” according to a report published Tuesday by the scientific journal ES&T Water.
As Rachel explains, these chemicals — which seep into the soil from landfills, airports, sewage treatment plants and other industrial sites, and then wash into waterways — are linked to various health risks such as cancer and heart disease.
Many people fish in the bay, including Asian immigrants, other people of color and low-income people. Though they do not sell the fish commercially, some rely on the fish for subsistence.
State officials have established health advisories for other contaminants in fish, such as mercury, but not for forever chemicals.

Religious exceptions show limits of state abortion protections

Though California officials often tout the state as a “safe haven” for reproductive rights — especially after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections in 2022 — a legal battle involving a Catholic hospital underscores the limits of California’s abortion rights, writes CalMatter’ Kristen Hwang.
Providence St. Joseph Hospital refused to provide an abortion last year after Anna Nusslock arrived at the Eureka hospital bleeding and in pain, according to lawsuits filed by Nusslock and California Attorney General Rob Bonta. Doctors said Nusslock needed immediate treatment for her miscarriage, but Providence refused to intervene because her twins still had “fetal heart tones.”
Providence argues that it provided appropriate care and that its actions are protected by the U.S. Constitution. Catholic hospitals operate 1 in 5 maternity wards in California. While they aren’t required to provide abortions if they morally object to them, they must provide emergency services, under state law, to patients who request help whose life may be in danger.

Their policies generally prohibit abortion, even in miscarriage, as long as a heartbeat can be detected.","In summary
Catholic hospitals run 20% of California’s maternity wards. Their policies generally prohibit abortion, even in miscarriage, as long as a heartbeat can be detected. 


Anna Nusslock never wanted to be the face of a new kind of reproductive rights battle in California, but when a small Catholic hospital refused to provide an abortion that would end her miscarriage, Nusslock girded herself for a long and difficult conflict.
Nusslock felt her civil rights were being violated, she said, even as she lay in the hospital bed curled in on herself, bleeding and mourning the loss of her twin girls. The doctor had said that her pregnancy needed to be terminated immediately to protect her from infection and other serious complications but hospital policy prohibited it, according to two lawsuits filed by Nusslock and California Attorney General Rob Bonta.
“I am planning to fight this for the rest of my life,” Nusslock said in an interview with CalMatters.
Both complaints allege that Providence, the Catholic health system that owns St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka, illegally denied Nusslock emergency abortion care and discharged her instead. They also allege that multiple pregnant women have been denied abortions at St. Joseph Hospital during medical emergencies.
The disputes playing out in a small courtroom in Eureka highlight the limits of California’s efforts to protect abortion rights since the Supreme Court in 2022 repealed federal protections granted under Roe vs. Wade. They also reveal geographic disparities in patients’ access to reproductive health care after dozens of California hospitals shuttered their maternity wards over the past decade. 
Providence has denied the state’s allegations and argued that it provided appropriate care to Nusslock. It contends that its actions are protected by religious liberties that are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Humboldt County Superior Court Judge Timothy Canning earlier this month rejected a bid by Providence to dismiss the state’s lawsuit. Providence has filed a request to dismiss Nusslock’s civil suit, which is ongoing.
Catholic companies own about 13% of hospitals in California, but operate 20% of the state’s maternity wards, according to a CalMatters analysis of state data. In the rural northern counties, they represent an even greater share at 35%. 
Large corporations such as CommonSpirit (Dignity), Providence, Trinity and Scripps are the most prominent Catholic health care systems in the state.

In Humboldt County where Nusslock lives, Providence now owns the only hospital with an obstetrics department. The next closest maternity ward is 86 miles north along a winding, mostly two-lane stretch of Highway 1.
Last year, Nusslock arrived at Providence St. Joseph Hospital bleeding and in pain but still hopeful her pregnancy could be saved, according to the state’s complaint. Her water had broken at 15 weeks – too early for the twins to survive on their own – and tests indicated Nusslock had an infection and high blood pressure, the complaint says. 
Multiple doctors said her condition was dangerous and she needed immediate treatment but Providence refused to intervene because her twins still had fetal heart tones, according to the complaint. Nusslock was discharged with a bucket and towels “in case something happens in the car,” according to the complaint and a declaration filed by Nusslock.
Nusslock’s husband drove her to another hospital about 20 minutes away where she began hemorrhaging and underwent immediate surgery, according to court documents. That hospital, Mad River Community Hospital in Arcata, has since permanently closed its labor and delivery ward, leaving St. Joseph alone in the county. 
California’s constitution protects abortion rights, but religiously affiliated hospitals, clinics and individual providers are not required to provide them if they have moral objections. State law, however, requires hospitals to provide emergency services to any person who requests help whose life may be in danger or at risk of “serious injury or illness.”

In an unsigned statement, a Providence spokesperson said the hospital is clear about not performing elective abortions but does allow “medically necessary interventions to protect pregnant patients who are miscarrying or facing serious life-threatening conditions” in an emergency. 
“This is consistent with the California Emergency Services Law and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. It is also consistent with the Catholic Ethical and Religious Directives, which include discussion of the importance of the physician-patient relationship as well as the circumstances in which certain medical procedures that could result in fetal death may be allowed in a Catholic hospital,” according to the statement provided to CalMatters.
The Catholic Health Association, a trade group representing Catholic health facilities, did not respond to repeated questions about personal belief protections and the expansion of Catholic hospitals.
Religious liberty at heart of hospital’s defense
On a rainy day in February, Harvey Rochman, lead attorney for Providence, argued that religious freedoms protect Providence’s alleged actions.
“The elephant in the room so to speak on this case is there is no court that has ordered a Catholic hospital to perform an abortion under circumstances that the hospital has determined is contrary to the hospital’s faith,” Rochman said during the hearing in Eureka.
The hospital denies that it discriminated against Nusslock or improperly denied care to her. Rochman argued that federal law allows secular hospitals to transfer patients if they do not have the expertise or technical ability to perform a procedure, which is no different from a faith-based hospital saying it cannot perform a procedure that “contravenes” its beliefs.
“The current jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court…is the religious rights have the same significance as the secular,” Rochman said during the hearing.
Catholic hospitals nationwide must adhere to the “Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services” developed by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The directives prohibit abortion in almost all circumstances.

Martine D’Agostino, a deputy attorney general representing the state, argued that the case was about Providence St. Joseph Hospital denying women emergency health care “at great risk to their lives.”
State law prohibits hospitals from transferring patients for non-medical reasons, such as lack of insurance. D’Agostino argued that St. Joseph Hospital did not stabilize Nusslock and illegally discharged her.
“The record details harrowing experiences of several women who were turned away from St. Joseph’s emergency department,” D’Agostino said. “The attorney general brought this case to ensure that St. Joseph Hospital follows the law that emergency health care must be provided to women of this county.”
In declarations filed with the court, multiple doctors allege that other St. Joseph patients have experienced close calls similar to Nusslock’s miscarriage. 
One doctor who delivers babies at Providence St. Joseph Hospital said in a declaration that he has had three patients other than Nusslock who needed emergency pregnancy terminations during miscarriages that he was not able to carry out. The declaration states “…the Chaplain told me, that under no circumstances was I to terminate a pregnancy at Providence Hospital.”
Another doctor who later treated Nusslock at Mad River Community Hospital said one to two patients each year would come to the hospital’s now-closed obstetrics department having been turned away from Providence in the midst of a miscarriage.
Another woman has anonymously filed a civil lawsuit in Humboldt Superior Court against Providence alleging similar circumstances to Nusslock. In February, lawyers for Providence filed papers asking a judge to dismiss the case.
Differences in how hospitals treat miscarriage
Although Nusslock’s case is not unique, experts say patient experiences at Catholic hospitals vary widely. 
“People always ask me ‘Why are people not dying all over the place?’ And it’s because it’s not exactly that extreme,” said Lori Freedman, a sociologist and bioethicist at UC San Francisco who has extensively researched patient and doctor experiences at Catholic health systems.
Frequently, doctors at Catholic institutions, many of whom are not Catholic, find workarounds to prevent patients from dying, Freedman said. An ethics committee headed by a priest or other religious figure at each hospital decides in the moment whether doctors can intervene. They may wait until the woman develops a fever (a sign of infection), until her bleeding increases or until the fetus dies, Freedman said. 
The Ethical and Religious Directives at Catholic hospitals allow pregnancy termination for a “proportionately serious pathological condition of a pregnant woman,” but ethics committees at each hospital can have different interpretations of where to draw the line, Freedman said.
This approach, however, is often shocking to obstetricians in non-religious hospitals, Freedman said.
“When you talk to someone in a really high-quality obstetric service, their jaw drops because they’re like, ‘Well it’s not just die or not die,’” Freedman said. “What kind of level of suffering and risk are you going to require, before the intervention you know is going to happen is allowed to happen?”

The Catholic Health Association states in a policy brief that “Our deeply held religious and moral convictions are the source of both the work we do and the limits on what we will do.” 
Those religious and moral convictions include a mandate to continue the “healing ministry of Christ,” to care for the poor, and to advocate for marginalized groups like immigrants, according to the Ethical and Religious Directives. 
They also state that the “Catholic health care ministry is rooted in a commitment to promote and defend human dignity; this is the foundation of its concern to respect the sacredness of every human life from the moment of conception until death.”
Maryam Guiahi, an obstetrician in Santa Barbara who has previously worked in Catholic institutions in Chicago, said that’s where Catholic policies begin to conflict with modern secular medical ethics that place different emphasis on patient autonomy and avoiding harm.
In cases like Nusslock’s, in which the amniotic fluid sac breaks before the fetus is viable, terminating the pregnancy is typically the safest option and the standard of care, Guiahi said.
Guiahi said Catholic hospitals sometimes don’t allow doctors to tell patients that an abortion is an option.
“I’ve been in secular institutions and we can give that information. We can let people decide what they want, and some people will choose to continue and hope and see what happens, but other women don’t want to go through that,” Guiahi said.
Not telling patients all of the risks and options compromises their ability to consent and can lead to avoidable complications like infection and hemorrhaging, Guiahi said.
Guiahi said she never saw a patient die after being denied an emergency abortion at the Catholic hospital she worked at, but sometimes patients would come back septic and require care in the intensive care unit. 
“To me, medicine is about ‘to do no harm.’ I don’t know many medical situations where we wait till people get sick in order to intervene,” Guiahi said.
Moving to have a baby
Nusslock is making plans to leave Eureka during her next pregnancy. She and her husband still desperately want to start a family, but she can’t drive past Providence St. Joseph Hospital without getting dizzy. She said she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. 
“I still have that voice in the back of my head just screaming, ‘you’re bleeding to death,’” Nusslock said.
Most likely Nusslock said she’ll find a place in the Bay Area to live during her pregnancy.
Having few options to give birth reflects a larger loss of maternity services in California. The northern counties, including where Nusslock lives, have lost a third of their birthing hospitals since 2012, according to a CalMatters database on maternity care.
Statewide, 59 hospitals have stopped delivering babies in the same time period, creating broad swaths of maternity deserts particularly in rural and low-income communities. 
Nearly 80% of those closures have been secular hospitals, increasing the influence of Catholic health care.

During the February court hearing, Providence lawyer Rochman said that a core mission of the Eureka hospital is to keep labor and delivery services available “when it may not be financially sensible to do so.”
In a statement, a Providence spokesperson said “providing high-quality labor and delivery services” is a “top priority” for the organization in Humboldt County and throughout the nation.
But having an operating maternity ward doesn’t mean all services are available. The Ethical and Religious Directives also prohibit the use of contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, including sterilization for both males and females, and in vitro fertilization.
Josie Urbina, an obstetrician with UC San Francisco Health who specializes in complex family planning, said this creates an unequal patchwork of services in the state.
“It’s unfortunate that in rural parts of California, which happen to be dominated by religious hospitals, that the standard of care is not being followed,” Urbina said. “It’s really just detrimental to patient care.”
For Nusslock, who moved to Eureka 10 years ago and quickly fell in love with the towering redwoods and small-town feel, the lawsuits are about ensuring her experience doesn’t happen to anyone else, she said in an interview with CalMatters.
“These are good people. These are people worth protecting,” Nusslock said. “If they’re going to give me an opportunity to speak for them and fight for them, I’m going to take every opportunity I can.”

Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers representing the Delta say Newsom is trying to upend existing water rights and land acquisition laws, while the governor says “we’re done with barriers.”


Fifteen California lawmakers from both parties are up in arms over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest proposal to to use the budget process to fast-track the Delta tunnel — a deeply controversial, $20 billion plan to replumb the estuary and funnel more water south. 
With the clock ticking for the Legislature to pass a budget bill tackling the state’s $12 billion deficit, Newsom dropped a spending plan last week that would add sweeping changes to permitting, litigation, financing, and eminent domain and land acquisition issues aimed at speeding approval of the massive project. 
“We’re done with barriers  — our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future,” Newsom said in a statement last week. “Let’s get this built.” 
Assembly and Senate Democrats and Republicans representing Delta counties, including Sacramento, Yolo, Contra Costa and San Joaquin, fired back in a letter last week, saying it would “change several, separate parts of state law to benefit only a portion of California, to the detriment of Californians north of the Delta.”
In a hearing and press briefing on Tuesday, several warned Newsom and legislative leaders that the tunnel’s water supply benefits would not outweigh its financial costs nor its toll on communities, farms and the environment in the Delta region. 
“Shifting water from one farming region to benefit another farming region doesn’t solve our water crisis, it only makes it worse,” Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Democrat from Suisun City and co-chair of the Delta Caucus, said Tuesday. 
“Our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future.”GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM
The Delta Conveyance Project, the official name of the tunnel, would stretch 45 miles from the Sacramento River to a reservoir near Livermore, diverting water around the Delta. The state’s original tunnel proposal dates back more than 60 years.
The project’s goal is to increase exports of Northern California water south — much of it to cities in Southern California and farms in the San Joaquin Valley — during wet years. It’s also supposed to shore up the supply against earthquakes or other disasters that could swamp the estuary in salt water, tainting or even cutting off State Water Project supplies that 27 million people and 750,000 acres of farmland rely on. 
“It does feel like drought’s coming back for us, and it will in all likelihood be deeper and longer,” Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources and Newsom’s senior water advisor, told lawmakers of the Assembly Budget Subcommittee on Climate Crisis, Resources, Energy and Transportation. 
Being able to move water when it’s wet into reservoirs or thirsty aquifers, Nemeth said, “has never been more important.” 
Water agencies in the Bay Area and Southern California applauded Newsom’s proposals, saying they would cut costs and shorten the timeline for the project and make their water supply more reliable in a time of climate change.  
But Delta counties warned Newsom and legislative leaders in a letter that “every city and county affected by this project in the Delta region opposes the tunnel.”

In the packed hearing room on Tuesday, opposition outweighed support. Many raised concerns that they might lose their power to fight a project that they fear could scour the Delta landscape with construction and staunch freshwater flows already insufficient to keep harmful algal blooms at bay or support the state’s collapsing salmon fishery.
“This project will damage the Delta in countless ways and pass on the costs to my generation of Californians,” Wesley Motlow, a resident of the small Delta community of Locke, told committee members. “I’ve always been proud to be a member of the state, but if this project is seen to fruition, I will not feel that way.” 
A state analysis warned in 2022 that a Delta tunnel would put salmon at risk. This past spring, salmon fishing was cancelled for an unprecedented third year in a row. 
“Drying out the North just to water the South doesn’t make it better at all, and it doesn’t make it fair,” said Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen, a Democrat from Elk Grove who pushed instead for more recycled water and other local strategies.

Newsom’s streamlining proposals take aim at an array of hurdles the tunnel project would have to clear, as well as recent court decisions that could set it back. 
One change would codify the state’s authority to issue revenue bonds to fund the project — which participating water agencies would have to pay back. A court ruled last year that the state water agency “exceeded its delegated authority” for the bonds.
Newsom’s proposal would shorten the timeline to resolve challenges in court, limit injunctions against construction activities unless they present “an imminent threat to public health and safety” and alter some procedures and oversight for acquiring properties under eminent domain. It would also eliminate certain deadlines related to water rights for the State Water Project, according to a Senate analysis, and limit the ability of others to file protests against the state.   
“It creates a separate water rights system for the State Water Project that upends over a century of water rights law,” said Osha Meserve, counsel for various local water agencies and other opponents of the Delta tunnel.

Also, Senate analysts said, the proposal “does not contain language that would allow a court to stay or enjoin a project to protect native American artifacts or historical resources.”
Malissa Tayaba, vice chair of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians and director of traditional knowledge, said the tunnel threatens their homelands and desecrate the resting place of their ancestors. 
“It seems that, to Governor Newsom, our culture, our ancestors and the environment that sustains us is worth less than the ability to over-divert water from our rivers to send more water and money to commercial water interests,” Tayaba said. 
Environmental advocates say the governor’s proposal is an end run around laws and court decisions that could affect environmental protections beyond the Delta.
“What the governor calls barriers, we call laws,” Jon Rosenfield, science director with the San Francisco Baykeeper, said at the press conference Tuesday.

Many legislators took issue with Newsom’s strategy of using add-ons to the budget — called trailer bills — to rush through complex policy proposals that they fear would limit the public’s power to challenge the massive project. 
The normally circumspect, nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office agreed. 
“These are issues that have been debated and discussed for years and even decades, and the Legislature simply does not have much time … to consider all of the potential implications,” Sonja Petek, principal fiscal and policy analyst with the Legislative Analyst’s Office, told lawmakers.  With such a challenging budget ahead and decisions looming to cut services that Californians rely on, Petek said, these proposals “serve as a distraction.” 
It’s not the first time Newsom has taken this tact. In 2023, he proposed overhauling permitting and litigation for the Delta tunnel under the California Environmental Quality Act as part of a broader infrastructure package. Lawmakers were outraged and rejected that part of the proposal.
Tara Gallegos, Newsom’s deputy director of communications, said in an email that the statements from legislators and environmentalists at the press conference Tuesday “demonstrated why this fast track is necessary, as it is clear that misinformation will continue to delay and obfuscate this critical project.” She said solutions such as more recycled water are “simplistic” and “ignore the practical realities” of providing sufficient and reliable supplies.
Assemblymember Steve Bennett, a Democrat from Oxnard and chair of the  budget subcommittee, said debate about the tunnel will likely be deferred until after the budget vote in June.
“These conversations take time. There’s a lot of fear. There’s palpable frustration,” he said. “I know that going through policy committees is not considered fun, but given the magnitude of this issue, it may be the only way you can actually get enough information out there, in a steady enough format, to be able to make this move.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/022525-DeltaTunnelHood-FG-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065
,California,2025-05-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Inland Empire lost trade and transportation jobs, but it’s too early to blame tariffs",Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/05/inland-empire-jobs-loss/,"Unemployment in the Inland Empire ticked up to 4.9% last month, with lost jobs in trade and transportation. Only a few job categories showed gains.","In summary
Unemployment in the Inland Empire ticked up to 4.9% last month, with lost jobs in trade and transportation. Only a few job categories showed gains.


Trade and transportation jobs dropped in the Inland Empire between March and April, while employment in other sectors such as hospitality and construction declined over the past year, according to a jobs report the California Employment Development Department released Friday.
However government jobs added 8,800 slots over last year while employment in schools and healthcare grew by 16,800 positions.
Overall, the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.6% last April to 4.9% last month. That’s a little lower than the statewide average of 5% but higher than the national 3.9% rate. 
Taking a longer view, the region’s job growth and labor force have held strong over the past five years compared to the rest of the state, said Christopher Thornberg, an economist with Los Angeles-based Beacon Economics.
“You’re talking about an economy that is one of the few bright spots in a flat California economy,” he said of the Inland Empire.
Trade, transportation and utilities sectors in the Inland Empire lost 1,400 jobs last month after gaining 1,300 positions over the previous year. That’s key for the Inland Empire, where more than 4,000 warehouses cover about 40 square miles of space and accounted for nearly 10% of jobs in Riverside County and more than 16% in San Bernardino County in 2021-22, according to a report by UC Riverside last year.
California business leaders are closely watching the distribution sector, wondering how well ports and warehouses will hold up as President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs roil retail markets.
Thornberg said it’s too early to make that call. In the first quarter of the year, businesses tried to get ahead of the tariffs by stocking up, he said. In the second quarter tariffs were imposed and then lifted, triggering uncertainty, but probably not layoffs.
“Supply chains are long, complicated, and you don’t lay people off on the basis of a one-month disruption,” he said. “So, honestly, you’re not just going to see any of the data, not yet. And of course, we’re still wondering where this trade war goes. There’s a lot of volatility in this supply chain.”
That can make it hard to tease out the effects of national trade policy from consumer trends and regional economic factors. 
“With all that being said, it’s not like logistics is doing well,” Thornberg said. “Logistics saw a huge upsurge in 2022 because of spending, supply chains and the pandemic. Now people are spending more on restaurants and travel than campers and PlayStations.”
Hospitality also took a hit in the Inland Empire, losing 9,600 jobs between April 2024 and last month, although the sector added 2,200 positions between March and April of this year. 
Construction declined by 6,000 jobs year over year but gained 2,100 positions last month.
Alex Fernando, a labor market researcher at the Employment Development Department, said the agency doesn’t analyze the reasons for changes in job numbers, but national political policy could contribute to declining tourism, while seasonal factors also make a difference. 
With summer approaching, he said, “we start to notice that industries like construction go up, while local government and schools will be out of service during the summer months.”
Overall, Thornberg said, the Inland Empire is doing well. His data show that the region’s labor force — the number of people working or looking for jobs —  grew by 6.7% between 2020 and 2025, and jobs increased by 7.3% during that time. 
By comparison, Los Angeles and the Bay Area both lost jobs and workers in that five-year span.
”Now people are spending more on restaurants and travel than campers and PlayStations.”Christopher Thornberg, economist at Beacon Economics
The Inland Empire Economic Partnership released a report Tuesday that shows stable unemployment rates in the region. But it warned that might not last. 
“The outlook is worrisome: the Inland Empire’s job creation ability hangs on the contribution of three sectors: Health Services, Local Government Educational Services, and Logistics,” the report stated. “All other sectors are reducing employment.”
Tariffs could slash business to distribution centers, while California’s budget shortfall could cut money to schools and local governments, the report stated. 
Thornberg thinks the logistics sector will remain stable, despite the looming trade war.
“Ultimately we need stuff from overseas,” he said. “Even with tariffs, we’re going to buy the stuff.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/031524-Warehouse-AN_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065
,California,2025-05-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles has a Donald Trump problem. It’s making the city’s bad budget even worse,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/los-angeles-donald-trump-budget/,"As Los Angeles confronts a major budget deficit, President Donald Trump's economic policies and abrupt actions are making it even harder to dig out of the hole.","Los Angeles city government did plenty to create its billion-dollar budget problem. 
Its elected leaders are so in thrall to public employee unions that departments grew too big and often paid too much in salaries and pensions. That’s smart politics but bad policy. The reckoning, now upon a city with an $800 million shortfall, will be painful.
But the city is not fully to blame. Indeed, much of Los Angeles’ current budget struggle is being inflicted by Washington, where a vain, incoherent president recklessly moves markets and economies with his public musings and punitive policies. His actions are dramatically compounding the burdens on local coffers statewide, and Los Angeles, where tourism and trade are major generators of economic life, is being hit especially hard.
Take the Port of Los Angeles, the main port of entry for trade with Asia. Some 40% of all imported goods pass through the L.A. and Long Beach complex. When the U.S. president launches a trade war with China and the rest of the world, the port feels the impact, especially when the president’s China tariffs bounce from 10% to 20% to 25% to 104% to 145% to 30% — as they did over just the past three months. 
That introduces chaos into the trade network as manufacturers and importers are left to wonder how prices today might be different tomorrow. Many elect to freeze and wait for signals of what the future may bring. Predictably, port traffic has plummeted, and officials expect a 30% dropoff this year.
For Los Angeles, that means a sharp decline in port revenue, as well as the broader effects of decreased business: dockworkers who see their pay decline, truckers with fewer goods to haul, maintenance crews with fewer ships and trucks to service. As their salaries drop, they buy less and the effects ripple outward. Toymakers feel the pinch, along with accountants and car dealers and barbershops and everyone else.
“The tariff may be aimed at China,” Los Angeles City Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky explained to me, “but it hits in San Pedro.”
And the effect of those tariffs has struck both the port and Los Angeles International Airport. While cargo at the port has declined, tourism has plummeted as well — the result of uncertainty about costs as well as simple hostility toward the United States, which is suddenly demonizing longtime allies and partners.
Passenger traffic at LAX fell 7% in February compared to the same period a year prior, and fell again in March, off 5% from 2024. LAX revenues are predicted to rise modestly this year, but that’s only because it’s charging more in landing fees and building rents.
Trump’s bluster has affected foreign tourism across the United States, but it has had especially tough implications for Los Angeles. The three nations that provide the most tourists to Los Angeles are Mexico, Canada and China. Visits from all three have dropped in 2025, with Mexican tourism off 24% and Canadian visits down a whopping 74%, plunging in the face of President Trump’s repeated and condescending demand that our northern neighbor join the United States as its 51st state.
Overall, Yaroslavsky said the city of Los Angeles now projects a 25-30% decline in tourism for 2025. That means comparable reductions in the city’s share of hotel occupancy taxes. Restaurants, car services and tourist attractions all are braced for hits, too.
With Trump, the unpredictability of policy stems from the fact that he often seems driven by whatever is on his mind or whatever he most recently watched on television. That, too, complicates the lives of local leaders. 
“The tariff may be aimed at China, but it hits in San Pedro.”Katy Yaroslavsky, Los Angeles City Councilmember
Earlier this month, Trump announced on social media that he was “authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” 
That was news to Hollywood, and baffling news at that. What would it mean to impose such a tariff in a city where thousands of jobs depend on the movie industry? Would it protect American jobs or discourage movie production? Who knows? Certainly not Trump. And certainly not local officials trying to imagine how it might implicate their fiscal planning.
And that’s just the beginning of the Trump administration’s gifts to the city of Los Angeles and its residents. If his mass deportation plan ever kicked in at the level he promised (for all his bluster, Trump is deporting people at roughly the same rate as President Obama), it could, for example, ripple through the construction industry and significantly increase the cost and time required to build homes in a city facing fire recovery and the state’s worst homelessness crisis.

The plight of Pacific Palisades hinges on Trump in yet another way, too, as the administration continues to block disaster relief unless the city knuckles under to Trump’s insistence that it adopt new Voter ID laws in exchange. That has some impact on the city’s budget — city buildings and property were among the thousands of structures destroyed by the fire — but its greater effect is on residents, who are being held hostage in a way that victims of no other natural disaster in American history have ever faced. 
Finally, there is the Trump budget. The administration’s “skinny” budget, a rough outline of its spending plan for the coming fiscal year that was released earlier this month, includes dozens of cuts that could affect city services. An analysis prepared by Yaroslavsky’s office identified 19 city programs that could face cuts, from support for homeless services to elimination of renewable energy credits. Dozens of more cuts could affect residents, her office found, just not through the budget.
All told, the effect of Trump’s actions has been to add tens of millions of dollars to the city’s shortfall, along with untold millions lost to uncertainty and confusion. It is, to say the least, discouraging, if not entirely surprising.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education


Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
South Dakota turned to paraprofessionals to attack a teacher shortage, and hundreds responded

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
State cancels teacher trainings for new social studies standards due to federal funding cuts

And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators. South Dakota has a program offering deeply discounted tuition for paraprofessionals who want to earn a teaching degree.
In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
South Dakota rises to its highest-ever rank in teacher pay: 46th

As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Ericka Helling is used to being attacked on the job. She’s been bitten, slapped, kicked.
“And that’s just a part of the day,” said Helling, a 27-year veteran nurse in the intensive care unit at M Health Fairview’s Southdale Hospital.
She considers herself lucky. Her coworker was punched in the face just a few weeks ago. More than one nurse she knows has had a traumatic brain injury from a workplace assault.
Often the violence comes from patients who are inebriated, delirious or in the midst of some other mental health crisis. Sometimes, it’s the patient’s family members. Last month, Helling’s hospital went on lockdown after a man visiting his mother pulled out a gun and struck his sister several times, according to court filings.
“We’re always concerned about what’s next, what’s coming, head on a swivel,” Helling said. “It’s not unique. Violence happens in every single hospital across this country.”
Health care workers are five times more likely to be seriously injured from an assault on the job than the U.S. workforce as a whole, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nearly three-fourths of all nonfatal workplace violence is against health care workers.
The antidote, according to nurses, is more staffing. More eyes to spot problems before they escalate into violence, and more hands to respond when it does.
Union nurses with the Minnesota Nurses Association are intent on pressuring hospitals to commit to higher staffing levels as they negotiate labor contracts covering roughly 15,000 nurses at seven of the state’s largest hospital systems in the Twin Cities and Duluth areas: Allina, Children’s Minnesota, HealthPartners, M Health Fairview, North Memorial, Essentia and St. Luke’s.
The issue is so important to them, the union says, that nurses have ranked safe staffing above pay for the first time in their survey of members.
The union is becoming increasingly impatient and disillusioned with hospital leaders and the collaborative approaches like advisory committees they’ve won in past negotiations.
The contracts expire in May and June – and union president Chris Rubesch said a strike is on the table.
“We’ve been steamrolled. We’ve been ignored. So enough is enough,” Rubesch said, at a news conference earlier this month.
Ultimately they want strict nurse-to-patient staffing ratios to mandate a minimum number of nurses, which they argue will protect nurses as well as patients, who are facing rising rates of adverse events.
But staffing ratios have been a nonstarter for hospital leaders in negotiations. Hospital leaders argue staffing levels must remain a management decision because it allows them to respond to hour-to-hour changes in staffing needs. They say having to meet strict nurse staffing ratios would drive up the cost of care and force them to sideline lower paid workers like nursing assistants in order to meet quotas for registered nurses.
Looming over current negotiations are potential drastic federal funding cuts to Medicaid, which threaten to strain hospital finances, which leaders say are only just recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rubesch, the union president and a cardiac nurse at Essentia in Duluth, said his employer proposed stripping language from their contract that says staffing decisions cannot be based solely on budget concerns.
“Ask yourself why they are striking that language, if only so that they can staff to the budget and not to the patient’s needs,” Rubesch said.

Hospital leaders note that they’ve been able to hire many more nurses since the COVID-19 pandemic led to a wave of departures from the health care industry.
“Contrary to claims of a widespread nursing shortage and declining interest in hospital-based careers, the data tells a different story. Hospitals across the Twin Cities are seeing strong momentum in nursing workforce stabilization, with double-digit declines in RN vacancy rates over the past year,” wrote Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the hospitals in negotiations, in an email.
Nurse vacancies more than quadrupled during the COVID-19 pandemic — from 3% in 2020 to over 14% in 2022 — as burnout drove health care workers out of the industry. The vacancy rate is now down to 11%, according to the latest workforce survey by the Minnesota Hospital Association of most hospitals in the state.
The hospital association noted that just 2 in 5 registered nurses are working full time, a record low, which suggests the workforce shortage could be eased if nurses picked up more hours.
Nurses counter that the exhausting shifts with managers scheduling too few nurses on duty make a full-time schedule unsustainable. Plus, nurses say hospitals prefer to hire them part-time because managers can cancel their shifts when they believe the hospital is overstaffed without having to pay their wages.
“Hospitals aren’t hiring people at full time … because they want control over their staffing,” Helling said.
A recent search of open jobs for bedside registered nurses at M Health Fairview hospitals showed less than a third were for 0.8 full-time equivalent or greater. At Children’s Minnesota, only about a quarter were full time. At HealthPartners, just 1 in 5 open hospital nursing positions were full-time.

For over 30 years at the bargaining table and the state Capitol, the nurses union has been fighting for a greater say in hospital staffing levels. Over that time, staffing has only gotten worse, nurses say.
Three years ago, 15,000 nurses walked off the job for three days at 15 hospitals in what was then the largest private-sector nurses strike in U.S. history. The union won the highest pay increases in two decades – about 18% over three years — but negotiated only modest concessions from hospital leaders on staffing.
Minnesota nurses are the highest paid in the country after accounting for cost of living, earning about $94,830 per year on average. The union boasts that’s in large part their doing, and say those higher wages help attract and retain nurses who provide nation-leading care.
After the 2022 strike, the nurses union turned to the state Legislature and got as close as they’ve ever been to staffing ratios. In 2023, the DFL-controlled House and Senate passed a bill that would have required hospitals to create committees made up of nurses and management to set staffing levels. The bill was gutted in the final hours of the legislative session, however, after Mayo Clinic threatened to move billions in future investments out of state if it became law.
What was left of the bill included requirements that hospitals create procedures for health care workers to request additional staffing if they’re worried about safety, and to document those requests and submit them to the Department of Health along with written action plans on workplace violence. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, the Department of Health must also publish an annual report on the state’s hospital nursing workforce.
Nurses struck out on staffing levels again at the Legislature again this year, having pushed for their ideal, no compromises proposal that would have set rigid nurse-to-patient ratios.
After their legislative defeat in 2023, nurses elected a new set of leaders that promised a more confrontational stance toward management and a strategy focused on organizing and public pressure campaigns rather than dueling with employers over grievances through legal briefs.
The current negotiations with 13 hospitals is the first major contract fight for the new leadership, who would seem to be at least as willing as their predecessors to lead their members to the picket line if they fail to win any concessions on staffing at the bargaining table. They’re also asking for increased security protections and more paid time off if they’re injured on the job.
Nurses opened negotiations seeking 18% pay raises over three years, while the hospitals started with 6%.
The nurses’ focus on staffing to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of violence is backed up by research.
Patient deaths and hospital readmissions were also found to be higher when fewer nurses were on duty, according to a study of New York hospitals by researches at the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers estimated that more than 4,000 lives and $720 million could have been saved over the two-year study period if hospitals were staffed with 1 nurse per 4 patients rather than the average of 1 to 6.
A study of Illinois hospitals similarly found patient deaths and hospital stays increased as nurses were given more patients to care for.
As for violence, OSHA lists understaffing, high turnover and long wait times as risk factors for violence, all of which are plaguing Minnesota hospitals, nurses say. OSHA also says working alone and in isolated areas contribute to the potential for violence.
“We deserve the right to go to work and be safe and return home in that same safe condition,” Helling said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250507_0058-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065

(Photo by Mitch Diamond/Getty Images)The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food announced it has up to $2 million in low-interest loans available to help farmers who are struggling due to drought. 
The department issued a news release on Tuesday to raise awareness of the availability of the loans through the Emergency Disaster Relief Loan program. 
State officials said loans are available to eligible agricultural producers in 17 counties named in an executive order Gov. Spencer Cox issued last month due to drought, including: Beaver, Carbon, Emery, Garfield, Grand, Iron, Juab, Kane, Millard, Piute, San Juan, Sanpete, Sevier, Tooele, Uintah, Washington and Wayne counties.

Eligible farmers can apply for seven-year loans of up to $100,000 each, with two years of no interest and 2.75% interest thereafter, according to the department. Applications for the loans will be accepted until Oct. 23. 
“Utah’s agricultural producers are on the front lines of drought impacts, facing difficult decisions as water scarcity threatens crops, livestock, and long-term viability,” Commissioner Kelly Pehrson said in a prepared statement. 
“We recognize the tremendous strain drought places on farm families and rural communities, and the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food is committed to doing everything we can to help,” Pehrson added. “This loan program is just one of the tools we’re using to support producers through this crisis and keep our agricultural economy strong.”
As of May 13, almost the entire state of Utah remains “abnormally dry,” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Areas in southern Utah including Washington County are in “extreme drought,” while other rural counties on the southern, eastern and western sides of the state face either severe or moderate drought.

State officials with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food urged farmers to visit the state’s website to learn more about the program and how to apply. 
“These funds are only available for agricultural producers to address declared disaster-related losses and cannot be used for any value-added projects,” the website says. 
To be eligible, the department says:

All losses and expenses submitted for funding must be documented.
Loan funds may only be used to cover losses related to the official disaster declared. 
Loan funds may only be used to cover losses not already covered by indemnity, insurance, or other compensation.
Eligible losses and expenses will be further defined in application information provided specific to the declared disaster.

Additionally, state officials encouraged farmers to also contact their local USDA Farm Service Agency office to explore other available federal drought assistance options.
They also referred farmers to the state’s drought resources website, which provides updates on available financial resources and how to access them. 
“We understand the challenges that drought conditions present, and we are committed to providing the necessary resources to help Utahns navigate these difficult times,” the website says. It also encourages all Utahns to “focus on water conservation efforts to help mitigate the impacts of the drought.”

She made a name for herself nationally in 2014 when the Obergefell v. Hodges case – which eventually legalized same-sex marriage nationwide – was on appeal, and allowed a short window for states to recognize those marriages for the first time before the case was finalized. Byrum opened her office to those couples and performed one of the first same-sex marriage ceremonies in the state.
Byrum also served in the Michigan House of Representatives for six years before being elected to as the Ingham County clerk in 2012, and previously owned and operated an Ace Hardware store in Charlotte for nearly 20 years.
  Rep. Barb Byrum speaks on the House floor in 2012 | Facebook
“I’m running for Secretary of State because I believe elections should be fair, secure and accessible for voters today and in future generations, and that Michiganders deserve an exceptional customer service experience at every Secretary of State office,” Byrum said in a statement. “For more than 20 years, I’ve served the public as a state legislator and as a County Clerk, and I’d be honored to continue serving the people of Michigan as the next Secretary of State.”
Byrum is a longtime advocate for voters’ rights and routinely uses her social media pages to explain complex election matters, especially in the wake of the 2020 election, when Republicans refused to accept the results of the presidential contest and fomented numerous unfounded election conspiracies.
In a news release announcing her campaign, Byrum said election officials like herself take pride in ensuring Michigan’s elections are secure and that every qualified voter has a chance to have their voice heard.
“I fight back against those who would seek to make it harder to vote and those who attack our democratic process because our democracy is worth fighting for,” Byrum said. “As Michigan’s next Secretary of State, I will ensure that Michigan will continue to run free, fair and secure elections, as we have these many years.”
Her announcement also came with an endorsement from fellow Democratic Genesee County Clerk-Register Domonique Clemons, who called Byrum “a leader among the clerk community and knows elections backwards and forwards.”
“She is the go-to expert for new clerks when they need assistance, and is always ready to support,” Clemons said in a statement. “Barb is a vocal advocate for voter rights and election integrity. She is steadfast in defending democracy against those who try to undermine our election process.”
Michigan campaign finance reporting documents show Byrum formed her candidate committee on May 15 with a reporting waiver requested, which typically means candidates plan to raise and spend less than $1,000 in the election cycle.
At present, Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie is the only other name in the race on the Democratic side.
Michigan’s political parties nominate candidates for secretary of state and attorney general and do not participate in the primary process. Michigan Democrats will nominate a candidate for secretary of state at their state party convention in the spring of 2026.

(Alex Cochran for Alabama Reflector)He said a group of correctional officers beat him in a prison barbershop. The officers said it never happened.
But despite continued denials the officers used excessive force, the state agreed to pay $140,000 to a man formerly incarcerated at Bibb Correctional Facility in Brent who sued the officers after he suffered a broken hip in 2018. The officer identified as the primary aggressor in the complaint has been named in half a dozen excessive force lawsuits filed by incarcerated men in Alabama.
The lawsuit over the broken hip, filed by Koty Williams, is one of 30 civil rights complaints settled by Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) in 2023 involving payments to plaintiffs totaling $929,110. The vast majority of the lawsuits, 26 out of 30, were filed over claims of excessive force by officers inside Alabama’s overcrowded and violent prisons.


May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


The findings are the result of an extensive examination of accounting data obtained from the Alabama Department of Finance detailing all payments made from the General Liability Trust Fund since 2020, as well as court records connected to trust fund transactions.
Williams, who was released from prison in 2023, said the settlement money he received represented the only shred of accountability he could obtain from the system.
But it did nothing, Williams said, to heal his emotional scars. The assault and injuries he suffered at the hands of officers, Williams said, left him feeling completely violated and led him to use opioids to manage the pain.
“They took something away from me, like my manhood,” said Williams, speaking by phone from a drug rehabilitation facility in California, where he had admitted himself after his release from ADOC. “It really messed me up.”
The Alabama Department of Corrections declined to comment on the case, or provide details on how Koty Williams sustained his injury, citing department policy. “The ADOC does not comment on pending litigation or confidential settlement negotiations and any resulting agreements,” wrote ADOC’s communications director Kelly Betts in an email response to a list of submitted questions. She added that settling a case is not an admission of wrongdoing.
His lawsuit was just one of hundreds against ADOC officers winding its way through the courts when it settled in 2023. But the details of Williams’ ordeal and ADOC’s response reflect the issues that led the U.S. Department of Justice to sue the state in 2020 over unconstitutional prison conditions: understaffing, inadequate supervision and the failure to hold officers accountable for abuse.
‘Please don’t hit me no more’
On the morning of Nov. 27, 2018, Williams was 25 years old, serving a sentence for second-degree assault and receiving stolen property, both drug-related convictions, according to state court records.
That morning, Williams said, he left his assigned dorm to go to another one, where he planned to register for a Christian-based reentry program called “Jumpstart.” While he was inside the dorm, ADOC’s “Correctional Emergency Response Team,” or CERT, rushed in, shouting for men to go to their assigned beds.
According to a deposition with ADOC attorneys, Williams said he quickly went to the only vacant bunk he saw, while the CERT members began a shakedown, searching the men, their bunks and their boxes of belongings. An officer patted Williams down, then sent him to the bathroom for a strip search.
While waiting to be strip-searched, Williams said he overheard officers in the dorm asking who slept on bed 2-B, the vacant bunk he’d gone to when the shakedown began. At first he didn’t answer, because he didn’t actually sleep there. But then Williams heard an officer calling his name.
“I’m right here,” he said, walking out of the bathroom.
According to the statement Williams later gave to an ADOC investigator, officers had found contraband items on the bunk, including two cell phones, a phone charger, and two syringes, along with Williams’ prison ID. CERT officers asked him about the items. Williams said they did not belong to him, that he didn’t do IV drugs and that 2-B wasn’t his assigned bed. According to a deposition Williams later gave to ADOC attorneys, a CERT officer, Sgt. Akeem Edmonds, told him to step out into the hall, then led him into the prison barbershop.
Williams said he was scared and did what he was told.
“These dudes are like people you see in weightlifting contests,” Williams said. “They’re huge.”
The primary assailant listed in Williams’ complaint was Edmonds, who said in a deposition that he is 6 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 295 pounds. Williams is 6 feet tall and weighs 155 pounds.
Williams said at least four officers filed into the barbershop behind them. The barbershop, he said, is a confined space, “about 12 paces in there,” with a long wooden bench along one wall where men sit to wait for haircuts.
Williams said Sgt. Edmonds held up the syringe and asked him why he wasn’t owning up to it. Again, Williams denied it was his. Williams said Edmonds then punched him in the face and he fell to the ground.
In the deposition with ADOC attorneys, Williams said he remembered blood pouring out of his nose while several officers hit and kicked him as he lay on the ground. The officers, Williams said, shouted for him to get up, and Edmonds grabbed him by his waistband and the back of his shirt, and slammed his body down on the wooden bench. Williams said he knew then that he’d been badly injured.
“I told them, ‘Please don’t hit me no more,’” Williams recalled in his deposition. “’My leg is broke.’”










“I told them, ‘Please don’t hit me no more. My leg is broke.'”


– Koty Williams, deposition


He was unable to stand. Williams said one officer suggested that he tell people he got hurt by falling out of his bunk.
“He said, ‘You’re going to have to quit jumping off them racks. It’s not good for you,’” Williams told ADOC attorneys. Then, he said, the group of officers left him bleeding on the floor of the barbershop.
Williams’ account of the assault in the Bibb barbershop has never been corroborated by an employee of ADOC, and an internal investigation failed to substantiate the claim. But the Department never challenged that Williams was injured, or explained how Williams sustained his injuries.
The officers named in Williams’ lawsuit all denied the beating occurred, both in statements to ADOC’s investigator and depositions with Hank Sherrod, Williams’ attorney.
Edmonds initially told the ADOC investigator that during the shakedown, he found two syringes and Williams dnied that they belonged to him. Edmonds said he noticed Williams was walking with a limp, so he asked Williams what happened, but Williams would only say he’d been “jumped,” and would not tell Edmonds who was involved. Edmonds said he called for a wheelchair and took Williams to the infirmary to be checked out.
In a later deposition, Edmonds didn’t mention finding the syringes, but relayed a similar account that he’d previously told ADOC’s investigator, that he noticed Williams was limping during the CERT shakedown, and Williams told Edmonds he’d been “jumped.”
Edmonds acknowledged that he took Williams outside the dorm into the hallway and later pushed him in a wheelchair to the infirmary to be checked out. But he denied ever beating Williams in the prison barbershop. And even though Edmonds recognized Williams’ injuries were serious enough to need a wheelchair, he said that he never filled out an internal “incident report” that’s required when an incarcerated person is injured.
“I probably reported it up the chain,” Edmonds told Williams’ attorney in a deposition. But the captain who supervised Edmonds said in a deposition that he didn’t file a report about Williams’ injury either.
Williams said Sgt. Edmonds did place him in a wheelchair and transported him to the prison infirmary, but only after Edmonds had assaulted him. Williams said he wasn’t limping before the assault and Edmonds didn’t pull him aside or suggest he get looked at in the infirmary.
When the infirmary nurse asked Williams what happened, he hesitated.
“I didn’t want to talk about it right then because the guy that done (it) – the reason why I was how I was is because (of) the man standing in the room with me,” Williams later told ADOC attorneys.










I didn’t want to talk about it right then because the guy that done (it) – the reason why I was how I was is because (of) the man standing in the room with me.


– Koty Williams


The nurse explained that Williams had to give her a reason he was there in order for her to order testing. Williams said he eventually told her that Sgt. Edmonds had beaten him in the barbershop. He also told her he was in severe pain and couldn’t walk.
According to Williams, the nurse ordered an X-ray, and after it was done, sent Williams back to his dorm. He said the nurse never offered him any medication for pain, and he spent the next 24 hours in agony.
“If it wouldn’t have been for other inmates, I wouldn’t have made it,” he said.
Williams said other men in the dorm helped him get in and out of bed, and gave him the only relief available, a dose of contraband fentanyl. He said this moment triggered years of self-medicating and addiction that he’s still working to recover from.
“I already had a past of using opiates,” Williams said. “After they broke my hip, I just went downhill.”
Williams said the evening following the assault, he was called back to the infirmary. By this time, the pain in his hip was so bad he had almost passed out. The same nurse who examined him a day earlier told Williams they were sending him to the hospital for surgery. The X-ray showed a fracture in his hip that needed immediate intervention.
The technical diagnosis was intertrochanteric fracture on left hip, a painful break in the bone located in the upper part of the thigh, just below the hip joint, according to Williams’ medical records. A person with this injury cannot stand or put weight on the injured side, and it can take months to heal, according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association.
The surgeon who treated Williams at Brookwood Hospital said in a deposition that he didn’t recall having a specific conversation with Williams about how he got injured, other than being involved in an altercation. The surgeon assumed the fight was with other prisoners.
“I don’t try to ferret out exactly the mechanism of injury because it’s somewhat irrelevant at that point,” he said.
During surgery, the doctor inserted an implant, which acted like an internal splint, stabilizing and supporting the broken parts of Williams’ hip.
Williams was returned to Bibb Correctional Facility the following day and spent two weeks in the prison infirmary. It was during this first week back that another man incarcerated at the prison called Williams’ stepmother and told her he’d been injured. She then called ADOC, triggering an internal investigation.

An investigation and a missing video

Ten days after Williams was injured, an agent with ADOC’s Law Enforcement Services Division (LESD) came to Bibb Correctional Facility and interviewed him in the prison infirmary, according to a document obtained by the Reflector. Williams told the investigator about the incident and named the officers involved. He also encouraged the agent to talk to prisoners in the dorm to corroborate his removal from the dorm and his return in a wheelchair with serious injuries.
The agent later said in a deposition that he couldn’t verify when Williams was injured, and that he “had no witnesses.” He also said that he didn’t take photos of Williams’ injuries, or visit the prison barbershop where Williams said the attack took place.
Williams had suggested to the ADOC investigator that surveillance video would show officers removing him from the dorm and taking him into the prison barbershop on the day he was injured. This video, if recovered, could have been crucial in making or breaking the officers’ stories. If ADOC’s own investigation found evidence of a crime, in this case felony assault, the case would be turned over to the local district attorney for prosecution.
ADOC’s agent in charge of the internal investigation requested the video, but days later received an email from the prison’s warden informing him that no such video existed.
The captain in charge of maintaining video at Bibb and investigating use-of-force incidents said in a deposition that he checked the camera in the dorm’s cubicle but did not find any footage of officers taking Williams out of the dorm. There was a separate camera in the bay of the dorm which also could have captured Williams with officers from a different angle that the officer said he did not check.
“I should have, but I didn’t,” he said in his deposition.
The captain also said no officer or supervisor informed him of any incident. He only learned that Williams was injured, he said, when the prison sent Williams to the hospital for surgery. The captain said in his deposition that he called the shift office after Williams was hospitalized and asked if the injury involved officers. He was told no. He asked the lieutenant to “look into it,” but there was never any follow-up.
Williams’ attorney, Hank Sherrod, pressed the ADOC investigator about the scant internal investigation during the deposition, asking if the officer lifted “even your little pinky finger” to interview witnesses.
“No,” the investigator replied. “Because no video.”











Because no video.


– ADOC investigator on why he did not interview witnesses to Koty Williams incident



But the investigator also could not recall a reason for why there was no video, only that Bibb Warden Deborah Toney informed him of this via email and that was the end of the conversation.
Williams viewed the ADOC investigation as part of a culture inside the department, in which protecting the institution is the priority. He felt that acutely when he tried to tell multiple officers, health care staff and an ADOC investigator about what happened to him.
“They all looked at me like I was lying,” he recalled. “I’m an inmate. My word ain’t s— to them.”
In its 2020 findings of excessive force in Alabama prisons, the DOJ wrote that inconsistent video collection and lackluster investigations contributed to ADOC’s culture of systemic excessive force. DOJ recommended the department install cameras in all areas where uses of force occur, implement video recording capacity and retain video for 30 days.
ADOC’s spokesperson Kelly Betts did not send a response to a question submitted via email asking if the department had followed these recommendations from the DOJ.

A half-dozen lawsuits

Williams isn’t the only incarcerated person to sue Edmonds for excessive force. According to federal court records, Edmonds was a named defendant in a half dozen lawsuits involving allegations of excessive force. Between 2018 and 2024, ADOC paid over $198,000 in settlements to end five lawsuits against Edmonds.
A review of Edmonds’ personnel file showed that former ADOC Commissioner Jeff Dunn attempted to demote Edmonds and then fire him. Both attempts were unsuccessful after Edmonds appealed his case to the state personnel board.
In 2020, ADOC conducted an internal investigation of a suspected excessive force incident and recommended that Edmonds be demoted.
“ADOC asserts that the employee used his duty belt to beat an inmate in the Classification area of the Bibb Correctional Facility, after it was determined the inmate had taken food from the staff refrigerator,” the disciplinary paperwork stated.
But Edmonds requested a review by the state personnel board, which held a hearing in May 2020.
The personnel director issued written findings that the evidence indicated Edmonds did not use excessive force, citing a lack of eyewitnesses who would testify that they saw Edmonds beat the man with his duty belt, and the reliance on a confidential informant who reported the assault. Although the man’s medical record indicated bruises and abrasions, the prison medical staff characterized the injuries as old or in “multiple stages of healing.”
The findings also cited an administrative employee of the prison who saw Edmonds holding a brown belt, and a psychological associate stating that she heard the incarcerated man say “I can’t get up sir. They’ve been beating on my chest for two days.”
The personnel director found Commissioner Dunn’s recommended demotion was unwarranted, and affirmed Edmonds’ status as a correctional sergeant.
A message seeking comment from Dunn was not returned.
In June 2021, Edmonds was arrested and charged with assault connected to the same incident. ADOC responded by placing Edmonds on mandatory leave and began the process of terminating him. But after a “pre-dismissal conference” in September, the state personnel hearing officer found Edmonds not guilty of excessive force.
In November 2021, Bibb County Assistant District Attorney R. Bryan Jones recommended dropping the assault charge due to lack of evidence, and a judge agreed. Edmonds was permitted to return to work at ADOC in January 2022.
Eight months later, ADOC promoted him to correctional lieutenant.
ADOC would not comment on this specific case, but confirmed that Edmonds still works for the department. The Attorney General’s Office has represented Edmonds in six excessive force lawsuits, but the office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Messages were left with an attorney for Edmonds, and with a family member of Edmonds, but there was no response.
Williams completed drug rehab and has returned to Alabama. He said he walks with a limp and experiences numbness in his leg that he attributes to his broken hip. He didn’t know about the other lawsuits against Edmonds and wondered why they didn’t result in more action by ADOC to prevent future assaults.
“How is he not fired?” he asked. “Did my case not prove enough?”

Erik Perkett talk with citizens at community event Monday. (Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Hours before Clark County began removing unhoused people from tunnels under the Flamingo Wash, Clark County Commission Chair Tick Segerblom told nearby residents they might see an influx of people experiencing homelessness in their neighborhoods.
Though Segerblom pledged to “protect you guys and keep them out of your neighborhood,” there are still lingering questions about how many beds and shelter options were available to unhoused people living in the tunnels ahead of the encampment being cleared. 
The number of people experiencing homelessness in Southern Nevada, like across the country, has grown in recent years and there aren’t enough adequate shelter options or housing to address the underlying crisis. 
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officials and Segerblom told residents arrests and citations could be an option for those who refuse to move when the encampment is being cleared out. 
County officials along with LVMPD and HELP of Southern Nevada homeless outreach workers said on Monday that an unknown number of people living in the tunnels beneath the wash would be evicted this week in order to begin a $15 million Regional Flood Control project. 
“We are not sure what is going to happen but the concern is a large number of people in the tunnels are going to be forced out” of the tunnels and into the neighborhood, Segerblom said during a town hall Monday night.
Officials began clearing out the wash at 5 a.m. Tuesday. 
In Monday night’s contentious hourlong meeting, community residents angrily questioned the county’s response to homelessness and worried about an influx of unhoused people coming into neighborhoods. 
“Here is the reality,” Segerblom said Monday night. “We don’t have enough manpower. We don’t have enough rooms. We don’t have enough of anything. But we do have a wash where a lot of people live who come out into the neighborhoods. We are committed to making sure no one can get into that wash and live in that wash. It’s not going to happen tomorrow. It’s a process.”
Southern Nevada’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count, an annual snapshot of homelessness on one particular night, identified 7,906 unhoused people — a number officials and homeless providers agree is an undercount. Data showed that the number of people experiencing homelessness grew 20% from the previous year. 
Addressing underlying causes of the rise of homelessness and housing instability in the state was not the focus of Monday’s community meeting. 
Residents, instead, voiced frustration at the prospect of seeing more unhoused people in their neighborhoods, assuming that once folks are asked to leave the tunnels they will migrate to other areas in town. 
Community members also pressed for stronger enforcement by LVMPD and more jail time. 
Criminalization has been criticized by social service providers and homeless outreach workers who warn citations and arrests not only don’t address the underlying reasons people are homeless but impede unhoused people from getting connected to services, including housing. 
Segerbloom said officials will attempt to refer those displaced from tunnels to the noncongregate shelters the county has opened, in particular the Navigation Center, a 70-bed facility that is designed to temporarily house homeless adults without children.
During an interview, Segerblom acknowledged that the Navigation Center is typically at capacity.
“Let’s see if there is someone who says they want services and I’ll find a place,” Segerblom said.
Despite not having enough beds or adequate programs to refer unhoused people to in general, Segerblom said the county was ready to deploy another tool on Tuesday: arrest and citation. 
Clark County’s anti-homeless camping ban, which allows a person to be jailed up to 10 days and fined up to $1,000 for camping and sleeping in a public right-of-way, went into effect in February. 
The county passed the ordinance in November, months after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities could criminalize those experiencing homelessness even if they didn’t have enough adequate shelter space. 
LVMPD Lt. Erik Perkett told the residents Monday that officers are “absolutely arresting people and citing” unhoused people for violating the citation. 
A night in jail is estimated to cost about $135, according to estimates from Southern Nevada Homelessness Continuum of Care.
“Nobody wants to pay that for 5,000 people,” Segerblom said. One resident quipped, “don’t be so sure.”
Toward the end of the town hall, Lou Lacey, the director of the homeless response teams with HELP of Southern Nevada, tried to explain to the crowd the process of connecting people with services ahead of the county clearing out encampments. 
The organization had already been into the wash ahead of Tuesday’s scheduled abatement to warn residents to be cleared out and offer to connect them to a variety of services, Lacey said.  
He added that despite early interactions, some residents likely wouldn’t take assistance until the morning of enforcement. 
But if people accept services, Lacey said HELP will “take them to any substance abuse or mental health service” they request.
“These are still human beings,” Lacey said. “You can’t say ‘you’re going to go.’ We have to reason with them.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0419-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-21 08:03:16.680896

(File/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — An extra $1 billion fell into legislators’ laps as they started budget negotiations Tuesday, making a budget process with few sticking points potentially even smoother.
Following a stronger-than-anticipated tax season for the state, along with continued increases in corporate income tax and sales tax collections, legislators will have an additional $669 million for one-time expenses and $377 million in recurring revenue, the state Board of Economic Advisors announced Tuesday.
Normally, such mid-year hikes occur before the chambers approve their budget plans. But the state’s revenue forecasters declined to recognize any surplus at its meeting last month.
However, with just six weeks left in the fiscal year, the board decided to officially increase its revenue estimates: The $669 million is most, but not all, of what’s flowed into state coffers above expectations through April and $377 million is the boost in projections for the fiscal year starting July 1.
Those “surprisingly good numbers” will make “a lot of what we’d be fighting over a lot easier,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, R-Greenville.
A six-member committee — three each from the House and Senate — is tasked with hashing out the differences in their chambers’ $14.4 billion budget plans.
The panel met publicly for about an hour Tuesday before staff mentioned the $1 billion adjustment, and the meeting adjourned. Talks resume Wednesday.
Some major parts of the budget package were already locked in before negotiations began. That includes $1,500 raises in the state’s minimum pay for teachers and an accelerated income tax cut (which completes a 2022 law that phased in rate reductions).
Other items are still up for debate.
For instance, the Senate put an additional $100 million into updating aging bridges across the state, while the House provided $200 million as the second installment of a five-year, $1 billion commitment sought by the state Department of Transportation. The Senate sent the DOT $25 million to cover clean-up costs of Hurricane Helene not paid by the federal government, while the House provided $35 million.
There are a number of projects at the state’s universities that one chamber funded while the other didn’t.
Other differences are in how the money’s spent. Both chambers, for example, put an additional $112 million into “state aid to classrooms,” which is meant for teachers’ raises. So, that amount is set. However, an adjustment in the way the House proposes to fund virtual charter schools could shift more of that total to traditional K-12 schools.
How the compromise committee might spend the additional $1 billion is not yet clear. Bannister didn’t give any specifics. And the Greenville Republican declined to name any particular possible sticking points.
Legislators already expected smoother sailing during this year’s budget process than in recent years, when disagreements over how much to spend on Clemson’s new veterinary school either stalled the process or derailed it for weeks.
The committee expects to reach a compromise by the end of the week, sending the spending plan back to both chambers for final approval by next Wednesday, said Bannister, chief budget writer for the House.
That leaves more time than usual before the fiscal year begins July 1. Budget negotiations normally carry into June, sometimes with only days to spare.
Much of the newly recognized money could be put into savings, adding to the $1.2 billion already in reserves.
“There’s enough money to cover everything, and then we will have money left over that we will not allocate in this budget cycle,” Bannister said.
Despite more revenue than expected coming in this year, the state’s economic forecasters warned the growth might not last. Although the state’s population and income are expected to continue growing, proposed tariffs could cause some businesses “to take a more measured approach to activity,” potentially taking a hit to state revenue, according to a news release.
Putting aside part of this year’s extra revenue for next year’s budget process could help offset some of those impacts, should they come, Bannister said.
“Certainly, it’s nice to have growing revenues and one-time money that’s not going to be spent this year to have a cushion in case something does come up in the next 12 to 24 months,” Bannister said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/money-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 09:05:25.180065

Crusading journalist Ida B. Wells published a column exposing the lynchings of African-American men and denouncing claims that the lynchings were meant to protect white women. 
Her anti-lynching campaign came after a mob killed three of her friends, who had reportedly opened a grocery store that competed with a white-owned store in Memphis. 
Upset by Wells’ writings, a white mob destroyed her presses and threatened to kill her if she ever published again. She left Memphis for Chicago, but she continued to expose lynchings, calling for national legislation to make lynching a crime. 
In 1898, she took her protest to the White House. 
“Nowhere in the civilized world save the United States of America do men, possessing all civil and political power, go out in bands of 50 and 5,000 to hunt down, shoot, hang or burn to death a single individual, unarmed and absolutely powerless,” she wrote. “We refuse to believe this country, so powerful to defend its citizens abroad, is unable to protect its citizens at home.” 
The National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, which opened in 2018, features a reflection space in honor of her.

BPD officials fear that could all go away if the Trump administration continues to make funding cuts to the National Library Service.
The ALBPD is part of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). IMLS received federal funding, which is funded federally, meaning the state does not give any funds to the accessibility sect of APLS. In March, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order in March to dissolve the small agency.

Kelyn Ralya, the interim director of the Alabama Public Library Service, told members of the BPD Consumer Advisory Committee Tuesday that the agency cut its staffing from 77 employees to 12 this spring.
“That’s quite a cut there,” Ralya said. “Some of the folks that we know are still there, and so we at least have a good contact there.”
Beyond national leadership changes, Rhonda Napier, the regional librarian, said she is most worried about federal funding cuts. Ralya told the committee that federal grants were split into two distributions this year. She said they received the first part and are supposed to receive the second half soon. 
Twenty-one states sued the Trump administration in March in an attempt to delay funding cuts to IMLS and other smaller agencies. A federal judge stalled the dismantling of the agencies through the lawsuit on May 7, according to NPR.
“I do believe that department has been dismantled, or that’s what they’re going for,” Ralya said. “I’m not sure if it’s like that, as in, the funding goes to another source. We just don’t know that yet.”
Without grants from IMLS, Napier said, the ALBPD would disappear.
“Which means all of this goes away,” Napier said in an interview after the meeting, gesturing to long rows of shelves that have books in braille and audiobook tapes.
Napier said the service sends out tapes and book readers to its patrons for free, just like going to an in-person library with physical books. Each tape can hold up to eight books and plugs into the readers via USB port, which she said is a more modern version of a cassette tape. 
The library has a diverse selection of genres, from children’s books to textbooks on statistics. She said there are services that will translate books into braille, but it isn’t free like the library. She said the same of audiobook services like Audible and Spotify.
“All of it is paid for. This is a completely free service,” she said. “Audible, obviously, you have to pay for it, you have to download their software and install it. None of that occurs here.”
Ralya also talked about the recent firing of the Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, along with the assistant director and the director of the copyright office. Todd Blanche, who represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal trial, replaced Hayden.
“That is very disturbing,” Penny Moss, vice chair of the committee said.

The utility, as part of its general rate case request for a 9% rate increase, is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to allow it to base electricity rates on the maximum daily demand customers place on the electricity grid, rather than all of the energy used in a month. 
Under the proposal for daily maximum demand billing, in addition to the $18.50 monthly service charge, the utility would determine the amount of energy consumed during a 15-minute period of peak usage each day, multiply it by four to determine an hourly rate, and charge .19 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) during that hour, compared to the .11 cents per kWh it currently charges. 
NV Energy CEO leaving amid utility overcharging episode

A customer using 3.5 kWh during the peak would pay an additional $19.95 per month, according to testimony from Janet Wells, a regulatory vice-president for NV Energy.  
A customer using 5 kWh would pay $27 more per month, while a customer using 6 kWh would pay $38 more per month, according to data provided by Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents renewable energy providers. 
Total usage during the monthly billing period would be irrelevant.
Demand charges are designed to reduce the strain customers put on the grid at late afternoon and early evening hours.
“If you get home at 5 p.m. and turn your air conditioning on, and run your dishwasher and turn on your lights from 5 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., that is what they’ll multiply to create your usage,” says Sheila Hallstrom of Advanced Energy United. 
The utility currently offers demand pricing as an option for residential customers, but is seeking to make the charges mandatory.  
Proliferation of rooftop solar is among NV Energy’s reasons for pursuing the maximum demand charge. By law, solar rooftop customers are charged rates “far below cost-based levels,” Jeffrey Bohrman, director of Regulatory Pricing and Economic Analysis for NV Energy testified before the PUC. 
The utility contends the charge will help lessen the burden on full-service customers who subsidize costs for those with solar panels. 
“That’s not necessarily accurate,” says Hallstrom “I think it’s a way to raise rates on all customers and disincentivize customers from continuing to invest in solar and other distributed energy resources.” 
The move also “penalizes customers that have already taken advantage of the independent energy opportunities in Nevada,” Hallstrom said during an interview Tuesday. 
NV Energy contends its $18.50 monthly service charge for Southern Nevada customers is inadequate. Given its unsuccessful effort last year to triple the service charge in Northern Nevada to $45, the utility is proposing the demand charge for residential and small commercial customers in the south. 
The utility says the demand charges allow it to more accurately price its services, while offering consumers flexibility in controlling their use.  
“The better reflection of cost causation through effective price signals results not only in increased equity among customers, but also communication with customers about how their behavior affects costs,” Bohrman said.
“Not a single utility across the country is doing this,” says Hallstrom, adding that regulators in other states have rejected similar proposals from other investor-owned utilities. “Part of the reason is because it’s too complicated for people to really understand. NV Energy’s reasoning is that customers will be able to change their energy use, but they can’t necessarily do that if they don’t understand their bills.” 
The complexity of the rate is “very often relied on by opponents of residential demand charges,” Bohrman testified, adding the argument can “be misleading to decision makers.”

It's a corporate giveaway. (Photo: iStock/Getty Images)As a proud Nevadan and Lake Tahoe resident who cherishes our public lands and forests, I feel compelled to speak out against the so-called “Fix Our Forests Act” (FOFA). Don’t let the title fool you! This federal legislation is no fix. In fact, it’s a reckless attempt to hand over the keys to our national forests to corporate logging interests under the guise of wildfire prevention. If passed, FOFA would open the floodgates to massive, unchecked logging projects that threaten the very landscapes we hold dear in Nevada and across the country.
Let’s start with the most alarming piece: FOFA would enable a Trump executive order to ramp up commercial logging across nearly 60% of America’s national forests. This is not hyperbole. It’s a direct result of language in FOFA that weakens environmental protections and strips the public of its voice in managing these lands. The bill allows agencies to bypass crucial environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Incredibly, it even permits NEPA reviews to happen after logging projects have already been completed, undermining the entire purpose of environmental oversight.
It gets worse. FOFA dramatically expands the size of “Categorical Exclusions” (CEs), administrative loopholes that allow certain forest projects to dodge public review and environmental study. Under FOFA, logging operations up to 10,000 acres (15 square miles) could move forward without any public input. To put that into perspective, that’s roughly the size of more than 7,500 football fields, cleared without so much as a town hall meeting. That’s not forest management, that’s a corporate giveaway.
The bill also advances a deeply flawed narrative: that commercial logging and grazing are effective wildfire mitigation strategies. The science says otherwise. Study after study has shown that the most effective ways to protect communities from wildfire involve local measures, like creating defensible space around homes, hardening buildings against fire, and developing emergency response plans. FOFA includes no funding for these proven strategies. Instead, it funnels energy and attention into large-scale commercial logging, which may actually increase fire risk by removing old-growth trees that are naturally more fire-resistant.
Here in Nevada, we understand the value of healthy, resilient ecosystems. Our forests aren’t just scenic backdrops. They’re critical to our water supplies, our recreation, and our identity. The Fix Our Forests Act threatens that balance. It’s a Trojan horse for deregulation, designed to sideline science, slash public involvement, and clear the way for extractive industries. Worse yet, it aligns directly with recent moves by the Trump administration to prioritize timber extraction over environmental stewardship. Just days before FOFA was introduced in the Senate, Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture released a memo implementing an executive order to massively expand logging across federal lands.
This is the same administration that has gutted staff at the U.S. Forest Service and slashed funding for wildfire prevention. If President Trump and the U.S. Congress truly cared about protecting communities, we’d see investments in firefighter support, forest restoration, and climate resilience, not just more clear-cutting. Instead, his executive order and FOFA combine to create a dangerous one-two punch: under-resourced forest agencies forced to chase arbitrary timber targets, at the expense of meaningful wildfire mitigation.
Let’s be clear: climate change, not tree density, is the root driver of the catastrophic wildfires we’ve seen across the West. Rising temperatures, prolonged drought, and increasingly erratic weather patterns are drying out our forests and setting the stage for firestorms. Logging our way out of this problem is not just shortsighted, it’s counterproductive. More logging won’t bring back the rain. What we need is bold, climate-smart leadership that prioritizes long-term forest health and community safety over short-term industry profits.
Unfortunately, Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03) and Congressman Mark Amodei (NV-02) cosponsored FOFA in the House, and Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04) voted for the bill. Congresswoman Dina Titus (NV-01) was Nevada’s lone “nay.” The bill will now make its way through the U.S. Senate and Nevada’s senators haven’t yet revealed how they plan to vote.
Whether we’re talking about FOFA or Trump’s executive orders, the bottom line is the same: this is an attack on our public lands. These are lands that belong to all of us, not just the timber lobby or political donors. Nevada’s senators, and senators across the country for that matter, should reject FOFA in its current form. We need our representatives to stop looking at our public lands with dollar signs in their eyes. Instead, they should champion legislation that supports fire-resilient communities through real solutions: funding for home hardening, local emergency planning, defensible space projects, and prescribed fire treatments guided by science and Indigenous knowledge.
We need forest policy rooted in stewardship, not exploitation. Nevada deserves better, and so do the forests we all depend on.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2165258599-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-21 08:03:16.680896

The 2025 Vermont Teacher of the Year, she teaches English and History at Winooski High School.As a teacher, I do everything in my power to uplift student voices. I publish student’s memoirs, I celebrate student’s writing of their own short stories, I listen to impassioned students’ speeches about racial injustice, I create showcases for students to share their poetry and I read countless original poems and narratives by my student authors. I do this because I believe in the transformative power of the arts. I have seen firsthand a shy, reluctant student blossom into a captivating poet; I have seen the ripple effect of a student who finds their voice as a writer and then does well in their other classes and beyond high school; I’ve seen students who struggle in some academic areas, but when given a paintbrush or a trombone, excel. This is what the arts do: they create moments for our students to find themselves and their voice. Isn’t this what we want out of a high school experience? There are few things better in life than watching a child recognize the power of their voice. The arts give students an opportunity to do that. It thus pains me that all local arts organizations that I work closely with are experiencing the loss of federal funding. Vermont Arts Council, The Flynn, Vermont Humanities, the Governor’s Institute for the Arts, and Vermont Folklife Center all are scrambling to make up for the loss of money that they depend upon. Each one of these organizations creates moments for my students to know that their voice and that their expression matters. From organizing student matinees of diverse performances, to funding poetry workshops and competitions, to providing teaching artists in classrooms, to working closely with students to tell their family’s stories, the work of these organizations in our classrooms is vital and essential. The arts are never an add-on to our curriculum; they are a central component of what an inclusive classroom is.READ MORE
It’s really hard to be a teacher right now. The mental health crisis among our teenagers following the pandemic is ongoing while mental health federal funding is threatened, our profession seems to be constantly attacked and our federal department of education has been slashed, and the constant attack on creating classrooms and schools that celebrate diversity, equity, and inclusion is relentless. Yet, the thing is, I never lose hope because of our kids. Teaching is an act of hope every single day. The kids give me hope: their creativity, their genius, their resilience, their ideas, their perseverance, and above all, their powerful voices. In early May, I had the honor to travel to Washington, DC for the National Poetry Out Loud finals, sponsored by the the National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Foundation. While I expected this to be an amazing experience for my student, Mapenzi Selemani, who represented Vermont as the state champion and became a regional finalist, I was struck by the impact the few days had on me as a teacher. My knowledge in the power of poetry to help us honor the human experience and the power of words to change lives was affirmed again and again. And this is why we need you: we need Vermonters to unequivocally stand in denial of the Trump administration and make it known loud and clear that you also believe in the power of the arts. In Vermont, we believe that the arts are integral to our success and we support the arts in our full capacity. As Elizabeth Fascoia, executive director of the Governor’s Institute of Vermont, said, we must make our voices loud in our belief in the power of the arts to transform lives and our knowledge in how vital they are for our state, our future leaders and our economy. Our students need you, as Elizabeth said, but our teachers need you, too. We need your support to do this important work with our students.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Caitlin MacLeod-Bluver: Amid funding cuts, Vermont needs to support the arts.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

Food shelves alone cannot provide enough food for entire families 365 days per year.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Stock: Proposed SNAP cuts would hit Vermont hard.","Dear Editor,I joined the Shelburne Food Shelf over ten years ago when there were about 30 families coming for help. Over time, that increased to 40 or 45 households per month. During the pandemic, the number of households served grew to between 90 and 100 families per month. Today, that peak has turned into a high plateau with 130 families served each month.The increase is due to Inflation and to wages that have not kept pace with costs. Please remember, this is Shelburne, a relatively affluent town in Vermont; the census in less affluent towns is higher.Right now, the Congress is getting ready to vote on huge cuts to food aid in order to give tax breaks to billionaires. These cuts will leave children and families hungry — not food insecure — hungry. Food shelves alone cannot provide enough food for entire families 365 days per year. SNAP benefits 66,500 Vermonters and the cuts considered will shift $38 million to the Vermont state budget if Vermont can maintain the benefit. Experts say this shift is not sustainable. Our state covering this entire additional cost seems unlikely, given the current budget. Yet Congress appears willing to make these cuts. They appear willing to force hungry people to prove they are working; this is when many people that use food shelves cannot do that. They work in our cash economy as housekeepers or day laborers and, therefore, cannot provide pay stubs. Families are getting by on a day-to-day and week-to week basis. Nearly 35,000 Vermont SNAP recipients live in households with a person who is disabled or an older adult. These households have already been devastated by inflation and are likely to be further hurt when tariffs (a regressive tax on lower income individuals and families) flow through the system. The cuts go beyond SNAP (supplemental nutrition assistance program) and include further cuts to farm to school programs and even to food inspection and safety standards. Remember that 2 months ago the USDA slashed $500 million from the Emergency Food Assistance Program which will hurt food banks, the main supplier of food to local food shelves. Congress is making a choice to give tax breaks to the wealthiest rather than provide food to hungry Americans. This is unconscionable — and we will not forget.Susan StockFormer Shelburne Food Shelf board chair and current volunteerRead the story on VTDigger here:  Susan Stock: Proposed SNAP cuts would hit Vermont hard.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letters-to-the-editor_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

Detainees often complain of violence, inedible food, limited programming and subpar healthcare. Lack of sunlight may be an unexpected addition to the list. But sunlight deprivation causes a myriad of serious issues, including high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of diabetes, as well as a host of mental health problems such as depression and sleep disorders. 
Jails built in the last century often have few windows and little room for recreation and natural light, making them “obsolete” by today’s design standards, according to Kenneth Ricci, prison and jail architect with Nelson Worldwide, a design firm.

Bringing sunlight and fresh air into jails often takes a back seat to other pressing issues. But a lawsuit in San Francisco suggests forcing detainees to live in the dark could violate their constitutional rights. In 2021, a group of men awaiting trial at two California jails sued the city and county of San Francisco for being confined without fresh air and sunlight.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim ultimately agreed with the men. In 2023, she ruled that the jails had violated the Constitution’s due process clause. The officials “created the problem by building a jail without a secured outdoor exercise yard and then relies upon that problem to claim that it cannot provide a secure way for inmates to have access to direct sunlight,” she wrote. 
These issues are top of mind for residents who have followed the closure of a jail in St. Louis, where detainees can go years without seeing the sun. The jails in all three cities have requirements to provide sunlight and fresh air, either mandated by jail policy, or by the state or federal governments. Yet all three have consistently fallen short, according to jail officials and state and federal inspection reports. 
City officials in St. Louis closed their crumbling older jail in 2021, but shuffling detainees into the remaining, newer jail hasn’t solved the problems. 
 St. Louis City Justice Center

  A photo shows shadows falling on the outside walls of a St. Louis jail building (Julia Rendleman for The Marshall Project).
When Darnell Rusan saw the sun for the first time in over a year, during a transfer from the city jail to the courthouse, he later recalled, he gazed up at it and took a deep breath.
“I hadn’t seen it in so long, breathed fresh air in so long,” said Rusan, who was released from jail in March. “I’m going to make sure I never go back in there.”
The St. Louis Division of Corrections stipulates in its official policies and procedures that every jail in the city “will have an outside exercise/recreation area for inmate use or an area that provides natural light.” In addition, all facilities must provide “a wide range of recreational program[s]” that includes indoor and outdoor exercise and leisure-time activities.  
However, the city’s downtown jail – the maximum-security St. Louis City Justice Center – doesn’t meet these requirements, conceded Interim Jail Commissioner Doug Burris. There is no outdoor exercise area and no windows in the cells, just a pane of glass in the door that faces the dayroom. 
Burris said in an April interview with The Marshall Project – St. Louis that, even on a bright summer’s day, “not much” sunlight makes it to people inside. Only a paltry amount of light filters through thick frosted windows at the top of a small rec area where, on a good day, detainees may spend a few hours. What’s more, he said, some people go years without access to the outdoors. 
“We’ve got 50 to 75 people in here that have been here for at least two years, up to five years,” he said. “We’re taking an abundance off their life.” 
Instead of lobbying to improve outdoor access at the jail, Burris said he is in the process of updating the jail’s guidelines to remove this requirement. The City Justice Center was designed without an outdoor recreation area. Fixing it would require finding the space in downtown St. Louis to construct a secure outdoor yard, or building one on the roof – both extremely costly, said Ricci, the architect at Nelson Worldwide.  
Burris believes the lack of opportunities for recreation and exercise is harmful. “To house people at the facility in excess of a year likely exacerbates mental health issues for detained people already afflicted,” he wrote in a 2025 operational review of the jail. “It also could create mental health issues for those who previously had none.” 
Rusan was detained awaiting trial for more than four years. Over the course of his stay, Rusan said he was often unable to tell the difference between day and night. As a result, he suffered disruptions in his sleep that continued well after he returned home.
“That place is like a basement,” said Rusan, who was ultimately found not guilty. “Now that I’m home, [my family has] been asking me why I keep waking up at night.”
Understaffing also means sections of the jail are on lockdown for 23 hours a day, meaning that many detainees are “not even going to the indoor rec area,” said Khanika Harper, a member of the city’s detention facilities oversight board. “As far as actual sunlight, they don’t have access to that at all.” (Burris confirmed in April that roughly half of the pods in the jail are on 23-hour lockdown.)
With the demolition in March of the Workhouse, St. Louis’s former medium security jail, Burris said the city’s focus is on improving conditions at the Justice Center. But improving access to natural light and fresh air were not on Burris’s list of immediate action items, which includes redesigning the jail intake area, getting a tablet for every detainee and creating a mentorship program and retention plan for jail staff. 
However, he said he hopes increased staffing and a “rocket docket” (that allows people who have been detained longest to get their case quickly before a judge) will ameliorate the worst effects.
“I would like to get to a place where we could even get some vans and go pick up trash, just so they could be out in the sun,” he said. “But I’ve got more immediate needs right now.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250520-SUNLIGHT-GKim-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The first five graduates from Purdue University Global Law School took their new attorney’s oath Tuesday morning, marking a milestone for both the school and Indiana’s legal system. 
At the ceremony held at the Indiana Roof Ballroom, the Indiana Supreme Court admitted 68 new attorneys, including the Purdue Global Law graduates. 
The ceremony was attended by all five justices of the Indiana Supreme Court, as well as judges from the U.S. District Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts, the Indiana Court of Appeals, and the Indiana Tax Court. 
The ceremony follows a July 2024 amendment to Indiana’s Rules of Admission and Discipline Rule 13 that allowed graduates of non-American Bar Association accredited, Indiana-based online law schools to sit for the Indiana bar exam. 
It was meant to address the state’s justice gap in rural or other underserved areas.
This amendment made Purdue Global Law graduates eligible to sit for the bar exam upon graduation. At the time, California was the only other state that allowed such eligibility.  
Indiana currently has a lawyer shortage. Indiana Court of Appeals Chief Judge Robert Altice told the graduates Tuesday that out of 6.8 million Hoosiers, only 19,055 are lawyers. 
“You are joining a very special group today,” Altice said. “As less than 1% of our total population, I encourage you to think about a small specialized group you are.” 
All five eligible Purdue Global Law graduates passed the February Indiana Bar Exam on their first attempt. According to Indiana Bar exam result data, Indiana’s overall pass rate for first time takers is 63%. The graduates are:  

Joud Elias
Lindley Jarrett
Jeff Kraft
Daniel Stahoviak
Abby Strehle

Strehle is a nurse practitioner, mother and now dual-licensed attorney in both Indiana and California. She attended Purdue for her undergraduate degree 26 years ago and received a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Indianapolis. Following that she completed her Master of Science and became a licensed Nurse Practitioner. 
Strehle said she always had an interest in law so she returned to Purdue Global Law’s fully online program. She completed her law degree in August 2023 while continuing to work in healthcare and raising her family in Bargersville, Indiana. 
“I wasn’t willing to give up my nights or time with my kids for a traditional law school,” she said.

Strehle, the owner and founder of Encompass Legal Services, now practices disability law in all 50 states. She said she wanted to take her experience in the medical field into the legal one. 
“I’ve seen the other side,” she said. “I know what people are going through when making either end-life decisions or something that disrupts their entire life.” 
She said that her online law school experience was far from easy but she was able to make connections and even some close friends online. She said the courses are set up in similar formats including course work, weekly zoom meetings and breakout sessions. 
Strehel said the Indiana Supreme Court amendment that created the path for Purdue Global Law graduates to become eligible for the bar exam means everything to her. 
“When I applied to Purdue Global, I only hoped that being licensed in Indiana would be a thing,” she said. “The fact that I can be licensed in Indiana allows me to really do what I want to do and the reason why I did what I wanted.”
Dean of Purdue Global Law School, Martin Pritikin called the moment “a turning point” for access to justice. Pritikin was a professor and administrator of a traditional law school for 12 years before he became interested in online education. 
Purdue Global Law — previously called Concord Law School — was founded in 1998 and was one of the nation’s first fully online law schools. Pritikin said the school operates at one-third of the cost of traditional programs and is designed for nontraditional students – working professionals or others who need flexibility. 
“Our typical student is not someone who went straight from high school to college to law school,” he said. “Even though they may be new lawyers they are not new to the workforce.”
Pritikin said the curriculum at Purdue Global is as “rigorous” as anything someone would get at a traditional law school. He said that people think the school is easy because it’s online, but that’s not the case. 
Pritikin said the Indiana Supreme Court “took a chance” on Purdue Global, and hopes the school is a big part of solving the access to justice crisis. He noted more than half of the students enrolling are not from Indianapolis — they are from rural, small and underserved areas. 
The school currently has 78 Indiana-based students enrolled — about 10% of total enrollment.
“It’s the best way to get more lawyers in underserved areas and to make it easier for people in those areas to stay where they are to attend law school.”

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Just one year ago, JD Vance was a leading advocate of the Great Lakes and the efforts to restore the largest system of freshwater on the face of the planet.
As a U.S. senator from Ohio, Vance called the lakes “an invaluable asset” for his home state. He supported more funding for a program that delivers “the tools we need to fight invasive species, algal blooms, pollution, and other threats to the ecosystem” so that the Great Lakes would be protected “for generations to come.”
But times have changed.
This spring, Vance is vice president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is imposing deep cuts and new restrictions, upending the very restoration efforts that Vance once championed. With the peak summer season just around the corner, Great Lakes scientists are concerned that they have lost the ability to protect the public from toxic algal blooms, which can kill animals and sicken people.
Cutbacks have gutted the staff at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Severe spending limits have made it difficult to purchase ordinary equipment for processing samples, such as filters and containers. Remaining staff plans to launch large data-collecting buoys into the water this week, but it’s late for a field season that typically runs from April to October.

In addition to a delayed launch, problems with personnel, supplies, vessel support and real-time data sharing have created doubts about the team’s ability to operate the buoys, said Gregory Dick, director of the NOAA cooperative institute at the University of Michigan that partners with the lab. Both the lab and institute operate out of a building in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was custom built as NOAA’s hub in the Great Lakes region, and both provide staff to the algal blooms team.
“This has massive impacts on coastal communities,” Dick said.
Multiple people who have worked with the lab also told ProPublica that there are serious gaps in this year’s monitoring of algal blooms, which are often caused by excess nutrient runoff from farms. Data generated by the lab’s boats and buoys, and publicly shared, could be limited or interrupted, they said.
That data has helped to successfully avoid a repeat of a 2014 crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when nearly half a million people were warned to not drink the water or even touch it.
If the streams of information are cut off, “stakeholders will be very unhappy,” said Bret Collier, a branch chief at the lab who oversaw the federal scientists that run the harmful algal bloom program for the Great Lakes. He was fired in the purge of federal probationary workers in February.
The lab has lost about 35% of its 52-member workforce since February, according to the president of the lab’s union, and it was not allowed to fill several open positions. The White House released preliminary budget recommendations last week that would make significant cuts to NOAA. The budget didn’t provide details, but indicated the termination of “a variety of climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs, which are not aligned with Administration policy” of ending “‘Green New Deal’ initiatives.”
An earlier document obtained by ProPublica and reported widely proposed a 74% funding cut to NOAA’s research office, home of the Great Lakes lab.
Vance’s office didn’t respond to questions from ProPublica about how federal cuts have affected Great Lakes research. The White House also didn’t respond to messages.
Municipal water leaders in Cleveland and Toledo have written public letters of support on behalf of the lab, advocating for the continuation of its work because of how important its tools and resources are for drinking water management.
In a statement to ProPublica, staffers from Toledo’s water system credited the Great Lakes lab and NOAA for alerting it to potential blooms near its intake days ahead of time. This has saved the system significant costs, they said, and helped it avoid feeding excess chemicals into the water.
“The likelihood of another 2014 ‘don’t drink the water’ advisory has been minimized to almost nothing by additional vigilance” from both the lab and local officials, they said.
Remaining staff have had to contend with not only a lack of capacity but also tight limits on spending and travel.
Several people who have worked in or with the lab said that the staff was hampered by strict credit card limits imposed on government employees as part of the effort to reduce spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheaded by presidential adviser Elon Musk.
“The basic scientific supplies that we use to provide the local communities with information on algal bloom toxicity — our purchasing of them is being restricted based on the limitations currently being put in by the administration,” Collier said.
NOAA and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, didn’t respond to messages from ProPublica. Neither did a DOGE official. Eight U.S. senators, including the minority leader, sent a letter in March to a top NOAA leader inquiring about many of the changes, but they never received a response.
The department described its approach to some of its cuts when it eliminated nearly $4 million in funding for the NOAA cooperative institute at Princeton University and emphasized the importance of avoiding wasteful government spending. ProPublica has reported on how the loss of research grants at Princeton and the more significant defunding of the NOAA lab it works with would be a serious setback for weather and climate preparedness.
A number of the staffing losses at the Great Lakes lab came when employees accepted offers of early retirement or voluntary separation; others were fired probationary workers targeted by DOGE across the government. That includes Collier, who had 24 years of professional experience, largely as a research professor, before he was hired last year into a position that, according to the lab’s former director, had been difficult to fill.
A scientist specializing in the toxic algal blooms was also fired. She worked on the team for 14 years through the cooperative institute before accepting a federal position last year, which made her probationary, too.
A computer scientist who got real-time data onto the lab’s website — and the only person who knew how to push out the weekly sampling data on harmful algal blooms — was also fired. She was probationary because she too was hired for a federal position after working with the institute.
And because of a planned retirement, no one holds the permanent position of lab director, though there is an acting director. The lab isn’t allowed to fill any positions due to a federal hiring freeze.
At the same time, expected funds for the lab’s cooperative institute are delayed, which means, Dick said, it may soon lay off staff, including people on the algal blooms team.
In March, Cleveland’s water commissioner wrote a letter calling for continued support for the Great Lakes lab and other NOAA-funded operations in the region, saying that access to real-time forecasts for Lake Erie are “critically important in making water treatment decisions” for more than 1.3 million citizens.
In 2006, there was a major outbreak of hypoxia, an issue worsened by algal blooms where oxygen-depleted water can become corrosive, discolored and full of excess manganese, which is a neurotoxin at high levels. Cleveland Water collaborated with the lab on developing a “groundbreaking” hypoxia forecast model, said Scott Moegling, who worked for both the Cleveland utility and Ohio’s drinking water regulatory agency.
“I knew which plants were going to get hit,” Moegling said. “I knew about when, and I knew what the treatment we would need would be, and we could staff accordingly.”
The American Meteorological Society, in partnership with the National Weather Association, spotlighted this warning system in its statement in support of NOAA research, saying that it helps “keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.”
Collier, the former branch chief, said that quality data may be lacking this year, not just for drinking water suppliers, but also the U.S. Coast Guard, fisheries, shipping companies, recreational businesses and shoreline communities that rely on it to navigate risk. In response to a recent survey of stakeholders, the president of a trade organization serving Great Lakes cargo vessels said that access to NOAA’s real-time data “is critically important to the commercial shipping fleet when making navigation decisions.”
Because federal law requires NOAA to monitor harmful algal blooms, the cuts may run against legal obligations, several current and former workers told ProPublica. The blooms program was “federally mandated to be active every single day, without exception,” Collier said.
The 2024 bloom in Lake Erie was the earliest on record. At its peak, it covered 550 square miles. Warming temperatures worsen the size and frequency of algal blooms. While the field season was historically only about 90 days, Collier said, last year the team was deployed for 211 days.
As the shallowest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is typically first to show signs of problems. But it’s also an emblem of environmental stewardship, thanks to its striking recovery from unchecked industrial pollution. The lake was once popularly declared “dead.” A highly publicized fire inflamed a river that feeds into it. Even Dr. Seuss knocked it in the 1971 version of “The Lorax.” The book described fish leaving a polluted pond “in search of some water that isn’t so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.”
But the rise of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, and labs like the one protecting the Great Lakes, along with legislation that protected water from pollution, led to noticeable changes. By 1986, two Ohio graduate students had succeeded in persuading Theodor Geisel, the author behind Dr. Seuss, to revise future editions of his classic book.
“I should no longer be saying bad things about a body of water that is now, due to great civic and scientific effort, the happy home of smiling fish,” Geisel wrote to them.
Early this year, headlines out of the Midwest suggested that “Vance could be a game-changing Great Lakes advocate” and that he might “save the Great Lakes from Trump.”
A 2023 report to Congress about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular funding mechanism for projects that protect the lakes, including the research lab’s, described the lab’s work on harmful algal blooms as one of its “success stories.” Last year, with Vance as a co-sponsor, an act to extend support for the funding program passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Another bipartisan effort to reauthorize it launched in January.
Project 2025, the plan produced by the Heritage Foundation for Trump’s second term, recommended that the president consider whether NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.”
NOAA is “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” the plan said, and this industry’s mission “seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”
“That is not to say NOAA is useless,” it added, “but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”
When asked at his confirmation hearing in January if he agreed with Project 2025’s recommendation of dismantling NOAA, Howard Lutnick, head of the commerce department, said no.
One month later, the Great Lakes lab’s probationary staff got termination notices. That includes Nicole Rice, who spent a decade with NOAA. A promotion made her communications job vulnerable to the widespread firings of federal probationary workers.
In recent testimony to a Michigan Senate committee, Rice expressed deep concern about the future of the Great Lakes.
“It has taken over a century of bipartisan cooperation, investment and science to bring the Great Lakes back from the brink of ecological collapse,” Rice said. “But these reckless cuts could undo the progress in just a few short years, endangering the largest surface freshwater system in the world.”

It’s the shock and awe of Democrats and progressives that confuses me. 
Did anyone expect the Republican-controlled legislature would do anything other than undermine voters, criminalize reproductive health care and oppress workers? After all, these actions reflect their strong brand. 
What have progressives done to prevent the carnage unfolding yet again? Protesting in the statehouse, signing petitions and rallying in the streets only work if there is a strategy fueling those actions. 
As a long time left-flank campaign strategist, I’m here to tell you: strategy requires analysis. Analysis demands facts. And facts are hard to confront. But if there’s one thing I know about Missourians (I’m a born and bred one myself), it’s that we can do hard things.
So, what happened this year just months after abortion and workers’ rights sailed to voter-approved victories? 
Missouri ballot measures embody a tactics hungry progressive movement devoid of strategy. If the working class reality in our state is a wound, ballot measures are mere band-aids. What we need are antibiotics — strategies that target the systems that infect poor, working class and rural communities, and disproportionately the people of color among them. 
Now with the first legislative session after Amendment 3 and Prop A under our belts, this landscape has gone septic. An abortion and trans health care ban will be back on the ballot. At the stroke of the governor’s pen, paid sick leave that voters approved will be repealed and minimum wage could remain inadequately stagnant. 
The facts of how we got here so quickly after these November wins are hard to ignore and even harder to dispute. 
The campaign behind Amendment 3 in Missouri decided early on that the only path to success at the ballot was to prioritize GOP voters over their young, people of color base, as reported in The Nation just last week. Democrats across Missouri and nationwide took to the campaign trail selling a delusional promise — you can have your abortion and MAGA, too.
This single issue approach to bait MAGA voters into securing “reproductive freedom” also ushered in a new era of fascism.
Veteran polling firm Perry Undem released a post-election analysis that shows voters make decisions based on “who they believe sees them, understands them and represents their values — whether or not those values are expressed through specific policies.” 
A political strategy to win back progressive power in Missouri requires values that reflect progress — and trust that most Missourians, like all people, can move towards what is right and just if they have the information.
This means taking principled stances that help people navigate the complicated life challenges they face, and doing it radically, loudly and unapologetically. 
We have to educate people about how an abortion — sometimes later in pregnancy — can help a poor working class woman dig herself out of poverty and put food on the table for her existing kids. 
We need to defend the rights of transgender people and explain that if their marginalized identities can be targeted so, too, can yours.
You want affordable food? Then protect the immigrants who farm it. 
Worried your child won’t come home from school alive? Unseat the lawmaker who refuses to reform gun laws. 
And yes, that means primary the Democrats, too. 
Nationwide, nearly 90 million voters stayed home last year. Voter apathy is a real threat to democracy. If we want people to feel the ballot box is worth their time, they need to believe their votes matter. 
This requires electoral change.  
Direct democracy is a powerful tool, but as evidenced in Missouri, a useless one if we cannot elect lawmakers who will protect the change voters approve. Missourians deserve leaders who will implement radical strategies at the temperature needed to burn fascism to the ground. 
From one engaged Missouri voter to another: demand nothing less if you truly want your vote to stick.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally10-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

 Health officials celebrated the progress in reducing opioid deaths and cited public health interventions. But a treatment recovery director warned the data could be misleading.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont opioid overdoses fell in 2024 for the second year in a row.","Vermont’s opioid overdose deaths fell for the second year in a row in 2024, hitting their lowest annual tally in four years, according to the latest opioid annual report from the Vermont Department of Health. The department reported 183 Vermonters died of opioid-related overdoses in 2024, compared with 236 deaths in 2023. The drop was paralleled by falling deaths at a national level, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Deputy Health Commissioner Kelly Dougherty said her team was happy to see the decline in deaths, but noted they remain high — higher than pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels and higher than in 2015 when then-Gov. Peter Shumlin raised alarms about a rising rate of overdoses in the state.Health officials had been encouraged by a drop in overdoses in 2019, only for the trend to reverse during the pandemic, when Vermonters saw their lives upended in a variety of ways. Recent years have also seen a continued rise in potent opioids like fentanyl and xylazine, often in combination with non-opioid drugs like cocaine. The Vermont Health Department and substance use organizations across Vermont have fought back by aggressively expanding access to naloxone, a medication that can reverse opioid overdoses and prevent them from becoming fatal. Dougherty said the department has distributed naloxone throughout the state, making it available online, in schools, at job sites and even in a few vending machines. The department has also widely distributed fentanyl and xylazine test strips and co-created the VT Help Link, a “one-stop shop” to access services and treatment. Dougherty said these initiatives are reflective of a shift toward seeing opioid use and substance use disorder as a medical condition that can be targeted with harm reduction strategies. Vermont has a handful of community organizations that distribute clean syringes. The state legalized safe injection sites in 2024, but the first site in Burlington is still in the planning stage. READ MORE
There are limitations to the overdose data. Dougherty said deaths are falling, but little is known about whether fewer Vermonters are using opioids or have substance use disorders. Tracie Hauck, executive director of the drug recovery group Turning Point Center of Rutland, said focusing on death data alone could be misleading. “From what I see in our community, things aren’t any better,” she said. “Crime is picking up again. You’re seeing people that are struggling health wise and have no place to live and are using substances.”Hauck said a lack of supportive transitional housing for Vermonters in recovery is a gap that can make it hard for people to stay sober. “A lot of people we’ve sent to rehab are homeless to begin with,” she said. “So if they don’t go to a transitional living program after they complete rehab, they’re back out on the street and there’s no housing for them.”People without stable housing often find themselves in “survival mode,” leading them back toward substance use, Hauck said. “People don’t have phones. They don’t have reliable transportation. They don’t have stable housing, so they’re just in survival mode continuously,” she said. “And that doesn’t lead to real, good, solid recovery because their stress level continues to be so high.”Hauck said a more holistic approach to substance use disorder is needed that incorporates a person’s mental and physical health, housing, and interactions with the criminal justice system. Dougherty echoed the need for more transitional housing along with “step-down” facilities that can help rehabilitate people after their initial medical withdrawal. Both urged Vermonters to look past their assumptions and judgements about drug use and consider the human beings affected by the opioid crisis. “These are people — 183 people who were somebody’s loved one, somebody’s friend, somebody’s family member,” Dougherty said.Hauck said despite her reservations about focusing solely on deaths, she still favors harm reduction measures like naloxone that offer people more chances to seek help.“I am not anybody’s higher power to decide whether they should live or die, and I don’t think any other human being is, but I just know sometimes it takes a lot for someone to go through before they make that decision to get involved in recovery,” she said. Hauck said she has seen people on Facebook complain about the distribution of naloxone without considering the full implications of not having it available. Anyone can risk opioid overdose when drugs like cocaine are so frequently contaminated with them.“They’re not pausing and thinking about how tainted our supply is and how far that reaches, and to who that reaches to,” she said. “It’s not just people with substance use issues. It’s people that use recreationally.”Dougherty said she was concerned about potential changes to the health care system being discussed at the federal level. Congress and President Donald Trump are working on legislation that could lead to Medicaid cuts. The Trump administration has proposed cuts to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. None of the Vermont Department of Health’s harm reduction services rely on federal funding, Dougherty said. But Medicaid pays for many substance use services in Vermont, so the department is worried about cuts overall, she said. “We’re just bracing generally at the health department, beyond substance use, because it’s like a full-out attack on public health,” she said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont opioid overdoses fell in 2024 for the second year in a row.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HUyTN-opioid-overdose-deaths-hit-four-year-low-1-1024x694.png,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

Would our next governor keep it or ax it?,"A New Jersey attorney general order bars local cops from cooperating with civil immigration enforcement. Would our next governor keep it or ax it? (Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)With Gov. Phil Murphy set to leave office in eight months, the future of his administration’s push to prevent local police from assisting with civil immigration enforcement is in doubt.
Since 2019, an Attorney General’s Office directive has prevented this kind of cooperation between New Jersey law enforcement and federal immigration agents. But Republicans running in June 10’s primaries want to ax that order, and at least one of the six Democrats in the race does, too.
This comes amid the backdrop of the second Trump administration, which has named detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants a chief priority and has targeted orders like New Jersey’s, called the Immigrant Trust Directive.
There are five Republicans vying for the party’s nomination to succeed Murphy, a Democrat, and the front-runners have the same position: repeal the directive and cooperate with the federal government when it comes to immigration enforcement.
There is more nuance on the Democratic side, where six are seeking the Dem nod for governor. Two want to keep the directive, one wants to lose it, and three want to give the order the force of law by passing a bill stalled in the Legislature called the Immigrant Trust Act. That measure would codify the directive and expand it to bar immigration enforcement activity at “sensitive locations” like schools and hospitals, and require public reporting on cooperation with federal agents.
Democrats
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, and teachers union chief Steve Spiller all support passage of the Immigrant Trust Act.
The immigration issue is close to home for Baraka, who has protested the opening of a new migrant jail in his city, Delaney Hall. Baraka, who alleges the building is operating without proper city permits, was arrested by federal agents at the facility on May 9 and accused of trespassing (the charge was dismissed Monday).
Baraka has fought back on what he says is criticism that he focuses too much time on protecting immigrants.
“You have people who say, ‘How is this our fight?’ And ask me, ‘Mayor, why are you protecting immigrants?’ Well, and I said it repeatedly over and over again, if you’re not from the Choctaw Nation, or the Lenni Lenape, if you’re not a Cherokee or Apache, then somebody in your family has come here undocumented,” he said during a courthouse rally last week.
Fulop said during an NJ Spotlight News debate last week that the time to pass the Immigrant Trust Act was when acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said she was investigating Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over their support of the policy. Fulop said he’d sign the bill into law if elected governor.
“It speaks to the value of New Jersey. It speaks to how you view the immigrant community. It speaks to how they live their life in the community of Jersey City or Newark or wherever they reside, and that is an important starting point,” Fulop said.
Spiller, a former Montclair mayor, also supports codifying the directive and expanding its safeguards for undocumented residents. He has said he would appoint an attorney general who would protect immigrant communities.
He said he wants to “make sure our immigrants are not unfairly targeted through accessing data or locations where they should be in safe haven.”
Reps. Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer have expressed reservations about passing the Immigrant Trust Act, citing the potential for legal challenges.
At a recent event with Latino supporters at an Elizabeth supermarket, Gottheimer said he believes fighting for immigrants is “essential,” but the proposed legislation needs some “tweaks.”
“Right now, it doesn’t allow for violent criminals who are undocumented to not be here anymore, and I think not allowing for that is a huge mistake,” he said.
Sherrill, a former federal prosecutor, noted that the directive has already withstood judicial review (a federal appeals court rejected a challenge to it in 2021). She said she worries that taking additional action would allow for a new challenge that could make it to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“I also share concerns raised by a wide range of people that the bill must be clear about criminal consequences for those who commit violent offenses,” she said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney wants to repeal the directive altogether. He said it “doesn’t do anything but give false hope” to undocumented immigrants, and likened it to providing “sanctuary status.”
“If you came here as a criminal, you got to leave. If you break the law here, you got to leave. But Washington — and I’m sorry because this is where this lies — Washington has to come up with a pathway” to citizenship, he said during the NJ Spotlight debate.
Republicans
The Republican front-runners in the race clash plenty, but agree on repealing the directive. And none of them would sign the Immigrant Trust Act if passed by the state Legislature.
State Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said in an interview that he’d cooperate with the federal government, whether or not he likes the law. Bramnick added that he wouldn’t support any legislation that offers “sanctuary” protections.
Jack Ciattarelli, a former Assemblyman who is seeking the governor’s seat for the third time this year, said he’d repeal the directive on his first day in office.
“We are not going to have sanctuary cities and we’re not going to be a sanctuary state,” he told the New Jersey Monitor. “That only encourages illegal immigration. I said that in ‘21, we’re doing that again here in ‘25.”
Former radio talk show host Bill Spadea said he wants to repeal the directive and any other laws that protect undocumented immigrants, like the one that allows people without citizenship status to obtain driver’s licenses. Spadea said he’d declare a state of emergency for public safety on his first day in office to suspend these laws.
“We have the potential of criminal aliens who have been convicted in their home countries or accused of horrible crimes here lining up to get a New Jersey driver’s license. It’s not acceptable and it’s going to end by executive order,” he said following a campaign event in Seaside Heights. “And we’ll be happy to take that to court and fight it all the way.”
Mario Kranjac, the former mayor of Englewood Cliffs, said he doesn’t think it’s safe not to fully cooperate with federal agents, and said he’d “defund” municipalities that pass sanctuary ordinances.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Southern Idaho’s water reservoirs are stocked up, signaling promise for this year’s irrigation prospects. 
But Idaho might need to rely on reservoirs more than usual this year, amid drier and warmer early spring months that have prompted faster snow melts with less streamflow runoff than expected, the Idaho Water Supply Committee heard from state water officials at its Tuesday meeting.
“My prediction is it’s gonna be a summer where we really dip into our reservoir system,” said Idaho Department of Water Resources Hydrologist David Hoekema, who chairs the committee.
About a quarter of the state is in moderate drought currently, he said, but officials might be underestimating drought conditions in some places.
Here’s how Idaho reservoir systems are fairing: 

The Owyhee River reservoir system is full.
Two other reservoir systems – along the Boise and Payette rivers – are expected to fill to 100%.
Officials expect the Upper Snake reservoir system to fill, or nearly fill, and it is now 88% full.
In eastern Idaho, the Henrys Fork system is 99% full, the Island Park Reservoir is 100% full, the Ririe Reservoir is 100% full and the American Falls Reservoir is 96% full.

Erin Whorton, a water supply specialist with the National Resources Conservation Service, said North Idaho’s mountain snowpack and runoff is in better shape than this time last year, when the region had one of its lowest snowpacks on record, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
The Idaho Water Supply Committee is planning to meet again in early November.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Hoosier Lottery anticipates earning and spending slightly less than budgeted — but is still on track to deliver a hefty surplus payment to the state of Indiana. The five-member State Lottery Commission also easily approved its next business plan.
In a forecast revealed during a Tuesday commission meeting, revenues were expected to end the 2025 fiscal year on June 30 down by almost 4%.
But estimates for a trio of expenditures had decreased by even more: prize expenses by more than 4%, game and provider expenses by almost 5% and administrative expenses by a whopping 20%. The latter is due to how the lottery budgets for wages, plus “other savings,” Chief of Staff Carrie Stroud said.
The lottery’s contract operator, IGT Indiana, predicts it’ll still provide $352 million in net earnings to state coffers.

Because the incentive payment mark is set at $342 million, the lottery and its operator plan to split an anticipated $10 million in overflow instead of the $15 million budgeted. If the operator hadn’t cleared the $322 million minimum, it would’ve owed the lottery a shortfall payment.
In a year-to-date financial report for the 10 months ending April 30, surplus revenue to the state was on schedule — about $285 million.
Hoosier Lottery Executive Director Sarah Taylor said Powerball sales — “a huge favorite” in Indiana — were down here and nationwide.

“It’s just the nature of the game,” Taylor told reporters after the meeting. “You know, we have a year where it has huge jackpots and a year where it doesn’t. So nothing’s wrong with it.”
Worsening economic conditions may have contributed to scratch-offs’ almost $58 million underperformance when compared to the budget year-to-date.
“Folks may spend a little bit less on their entertainment dollars with us, and we respect and understand that and look forward to when they are returning to us,” Taylor said. “But we still offer a variety of price points. So even if they’d like to play at the $1 (price point), we’ve got some fun $1 (products).”
In its fiscal year 2026 business plan, the lottery hopes to net $352 million and gross about $1.6 billion — the same amounts it’s expecting to earn this fiscal year.
“We did take a cautious approach on, not only the draw games, but also on scratch,” Taylor said. “…  We want to make sure it’s the right fit for our players. We want to make sure the play style is fun and interesting, so we’ll be very flexible, like we were this year, into next year. And yes, we were cautious.”
Lawmakers recently killed a proposal that would’ve let the Hoosier Lottery establish interactive online gaming — likely raising overall sales.
“We’re 35 years old … And so, we’re selling the same product the same way,” Taylor told reporters.
“If the Legislature decides that it’s the right time to make that move, we’ll accept it and be happy to launch an iLottery program,” she continued. “In the meantime, we’ll do everything to bring home the monies that we’ve committed to bring to the state of Indiana, but look forward to maybe some additional modernization and innovation when it’s the appropriate time.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”










Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.

Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
 How best to credential

Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
 Low pay

A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

(Screenshot via WisEye) Wisconsin Republicans advocated on Tuesday for a bill to encourage filmmaking in Wisconsin through tax credits and a state film office. Another bill would declare that “gig workers” for app-based delivery services aren’t employees of a company.
During a Tuesday Senate Utilities and Tourism committee meeting, Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) said SB 231 offers tax credits to encourage more films to be made in Wisconsin. Bradley described  a recent movie called “Green and Gold,” about a fourth-generation dairy farmer in Wisconsin who is on the verge of losing his farm and makes a bet on the Green Bay Packers to help save it. 
Bradley said the director of the film, Anders Lindwall, chose to make it in Wisconsin, but that decision meant a financial sacrifice as the director turned down a major studio offer to purchase his film. The studio wanted him to relocate production to Alabama — a state with film tax incentives.
“He turned down the offer to keep his project authentically Wisconsin,” Bradley said. 
Wisconsin had a film incentive for a brief time in 2010 under former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, though the Republican-led Legislature discontinued that program just a few years later. Now, Wisconsin is  one of only four states in the country without a film office and one of 13 without any film tax incentives. 
The bill would create new tax credits including one for 30% of the total cost of the salaries paid to employees who reside in Wisconsin and work in Wisconsin, one for 30% of acquiring or improving property and one for 30% production costs paid by a company to produce a film, video, broadcast advertisement or television production. A person’s total credits would be capped at $1 million for a fiscal year. The bill would also create a new State Film Office housed in the Department of Tourism that would implement the tax credits.
Rep. David Armstrong (R-Rice Lake) said having the rate at 30% would put Wisconsin in the top tier of states offering film incentives.
“How many of you like me flinch when you see the Georgia peach logo in the credits after a movie or TV show?” Armstrong asked at the hearing. “Do we want Illinois or Minnesota or Georgia to poach productions that could just as easily be shot in Wisconsin?”
Bradley said the bill “aims to make Wisconsin competitive by attracting filmmakers and productions through meaningful incentives, which in turn support local businesses, job creation, and increased tourism. Simply put, it would encourage filmmakers like Mr. Lindwall to choose Wisconsin, bringing their stories and economic activity to our state.” 
The bill has broad bipartisan support with cosponsors including Sens. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee), Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood) and Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska).
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) expressed some concerns about whether the funding for the proposal would be included in the budget since it is not in the bill. Wisconsin lawmakers are in the progress of writing the next biennial budget and while Gov. Tony Evers included a similar proposal in his budget, it was pulled out along with more than 600 other items by Republican lawmakers on the committee.
“I have a motion to bring that back in,” Bradley told Ratcliff. 
“But if we pass this bill, it does not include the funding?” Ratcliff asked. 
“This bill does not have the funding. The funding would come through the budget… We’re going to fight real hard to try to get that funded,” Bradley said. 
According to fiscal estimates, the cost to state revenues would be at max $10 million. The new office would require three new positions in the tourism agency and would cost about $199,300 in 2026 and $254,000 in 2027. 
Film stakeholders testified in favor of the bill during the hearing. 
Paulina Lule, a Milwaukee native and an actress who recently starred in the MGM+ series Emperor of Ocean Park and has been in other shows including The Good Place and Scandal, told lawmakers that the bill would help people who want to showcase Wisconsin as it is in real life.
Lule said she has a film she has been working on called Sherman Park, which is about the neighborhood in Milwaukee. 
“I have had producers who have been interested in making this film as long as I make it not in Sherman [Park],” Lule said. “I don’t want to, and so this film has sat unfilmed for 10 years.” 
Lule said she recently began shooting a short film version in the Milwaukee park and was proud to be able to include a shot of the neighborhood’s name on a sign. She said that making films in Wisconsin would be a powerful way to promote the state and encourage people to visit. 
“Show off Racine. We can show off the real Green Bay, not just the Packers. There’s more to Green Bay than just the Packers as much as I love them,” Lule said. “You’re missing out on one of the broadest… ways of promoting the state is by having stories that are authentically about Wisconsin, made in Wisconsin… with actors in it that sound like they’re from Wisconsin.”
Michelle Maher, a River Falls movie theater owner, said that having movies filmed in the state would also provide an opportunity for local theaters. She noted that the movie Sinners, a vampire movie set in the Jim Crow South directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Michael B. Jordan, was filmed on-site in Clarksville, Mississippi.
“It was a town similar to the size of the town that I live in, River Falls,” Maher said. “Unfortunately, that town doesn’t have the movie theater that I have in my town… [Coogler and Jordan] got together and said, we are going to make sure this movie shows in this town, so they brought in a crew to be able to show that movie locally to the town that it was filmed at. What if there was a movie filmed in River Falls? Not only would I have a huge premiere for a regional area, I would have an annual event built in that would generate huge tourism opportunities and other ways to invent and reinvent that same wheel.”
Classifying ‘gig workers’ as non-employees
Lawmakers also considered SB 256, which would declare delivery drivers for app-based companies, including Uber and Doordash, are not employees of the company for the purposes of compensation insurance, minimum wage laws and unemployment insurance. The bill would allow “portable benefits” for those workers.
Bradley, the coauthor of the proposal, said the legislation is needed so that companies can provide benefits to workers without changing their “independent contractor” status. Under this type of benefit system, accounts are linked to a worker rather than the employer, meaning the benefits follow workers to other employment opportunities, and companies and workers would both be able to contribute.
“The gig economy is here to stay, and with it, the flexibility that many workers value and desire,” Bradley said. “Unfortunately, current laws prevent drivers from accessing crucial benefits. These include health care, paid leave and retirement savings. That’s the problem SB 256 aims to address. This legislation creates portable benefit accounts funded through contributions from the platforms based on drivers’ earnings. These accounts can be used by drivers to pay for a range of expenses, including health care, retirement, or coverage of loss of wages due to illness or an accident.” 
Lawmakers have considered the proposal before, including last session. The bill passed the Senate but never came up for a vote in the Assembly. 
The bill specifies that if an app-based delivery company doesn’t prescribe dates, times of day or a minimum number of hours during which someone must work; terminate the contract of the driver for not accepting a specific request for transportation or delivery service request; allow drivers to work for other companies; or restrict the driver from working in any other lawful occupation or business, then a driver is not considered an employee or agent of the company. 
“Previous versions of this legislation have garnered bipartisan support, and that support is only growing,” Bradley said. “It’s time we modernize our policies to meet the realities faced by thousands of Wisconsin workers.”
Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) said he found it “embarrassing, disappointing” that the committee was considering the proposal. He said there is an “independent contractor travesty in this country.” 
“As an independent contractor, these workers know what they’re signing up for,” Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan) said. “They understand that they’re on an independent contractor basis. They understand that they want to remain independent contractors.” 
Katie Franger, public affairs manager for Uber, told lawmakers that flexibility is the “fundamental reason” people choose the company’s platform for work. She said that the legislation would fit with this by allowing workers to have flexibility in benefits as well.
“Portable benefits allow each individual to choose what truly matters to them, ensuring resources are directed where they’re most needed,” Franger said. 
When Smith asked about why they couldn’t provide the benefits already, Addison DiSesa, legislative policy advisor for DoorDash, said “providing the benefits proactively jeopardizes the independence of these workers” and that the bill “empowers workers to get access to the benefits that they want while protecting their independence.” 
Maliki Krieski, a Ripon mother and Doordash worker, told lawmakers that she supports the bill because she wants to keep the flexibility that is part of the work currently. She said it allows her to take care of her child, who has diabetes.
“Our state system is outdated…,” Krieski said. “The one thing that stands between us and any form of health care incentive, retirement plan… The only thing that stands between us and that is the state law.”
Stephanie Bloomingdale, president for the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, cautioned that the bill seeks to create an exemption to current law and could be harmful to workers, who depending on the situation might qualify for certain benefits. She also pointed out that it doesn’t require companies to provide access to any benefits. 
“It exempts app-based delivery drivers from settled Wisconsin law concerning our workers compensation, minimum wage and unemployment insurance laws,” Bloomingdale said. 
Bloomingdale noted that to be considered an “independent contractor,” when it comes to worker’s compensation, workers have to meet a nine-part test, otherwise a worker is automatically considered an employee. The bill would replace this with the four-part test, which she said would be quite “minimal.” She noted that depending on the situation some workers could potentially qualify for worker’s compensation. 
A legislative council representative explained that “the default is that you’re an employee, and then there’s a nine factored test and that leads to a determination that you might be an independent contractor.” The bill, he said, would implement a “route that’s more streamlined for these app-based drivers.” 
“We oppose the bill because it does not guarantee any more or less flexibility for workers. It does not guarantee good wages and it does not guarantee benefits for workers in the gig economy. It does none of these things because the bill eliminates employee status for these workers and all the rights that come with that status,” Bloomingdale said. “The bill does not guarantee or require that these tech giants provide any benefits, portable or fixed.”
Bloomingdale said the bill would instead just “create special exemption for these powerful corporations at the expense of Wisconsin’s working men and women” and called the bill a “slippery slope.” 
“If this bill passes, we will be back here as those who do the bidding on international corporations come to this legislative body to similarly carve out a certain class of workers to evade state law and reclassify each group of workers one by one,” Bloomingdale said. “If these companies succeed in passing this bill, their low-pay, no-protection business model could expand in virtually every industry.”

(Photo courtesy of Raise the Wage Oklahoma)For more than two decades, I’ve worked in policy and advocacy in Oklahoma, standing alongside people from all walks of life to push for solutions when politicians have failed to act. 
I’ve seen a lot of change in our state — some for better, some for worse — but one thing that has remained consistent is this: when politicians ignore the will of the people, Oklahomans have always had a powerful tool to create change directly and solve the biggest problems in their lives — the right to the initiative petition process.
That right is enshrined in our state Constitution. Oklahomans believed then, as many still do now, that democracy should be more than just casting a vote every few years. It should be a living, breathing process where the people themselves can act when their elected officials won’t. And throughout the years both major political parties have relied on that principle.
Let’s not forget that it was Republicans who used the initiative petition process strategically to rewrite the political map — both in Oklahoma and across the country. In 2004, during President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign, Republican operatives pushed to put same-sex marriage bans on state ballots, including Oklahoma’s, to energize evangelical voters and give Bush a second term. 
It worked. The ban passed overwhelmingly, and Bush won reelection. It wasn’t just a political stunt — it was a calculated use of direct democracy to drive turnout and shape national outcomes at a time when his administration was under heavy fire over the Iraq War.
A decade earlier, when Democrats held firm control of the Oklahoma Legislature, Republicans turned to the initiative petition to bypass the majority. They led the charge to put legislative term limits on the ballot, and voters approved them. That single measure dramatically reshaped Oklahoma politics. Today, Republicans dominate both chambers and every statewide office. The very process some of them now seek to weaken is the same one that helped them gain power.
This is not a partisan issue. Initiative petitions have been used to address real problems ignored by politicians for years. Because of the Oklahoma people, we’ve expanded Medicaid, saving rural hospitals and increasing access to care for hundreds of thousands of Oklahomans. We’ve reformed our criminal justice system, pushed for school funding, and limited the growth of government.
That’s why efforts to cripple the initiative petition process, like Senate Bill 1027 are so dangerous. This bill would make it harder, if not impossible for everyday Oklahomans to bring forward and pass initiative petitions — adding red tape, impossible signature thresholds, and injecting partisan politics into the process.  It’s a direct attack on our constitutional right to govern ourselves when politicians won’t do their jobs.
Make no mistake: this isn’t about protecting the integrity of the process. It’s about protecting power — concentrating it among politicians and powerful special interests and keeping it out of the hands of the people.
Whether you’re a Republican, Democrat, or independent, this should concern you. Because once the door is closed to citizen-led change, we all lose. The issues we care about — health care, education, public safety, economic fairness — don’t belong to one party. And neither should political power.
For more than 100 years, Oklahoma has trusted its people with the power to act. Why now would we let short-sighted political maneuvering take our power away? Our future depends on protecting it.

Districts confront training decisions, costs, public sentiment as they set new policies for allowing firearms on school property.
The post As Wyoming gets rid of gun-free zones, schools wrestle with limited control appeared first on WyoFile .","In Campbell County, a place where nearly 90% of voters are registered Republicans, public schools already allow workers to carry concealed guns on school property. Still, the district found itself busy this spring revising those rules ahead of a new law poised to take effect July 1. Although Deputy Superintendent Kirby Eisenhauer described his district’s prior gun policy undertaking as a “good, healthy process,” he called the current situation a “serious matter” in “uncharted waters.”
Four hundred miles to the west, in Wyoming’s bluest community, the Teton County school district is also deep in writing a policy to allow civilians to carry guns — for the first time — in its schools. 
“I cannot vote for this item,” Teton County Trustee Kate Mead said at an April 16 school board meeting. “Some of this stuff calls for resistance, calls for us to say, ‘No. Here, we’re not going to let concealed carry in our schools. We’re not going to endanger our kids.’
“That’s our job,” Mead said. In addition to serving on her local school board, Mead is a rancher, attorney and the sister-in-law of former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican who signed what had been the law of the land for guns in schools, until now.
The new law, enacted by the Wyoming Legislature this winter after multiple failed attempts in past sessions, does away with most gun-free zones in the state, including those in public schools. In preparation for it, school districts are now revising policies or drafting them for the first time, consulting lawyers and safety experts, calculating costs and seeking public feedback. While some school district boards propose adopting the state’s policy as is, others are working to beef up safety precautions related to the mandate as much as they legally can. 
The law punishes districts that don’t allow concealed carry. Teton County School District Superintendent Gillian Chapman called the penalties significant — a misdemeanor that carries a fine or jail time or both — for denying someone the right to concealed carry in a public school building. The district can’t ask visitors if they’re packing, she said. 
But the law does allow local school boards to develop rules and regulations dictating storage and training requirements for employees or volunteers possessing firearms on school property.
Chapman urged her board — despite Mead’s call to resist — to exercise that sliver of local control. The school board is considering three requirements for school staff and volunteers: possessing and maintaining a valid concealed-carry permit; following firearms training outlined by the district; and keeping firearms with them at all times or in concealed and locked containers.

Other districts are also setting their own training and storage requirements to enhance safety. While schools can’t ban concealed carry, the law does still allow districts to prohibit students from carrying guns and to ban open carry. 
Whether or not a district already allowed guns, school board members are critical of the Legislature for encroaching on local control. 
“I find it ironic that the Legislature took six pages of law to tell us how to use the right restroom when we don’t have a problem in using the right restroom, but they then took another 10 pages to tell us we can’t regulate guns on school grounds,” Campbell County Trustee Mark Christensen said. He referenced a new law that will require people to use the facility that corresponds to the sex they were assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, physical appearance or what appears on their legal documents. “The hypocrisy in that is next level.”
Targeting gun-free zones
Wyoming lawmakers have pushed for allowing firearms in schools since at least 2013. Bills to repeal some or most of Wyoming’s gun-free zones have been a mainstay in the Legislature, with new bills filed nearly every year over the past decade.
The first bill to become law in that vein came in 2017, when then-Gov. Mead signed a bill titled “School safety and security” into law. That bill authorized local school boards to adopt rules and regulations to allow school employees with concealed carry permits to possess a firearm on school property.
Over the last eight years, “only [a few] out of 48 districts have chosen to do that,” Wyoming Education Association President Kim Amen said. “So, we see that as an indication that there’s not a giant desire among school districts to bring guns into schools.” 
That bill’s passage was followed by pushes to repeal most or all of Wyoming’s gun-free zones from 2019 to 2021 and 2023 to 2025. This year, Gov. Mark Gordon allowed House Bill 172, “Repeal gun free zones and preemption amendments,” which does away with most of Wyoming’s gun-free zones, to go into law without his signature. 
Park County, home to the towns of Cody and Powell, sits midway between Teton and Campbell counties in northern Wyoming. Cody schools were among the first in Wyoming to give staff the option to carry concealed guns when the board approved a policy in 2018. Cody’s school leadership has been meeting with legal counsel to determine what changes are needed to align with the Wyoming Repeal Gun Free Zones Act, Superintendent Vernon Orndorff said.
Next door, Powell’s public schools considered giving staff the option to concealed carry in 2018, recalled Superintendent Jay Curtis. At that time, more than 100 people attended a forum at Powell High School and responses flooded in to surveys sent out by the district. Ultimately, the district decided against allowing concealed carry and instead opted for a comprehensive safety plan.
But the district took up the topic again last year, after Gordon vetoed a similar bill to repeal gun-free zones, warning that it would override historic norms of local control over firearms. Curtis advised his school board in March 2024 that it may be time to consider revisiting a concealed carry policy, honoring the governor’s veto message in favor of local board control.

Around that time the Powell board hired an Illinois-based safety and threat assessment team, West40, to audit the school’s safety plan, during which the consultant, a former school resource officer, said it would be more effective for schools to hire more school resource officers, if possible, than to arm staff. He said if schools do arm staff, policies and procedures need to be in place.
So far, public response to the new law has been muted at district meetings in Powell, although one community member spoke up at the safety audit presentation to urge a policy be adopted ahead of this year’s legislative session. The board is planning to discuss adopting a new policy at an upcoming work session. 
Limited control
In southern Wyoming, more than 50 community members, parents and educators attended an April 9 forum to discuss the new law in Albany County School District 1. 
“While I am happy to see the turnout that we have, I am disappointed with our reason for coming together,” said school board member Alex Krassin. “I personally do not feel like education settings with children need to have guns present outside of our highly-trained [school resource officers].” 
Krassin stressed that school board members are elected by Albany County residents, and the new law removes their authority to regulate guns on behalf of their voters. 
“Teachers should not have to be the law enforcement if an assault rifle is being used by an attacker,” said attendee Elise Hawk. “It’s difficult for even trained officers to make a difference.”
But school board member Nate Martin said that’s no longer the debate. 
“The conversation tonight is not whether or not guns in schools are a good or responsible thing. That ship sailed,” Martin said. “It is, what are we going to do now that the Legislature is forcing us to allow guns into schools under certain circumstances?”

But that didn’t stop Laramie High School freshman Faye Smith from expressing fear for her safety.
“I cannot fathom thinking that one day I might walk into school and be carried out in a body bag,” Smith said. “This is not a matter of left and right. It is for students. It is life and death, and I love my rights as an American, both the right to bear arms and the right to an education. And I know that you guys can’t do much about this, but I would really encourage using school resources such as double [metal] detectors at the entrances.”
Balancing safety and freedom
To the east of Albany County, neither Laramie County School District 1 or 2 currently allow concealed carry in their schools. While some parents seem excited to conceal carry in schools, several board members, teachers and community members are reluctant to develop a policy.
Laramie County School District 2 in Pine Bluffs is not pursuing its own policy, and does not anticipate any costs or community backlash. The law sets minimum requirements for firearm storage and training for school staff and volunteers if districts don’t adopt their own policies. 
Laramie County School District 1 trustees are split over how to safely allow guns in Cheyenne schools, and most see the new law as a government overstep. Trustee Barbara Cook, who said she is greatly opposed to guns in schools, sought increased training requirements for the district. But her attempt failed.
“To only require staff and volunteers to engage in the minimal training stated in the law is irresponsible,” Cook wrote in a letter that she described as her personal opinion and not a reflection of the board. Cook’s letter pointed to other districts that are requiring more rigorous training, including background checks and random drug tests.
“School shootings are chaotic, so to believe a minimally trained staff person can react in a tactical way while battling an armed intruder and keeping their students safe is ludicrous,” Cook wrote. 
Trustee Rene Hinkle also opposes guns in schools based on the hardship she’s witnessed as a doctor.
“As probably the only person up here on this dais who has been in an emergency room when a child has come in from an accidental shooting and died from a brother shooting them. It is devastating to a family. It is devastating to that child. It is devastating to the community,” Hinkle said. “It is unconscionable to think that there will be a gun in an elementary school, and that these kids, no matter how careful people are, can die.”
In Powell, Superintendent Curtis acknowledges that concealed carry in schools can conjure images of scary scenarios, which came up in discussions with his staff after the Legislature passed HB 172. But he points to a similar established law in Utah as an example. While there have been unattended firearms, there have been no shootings, Curtis said.
“You haven’t had instances where teachers are getting shot in parent-teacher conferences, and basketball coaches and players and parents and officials are not getting shot at basketball games,” Curtis said. “I don’t think we have a corner on the market for tense basketball games. And so all of these scenarios that we conjure up have not happened.”
Sheridan County School District 2 — covering 10 schools — is exploring its options and gearing up to answer the public’s questions during a June 9 board meeting. Board Chair Shane Rader — who also serves as the Wyoming School Boards Association Area 7 director and president-elect for the association — said the group recently sent a model policy to member districts. So, school boards are now able to look at the model policy and adapt it to meet their specific needs.
In Teton County, the district is considering partnering with the local sheriff’s office for firearms training. The sheriff signs off on all concealed carry permits issued in the county, Superintendent Chapman added. So the sheriff knows who is authorized, but he doesn’t know which residents from other counties have permits. 
The training would help identify which people will have a gun on school premises.
“We see this as an opportunity to ensure that individuals that do wish to concealed carry will have a highly skilled trainer from the sheriff’s department doing that training and supervising that training,” she said, which could also help mitigate insurance costs.
What are the costs?
Implementing the new policies will have costs. The Campbell County district’s insurance covers the public during an active shooter event, but doesn’t cover staff and volunteers with firearms. Adding that coverage will increase the insurance premium by an extra $20,000, trustees have been told. The district also will pay for training, psychological evaluations, background checks, drug testing and approved secure containers/lockboxes. Employees must pay for their own firearm and holster.
Likewise, Laramie County School District 1 is anticipating increased insurance premiums, according to Community Relations Director Mary Quast.
Cheyenne Teachers Education Association President Dylan Ford said the district is struggling to find insurance willing to cover gun-related injuries.
“Not just for staff, but for students,” Ford said. “In my eyes, we really need to make sure that our students are safe, that our staff is safe, and that if accidents do happen because of this law that they know that they’re covered for it.”
Laramie County School District 1 employees will be expected to fund their own training and purchase equipment to be compliant with the policy.
“There are very limited resources available from the state to support the implementation of this law,” Quast wrote in an email. “Without a clear and consistent funding source, the district cannot responsibly commit to covering these costs.”
Sheridan County School District 3 unanimously approved a training contract May 14 with Critical Training Concepts for $8,500 for staff firearms training. Board Chair Karis Prusak said the board thought it would be good for teachers and staff, who choose to carry, to have adequate training and feel comfortable.

Sheridan County School District 1 Business Manager Jeremy Smith said because the school district is a member of the Wyoming School Risk Retention Program, there will be zero effect on that district’s premiums or liabilities related to implementing a policy.
On Monday, the Wyoming Department of Education put out a statement indicating the agency can reimburse school districts for “expenses related to the possession of firearms on school property.”
A polarizing policy
In Casper, meetings about the policy have included hours of discussion and debate, followed by narrow 3-2 committee votes.
Natrona County School District 1 leaders have been focusing on establishing specific training and qualification requirements for employees and volunteers. So far, the district is proposing an initial course of not less than 40 hours of live-fire handgun training and 16 hours of scenario-based training, split between eight hours of scenario work and eight hours of medical training. Annual recurrent training would require at least eight hours of live-fire and eight hours of scenario-based training, incorporating elements like an active shooter drill and a law enforcement pistol course. Instructor qualifications require at least five years of relevant experience or documented certification.
Public feedback has varied, as seen in last Thursday’s comment on the proposed policy.
“This law is not about protecting children. It’s about taking away local control and turning our state into one where it is deemed normal for everyone to be armed,” said Melissa Behringer, who in February organized a protest against HB 172 as it headed to the governor’s desk and in April voiced her opposition to NCSD1 trustees.
“I hate it, and [I’m] totally against it, and I can’t believe we’re allowing guns in our schools,” said Nancy Allen, a grandmother and former Carbon County teacher of 40 years. Allen’s daughter is also a teacher. “Will the school be providing any liability insurance for teachers in case something would happen, like the gun falls out of your holster and it goes off and shoots the kid or shoots the principal or something?”
Two district employees, veteran Kip Marchant and self-described gun enthusiast Brad Cleverly, voiced support for the policy, although Cleverly found some of the training requirements “somewhat ambiguous,” and Marchant questioned the availability of local training options that provide the required 40 hours of training.
Amid the debate, district Board Policy Committee Chairman Michael Stedillie said that, whether the school board likes it or not, the issue is now “ours to face.”
“I wish we had not had to face this issue, but because we have no choice, you are the people that I want to face this issue with,” he said. “I know I just ended a sentence with a preposition, but thank you for your hard work.”

State’s top gas producer sees promise in data centers' insatiable energy needs and desire for low-emission power.
The post Digital gold rush could drive demand for Wyoming’s growing ‘low-carbon’ natural gas industry appeared first on WyoFile .","The data center boom continues in Wyoming, and the state’s natural gas industry may play an increasing role in powering the computing systems with electricity.
Wyoming’s largest natural gas producer, PureWest, says it’s getting into the data center power supply game and partnering with two other firms on a project near Evanston. For its part, PureWest must ensure its fossil fuel product will have minimal carbon emissions to meet data centers’ energy preferences. 
To do that, PureWest says it will obtain a globally recognized “low-carbon verification” certificate, which means the company has met the rigors of ensuring there are no rogue emissions in its natural gas supply chain, from its production wells south of Pinedale to the gas-fired power generators near Evanston.
The project will initially generate 150 megawatts of electricity, then scale up to 1,200 megawatts, delivering the power to at least one data center developed by Prometheus Hyperscale, according to the companies.

One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.
Frontier Carbon Solutions, which is partnering with the U.S. Department Energy and the University of Wyoming on a “large-scale” commercial carbon storage hub near Granger, will capture and permanently store the natural gas generator carbon emissions.
“We’re very excited to help bootstrap these [data center] projects with verified low-carbon natural gas,” PureWest CEO Christopher Valdez told WyoFile.
Though the project partners are not required by state or federal law to certify the natural gas as low carbon, or to capture and store the gas-fired generator emissions, Valdez said, it’s what data center customers demand. And PureWest wants to be a player in the market.
“It’s going to be tied to the requirements of the ultimate consumers — the clients of this data center,” he said. “It’s a demand pool, and it’s specific to our local markets.”
Other companies
Anschutz Corporation, whose subsidiary is building the $5 billion Chokecherry Sierra Madre wind energy project in Carbon County and the $3 billion TransWest Express transmission line to connect it the Southwest, quietly rolled out a tentative plan in April to also add 3,200 megawatts of gas-fired generation and a 1,000 megawatt solar generation facility, according to a filing with the state.
The Seminoe Generating Station and the Walcott Generating Station would power “one or two” data center clients, and could include “on-site carbon capture and storage,” according to company statements and information on Anschutz subsidiary Power Company of Wyoming’s website. All of the facilities would be located in Carbon County. So far, there are no formal data center partners to announce, a company spokesperson told WyoFile.

Mark Gordon and Nevada Office of Energy Director Dwyane McClinton participate in a groundbreaking ceremony June 20, 2023 for the TransWest Express transmission line in Carbon County. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Director Rob Joyce estimates the natural gas plant would be among the largest in the U.S., and his organization is concerned about greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants.
“We don’t have assurances that they’re actually going to capture [and store] the emissions like they’re saying,” Joyce told WyoFile. “I’m always skeptical about that kind of thing.”
Not all environmental groups are skeptical of this market-driven trend. 
Jonah Energy, which also produces natural gas in the Pinedale Anticline in west-central Wyoming, was among the first in the state to gain a low-carbon verification for its natural gas. The Environmental Defense Fund has worked with Jonah and other oil and gas operators for years to support the installation of equipment and best practices that prevent leaks of methane — a potent greenhouse gas.
“Wyoming’s natural gas producers have a real opportunity to lead in a global market looking for lower-emissions energy,” EDF Regulatory and Legislative Manager John Rutecki told WyoFile via email. “If Wyoming wants to stay competitive in powering next-generation industries like data centers, those efforts must be backed by robust, transparent emissions measurement and verification and strong statewide standards.”

In a move that pokes holes in its ""we the people"" posture, the group of state elected officials is going after groups of local elected officials, columnist Rod Miller writes.
The post The Wyoming Freedom Caucus and its self-inflicted wounds appeared first on WyoFile .","The trigger-happy Wyoming Freedom Caucus has loaded its rusty six-gun once again, and once again is fixin’ to shoot holes in its own foot. With all its errant gunplay, the Freedom Caucus is putting at risk innocent bystanders in Wyoming’s communities, the very folks they pound their chest and purport to protect.

Opinion

As evidence, I offer Maggie Mullen’s recent article in WyoFile about the interim work of the Legislature’s Joint Corporations Committee. Freedom Caucus members, who preach “local control” out of one side of their mouths, told the committee that they are willing to sacrifice towns and counties in the Cowboy State as collateral damage in their war against folks who push back against Freedom Caucus looniness.
Let me say that again. The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is willing to throw local government in the Big Empty under the bus in the name of local control.
At issue are the several member associations, made up of local elected officials, that sometimes resist Freedom Caucus initiatives to replace local control with centralized legislative planning from Cheyenne. When these associations stand up for the rights of their local citizens, the Freedom Caucus snarls and says, “Not on our watch!”
The Freedom Caucus party line is always that it represents the “grassroots” in Wyoming, that it speaks for “we the people.” Horseshit! There ain’t nobody more grassroots or closer to the people than the mayor of a Wyoming town or a commissioner in a Wyoming county.
Yet when these same locally elected officials work together in their voluntary peer associations to better represent their constituents, the Freedom Caucus accuses them of ganging up on democracy and thwarting the will of the voters. That, friends and neighbors, borders on hypocrisy and puts a couple toes over the line.
Freedom Caucus members must think, somewhere in their narrow and fearful minds, that Wyoming’s mayors, county commissioners and other local officials undergo a sinister transformation when they join the Wyoming Association of Municipalities, the Wyoming County Commissioners Association or similar groups. The WFC must have nightmares about local officials suddenly becoming bomb-throwing Bolsheviks or Chinese spies instead of salt-of-the-earth elected public servants when they join an association of their peers.
So Freedom Caucus zealots pontificate about cutting off public funding to the associations and curtailing their work through tightening of the public purse. Here’s where the Freedom Caucus shoots itself in the foot.
Think about it. The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is an invitation-only association of folks with election certificates who band together to amplify their effectiveness and use public resources to further their aims. In this, it’s no different whatsoever from any other association of elected officials. It’s just oilier and more secretive.
If the state of Wyoming shouldn’t support the associations of other elected officials with tax dollars, it shouldn’t support the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, either. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and all that.
The Freedom Caucus should not be provided a fancy meeting room anywhere on state property. It can hold its secret meetings in a double-wide trailer somewhere on the outskirts of Cheyenne, and the members can pay the rent themselves.
Nor should Legislative Service Office staff waste a minute working on bills that emerge from Freedom Caucus meetings. State property, such as laptops, on which WFC members get their marching orders from their handlers in D.C., should be unavailable in secret Freedom Caucus meetings. If they need staff or machinery to do the work of their association, they can raise private funds.
If the good folks in Wyoming’s towns and counties don’t appreciate the Freedom Caucus trying to hamstring their local officials, they can write to the Joint Corporations Committee to express themselves. Or they can attend the next committee meeting in Casper on Aug. 14, either in person or remotely, and get their voices on the record.
Or I suppose they could say something else like, “Hell yeah, we want more Freedom Caucus control over our lives! We trust the Freedom Caucus in Cheyenne more than we trust the neighbors we elected here at home, so bring it on.”
Here endeth the lesson.

(Jacob Reeder/LSU Sports Information)  Most college athletic programs in Louisiana could soon each receive nearly $2 million in state tax revenue annually under a plan advancing in the legislature. 
House Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, cleared the House on a 74-15 vote. It would increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 21.5%. One-fourth of that revenue would go to the Supporting Programs, Opportunities, Resources and Teams (SPORT) Fund to benefit student-athletes at Louisiana’s public universities that compete at the NCAA Division I level – UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern State, Southeastern, Southern and the University of New Orleans.  
Under the new tax rate, Louisiana would receive about $77 million annually from sports gambling, with about $20 million dedicated to the new fund. Each school would get approximately $1.7 million annually. 
That’s a small drop in the bucket for LSU, which has an athletics budget of over $200 million. But it would be a significant lifeline for schools such as Southern, Nicholls and ULM, which each spend less than $20 million a year on their sports program. 
The proposed increase in sports gambling taxes has support from conservative and progressive corners, both saying the revenue should be used to offset the “social ills” of gambling. The higher rate would generate more money for addiction programs.
But the decision to dedicate some of that revenue to college athletics at a time when the state is under budget constraints troubles some progressives. 
“Legalized mobile gambling has created or exacerbated many social and cultural problems, including addiction, bankruptcies and even increases in domestic violence. New tax revenue should be used first and foremost to address some of those problems before we talk about spending more money on college sports,” said Peter Robins-Brown, executive director of Louisiana Progress, an advocacy group for marginalized communities. 
Presently, the state’s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments, 3% to gambling addiction programs, and the rest to other priorities and the state general fund. 
Under Riser’s bill, childhood education, local governments and addiction recovery would retain their existing share of tax proceeds. In addition to the 25% for college athletics, another 3% would be dedicated to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund to finance programs for students with disabilities. The rest goes into the state general fund for a variety of government needs. 
Riser’s bill will next be discussed in a Senate committee.

The lawsuit, spearheaded by a national team of child welfare attorneys, is seeking court approval for class action status in order to represent all 9000 children in the state’s foster care system.
It alleges that the Department of Children’s Services (DCS) has persistently violated children’s constitutional rights and federal law, including Americans with Disabilities Act protections for kids with disabilities. The suit seeks a sweeping court order forcing the agency to comply.
“Tennessee’s foster care system is failing children it is intended to protect,” said the lawsuit, filed Monday in a Nashville federal court.
DCS “warehouses children in spaces which lack the basic necessities of life, including adequate food, bedding, soap and potable water,” the legal filings said. Kids fortunate enough to get a spot in a foster home, instead of an institution, are “moved from place to place without the opportunity for a stable childhood,” it said.
A DCS spokesperson referred a request for comment about the suit to the Tennessee Attorney General’s office, which declined to comment.
It is the second class action lawsuit filed in recent months against DCS alleging gross mistreatment of children the agency is mandated to protect.
Class action complaint accuses Tennessee Department of Children’s Services of abusing disabled kids

DCS operates with more than $1.2 billion in state and federal funding annually to oversee two main areas of responsibility.
The first focuses on child abuse and neglect. The agency investigates allegations of abuse, oversees the state’s foster care system and provides services that help keep struggling families together.
The second is juvenile justice programs. The agency houses youth who have gotten tangled up with the state’s juvenile justice system for offenses that range from missing school to committing crimes.
While Monday’s lawsuit focuses on the actions or inactions by DCS in caring for children who have been abused or neglected, a class action lawsuit filed last year alleges a series of failures that have harmed kids with disabilities tangled up in DCS’s juvenile justice system. That suit remains ongoing.
Both lawsuits seek court-ordered changes to the way DCS operates.
Monday’s 74-page lawsuit details the unstable lives of multiple children who have been in DCS custody for years. Among them is 15-year-old “Darnell,” a pseudonym used in court filings to protect the teen’s privacy.
At eight years old, Darnell made his way to a fire station for help after being struck in the face then abandoned on the side of a road by his mother. DCS took custody.
In the eight years since that day, Darnell has been placed in at least 14 different settings. Darnell has spent half of his childhood in institutions that his DCS caseworkers acknowledge were unsuitable for his needs. Those institutions fail to provide even basic necessities to children living under their roofs.
Living in limbo: DCS places kids indefinitely in group homes awaiting “evaluations”

“His (appointed legal advocate) offered to buy him a Christmas present and asked what he wanted. The only thing Darnell wanted was his ‘own deodorant stick,’” the lawsuit noted.
Darnell struggled academically, but DCS failed to get him educational testing or advocate for individualized education plans to provide him extra in-school help.
Instead, during one four-month stint outside of an institution, DCS falsely promised foster parents hoping to adopt Darnell that he was a “straight A student.” When Darnell instead struggled in school and acted out at home, the family cited a lack of information and support from DCS in ending the foster care arrangement.
Darnell’s former legal guardian continues to supply him with clothing and hygiene products inside the institution where he currently lives. The guardian has undergone all required training to become his foster parent. Despite her persistence in advocating Darnell come home with her, he remains in an institution where, he told juvenile court officials earlier this year, he feels unsafe.
The lives of other children in DCS custody detailed in the lawsuit include prolonged separation from siblings, sexual abuse, the use of inappropriate restraints and lengthy stays in temporary settings intended to house children for no more than 30 days.
Children in DCS care are “deteriorating physically, psychologically, emotionally and educationally,” the lawsuit said.
DCS seeks $189M in new funding with plans to target rural counties with high foster care rates

The agency has come under public scrutiny in recent years as reports emerged of children sleeping on state office floors due to a lack of a suitable foster home beds, allegations of sexual abuse in privately run institutions, caseworkers struggling with impossible caseloads and rampant turnover among disillusioned employees.
In response, Gov. Bill Lee and state lawmakers appropriated significant additional funding for the agency in 2023 to hire and train caseworkers, contract with private companies to provide institutional and foster care and create new temporary “assessment centers” and other facilities to house children.
The lawsuit alleges that, despite new funding, little has improved in the lives of children still in state custody.
Assessment centers are intended for a maximum of a 30-day stay in order to determine the best type of treatment and housing for children who have suffered abuse or neglect.
Kids in state custody forced to sleep on floors in state office building

Instead, most children are there for far longer, living in “draconian conditions more commonly found in adult prisons,” the suit claims.
The centers are frequently staffed by sheriff department personnel, not child welfare workers; DCS has authorized the use of shackles on children taken off site for doctors appointments and pepper spray to subdue them. Young victims of abuse are housed at the centers alongside teens accused of crimes, the suit noted.
“Children charged with violent criminal offenses are placed together with children removed from their homes due to the trauma of inflicted violence,” the suit said. “Boys with rape and assault charges are placed together with girls.”
The suit echoes similar claims made against the agency more than two decades ago, when a 2000 class action lawsuit alleged children in DCS custody were deprived of education, healthcare and other rights, and subjected to egregious living environments
That lawsuit, known as “Brian A.,” led to 17 years of federal court oversight requiring the agency to meet basic benchmarks in their treatment of children. The oversight formally ended in 2017.
“The system quickly declined to a point even worse than it was in 2000, and now subjects children to a wide range of harms,” a statement from attorneys filing suit this week said.
The law firms filing suit are Bass Berry & Sims, A Better Childhood, The Barbara McDowell Social Justice Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Wang Hecker. The lawsuit names the Department of Children’s Services as defendant along with Commissioner Margie Quin, Deputy Commissioner Carla Aaron and Deputy Commissioner Karen Jointer Bryant.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A Republican-sponsored bill that would have defined a riot as a gathering of at least three people that could pose a threat of property damage or injury has been removed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee’s executive session agenda. The bill has been criticized for being overly broad, and potentially chilling First Amendment protections of protest and free speech. Besides defining a riot, the bill also exposed accused rioters and riot organizers to felony charges and civil liability including restitution for attorneys’ fees and property damage, and carried a prohibition on government officials with authority over law enforcement from limiting an agency’s response to quell unrest. 
Rep. Andrew Hysell (D- Sun Prairie), a member of the Assembly Committee on Judiciary, said that he criticized the bill because it “actually weakens existing law for the very people it was supposed to help.” The committee held a public hearing on the bill on May 7, at which  a large number of Wisconsinites voiced opposition to the bill. Rep. Shae Sortwell (R- Two Rivers), one of the bill’s authors, testified in favor of the bill, saying that it’s needed to prevent protests from spinning out of control into riots, property destruction, and injury. Sortwell and other republican supporters of the bill referenced protests and unrest in 2020 in Kenosha and  Madison. 
Among those who testified against the bill was Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Madison). Like other critics, Clancy said the bill was written vaguely in order to be applied broadly to crack down on protest movements. “While myself and many of my Democratic colleagues are tired of wasting our time and our constituents’ resources on badly written, unconstitutional bills like AB-88, I’m ecstatic that Republicans have abandoned this one for now,” Clancy said in a statement after the bill was shelved by the Assembly committee. “It’s clear that passionate, thoughtful testimony from the public, free speech advocates and civil rights experts – along with excellent technical critiques from Rep. Andrew Hysell – has stopped this so-called ‘anti-riot’ bill dead in its tracks.”
Clancy added that “in reality, however, this isn’t an ‘anti-riot’ bill: it’s a threat to free speech, expression and assembly disguised as a public safety measure. Thankfully, it’s now unlikely to move forward this session.” 
During the May 7 committee hearing where people spoke either in favor of or against the bill, one man wore a hat which used an expletive to denounce President Donald Trump. Committee Chair Ron Tulser (R- Harrison) demanded that the man remove the hat because it was offensive. Tulser threatened to have law enforcement remove the man, and called the hearing into recess. Later, when the hearing continued, the man was allowed to continue wearing the hat. Clancy told  Tulser his emotional reaction to the hat and his impulse to call for police was an example of how a broad, penalty-heavy bill for protests like AB-88 is a bad idea.
In his statement, Clancy urged his colleagues to spend “less time trying to dismantle our rights and getting angry at rude hats” and more time “addressing the actual needs of Wisconsin residents. Until that changes, we must all remain vigilant to fight back their next, terrible idea.”

(Tony Leys/KFF Health News)SPENCER, Iowa — This town’s hospital is a holdout on behalf of people going through mental health crises. The facility’s leaders have pledged not to shutter their inpatient psychiatric unit, as dozens of other U.S. hospitals have.
Keeping that promise could soon get tougher if Congress slashes Medicaid funding. The joint federal-state health program covers an unusually large share of mental health patients, and hospital industry leaders say spending cuts could accelerate a decades-long wave of psychiatric unit closures.
At least eight other Iowa hospitals have stopped offering inpatient mental health care since 2007, forcing people in crisis to seek help in distant facilities. Spencer Hospital is one of the smallest in Iowa still offering the service.
CEO Brenda Tiefenthaler said 40% of her hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are covered by Medicaid, compared with about 12% of all inpatients. An additional 10% of the hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are uninsured. National experts say such disparities are common.
Tiefenthaler vows to keep her nonprofit hospital’s 14-bed psychiatric unit open, even though it loses $2 million per year. That’s a significant loss for an organization with an overall annual budget of about $120 million. But the people who use the psychiatric unit need medical care, “just like people who have chest pains,” Tiefenthaler said.
Medicaid covers health care for about 72 million Americans with low incomes or disabilities. Tiefenthaler predicts that if some of them are kicked off the program and left without insurance coverage, more people would delay treatment for mental health problems until their lives spin out of control.
“Then they’re going to enter through the emergency room when they’re in a crisis,” she said. “That’s not really a solution to what we have going on in our country.”
Republican congressional leaders have vowed to protect Medicaid for people who need it, but they also have called for billions of dollars in cuts to areas of the federal budget that include the program.
The U.S. already faces a deep shortage of inpatient mental health services, many of which were reduced or eliminated by private hospitals and public institutions, said Jennifer Snow, director of government relations and policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. At the same time, the number of people experiencing mental problems has climbed.
“I don’t even want to think about how much worse it could get,” she said.
The American Hospital Association estimates nearly 100 U.S. hospitals have shuttered their inpatient mental health services in the past decade.
Such closures are often attributed to mental health services being more likely to lose money than many other types of health care. “I’m not blaming the hospitals,” Snow said. “They need to keep their doors open.”
Medicaid generally pays hospitals lower rates for services than they receive from private insurance or from Medicare, the federal program that mostly covers people 65 or older. And Medicaid recipients are particularly likely to need mental health care. More than a third of nonelderly Medicaid enrollees have some sort of mental illness, according to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization that includes KFF Health News. Iowa has the highest rate of mental illness among nonelderly Medicaid recipients, at 51%.
As of February, just 20 of Iowa’s 116 community hospitals had inpatient psychiatric units, according to a state registry. Iowa also has four freestanding mental hospitals, including two run by the state.
Iowa, with 3.2 million residents, has a total of about 760 inpatient mental health beds that are staffed to care for patients, the state reports. The Treatment Advocacy Center, a national group seeking improved mental health care, says the “absolute minimum” of such beds would translate to about 960 for Iowa’s population, and the optimal number would be about 1,920.
Most of Iowa’s psychiatric beds are in metro areas, and it can take several days for a slot to come open. In the meantime, patients routinely wait in emergency departments.
Sheriff’s deputies often are assigned to transport patients to available facilities when treatment is court-ordered.
“It’s not uncommon for us to drive five or six hours,” said Clay County Sheriff Chris Raveling, whose northwestern Iowa county includes Spencer, a city of 11,000 people.
He said Spencer Hospital’s mental health unit often is too full to accept new patients and, like many such facilities, it declines to take patients who are violent or charged with crimes.
The result is that people are held in jail on minor charges stemming from their mental illnesses or addictions, the sheriff said. “They really shouldn’t be in jail,” he said. “Did they commit a crime? Yes. But I don’t think they did it on purpose.”
Raveling said authorities in many cases decide to hold people in jail so they don’t hurt themselves or others while awaiting treatment. He has seen the problems worsen in his 25 years in law enforcement.
Most people with mental health issues can be treated as outpatients, but many of those services also depend heavily on Medicaid and could be vulnerable to budget cuts.
Jon Ulven, a psychologist who practices in Moorhead, Minnesota, and neighboring Fargo, North Dakota, said he’s particularly worried about patients who develop psychosis, which often begins in the teenage years or early adulthood. If they’re started right away on medication and therapy, “we can have a dramatic influence on that person for the rest of their life,” he said. But if treatment is delayed, their symptoms often become harder to reverse.
Ulven, who helps oversee mental health services in his region for the multistate Sanford Health system, said he’s also concerned about people with other mental health challenges, including depression. He noted a study published in 2022 that showed suicide rates rose faster in states that declined to expand their Medicaid programs than in states that agreed to expand their programs to cover more low-income adults. If Medicaid rolls are reduced again, he said, more people would be uninsured and fewer services would be available. That could lead to more suicides.
Nationally, Medicaid covered nearly 41% of psychiatric inpatients cared for in 2024 by a sample of 680 hospitals, according to an analysis done for KFF Health News by the financial consulting company Strata. In contrast, just 13% of inpatients in those hospitals’ cancer programs and 9% of inpatients in their cardiac programs were covered by Medicaid.
If Medicaid participants have mental crises after losing their coverage, hospitals or clinics would have to treat many of them for little or no payment. “These are not wealthy people. They don’t have a lot of assets,” said Steve Wasson, Strata’s chief data and intelligence officer. Even though Medicaid pays hospitals relatively low rates, he said, “it’s better than nothing.”
Birthing units, which also have been plagued by closures, face similar challenges. In the Strata sample, 37% of those units’ patients were on Medicaid in 2024.
Spencer Hospital, which has a total of 63 inpatient beds, has maintained both its birthing unit and its psychiatric unit, and its leaders plan to keep them open. Amid a critical shortage of mental health professionals, it employs two psychiatric nurse practitioners and two psychiatrists, including one providing care via video from North Carolina.
Local resident David Jacobsen appreciates the hospital’s efforts to preserve services. His son Alex was assisted by the facility’s mental health professionals during years of struggles before he died by suicide in 2020.
David Jacobsen knows how reliant such services are on Medicaid, and he worries that more hospitals will curtail mental health offerings if national leaders cut the program. “They’re hurting the people who need help the most,” he said.
People on Medicaid aren’t the only ones affected when hospitals reduce services or close treatment units. Everyone in the community loses access to care.
Alex Jacobsen’s family saw how common the need is. “If we can learn anything from my Alex,” one of his sisters wrote in his obituary, “it’s that mental illness is real, it doesn’t discriminate, and it takes some of the best people down in its ugly swirling drain.”

M.J. Kellner’s royal blue and golden yellow semi-trucks are a common sight throughout central Illinois. Every week, the wholesale food company delivers thousands of pounds of grocery items to state-owned facilities, including prisons, mental health centers, rehabilitation institutions and veterans homes. The company boasts that many of its customers are within a 100-mile radius of its Springfield headquarters.

But most of the food M.J. Kellner delivers comes from well beyond state lines.

In fact, of all the food consumed in Illinois, 95% of it comes from outside the state.

The Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP), proposed during this year’s Illinois General Assembly, would have required food vendors like M.J. Kellner to provide more information about how and where they source their food.

House Bill B3701 and Senate Bill 2187 would have significantly changed state food procurement practices, which advocates say are outdated and divert millions of public dollars out of state each year, instead of going to local farmers. The bills would have also raised standards for food companies’ labor, environmental and animal welfare practices.

However, state lawmakers did not pass the bills before a key legislative deadline in April.

“That is what you call a missed opportunity,” said Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, the Senate bill’s sponsor.

State institutions purchase and serve hundreds of thousands of meals daily, worth tens of millions of dollars in contracts. Advocates for the purchasing program want state agencies to send more public money to small local producers and distributors, especially those that provide fair wages and safe working conditions.

State agencies use dozens of private food distributors, but for the Department of Corrections, the state’s largest food buyer, nearly 70% goes to just two: M. J. Kellner and Advanced Commodities, Inc. The vast majority of those contracts, worth more than $156 million combined since 2021, supply food for the nearly 30,000 people incarcerated in Illinois.

M.J. Kellner did not respond to requests for comment.

Most of the companies are wholesale distributors. They buy large food quantities from producers, often at a large discount, and sell them to institutions, restaurants and other businesses.

Several state agencies opposed the bill, including the Illinois Department of Central Management Services, the agency responsible for most food purchases.

CMS, the Department of Agriculture and other agencies testified against the Good Food Purchasing Program at the House Agriculture Committee on March 18. Agency officials said at the hearing that the policy would add additional red tape to an already complex process.

State Rep. Sonya Harper, a Chicago Democrat and chair of the House Agriculture and Conservation Committee, said state officials had ample time to address issues with her and should not have waited until the eleventh hour to raise objections.

“This bill has been out there,” said Harper, who was a sponsor of the House bill. “If you had an issue with it, you guys know how it goes. Send me some language that would make it better. Let’s have that conversation before the day that I come to committee.”

With the bills dead, Harper filed a House joint resolution that, if passed, will extend the life of the task force and encourage, but not require, state agencies to share details about their food purchasing practices.

Harvesting expertise: Corporate logistics meets local foods

Clint Bland’s commercial organic family farm in central Illinois is just a 5-minute drive from Jacksonville Correctional Facility, one of the state’s 27 adult prisons. He also raises beef and poultry, and began selling to several local school districts around central Illinois in 2024 as part of various local and federal programs that help schools buy more locally produced food.

But when asked if he’d ever thought about trying to sell his products to Jacksonville Correctional Center, Bland said he didn’t know where to start.

“I don’t even know who to contact,” Bland said. “It’s been hard enough just figuring out who the buyers are in certain schools. It’s hard to get a seat at the table, you know.”

Bland spent nearly a decade working in upper management for a major corporate food redistributor called Dot Foods, a sort of middleman for the middleman in the food supply chain. The company buys truckloads of food from manufacturers and then sells smaller quantities to smaller distributors.

In 2016, he and his wife started farming in Jacksonville, and in 2022, he turned farming into a full-time job. Inspired to strengthen the local food scene in his area, Bland later started an aggregation and distribution company for local producers called Farmers Alliance for Regional Marketing and Sales, or The Farms of Illinois for short.

“Farmers are often not the best at customer service, they’re not the best at delivery and invoicing and billing. They’re not the best at all these things,” Bland said. “They just want their hands in the soil.”

State agencies are required to award food contracts to the lowest compliant bidder who also meets established specifications. But in 2022, lawmakers allowed public schools to hire vendors that source local food products, even if the cost was higher.

Going with just the lowest bid forced schools to accept meals of substandard quality, which resulted in garbage cans full of uneaten food and ultimately, wasted money, advocates of the change said.

In September 2023, Pawnee Community Unit School District No. 11 started buying and serving locally grown vegetables and locally raised beef and chicken.

State Rep. Wayne Rosenthal, R-Springfield, recently visited the school and said that the cost of purchasing local foods is often the same, if not cheaper, than the prior vendor.

“(There’s not) much difference (in price) one way or the other,” Rosenthal said. “The big difference is the kids are eating the food. They’re not throwing it away. And to me, that’s a big plus.”

Local food programs terminated: Farmers feel left in the dust

Advocates for the local purchasing program say state support is especially important following the Trump administration’s cuts to two key federal programs: IL-EATS and the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure.

The IL-EATS program funneled $43 million in federal dollars last year to the state health department to contract with local farmers to supply food banks. The program represented around 30% of all sales for The Farms of Illinois, but was cut by Trump in March. Since then, Bland has laid off an employee with the potential for more cuts.

“All these farmers are depending on us, too,” he said. “I have a tremendous responsibility. I feel tremendous weight to make sure that I don’t fail them.”

Ed Dubrick, a small pasture poultry farmer in Cissna Park who also farms vegetables with his wife, said local farmers struggle to compete in a consolidated market where large distributors are able to sell products well below the price it takes to produce them.

“The (IL-EATS) program had really hit its stride and was making a difference in the lives of both farmers and the nutrition insecure in our state,” Dubrick said.

The Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure (RFSI) program provided federal funds for infrastructure, such as refrigerated trucks, walk-in coolers, wash stations and commercial dehydrators and dry racks — critical tools that help farmers access better market opportunities.

The Trump administration eliminated the $6.5 million program in March.

Critics of Trump’s actions argue the cuts also contradict his push for U.S. farmers to sell more of their products domestically, particularly as an escalating trade war threatens to disrupt the export market.

“Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States…Have fun!” Trump recently posted on social media.

Jackie de Bautista, executive director of Farmers Rising, a nonprofit agricultural education organization, was furious when she read the president’s post in March.

“The ridiculousness of this statement is that shifting an entire food industry production system from row crops to local food requires a transition period,” de Bautista said. “The irony in that statement is that this work was already happening and was finally being supported and incentivized by our federal government (before being abruptly cut).”

Bland still devotes a small portion of his farmland to commodity crops like corn and soybeans. So when the USDA pulled the plug on two programs that had helped him grow his local food business, he was surprised to find a check from the same agency in his mailbox.

This time, it was to compensate him for increased fertilizer and pesticide costs and falling commodity prices.

For Bland, it made one thing obvious: the system still props up commodity agriculture, but not local food.

He said the priorities of the USDA are out of balance.

“All of a sudden we got local food going away, and the government saying that that’s not important,” Bland said, “but prices got too low for you on your commodity, so we’re going to give you free money.”

Raising standards: Policy aims to elevate labor standards for all

The Good Food Purchasing Program prioritizes five values: supporting local economies, fair labor conditions and compensation, nutritious whole foods with minimal harmful ingredients, animal welfare standards, and environmental sustainability through ecological sourcing and menu planning.

Full transparency would be essential at every level of the supply chain, advocates said. Under the policy, suppliers would eventually be required to share sourcing data — tracing products from farm to plate — and make that data public.

The program would prioritize companies that pay their workers a “livable wage,” encouraging state agencies to grant contracts to companies with higher scores.

For example, Tyson Foods, which sells meat to M.J. Kellner, has repeatedly been cited for child labor violations, including some tied to fatal incidents. Smithfield, another M.J. Kellner supplier and the world’s largest pork producer, has faced multiple complaints that the company disproportionately exposes low-income, rural, military, and Black communities to air and water pollution from the company’s biogas operations.

The program would require full supply chain transparency from all suppliers, making middlemen like M.J. Kellner show where their food comes from, how it gets from the farm to the plate, how much the company spent on it and at what quantity.

This can be easier said than done. A 2023 report produced by Food Chain Workers Alliance and HEAL Food Alliance, two coalitional groups consisting of workers and producers, revealed that after 10 years of similar food purchasing programs operating in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, institutions were only able to obtain a sliver of their supply chain sourcing data — and they rarely shared this limited information with the public.

Cook County adopted the GFPP in 2018. In theory, county procurement decision-makers should examine working conditions for food warehouse workers.

But a 2023 survey found that more than half of the food chain workers in the Chicagoland area still earned wages too low to feed their families, and three-quarters lacked employer-provided health care. Workers who spoke up about their rights were fired or suspended.

Roger Cooley, executive director of the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, which crafted and advocated for the state bill, said that the point isn’t necessarily to cancel or not renew contracts with existing vendors if they’re not doing a good job, but to raise standards when shortcomings are identified.

And if a food company has OSHA violations, a state department can “go back to that supplier and be like, ‘Look, either you address these OSHA violations and give us a clear plan for it, or we’re going to have to shift our purchasing to somebody else,’” Cooley said.

“It’s more of a carrot than a stick method,” said Cooley, referencing the fact that this is an incentive process, not a mandate. “This is a long process. It’s not going to happen overnight.”

State food contracts: A past source of controversy in Illinois politics

Food contracts have been a source of controversy in the state’s political history.

In April 2002, while Rod Blagojevich was campaigning for governor, Archer Daniels Midland executives gifted the 46-year-old Democrat candidate two seats on one of the company’s private jets. In October, they gave him use of a private plane. Both were listed as campaign donations on Secretary of State records.

After Blagojevich was elected, ADM executives continued to funnel money into his committee. In 2005, the company was awarded a lucrative contract to supply soy-based products to the Department of Corrections.

By 2009, dozens of people incarcerated in state prisons filed lawsuits against IDOC, alleging that soy was served in nearly every cooked item at every meal and was responsible for making the plaintiffs sick with gastrointestinal issues, allergic reactions, heart problems, and thyroid dysfunction.

The lawsuits were all dismissed.

In 2009, Blagojevich was impeached, removed from office and sentenced to 14 years in federal prison on federal corruption charges for various pay-to-play schemes, none of which involved ADM.

The company received nearly $5 million from the state to provide soy products from 2005 to 2013.

In 2019, IDOC dietary departments announced they planned to move away from soy-heavy menus, “which will save money on production and reduce lawsuits filed against the department,” according to a fiscal report that year.

Since the former governor’s arrest, Illinois’ procurement law has gone through a series of fine-tuning efforts to root out corruption and conflicts of interest, including a 2008 bill Blagojevich himself signed into law, prohibiting public officials from accepting contributions from contractors. Before it passed, his campaign committee collected between $50,000 and $100,000 from companies seeking state contracts in a blitz of fundraising.

In 2021, the Illinois Department of Corrections began purchasing commissary items in a more centralized way, which led to disruptions in the delivery of goods.

Commissary items are a critical lifeline for incarcerated people who don’t want to, or can’t, eat the meals.

According to a 2022 survey of people incarcerated at Illinois Department of Corrections facilities, 70% of respondents indicated that they relied on purchasing commissary items to supplement at least half of all of their food.

One respondent commented, “No one likes the food in prison. Some of these people have been locked up for 20 years or more. They never eat the state food.”

Gwyn Troyer, Associate Director from the John Howard Association, the not-for-profit prison watchdog organization that conducted the survey, said that food is an overlooked need in a system beleaguered with challenges like delayed maintenance, lockdowns, and medical and mental healthcare issues.

“There is no public accounting of how state funds are spent,” Troyer said, “or expertise provided regarding how Illinois might better invest in food in prisons to promote health and wellbeing.”

She said the organization calls for greater transparency and oversight regarding state spending for food in prisons.

Troyer said that the concerns she hears mostly relate to food portions, inadequate nutrition, particularly related to medical and religious diets.

The Illinois Department of Corrections spent over $56 million on food in 2024, according to an Investigate Midwest analysis of publicly available data, a 70% increase from 2021 to 2024.

A spokesperson for IDOC said in a written statement that the increase is due to inflation and improvements to meals, which include larger servings of fresh produce, whole muscle meat, and “revised meals” at Adult Transition Centers. An analysis of state records show that DOC spending on MJ Kellner contracts has increased more than tenfold since 2021, making up a significant share of DOC contracts overall.

“Since the 2022 survey,” the spokesperson wrote, “IDOC has added a Registered Dietitian to its team,” whose role is to improve the overall quality of meals.

The spokesperson said that the department’s master menu is being updated to emphasize nutrition, product availability, and general preferences.

Politics, procurement and price tags: What killed the food reform bill

The Good Food Purchasing Program not only stalled this year in committee, it lacked clear support from current Gov. JB Pritzker, who faces challenging budget constraints amid federal funding cuts.

When asked if he would support the bill at a farm event in Urbana, Pritzker said that with the state facing losses of approximately $11 billion due to federal cuts, there is a lot pulling on the state budget.

“In a world where we’ve got to worry about keeping our rural hospitals open when we lose what I think we may in Medicaid, it’s going to be triage,” he said. “Something is going to close.”

Cooley, of the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, doesn’t believe that the proposed program would raise costs.

[caption id=""attachment_67692"" align=""alignleft"" width=""283""] Rodger Cooley, executive director of the Chicago Food Policy Action Council. (photo provided)[/caption]

“We have seen over and over again, no matter what the year is, those budget concerns come up and are given as one of the main reasons for not moving forward on this policy,” Cooley said. “Oftentimes, departments and agencies feel like they’re under the gun, underfunded, and under-resourced, and adding anything new is a stretch for them.”

Scratch cooking, equipment upgrades and choosing local, seasonal ingredients can keep budgets down, Cooley added. School kitchens in Chicago and Pawnee conduct taste tests to figure out what the students’ preferences are, reducing waste. Beyond Green, a Chicago-based company, helps train institutional staff on how to cook large quantities from scratch without increasing costs.

The company even weighs the portions before it’s served to students and weighs the trash afterwards to see how much is thrown away.

“They’re super dialing it in,” Bland said.

A representative from the Illinois Department of Agriculture, which opposed the bill, testified at a March hearing that his agency doesn’t have the technical know-how to administer a formal food procurement process, and that the bill would significantly delay food procurement at state-operated facilities.

Tyler Bohannon, the legislative liaison for the Illinois Department of Agriculture, said that his department opposes the bill because his agency doesn’t have the technical know-how to administer a formal food procurement process, and it could significantly delay ordering food.

“Finally,” he said at the hearing, “the Department of Agriculture cannot support any proposal that would have a substantial fiscal impact on the FY 26 budget.”

Ron Wilson, deputy director of Central Management Services and head of the Bureau of Strategic Sourcing, said at the March 18 hearing that the bill failed to account for the additional red tape it would create.

“The opposition that CMS has to this bill has nothing to do with the fresh food. Everybody, I think, is on board with that’s the way to go. If we could do that, that would be fantastic,” Wilson said. “The issue the CMS currently has is the procurement aspect of this.”

In a written statement to Investigate Midwest, a spokesperson from CMS said that centralized purchasing has been the state’s approach since at least 2004.

“This is standard practice across most large-scale governmental units and is considered a best practice as it takes advantage of economies of scale and significantly reduces redundant work requirements,” the statement said.The post Lawmakers tried to reform Illinois’ food system.

But for many refugees, “waiting” depends on the whims of domestic politics, international relations, and a good dose of luck, magnifying their feeling of being stuck.
Immigration to the United States is a waiting game – it can take years, decades, even to receive immigration visas, to reunite with family, to receive asylum, to get green cards and then citizenship. More than 20,000 people had already been approved for refugee status when Trump took office, many of them with family already here in the U.S. and in Idaho. Now they too wait.
However, the Trump administration is resettling white South Africans now, just three months after floating the idea, essentially allowing them to jump the line in front of people already approved, thousands of whom had already booked their travel.
As a sociologist studying migration and refugee integration in the U.S., I have been conducting interviews on the impact of the 2021 Afghan evacuation – when tens of thousands of Afghan allies fled their country after the U.S. withdrawal and return of Taliban rule.
Many Afghans were able to resettle in the U.S., at first through humanitarian parole. Later, they had to apply for asylum to create a pathway to citizenship. However, due to the backlog with asylum cases, many were forced to apply for Temporary Protected Status to receive work permits. On the same day that a small group of white South Africans arrived, the administration canceled Temporary Protected Status for Afghan allies.
In my research, I have talked to many Afghan families and to people who work with the refugee community in Idaho. Many are still moving through pending asylum cases, years later, including one man I met named Muzar (a pseudonym).
Muzar came to the United States in November 2021 after former President Joe Biden  withdrew U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Thousands of Afghans stood in lines for hours at the Kabul International Airport, desperately waiting to be evacuated. Muzar worked for the U.S. military, cleaning a military base, a critical service that made him a target, but did not qualify him for a Special immigrant Visa for Afghans who were connected to the U.S. military.
Now, his asylum case is still pending, as he tries to prove his service, as is the case for many. “Lack of proof” is a common theme for many service workers, which I describe in my own work on low-wage immigrant workers in the U.S.
They had tickets. A flight number. An arrival time. Then Trump’s executive order changed everything.

There are many youth and elderly women whom I regularly meet at the legal clinics in Boise. One such elderly person is Nurma (a pseudonym). She has been in the U.S. for 25 years and is still waiting for her daughter to join her.
The daughter had to flee Afghanistan with the rise of the Taliban and has been stuck in Pakistan for the last seven years, waiting on the visa petition her mom submitted. The legal clinics in Boise are led by attorneys working around the clock to help people like Muzar and Nurma file their asylum claims and reunite with their families. Week after week, many Afghans come seeking answers, and often the answers are elusive.
The waiting within the refugee system has become even more arduous since the Trump administration suspended the U.S. Refugee Admission Program on Jan. 20, his first day in office. Currently, more than 10,000 Afghans abroad, all of whom went through years-long background checks and have been approved, are waiting to be relocated to the U.S. Many are stranded in neighboring countries — Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran.
Yes, the U.S. immigration system is broken, but not in the way you may think. It should not take decades to reunite these Afghan families, torn apart by U.S. policy in Afghanistan. And it should not take one day for a new president to tear apart five decades of U.S. resettlement policy and undermine the family-based immigration system that has been in place since the 1960s.
If resettling white South Africans demonstrates anything, it’s that the U.S. refugee resettlement system is indeed a proper function of government that is capable of operating in an efficient and humane manner when given the proper resources.
Local refugee agencies plan to do what they do best and welcome newcomers to Idaho, but that should not come at the expense of the tens of thousands of other deserving people around the world, including our Afghan friends to whom we owe a high debt of gratitude.

DemasSexual assault survivors gained support from the Michigan Senate on Tuesday with the passage of bills to allow more time in filing civil lawsuits against their assailants, but it remains unclear if the Republican-controlled House plans to take up the bills.
The upper chamber voted 25-9 to pass the five-bill package sponsored by Democratic Senators Kevin Hertel of Saint Clair Shores, Sam Singh of East Lansing, Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor, and Veronica Klinefelt of Eastpointe.
Together, the bills would give survivors of sexual assault or other criminal sexual conduct a 10-year window after a crime was committed, with a cutoff at the age of 42, or within seven years after discovering an injury or some other connection to the misconduct, or whichever is later.
Survivors can file lawsuits to recover damages sustained from the criminal sexual conduct, which could be brought in court at any time if there was also a criminal conviction involved with the assault.
Sexual abuse survivors again ask Michigan lawmakers for more time to sue perpetrators

Regardless of the limitations listed in the package, the bills would allow a survivor who was victimized before the package’s effective date to file a lawsuit for damages within one year after the effective date. In that case, a claimant could not recover more than $1.5 million.
Other bills in the package would remove the existing 10-year statute of limitations, exempt claims to recover damages for criminal sexual conduct from the existing permanent prohibition on bringing a claim against the state,  and would amend the state’s government immunity law in various ways – including removing the immunity from tort liability for a public university, college or school district whose employee engaged in the misconduct while working there if the institution was negligent in hiring, supervising or training that employee. 
The same is true if the institution knew about the abuse and failed to intervene.
In a statement, Hertel said survivors of sexual assault have for too long been denied their day in court and silenced by “arbitrary deadlines and a system that failed them.”

“No more,” Hertel said regarding the Justice for Survivors package. “At their core, these bills are about justice, accountability, and finally giving survivors the voice they deserve. With this legislation, we are shattering that silence and making it clear: Michigan will no longer be a place where assault is ignored and abusers get to walk free to continue their cycle of harm.”

Michigan over the last several years made national headlines due to high-profile sexual assault or abuse cases, including the abuse perpetrated by the Larry Nassar scandal at Michigan State University and Robert Anderson at the University of Michigan. Attorney General Dana Nessel also spearheaded investigations into the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of American in Michigan during her tenure, which exposed abuses across generations.
The making of a monster

McMorrow said in a statement that Michigan’s justice system needed to be reformed to a position of protecting survivors and not shielding abusers.
“With the passage of this legislation out of the Senate, we’re one step closer to securing the access to justice that survivors deserve,” McMorrow said.
Irwin in a statement touted the legislation’s removal of immunity for large institutions to empower survivors “to speak their truth and pursue justice that they deserve.”
Klinefelt in a statement also noted that power institutions have shielded perpetrators while abuses happened under their watch. The bills would no longer allow those institutions to hide behind legal immunity when survivors come forward.
“We’re ending that with this legislation and are restoring trust, delivering justice, and making sure survivors’ voices are not easily swept under the rug.”
The bills now move to the House, but it’s unclear if they’ll get traction in the Republican-controlled chamber.
In a Tuesday news briefing, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) appeared noncommittal on taking the bills up in the House. He also noted that his Democratic colleagues tried to pass similar legislation last session, but the effort died in a disastrous lame duck session that saw several key Democratic priorities grind to a halt.
“I haven’t looked at it, but I think the idea of extending statutes of limitations for decades, or whatever it is, that creates a lot of questions, a lot of legal problems,” Hall said. “We’ll look at it. I haven’t seen it, but you didn’t see the Democrats move it when they were there, so it must have a lot of problems.”

Costs are skyrocketing as states rapidly expand school voucher programs, which divert public funds to pay for private school tuition. (Gene J. Puskar | The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Hope Scholarship’s accelerating price tag sparks debate in WV House, $97M in funding approved

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo: Emily Siner for the Tennessee Lookout)When former attorney and civil rights pioneer Rita Geier received an honorary doctorate degree last week from the University of Tennessee, it was an odd sort of full-circle moment: The award recognized, in part, her role in suing the university more than half a century ago.
“Her courageous legal efforts not only transformed Tennessee’s educational system, but also paved the way for a better society,” said Donde Plowman, chancellor of UT-Knoxville. “She has left a lasting mark on our state and our country’s history.”
Geier was the lead plaintiff in a 1968 class action lawsuit against Tennessee’s governor and university systems, which alleged that the state was upholding an unconstitutional segregated system of public higher education. 
At the time, she was both a law student at Nashville’s Vanderbilt University and a part-time history instructor at Tennessee State University, then called Tennessee A&I. The university had been founded to provide higher education for Black students at a time when they weren’t allowed into any other public universities.

Technically, by the late 1960s, the University of Tennessee and other previously all-white universities had eliminated race-based admissions requirements. But they were still almost entirely white, and Tennessee A&I was still entirely Black.
Geier says the disparities were obvious in other ways, too: the dilapidated buildings, the low pay for professors.
“TSU was the stepchild of the state higher education system. There’s no denying that,” Geier said. 
She began clerking for a local white attorney, George Barrett, who was seen as a “troublemaker” in Tennessee for his willingness to take on “issues that made people uncomfortable,” Geier said. Together, Barrett and Geier crafted a legal theory that the state had an obligation to integrate its public universities. 
“I was learning all about civil rights and the legal remedies that were possible. It didn’t take long for us to see that there was a tool that could be used,” Geier said. “And I was the perfect plaintiff.”
Similar lawsuits were already in the works over segregated K-12 education, but the state’s obligation in desegregating higher education, where enrollment was voluntary, was largely untested legal ground. 
In their original complaint, Geier and Barrett argued that Tennessee failed to provide appropriate funding to TSU because of its predominantly Black enrollment. It also argued that the state was “seeking to perpetuate a policy of racial segregation” by expanding a UT extension in downtown Nashville.
In the late 1970s, the lawsuit led to the merger of UT-Nashville with TSU — one of the only examples in the nation’s history of a historically Black university acquiring a predominantly white campus.

But the state’s obligation to desegregate public universities continued to be debated in the courts for the next several decades. The final consent decree, in 2001, involved improving TSU’s facilities and increasing scholarship programs for Black students across the state.
When the Geier case officially ended in 2006 — capping off 38 years of litigation — a judge declared that “any remaining vestiges of segregation have been removed from the Tennessee system of public higher education.” 
But conversations over the state’s treatment and funding of TSU are ongoing. In 2021, a state report estimated that Tennessee failed to pay TSU at least $544 million in federally required funding in the decades following the end of segregation. 
Meanwhile, Geier went on to pursue a legal career in government: She became a regional director for the Legal Services Corporation, general counsel for the Appalachian Regional Commission and associate commissioner for the Social Security Administration. After her retirement, she took a position at UT-Knoxville as an associate to the chancellor and a senior fellow at the Howard Baker Center for Public Policy.

Vance.  
A high-ranking person on Trump’s political team told Mississippi Today that several major advisors within the president’s sphere of influence don’t hold White “in high regard” because of the auditor’s ongoing feud with former NFL athlete Brett Favre, who has been caught up in the state’s massive welfare scandal. 
The political official, who Mississippi Today agreed to quote anonymously so they could candidly discuss the sensitive political situation, compared White’s feud with Favre to Trump’s feud with New York Attorney General Letitia James over her civil prosecution of his business operations, which were found to have committed financial fraud.
“(White’s) fight with Brett Favre has not set right with us,” the political official said. 
The recent comments follow remarks from other Trump operatives and conservative influencers and come at a time when White casts himself as Mississippi’s version of a Make America Great Again candidate as he prepares to launch a gubernatorial bid. 
Navigating Favre and his connections to the Trump ecosystem is likely a political hurdle for the state auditor in his bid to become governor. Favre is a close friend of the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and an ally of Trump. Last year, the Hall of Fame athlete spoke at a rally for Trump’s reelection campaign in Green Bay in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin. 
White, in a statement to Mississippi Today, said: “I’ve supported the President for years, his team knows this, and I’m working nonstop to advance the America First agenda here in Mississippi against the establishment swamp that’s dead set on stopping our fight for hardworking Mississippians.” 
“These unsubstantiated lies you are printing about me won’t deter me or my team from finding waste and fraud and expose any abuse by politicians desperate to protect their power,” White added. 
The tension between White and Favre, one of Mississippi’s most prolific athletes, stems from the state’s sprawling welfare scandal that has seen multiple people plead guilty to federal and state charges. 
White said in 2020 that Favre received over $1 million in speaking fees from a nonprofit organization that spent welfare funds with approval from the Mississippi Department of Human Services, but that Favre never actually gave the speeches.
Favre has repaid the $1.1 million he received, but state officials argue he still owes about $730,000 in unpaid interest.
Neither state nor federal prosecutors have charged the former NFL athlete with a crime, but the state has civilly sued Favre, as well as roughly three dozen others, in an attempt to claw back welfare money through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which they allege was misspent. 
Favre is also suing White for defamation, claiming that the auditor defamed him in media appearances. Specifically, the athlete is suing the statewide official for accusing Favre of “stealing taxpayer funds” and knowingly misusing funds “designed to serve poor folks.”
White has vigorously fought the litigation, argued that his statements about Favre were truthful and filed motions to dismiss the suit. Earlier this month, a three-judge panel of the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled against White in his attempt to dismiss the lawsuit and allowed the litigation in Hinds County Circuit Court to proceed. 
Obtaining a Trump endorsement in what may likely be a crowded Republican primary for governor would be a boon to a Republican candidate in ruby-red Mississippi. 
However, neither Trump himself nor his White House administration has said anything publicly about the state auditor. A White House official who was also granted anonymity told Mississippi Today that Trump has never said anything negative about White. 
“Shad’s been a great supporter of the president, and the president loves all of his supporters,” the White House official said. 
But other conservative media and political figures with ties to Trump have criticized White over his issues with Favre. 
Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative media personality, dedicated a segment of his show last year to defending Favre against White’s accusations and drew a comparison between White and New York Attorney General James’ prosecution of Trump. 
“White knew that suing Brett would have widespread publicity, and it has,” Kirk said. “In fact, the suit has made Brett persona non grata in many circles and has damaged his ability to make a living in the state of Mississippi.”
White, at the time, responded to Kirk’s comments by saying the conservative influencer didn’t understand the basic facts of the welfare scandal.  
“If you think it’s politically convenient for me to take on a Hall of Fame quarterback in Mississippi, you are stupid, stupid, stupid,” White said. “I’m not here to do what’s convenient. I’m not trying to be buddies with a famous guy, like some others. I don’t care. I’m here to do my job and tell Mississippians what happened to our money.”  
Another jarring moment occurred when White was promoting his office’s efforts to find and reduce wasteful spending in state government, a move that some legislators have criticized. 
“And after we’re done, I’m volunteering for duty in the Trump-Musk Commission!” White wrote. 
Arthur Schwartz, a Washington political operative who’s close to the Trump family and has been an adviser to Donald Trump Jr. for years, replied to the post and said White was not “getting anywhere near a Trump admin” and that the “transition team has already been warned about you.” 
Favre replied to Schwartz’s comments with two laughing emojis, prompting further back-and-forth between White and Schwartz.
The political conundrum for White comes at a time when the Mississippi public official has informally started a Mississippi Office of Government Efficiency within the State Auditor’s Office to root out government waste, modeled after Trump and Elon Musk’s federal Department of Government Efficiency.
White, on Thursday morning, posted on X that “it’s been a great five months supporting President Trump’s America First agenda!” 
He’s also made social media posts suggesting there are JD Vance-equivalent nicknames for him such as “Great Value JD Vance” floating around the internet and proposed getting a “MS MUSK” car tag to show his support for Elon Musk.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/06085014/3X0A5636-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-21 07:03:33.642427

This sensationalist framing is not only factually misleading — it’s politically loaded and dangerously reminiscent of the failed tough-on-crime tactics that have destabilized Black communities for generations. While headlines grab the public’s attention, they rarely tell the whole story. 
Memphis deserves better than soundbites, surveillance, and Silicon Valley saviors.
To understand why Patel’s approach is so problematic, we have to rewind to 2017. That year, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions came to Memphis with the same drumbeat: increased crime, more federal help. Memphis was entered into the Department of Justice’s “Public Safety Partnership,” supposedly to offer tools, data, and strategy to reduce violence.
For a moment in 2018, there was a modest dip in violent crime. But by 2019 — before the pandemic — those numbers were climbing again. And by 2020, Memphis experienced one of its most violent years on record, with homicides jumping nearly 50%.



				FBI Director Kash Patel called Memphis the “homicide capital of America” and said he’s sending federal agents to the city. But this isn’t the first time the federal government has intervened with strategies to purportedly reduce violence, and there’s been no meaningful investments in the community.			


So what did that federal intervention actually achieve?
If we’re honest, not much. No meaningful investments in community infrastructure. No reform of policing practices. No shift in the culture of punishment that undergirds our public safety systems. Just more boots on the ground, more guns on the street, and more people funneled into an already-bloated criminal justice system.
We have more police per capita than cities like Nashville, and yet our violent crime rate remains higher. Why? Because it’s not just about the number of officers — it’s about what they do, how they’re trained and who they’re accountable to. The Memphis Police Department doesn’t need more officers — it needs better practices, more transparency and real accountability. But those conversations keep getting swept under the rug, even in the wake of one of the most horrifying public tragedies in recent memory: the murder of Tyre Nichols.
That trial, still fresh in our collective conscience, was another missed opportunity. While five officers stood accused of Nichols’s death, the case largely avoided a deeper examination of the systemic and cultural failures within MPD. 
The DOJ’s own report — released in December 2024 — confirmed what many of us already knew: Memphis police have engaged in unconstitutional, racially biased and violent practices for years. These patterns weren’t new; they were just well-documented for the first time by federal investigators.
And now, we’re expected to believe that sending more federal agents — this time from the FBI, under the guise of public safety — will solve what decades of over-policing have only exacerbated? We cannot ignore that this is happening at the same time that billion-dollar tech projects are rolling into town.

Elon Musk’s xAI supercomputer project and Google’s data center development are being touted as signs of economic progress for Memphis. And to be fair, the arrival of such large-scale, high-tech investments does represent an opportunity. But history reminds us that opportunity alone does not guarantee equity. These projects often consume massive tracts of land, place significant strain on community resources like water and electricity and promise jobs that never quite reach the neighborhoods most impacted by generational poverty and systemic neglect.
That’s why we must be vigilant — not just skeptical, but strategic.
As these projects break ground, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that they do not deepen the displacement and disenfranchisement of longtime residents — especially Black and working-class families in Westwood, Box Town and Whitehaven. Instead, we must leverage these developments to create environmental safeguards, sustainable job pipelines and enforceable community benefit agreements that protect the people, not just the profit margins of corporations.
When powerful institutions — federal agencies, multinational corporations and complicit local officials — collaborate without community input or accountability, we don’t get innovation. We get exploitation dressed up in progress. That’s how the tragic cycles of the past repeat themselves:under new names and slicker branding.
So what do we do?
We resist the temptation to let outsiders dictate our future. We interrogate the narratives sold to us by elected and appointed officials who stage ribbon-cuttings instead of enacting reforms. We advocate for violence prevention, not just response. We demand that corporate development be paired with ethical obligations: equitable hiring, environmental responsibility and public transparency. And we push back — forcefully and faithfully — against the idea that more federal law enforcement is the path to peace.
Let’s be clear: Memphis doesn’t need more surveillance and suppression. We need resources, repair, and a renewed social contract rooted in justice, dignity and self-determination.
Anything less is just “copaganda.”

In a statement released Tuesday, the university said the UW-Platteville Police Department had responded to a call at Wilgus Hall, a student residence hall, for a “disturbance.” When officers arrived, they found two individuals with gunshot wounds.
One of the individuals police found on the scene has been identified as 22-year-old Kelsie Martin, who was transported to Southwest Health and then med-flighted to UW Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Martin was the Wilgus Hall Assistant Resident Director and a psychology major from Beloit, the university said in an update. 
The other individual was identified as Hallie Helms, also 22 years old. Helms died on the scene, and preliminary autopsy findings indicate that Helms may have died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Helms was a Wilgus Hall resident, and an elementary education major from Baraboo.
Final exams for the remainder of the week have been cancelled. Students with any questions are encouraged to reach out to the dean’s office for their individual college. Students are encouraged to reach out to counseling resources. University counseling will be offering walk-in urgent sessions Wednesday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and toll free counseling can be reached at 844-602-6680 or 720-272-0004. 
University officials and law enforcement have been tight-lipped about the incident, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. A shelter-in-place order was issued as a large police presence gathered on the campus Monday. The order lasted for about an hour until 5 p.m. Gov. Tony Evers said he was being briefed on the situation and will remain in close contact with university officials.
UW-Platteville enrolls around 5,800 students, with Wilgus Hall, one of 10 residence buildings, housing 230 students , according to the university’s website. Over 2,800 students live on campus. The shooting occurred at the end of the spring semester and on the first day of final exams.
Some students reported seeing ambulances on scene. One student, 24-year-old Amanda Sawatzki, reportedly heard the voices of two people arguing in the afternoon, and then later heard a loud bang while she was working on a senior seminar paper. 
At a 7 p.m. press conference on Monday, UW-Platteville Police Chief Joseph Hallman wouldn’t confirm whether a shooting had occurred, or whether there had been any injuries. Hallman and university officials called it an isolated incident, and said it is being actively investigated by police.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)This story is the second of four parts in a series about homelessness in Western Kentucky.
CENTRAL CITY  — When Courtney Phillips left her friend’s home in Muhlenberg County on Halloween last year, she took with her what she could fit into a backpack along with a leash for her dog Joker. The two of them walked roughly four miles to the county courthouse in Greenville.
The 32-year-old had been fired from her job at a nursing home in Madisonville, she said, because she didn’t have reliable transportation or a phone to let her employer know when she lacked a ride. She had been raised to be independent and take care of herself but had few options. A tornado in 2021 whose path stretched for over a hundred miles had wrecked her late father’s home in Bremen and left it uninhabitable.
A case manager she had worked with saw her on the side of the road, stopped and drove her to a church she had been attending for a couple of months. She said others with nowhere to go had slept in the parking lot of Abundant Life Church in Central City without fear of running into law enforcement.
Phillips found a corner and laid down two quilts and her sleeping bag and put her comforter on top. Her backpack served as a pillow and Joker as a source of warmth. She slept there for weeks, angry and hurt that circumstances had dropped her on cold concrete.
“If I’m out of sight, I’m out of mind,” Phillips told the Lantern. “I’m used to making things happen, and nothing was happening.”

As the nights grew colder, Jennifer Banks, one of the church’s pastors, watched Phillips and others sleeping outside through the church’s cameras. A van often parked there overnight. Police in late September had brought wheelchair-bound Mallie Luken to the parking lot and left her to sleep the night. Banks encouraged Phillips to stay in sight of the cameras so she could watch her for her safety.
After Thanksgiving, when overnight temperatures dropped into the teens, Jennifer’s husband Zachary brought blankets and hand warmers for Phillips and Joker, planning to place a small heater next to them. Phillips was unaware at the time, but Zachary saw that her lips were blue.
“We’re going to the church and letting her in. She’ll freeze to death,” Jennifer Banks recalls thinking. Her church hadn’t considered using their building as a shelter at that point.
Only four days after Phillips began staying at the church she landed a job at another nursing home, the pastor said. She’s still staying in a room at the church, walking and bicycling to work.
“All she needed to do is be able to sleep at night and get a shower, and she got a job,” Jennifer Banks said.
Phillips is grateful for the help she has received from the Bankses and others. As for some in the local community, she says, “They try to sweep us under the rug like we don’t exist.”
 A loose coalition emerges 
Zachary Banks and Jennifer Banks each had their own personal struggles before moving their family to Muhlenberg County in late 2023. The pastor of their “mother church” in Hardin County, also called Abundant Life, had called the couple to lead the new church in Central City. They bought a building that had been home to a Presbyterian congregation.
Zachary Banks had been in and out of prison while struggling with addiction, and Jennifer Banks had dealt with alcoholism. How their Christian faith helped them overcome those challenges informed how they wanted to build their new church community.
“If I can share my experience, if I can share my testimony with people like, ‘Listen, you don’t want to sit in a prison room for seven years,’” Zachary Banks said earlier this year. “I treat the people the way that I wish that somebody would have treated me.”

The two of them, with members of the previous congregation coming along, started talking about their vision and going out into the community, hosting picnics and weekly meals at the church and delivering food. One weekend they helped clean up trash at a local park. They saw people experiencing homelessness, some dealing with substance abuse, and invited them to come to church for food.
The church sought and received a grant from the Felix Martin Foundation, which funds initiatives in the county, to build a mobile shower outside the church.
The Bankses and their church aren’t the only ones who know people experiencing homelessness and want to do more.
Debra Gorham, the director of the Hope2All food pantry in Drakesboro in southern Muhlenberg County, distributes boxes of food to hundreds of families who line up in cars at her pantry. Some have unstable housing situations or live outside. Every Kentucky county is required to have an animal shelter, Gorham told the Lantern in April. But there is no such requirement for people.
“Something about that just doesn’t sit very well with me,” Gorham said.

Kelsey Rolley, a community services coordinator with the agency Pennyrile Allied Community Services, or PACS, in Greenville, fields requests for aid from people dealing with housing, utility bill assistance and more, relying on federal Community Services Block Grant funds to meet those needs. 
But the funding can run out quickly as people struggle to afford rents of $1,000 a month or more, she said, for houses that still need repairs or are not up to code. People are “having to take what they can get.” Emergency shelters in other nearby counties face high demand. The people she helps, whether they have a disability or other issues, often need recurring help.
“I don’t think it would ever be enough for just PACS alone to be able to carry the weight of the burden that we are seeing down here, whether it be the homeless, whether it be just resources in general — everybody’s having to spread them out thin, because the demand is so high,” Rolley said earlier this year.  “If we don’t have enough resources as a community to carry our own — if we can’t help our own, how are we supposed to grow as a population?”
 Putting her faith in ‘Beacon of Hope’
Gwen Clements, a Central City woman, started a Facebook group focused on homelessness and has worked with the Bankses, Rolley and others as a part of a loose coalition of the caring.
In the summer 2024, law enforcement officers serving a warrant came to a large encampment. Later, at the property owner’s request, police cleared the encampment, scattering the roughly dozen people who had been living there, some of whom Clements considers friends.

Clements took to Facebook angry at how the campers had been treated. 
“They’ve been living there for many months without ANY ISSUES!! The encampment is well hidden from public eye, so it’s not an eyesore for the city,” she wrote on Facebook in June 2024. “WHERE ARE THEY SUPPOSE TO GO??? Some of them work in town at local restaurants and walk to work…JUST WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSE TO DO??”
She threatened to let the displaced campers pitch tents in her front yard “with a huge sign explaining why they are there” for people to see on their way to the dedication of statues of local musical heroes The Everly Brothers and John Prine in downtown Central City.
She said a Central City police officer came to her house shortly after her Facebook post to advise her against that, saying a city ordinance prohibited pitching tents in one’s yard.
With Clements’ help, some who had lived in the encampment rented rooms at the Central Inn, a motel at 300 East Everly Brothers Blvd. Clements’ Facebook group members sometimes send her money to put up people at the Central Inn to keep them out of dangerous cold.

Clements wants to do more. In her vision the county would have a shelter, community kitchen and space for people experiencing homelessness.
The Central Inn — and its possibilities — came into focus as a possible solution as support began to gather around an idea floated by Abundant Life Church: Buy the Central Inn and turn it into apartments where people without housing can stay, pay rent and build financial stability and a credit history, before moving on to another rental elsewhere in town. Other services would be provided by local agencies to help those dealing with mental illness and other issues. 
The church posted on Facebook about the proposal and Clements, a supporter of the idea, shared the post with her Facebook group.
The church called it the “Beacon of Hope.”
Next in the Lantern’s series: In a meeting with local officials and downtown business owners, the “Beacon of Hope” faces pushback.
  The Banks and others at Abundant Life Church dubbed their idea for buying the Central Inn and using it to ease the housing crisis the “Beacon of Hope.”(Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)

(Photo by Leigh Vogel/Getty Images for Caring Across Generations)During my 14 years in the Kentucky House of Representatives, I was deeply involved in overseeing Kentucky’s Medical Assistance Program better known as Medicaid. I co-chaired a committee that made an in-depth study of Medicaid that resulted in legislation that I sponsored to address waste, fraud and abuse.
Recently, Medicaid and its recipients have been misrepresented, resulting in divisive and misleading rhetoric. It is crucial that we examine the facts carefully and address the misinformation stemming from recent news reporting and pending legislative actions.
Medicaid funds do not go directly to recipients. Medicaid services prepay for medical care, such as doctor visits, procedures and medications to aid low-income families, children, parents, caregivers, pregnant women, seniors and people with disabilities.
The proposal in Congress to cut Medicaid by $625 billion over 10 years, leaving an estimated 7.6 million people without health insurance by 2034, along with the impending work requirements, suggests a lack of sensitivity or understanding regarding the nature of this program and the demographics of Medicaid recipients in Kentucky and nationwide.
History
Let’s begin with a quick overview: Medicaid, established in 1965, is a public insurance program that provides health coverage to low-income families and individuals, including children, parents, pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities. It is funded jointly by the federal government and the states. Funds allocated for Medicaid do not go directly to recipients but are used to pay health care providers on a fee-for-service basis or through prepayment arrangements for medical care.
This includes doctor visits, medical procedures, medications and more. In Kentucky, the federal government pays about 70% and the state 30% of traditional Medicaid reimbursements while the match is 90% federal-10% state for expanded Medicaid, allowing Kentucky to provide “significant health care services” at a good value.
Myth
Now let’s look at the myth surrounding work requirements for Medicaid care. As the chair of the 1993 Program Review and Investigations Committee and principal sponsor of House Bill 127, an act relating to waste, fraud and abuse, I have consistently kept up with the Kentucky Medicaid Program over the years. It appears a long-standing misconception has produced an effort to create a solution for a problem that does not exist.




Full-time and part-time workers must rely on Medicaid and SNAP, a nutrition assistance program, because they do not earn a living wage to support their families. Maybe addressing this issue would help find a solution to the real, underlying problem we are currently facing.			


Between 2015 and 2017, over 60% of Kentucky Medicaid recipients consistently held full-time or part-time employment. According to 2023 data from the Kaiser Foundation, Kentucky currently ranks 10th  in the nation for the number of “working Medicaid recipients.” There are 56.4% with full-time employment and 14.6% with part-time employment. Subsequently, 70.7% of Medicaid recipients are currently working, while 29.3% are not employed. 
The non-working group comprises elderly individuals, people with disabilities, children and caregivers who together account for approximately 19.8%. These individuals do not meet any of the work requirements currently being proposed. Consequently, the legislative proposals being considered would only affect 9.5% of the remaining Medicaid population here in Kentucky —  undoubtedly, a solution for a problem that does not exist.
The real, underlying problem
Work requirements put up barriers to Medicaid coverage. Changes to work and reporting requirements and eligibility criteria have been shown to cause confusion among Medicaid enrollees, leading to substantial coverage loss, even for those who are eligible.
 A 2022 Kaiser Family Foundation report revealed that nearly 70% of people who had been dropped from Medicaid lost coverage due to procedural reasons. This is just the latest evidence of the harmful impact on peoples’ access to health care caused by recent changes in Medicaid policy. During the time studied, Kentucky disenrolled 71,000 enrollees for missed paperwork and other procedural reasons. Of these, 74% (52,540) lost coverage attributed to barriers created by the beginnings of a state Medicaid work requirement that a court blocked from taking full effect, while 26% were found ineligible. As a result, 52,540 individuals lost access to health care services.
 Clearly, any barriers affecting Kentucky’s Medicaid recipients warrant reevaluation. Our diligent Medicaid recipients merit equitable treatment and consideration.
However, Houston, we do have a problem: Kentucky reported that in 2022, half of working Medicaid enrollees (50%) were employed by companies with over 100 employees and 42.8% worked in the agriculture/service sector. These full-time and part-time workers must rely on Medicaid and SNAP, a nutrition assistance program, because they do not earn a living wage to support their families. Maybe addressing this issue would help find a solution to the real, underlying problem we are currently facing.
The Congressional Budget Office’s analysis shows that this “one big, beautiful bill” will reduce expansion reimbursements, add additional cost to Medicaid recipients, add work requirements, increase coverage barriers, cut Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years, and leave at least 7.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034.
True leadership involves building bridges, not barriers.

Kumpuris, who currently serves as Arkansas PBS’ education director and production director, will assume her new role on May 26. She replaces Courtney Pledger. The public media network announced in April that Pledger would leave her position in May.

In a statement issued Tuesday evening, Kumpuris said she was “honored” to step into the new role.
“This organization has long been a vital resource for our communities, and I’m committed to continuing our mission of providing high-quality educational content and programming that reflects the values and needs of all Arkansans,” she said. “I look forward to working with our incredible team as we build on our legacy of service and innovation.”
The majority of the eight-member board voted in favor of Kumpuris after meeting in executive section for nearly an hour. The voice vote included one audible dissent. Kumpuris will serve in an interim capacity while a national search for a permanent executive director is organized and conducted, Commission Chairman West Doss said during the virtual meeting.
“We’ve had a very good meeting of the commissioners and took the first step towards finding us a new executive director of Arkansas PBS,” Doss said. “We had three excellent candidates with excellent credentials, all internal, and we are all blessed to have them at Arkansas PBS.”
The other two internal candidates considered were Associate Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer Jason Kunau and Operations Director DeWayne Wilbur. All three candidates will be considered for the permanent position, Doss said. 
The permanent director will succeed Pledger, who joined Arkansas PBS in 2017 and also serves as vice chair of PBS’ 27-member national board of directors.
“It has been my great honor to lead Arkansas PBS through a transformative time that points to the limitless potential of our statewide public media network,” Pledger said in a statement issued last month.
Under Pledger’s leadership, Arkansas PBS expanded its K-12 educational programming, launching “Arkansas AMI” when schools closed during the pandemic. She also “significantly increased the reach and impact” of ArkansasIDEAS, the state’s most-used online professional development platform for teachers, according to an April press release. The network also started broadcasting state high school sports championships.
During her tenure at Arkansas PBS, Pledger also faced multiple conflicts with the state Legislature, including in 2023 when the organization’s regularly scheduled 2022 audit indicated that administrators might have sidestepped state laws related to contract bidding. 
Arkansas PBS announces executive director’s departure next month

Pledger told lawmakers the agency had no intention to break or circumvent state law and had learned from its “mistakes and errors.”
Arkansas PBS’ spending authority has repeatedly faced resistance in the Arkansas House. Appropriations need approval from three-fourths of lawmakers, and PBS’ fiscal year 2026 appropriation required five attempts to get 76 House members’ support.
Earlier this year, Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Jonesboro filed a bill to abolish the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, which oversees Arkansas PBS’ programs and finances, and transfer its powers and authorities to the state education department. 
After the bill to abolish the commission passed the Senate in February, Doss and Sullivan said they reached an agreement that led Sullivan to leave the commission alone.
Sullivan, the legislature’s most vocal critic of Arkansas PBS, unsuccessfully tried to reduce the public television station’s spending authority during the 2022 and 2024 fiscal sessions.
The governor appointed Sullivan’s wife, Maria Sullivan, to the commission last year. Doss previously said that Maria Sullivan will lead an Arkansas PBS task force aimed at better serving homeschoolers, which is a high priority for her husband.
The commission will next meet on June 5.

Hanna told the Michigan state House Families and Veterans Committee that has been the result for moms who’ve accessed cash payments through Rx Kids, which began as a program to address infant poverty in Flint, but has expanded to Kalamazoo and the Upper Peninsula, with other locations in Michigan to be served soon.
Hanna, a Flint-area physician who sounded alarm bells about the long-term health impacts of the Flint Water Crisis in 2014, said the number one thing moms buy with the $500 monthly cash payments the program gives moms after they give birth is diapers. And in Flint, Hanna said the program has distributed $10 million to more than 2,000 families and has seen reductions in smoking in mothers, increased birth weights and less reports of abuse or neglect.
The program is funded with money from the state government as well as local governments and private groups and also affords participants a one-time $1,500 cash payment during pregnancy.
“When we think about child welfare, it is one of the biggest cost items in our state budget and in our federal budget,” Hanna said. “The peak age of child welfare involvement is zero to one, that first year of life, more than double any other age of life and that’s largely because of poverty.”
And as Michigan officials on the local and statewide level seek solutions to grow the state’s population as it’s predicted to decline over the next few years, the Trump administration is looking to address declining birth rates.
A recent proposal by the Trump administration of a $5,000 “baby bonus” for moms after they give birth has made headlines around the country and is being matched by public discourse surrounding the high costs associated with pregnancy, giving birth and parenthood.
A group of Michigan Senate Democrats stood alongside Hanna at the state Capitol in march as they unveiled their plan to decrease the costs of parenthood in Michigan, which included interest in making Rx Kids a statewide program.
When asked if the Republican-led House would consider supporting Senate Democrats plan or propose their own population growth plan during an April 24 news conference, Michigan Speaker of the House Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) didn’t respond directly to questioning about the potential of “baby bonuses” from the Michigan Advance, but said the chamber is reviewing its options and is working on policies to make life more affordable for Michiganders across the board.
Discussions about the state budget are being had right now, but chair of the House Families and Veterans Committee, Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson), didn’t confirm with the Advance after the Tuesday committee meeting if a statewide expansion of baby cash payments is on the table.
“I think it’s important that we bring in organizations that are here to help families. It’s not that we agree with everything that goes on. It’s just that we need to hear from different agencies who are out there and what they’re doing for families and babies and what’s available,”  Schmaltz said. “We will take all the information and we’ll sift through it and find out what works, what doesn’t work and what should be funded and what shouldn’t be funded.”

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)As Elena Schlossberg of Prince William County, Virginia sees it, the community effort to fight the richest companies in the world seeking to build data centers began about a decade ago when opposition coalesced in the early days of the industry’s development.
Then, a couple of years ago, when people began to learn much more about the warehouse-like server farms proliferating at double the earlier rate, the fight strengthened with a meeting in Warrenton.
“That was where we all just started saying, ‘OK, in order to fight this behemoth, we have to have some organizational process,’” Schlossberg said. “We have to be able to communicate. We have to be able to support each other. We have to have a clearinghouse for all the information.”
Schlossberg’s group, the Coalition to Protect Prince William County, about 35 miles southwest of the nation’s capital, teamed up with several other groups, including the Piedmont Environmental Council, the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association, and met in one of the areas facing development pressure that could now triple in the state. They formed the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition.
Such community opposition is the focal point of a recent report by Data Center Watch, a research organization tracking data center opposition. A key finding: “$64 billion in U.S. data center projects have been blocked or delayed by a growing wave of local, bipartisan opposition.”
“What was once quiet infrastructure is now a national flashpoint — and communities are pushing back,” the report says. “This report highlights political risks and local opposition as frequent factors in data center project delays or cancellations, including community resistance, environmental concerns, and zoning issues.”
As data center development explodes, the industry has faced particular challenges in Virginia, its global epicenter. Some $900 million in projects in the state have been blocked, and $45.8 billion in projects have been delayed. Yet, environmental advocates say few protections have been put in place.
At the state level, dozens of bills were introduced in the Virginia General Assembly this year to enact development safeguards, but only a symbolic one about utility costs was signed into law by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, a trade group representing many of the tech companies developing projects in Virginia, said the group is “committed to working collaboratively with local officials, policymakers, and regulatory bodies at every level.
“Data center companies site projects where they are permitted under local zoning ordinances, rules, and regulations, which are developed by local leaders representing their communities,” Levi said. “The industry seeks to work collaboratively with local officials to minimize community impacts, which often includes participating in town halls and other community and public engagement opportunities.”
 Examples of pushback 

The locations of projects getting blocked or delayed are mostly centered in the Northern Virginia suburbs and exurbs of Washington, where the internet began. The region now serves a vast federal government, defense and intelligence complex.
A couple other projects highlighted in the report branch out into the Northern Neck, south of the Potomac River, and outside Richmond. Virginia is home to 13 percent of the world’s data center capacity, while 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic moves through computers in the state.
One case study in the report highlighted the effort by Schlossberg’s group, the Manassas Battlefield Trust and others to stop the $24.7 billion Digital Gateway development of a campus with 37 data centers in Prince William County near the Manassas National Battlefield Park. Another is the Bren Pointe residential community in Fairfax County, fighting a $165 million hyperscale project that would need transmission lines and a five-acre substation 60 feet from the boundary of a townhome complex.
In another project in Warrenton, proposed by Amazon with an undetermined development cost, hundreds of people, including actor Robert Duvall, attended and spoke in opposition, according to FauquierNow. Legal challenges have stalled the town council’s approval of the project, and during that period, council members who supported it have been voted out of office.
The report noted that Republican elected officials made up 55 percent of those critical of projects, expressing concerns over the use of tax incentives. Democrats made up 45 percent of those opposing projects, largely over environmental concerns.
But many elected officials are approving data centers.
“What will it take for people in positions of power to make different choices?” Schlossberg said. “As plain as the nose on my face, data centers are impacting the integrity of our water and our air and our communities and our reliable, affordable electricity.”
Ann Wheeler, former chair of the Board of Supervisors in Prince William County, declined to comment on why she lost her Democratic primary race for re-election, but stood by her choices to support the industry in today’s digitally driven society.
The environmental concerns used “misinformation” as part of a campaign of BANANA, or Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone, she said, and supporting the facilities’ construction meant union jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in local revenue to support social services her party has traditionally aligned with.
“They’ll go in somewhere,” Wheeler said, adding her county had resources for responsible planning. “I would rather have that tax revenue in Virginia.”
The report did not feature the opposition to a proposed data center in Pittsylvania County. There, community pushback and a report commissioned by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which highlighted the health effects from on-site, fossil fuel-powered generation equipment, led to the Board of Supervisors rejecting a needed rezoning application, effectively killing the project. The report included other case studies of successful data center opposition in Indiana, Texas and Arizona.
 Legislative failures

Virginia’s legislative research arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, issued a report in December that comprehensively examined the costs of data center development. It found that data-center energy demand would roughly triple from 2023 to 2040 if development went unconstrained. Even so, the legislative protections proposed this year failed to make it across the finish line.
Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have had localities require a description of substation needs and a study on the noise the facilities close to homes and schools generate, which can come from their air conditioning units, and onsite power generators. House Democrats killed a requirement for state regulators to review data center power contractsto ensure that electricity generation and transmission lines could support the need.
One change that did pass requires the State Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities, to review cost allocations for data center projects between consumers and the center operators. The commission already had that authority.
One Republican lawmaker, Del. Ian Lovejoy of Prince William County, pushed for ways to have the industry pay for the electric grid upgrades it necessitates. But debate on the bills married business and labor union interests, which “usually are opposed to one another,” Lovejoy said. “When those two groups agree on something, [there are] very difficult headwinds.”
The General Assembly was also leery of interfering with local land use decisions in an election year, Lovejoy said.
All 100 delegates are up for election this year, along with the governor. Democrats control the chamber 51-49. The state Senate, also controlled by Democrats, 21-19, has elections in two years. A similar debate driven by community opposition to new solar projects also took place this year in the legislature.
Community opposition to data centers, Lovejoy said, “is going to affect more and more people when they build data centers directly next to houses. That’s the cautionary tale. Look at Loudoun [County], look at Prince William. Don’t build them next to schools, don’t build them next to houses. Make sure they’re set back properly, or you’re going to have the same issues that we’re having.”
Schlossberg said members of her group traveled a couple of hours down to Richmond one early morning during the legislative session earlier in the year. They were there to lobby for the swath of data-center bills as part of the group’s increasing battle at the local, state and federal level that is costing the industry money and creating a community of opponents.
“I think it’s important to really talk about the building of community,” Schlossberg said. “In a digital world, I think we have seen people who have never felt lonelier. And I think that’s been a really important positive outcome, is that people connect.”

As with federal educational policy generally, it is not likely to have a significant impact on K-12 education because education has always been a state and local matter. In fact, in 2024, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued Executive Order 30 and an associated set of education guidelines that have already generated important action related to AI in education, including a summit this week that brings together educators in the K-12 and higher education systems to try to create alignment and educational pathways to best serve students in the commonwealth. 
Trump’s EO is a bit redundant to Youngkin’s EO, and both miss the forest for the trees. 
K-12 schools serve multiple purposes; two of the most important are to prepare young people to be productive members of a deliberative democracy and to prepare them for the workforce. To properly serve either of those roles has always meant ensuring that students are technologically literate, meaning not necessarily that they are adept at using technology, but rather that they make good choices about what, if any, technologies might be used in personal or professional situations. 
Today, artificial intelligence dominates the technology discourse, and the potential effects of AI on the workforce and civic life are significant. Concerning the workforce, the Brookings Institute’s late 2024 analysis concluded that “…more than 30% of all workers could see at least 50% of their occupation’s tasks disrupted by generative AI.” On democracy, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace writes that “AI models enable malicious actors to manipulate information and disrupt electoral processes, threatening democracies.”  This research makes it clear: If public schools are to serve their highest purposes, it is incumbent upon educators to make sure students are AI literate.
Being AI literate, though, means much more than just learning to use AI; it also means being aware of the ethics and potential risks. We know, for example, that AI is hurting the environment and that AI companies are defending themselves against credible claims of intellectual property violations. Students need to know that, too. Additionally, integrating chatbots into the learning process potentially dehumanizes a necessarily human experience. Absent this knowledge and the right skills and dispositions around technology and AI, our young people are less likely to be able to successfully engage in an increasingly technological civic age and are less likely to be prepared to succeed in an increasingly technological workforce. 
However, even that broader, ethics-inclusive approach to AI literacy is too narrow. AI is the latest form of technology to capture our attention, but our society is increasingly dominated by other technologies, including technologies of surveillance (some of which are powered by AI). Nearly all aspects of our society, from schooling to law enforcement, are changing because of technological developments. Long ago, institutions of higher education developed whole interdisciplinary programs of study that consider the historical, cultural and social impacts of science and technology on society. This is the broader, more interdisciplinary approach that needs to be integrated into our K-12 schools. 
Interdisciplinary programming is challenging in our siloed K-12 system, but it is possible and worth trying. We could, for example, ensure that when students read novels in school, they read one or two books that force discussion about the role of technology in our society. There is no shortage of good books like that. When students learn about history, they should learn about the Luddites. They might learn, for instance, that to be a Luddite was not just to be anti-technology; rather, Luddites started a labor movement that pushed back against the sort of automation that AI could contribute to today. For math, students could study quantitative reasoning and learn about how much of AI and machine learning is based on inferential statistics. 
I am the parent of a public school student and a critical friend of technology who wants my child to be able to explore the affordances of technology for learning. However, I am not interested in my child engaging in the sort of AI integration that Trump’s EO speaks to. If my child struggles to grasp a concept, I want them to struggle through it with their classmates and teachers, not some AI chatbot tutor. 
And, as a taxpayer, I am not interested in supporting the integration of technology that comes from the “public-private partnerships” that are highlighted in the EO. That’s a not-so-subtle attempt to further enrich the technology leaders who sat on stage at Trump’s inauguration. Instead of teaching my child to use Adobe Firefly to make fancy reports, I want my child’s teachers to help them learn to navigate a world that is increasingly technological and morally complex. 
Among some members of society, there is a near-religious devotion to AI. And, coincidentally, how religion is handled in public schools (at least for now, as the Supreme Court newly considers the place of religion in public schools) may be instructive. The common saying has been that schools can teach about religion, but they cannot teach religion. I favor a similar approach to AI in education. We should teach about AI, not teach with or especially for AI. In fact, if our schools are to prepare students like my child for the world ahead, they must largely look away from the narrow and shiny new object of AI and meet the broader societal challenge this technology represents.

This story was originally published by PublicSource. 
Corey O’Connor, a longtime city and county elected official, East End resident and the son of Pittsburgh’s 58th mayor, has the inside track to be the city’s 62nd mayor after winning the Democratic primary Tuesday.
The Associated Press called the race at 10:05 p.m. on Tuesday evening, with O’Connor more than 4,000 votes ahead and 80% of the votes counted. By 11 p.m. O’Connor had 53% of the tally, with 96% of votes counted.
“Your voices and your call for accountable leadership and growth have been heard in this Democratic primary,” O’Connor told a crowd of supporters at Nova Place in Allegheny Center.
He pulled off a rare defeat of a sitting mayor, denying Ed Gainey a second term after pummeling him with more than $1 million worth of mostly negative advertisements leading up to the vote. “Pittsburgh deserves better,” O’Connor declared in December, and proceeded to scathe Gainey’s handling of city finances, police leadership and economic development during more than three years in the office.

Flanked by supporters chanting his name, O’Connor declared that “we are going to win in the fall.” He echoed his campaign promises of enhancing the city’s police force, delivering affordable housing for all and supporting businesses of “all sizes.”
At the center of his address was the idea of pushing Pittsburgh into an era of growth, via a strategy that would begin with families first. He also said a “neighborhood-oriented” approach was necessary. This would mean investing in the city’s small business district instead of “doing study after study.”
Despite his criticism of Gainey’s administration, he said the current mayor’s love for Pittsburgh was never in doubt. They simply had differing plans for the future of the city.
O’Connor called for unity in the Democratic Party during and after his speech. To those who didn’t vote for him, he said, “Let’s sit down [and] have the conversation.”
“To me, it starts fresh. Tomorrow starts a whole new election in the fall, and we’re going to need everybody to take that message of growth and opportunity to our fall election.”
“This has been a wonderful four years,” Gainey said in a concession speech at the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers headquarters in South Side. “We didn’t put a crack in the glass ceiling. We shattered it.”
Gainey told his supporters that the coalition of voters that helped him prevail four years ago will remain “on the rise” despite the setback.
“Don’t be defeated,” Gainey said. “Don’t be sad. Be glad of the progress that we made. It would have been easy for me to bow to power but it was more exhilarating to fight them for you.”
Gainey congratulated O’Connor on running a “well-designed” campaign and, after some in the crowd jeered, said, “We’re not going to spread hate.”
2025 race a very different climate from 2021
“For me, Pittsburgh should be every family’s first choice,” O’Connor said after casting his vote Tuesday morning. “I think that’s the kind of administration we would build. And we’re excited to have that opportunity.”
O’Connor will be a heavy favorite in the general election due to the large Democratic majority that has picked all of Pittsburgh’s mayors since the 1930s.
O’Connor, 40, is just the second challenger to unseat a Pittsburgh mayor running for reelection in nearly a century. The other was Gainey, who beat then-Mayor Bill Peduto in 2021.
O’Connor’s win comes as the city and nation are in a very different place than they were when social justice activists and a restless electorate took down Peduto and swept Gainey into office.
Then, the nation was wobbling out of the pandemic’s economic shock and Joe Biden was beginning his presidency. Now, Donald Trump is back in the White House and city leaders are wondering how his push for massive spending cuts will reshape the city the next mayor will lead.
Then, Democratic politics was dominated by calls for police reform, with the protests following the murder of George Floyd fresh in the national mind. Now, neither candidate centered police accountability in their campaign, and both focused on economic and housing concerns after those issues were central to last year’s presidential race.

O’Connor could inherit Gainey’s struggles
O’Connor spent much of the campaign criticizing Gainey’s record, typical of a challenger, and would have his work cut out for him to make good on promises to build more affordable housing units than Gainey did, add officers to the police force and stabilize city finances that he has said are in disarray.
“I see a mayor that is managing decline instead of working to grow Pittsburgh,” O’Connor said when he launched his campaign in December.
His economic development platform includes a 90-neighborhood “cleanup program,” a promise to remediate blighted buildings and a pledge to invest $10 million in 10 business districts about the city — an idea similar to the Peduto-era program Avenues of Hope, which targeted investment at Pittsburgh’s Black business communities.
He faulted Gainey for not overseeing enough affordable housing construction and said he would alter the city’s permitting and zoning system to encourage development. PublicSource reported in March that the city’s real estate and development industries were donating largely to O’Connor, and some industry leaders said they did so because they found it too burdensome to navigate Pittsburgh’s zoning and permitting process under Gainey.
Finding a permanent police chief would be near the top of the next mayor’s to-do list. O’Connor blasted Gainey throughout the campaign for failing to secure a permanent one; Gainey’s first pick, Larry Scirotto, quit last year to referee college basketball and his pick to succeed Scirotto resigned before being confirmed by City Council.
Perhaps the most daunting challenge in 2026 and beyond lies in the city’s balance sheet, which O’Connor said contains a looming disaster.
Real estate tax revenue has been depressed by changes to the assessment process and post-pandemic teleworking trends. The city’s current five-year plan projects the rainy day fund to shrink from $208 million at the start of 2024 to $72 million at the end of 2029. Avoiding that fate would require cuts to staff or services, a revenue boost, or both.
O’Connor’s argument that Gainey has overseen decline in Pittsburgh was rebutted last week by new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimated that Pittsburgh grew by more than 1% last year and sustained modest net growth across the first four years of this decade — a major development considering the city’s decades of mostly steady decline since the 1980s.
O’Connor follows father’s path
O’Connor grew up in Squirrel Hill and attended Central Catholic High School, where he later coached golf. His father, Bob O’Connor, became a City Council member when Corey was 7, became mayor when the son was 22 and died of brain cancer less than a year after that, in 2006.
Corey O’Connor rarely talked about his father on the campaign trail this year, but has spent decades following his example. After graduating from Duquesne University and working for a few years in the office of former U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, he ran for his father’s old City Council seat in 2011 using money left over from his late father’s campaign account.
He stayed in the seat for a decade before being appointed Allegheny County controller, but soon turned his gaze on his father’s highest achievement, the mayor’s office that his father reached, but held so briefly.

His political foes debate how much he truly accomplished as a member of council, but he was doubtlessly present for significant moments in Pittsburgh’s history. He served alongside the mayor who succeeded his father, Luke Ravenstahl, through eight years of Peduto’s tenure and the progressive shift that brought Gainey into City Hall. The city emerged from state financial oversight during his decade on council, neighborhoods like Lawrenceville and the Strip District were transformed and unfathomable tragedy came to Pittsburgh with the Tree of Life shooting.
The city was finding its footing as a medical and educational hub when O’Connor entered public life, and it faces some comparable turbulence today. The local economy is still evolving to the post-pandemic reality, and the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts would reshape numerous city institutions, including City Hall.
Moreno wins Republican primary
Tony Moreno, a retired police detective from Brighton Heights, is the Republican mayoral nominee for the second time. He was an unlikely GOP champion in 2021, first running in the Democratic primary and ultimately winning the Republican nod through write-in votes.
There was no write-in effort this time as city Republicans had a competitive mayoral primary for the first time since 2001. Moreno defeated Thomas West, a Lawrenceville clothing store owner.
Moreno stood from his chair, slowly, with a smile in the back room of Moonlit Cafe in Brookline when the first poll results showed him taking an early lead.
Moreno, who spent most of his day at the polls — even directing traffic following a minor crash on Route 51 near Carrick — said Pittsburgh’s move toward progressive leadership has gone “too far” for the historically blue-collar, Democratic city.
He said his campaign transcends party politics. “I believe the message is the win,” Moreno said.
For Cindy and Jerry Weisser, Moreno’s approachable demeanor attracts them to the Republican nominee.
“He’s like one of us,” Cindy said while wearing a black and gold “Tony Moreno for Mayor” T-shirt.

The couple said their North Side neighbors include several condemned properties, and they believe Moreno is best poised to improve struggling neighborhoods.
Moreno has campaigned heavily on public safety, calling for more support to the police force and better access to mental health services, such as having social workers on police calls, he said.
Moreno ran largely on his background as a police officer, saying the city administration has betrayed its officers and should invest more resources in the force.
Gainey defeated Moreno in the 2021 general election, 71% to 28%. Moreno reported raising $4,000 in the months leading up to the primary.
Looking forward to his general election campaign against O’Connor, Moreno said his team is celebrating now, but is ready to push his same campaign messages into the coming months.
“It’s just asking the questions the community is asking,” Moreno said.
Democrats prepare for new era
City Councilor Bobby Wilson, whose district includes parts of the North Side and the Strip District, said the primary result was “very promising for the future of Pittsburgh.” Speaking at the nominee’s party, he said O’Connor would be ready on day one to tackle issues facing the city including tax revenue from Downtown and an aging emergency services vehicle fleet.
“This is a correction from three years ago,” Wilson said. “It’s time to move on.”
“He and I could always have very honest and frank conversations together, even when we disagreed,” Lavelle added.
Councilor Khari Mosley, who represents Gainey’s neighborhood in the northeast of the city, said the mayor has been “a great partner.”
“I think his lived experience gave him a unique perspective on the challenges that are facing the city,” Mosley said. “He’s lived through a lot of challenges that so many Pittsburghers are living and experiencing.”

(Photo by Troy Bennett / Maine Morning Star)Krystal Emerson never imagined her son would spend his days at school being forcibly moved against his will by school staff and shut in an empty room. 
But during the 2023-24 school year at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, that’s what happened — at least 18 times, according to Emerson and school district incident reports reviewed by the Maine Morning Star. Staff members put the 7-year-old boy in holds, forced him into empty rooms and did not let him out until he calmed down or his parents picked him up. 


May 21: Restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used on students in emergency situations. Accounts from families and educators show how districts’ interpretation of state law vary widely and how traumatic the experiences can be.
May 22: State data reveals only a fraction of Maine’s schools and districts are consistently reporting incidents of restraint and seclusion in violation of state law. Even with the underreporting, Maine schools are relying on these practices thousands of times per year.
May 23: How one district worked with researchers to change its approach to student behavior and significantly reduced the use of restraint and seclusion

“It broke him, and it broke me,” Emerson said.
The trauma became so severe that her son, now a third grader, no longer attends school in person, she said.
What happened to Emerson’s son is not an isolated case. Across Maine, schools use restraint and seclusion on students more than 10,000 times each year, according to Maine Department of Education data — with some districts resorting to the emergency tactics regularly while others have changed policies and taken other steps so that such interventions are only used as a last resort.
​In recent years, Maine as a whole has made an effort to reduce restraint and seclusion in schools, particularly for students with disabilities, with the U.S. Department of Education citing staff and student injuries and the resulting trauma for students as the reasons to curtail their use. The department has also condemned and discouraged these practices for years under multiple presidential administrations. Rare cases have resulted in serious injuries to students and even death.
A 2021 state law limits restraint and seclusion to emergencies. But as Maine educators report more challenging student behavior in the years since pandemic school closures, there have been calls to allow school staff to restrain and seclude children more often. A newly proposed bill would broaden the circumstances under which school staff could restrain or seclude students, igniting debate among educators, parents and lawmakers about how to manage student behavior without inflicting harm.
The Maine Education Association and the Maine School Management Association, representing teachers and administrators statewide, both support the proposal, citing increased reports of disruptive and violent student behavior — something educators nationwide have also reported in recent years.
The Gardiner-area school system, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 11, has led the push for that proposal. Victoria Duguay, principal of River View Community School in Gardiner, and MSAD 11 Superintendent Patricia Hopkins shared stories with lawmakers of students who hit and spit at adults, scream in hallways, throw chairs and destroy other students’ schoolwork.
Under the 2021 state law, school staff can only restrain students (immobilize them and move them against their will) or seclude them (isolate them in a room that they can’t leave) if their behavior “poses an imminent danger of serious physical injury” — requiring medical intervention beyond first aid, according to the Maine Department of Education regulations that govern restraint and seclusion.
“Staff are being hit, they’re being bit, but it doesn’t meet the threshold of serious imminent danger, because a 5-year-old isn’t going to [cause] an injury that requires medical care,” Hopkins said during an April 23 public hearing.
This extreme behavior, when it happens in a public place at school, traumatizes other students who witness it, Duguay said. The school sometimes has to close off access to common spaces — the gym or cafeteria — if a student acts out in a hallway through which students would need to pass. 
Under the legislation MSAD 11 is supporting, staff would be able to move students against their will to a seclusion room or another quiet space without it counting as a restraint, which districts have to record, document, and report to the state. 
But some educators who have pursued alternative training don’t agree that loosening restraint and seclusion requirements is the answer. 
“The consequences of passing this bill will only inflict more trauma on students,” said Audrey Bartholomew, associate professor and coordinator of special education programs at the University of New England, who trains special education teachers. “Additionally, the behavior will keep happening, because restraint and seclusion is not an appropriate response to challenging behavior, and it will in no way help students remediate their behavior. These should not be referred to as strategies, treatments or solutions.”
Inside the three-hour restraint and seclusion of a 7-year-old
In October 2023, Emerson’s son started a behavior plan to help with concentration and self-regulation. The plan, which Emerson shared with the Maine Morning Star, highlighted the mother’s concerns about her son’s anger, dysregulation, anxiety and ADHD, and noted Emerson’s finding that occupational therapy had helped her son better regulate. 
One week after the plan was put into place, the boy arrived at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School already agitated, hit another student with a Pete the Cat stuffed animal and tried to leave the classroom, setting off a series of escalating interventions in which staff physically restrained him, relocated him against his will, and ultimately placed him in a small room where he stayed until his father arrived, according to incident reports shared with the Maine Morning Star.
The reports, which staff or administrators are required to write, offer an inside look at the behavior leading up to the restraint, how the situation escalated as staff restrained and secluded the boy, and how it continued for three hours, ending when Seth Emerson picked his son up from a seclusion room.
When the second grader initially tried to leave his classroom, two educators cornered the boy in a hallway nook, according to the report written by the school’s assistant principal. When he tried to push past them, they placed a mat between themselves and the child to block him from hitting them, and initiated the first of several physical holds. Each time he was released, he briefly calmed down but didn’t follow directions to sit still or stay in a designated spot, prompting a cycle: he would attempt to flee, staff would block him, the boy would resist, and staff would restrain him again, the report says.
About an hour in, while hiding in a locker, he asked to go home. A staff member moved him to a classroom, where he hid under a desk, retrieved rocks from his backpack, and threw them at staff, the report said. While the report described the projectiles as rocks, Emerson said her son had pebbles in his backpack. 
Two hours in, staff called his parents. Even after he calmed down, they placed him in a seclusion room — referred to as a “quiet room” in the report — where they continued telling him to sit in a specific spot. When his father arrived, the boy walked out on his own, calm and cooperative.
Incidents like that continued for several more months for reasons that Emerson said did not warrant these measures: After he pulled books off shelves, punched a door, or refused to accompany staff to a quiet room, staff would put him in a physical hold or placed him in a room alone, according to a complaint Emerson filed with the district.
“I never condoned any of the behavior, whether he was throwing a book or whether he was yelling or running out of the classroom,” she said. “But he was not getting any education whatsoever last year. He was literally just going to school and being restrained and secluded.”

Frequent seclusions push an educator to quit
It’s not only students and their families who feel the trauma from restraints and seclusion. The educators who are told to put their hands on children feel it, too, several current and former teachers and education technicians told the Maine Morning Star.
Ashley Rose took a job as an ed tech at SeDoMoCha Elementary School in Dover-Foxcroft in August while working toward a degree in special education. But after months of witnessing staff placing students in empty rooms as they screamed and cried to be let out, she changed course. 
In March, Rose switched her major, deciding she no longer wanted to become a teacher. On April 28, she resigned, writing to Superintendent Stacy Shorey that she had repeatedly raised concerns with supervisors about the school’s frequent use of seclusion, the lack of staff training on student behavior, and the absence of alternatives — without seeing meaningful change.
SeDoMoCha Elementary School has “quiet rooms” located within special education classrooms — which Rose described as 10-by-6-foot rooms with no windows. Some have benches and one light, while others are entirely empty, she said. All the doors have windows in them so staff can monitor students. 
In her 10 years of working in special education, she has never seen such frequent use of quiet rooms, Rose said. 
In December, Rose found herself participating in her first seclusion. The student she was working with wasn’t physically aggressive, just loud, and Rose’s plan had been to escort her into the special education classroom — not the quiet room — to help her calm down. 
The student went with her voluntarily but was crying, she said. When they got to the classroom, another staff member who had worked at the school longer said it was part of that student’s behavior plan to go to the quiet room.
“That wasn’t my plan,” Rose said. “That room scares me just looking at it as an adult.”
As the student became more agitated, Rose said her own anxiety rose. If the student didn’t calm down, the other employee told Rose she had to shut the door. Rose complied, and then her colleague told her to hold the door shut with her foot to keep the student inside, she said.
Inside the room, the student began having what appeared to be an anxiety attack and threatened to break the window. She calmed down after about 20 minutes, and Rose let her out. Rose said she was not directed to file an incident report, nor was she told if someone else in the district did, despite the requirement in state law that districts document every seclusion.
Over the holiday break that followed, Rose said she had trouble sleeping. “All I can think about is the student I put in that room,” she said. “School should be their safe place, and these students were not feeling safe.” 
Shorey, the superintendent, said staff members are required to report every incident, but she did not know about the particular incident Rose described. Special Education Director Sue Terrill said it’s possible that a staff member other than Rose wrote a report, but the district was unable to locate any documentation of that event.
The district trains employees in safety care — crisis management and prevention practices — Terrill said. It is open to other trainings, too, she said, including one that Rose brought to Terrill’s attention in February offered by the Maine nonprofit Lives in the Balance, which other districts have used to dramatically reduce their reliance on restraint and seclusion.
Quiet rooms present a gray area
Rose said she saw staff members keep students in seclusion rooms even when they were calm, using those same rooms for a variety of reasons beyond seclusion, which is banned or strictly regulated in at least seven states, according to the MOST Policy Initiative, a Missouri nonprofit. Maine came close to banning the rooms in 2021, but the final version of the law was amended to allow their use in emergencies.
Rose said she saw staff place students in quiet rooms to calm down after acting out, and then not allow them to exit for 20 minutes after they calmed down. If the seclusion happened at the end of the school day, sometimes the student would be expected to return to the quiet room the next day, she said. 
Terrill recalled Rose raising this as an issue but denied keeping students in the rooms after they calmed down and no longer met the legal threshold for confinement.
But the district does use these rooms as timeout spaces, either by student choice or by staff direction, Terrill confirmed. Often, Terrill said, staff members are positioned outside the rooms, as they would be in a seclusion incident, but the student is typically free to leave the room, which is not the case in a seclusion.
Sometimes, the door is open, or a student can choose to shut the door with a staff member standing outside, she said.
“It can be the same room used if the student was in seclusion,” she said. “But if they’re taking a break because of something that happened, and that’s being used as a break space, the student might continue to work in there until they’re ready to go back to the classroom.”
Like RSU 68 in Dover-Foxcroft, districts across Maine also use seclusion rooms as quiet spaces, according to Ben Jones, a former Disability Rights Maine attorney who now works for Lives in the Balance.
“I think it’s actually more the rare case that the school is like, ‘We’re going to build this room and we’re going to call it the seclusion room, and it’s going to be used just for seclusion,’” he said.
If a student has voluntarily shut themselves in the seclusion room with a staff member outside and is free to go at any time, it would not count as seclusion under Maine law, he said. But if staff members ask students to stay in there to complete their work, as Rose described, whether it would count as a seclusion that districts are required to report to the state is “open to interpretation,” Jones said.
“The overall thing is, the kid is not learning, not in the classroom, in something that could easily turn into seclusion,” he said. “It’s inappropriate at best and potentially illegal if it’s an unrecorded seclusion.”
When are students and staff in “imminent danger”?
Education technicians like Rose — aides who often work with students one-on-one or in small groups — are often the ones handling student outbursts or potential violence, said Greg Kavanaugh, who spent 13 years working as an ed tech and special education teacher in Biddeford, Portland, and Yarmouth.
Ed techs are among the lowest-paid professionals in education, and often the least trained — including on behavior management techniques.
“They’re having to make good decisions about when to restrain, when to seclude, and their judgment is going to be really hard because they’re so stressed, overwhelmed, underpaid,” Kavanaugh said. “That just leads to more mistakes, more lapses in judgment.”
In his experience, Kavanaugh said, restraint and seclusion were consistently treated as last-resort measures — used only in extreme situations.
Staff received training on managing student behavior, they debriefed after restraints and seclusions, and they held regular conversations with parents, he said, which disability rights advocates recommend as best practices.
But working in a functional life skills program with students with moderate to severe disabilities, Kavanaugh said, deciding whether to restrain or seclude a child was never easy despite clear protocols in place. Even when a student threw a laptop across the room or hit him, he had to determine whether the behavior posed an imminent danger of serious injury that would require medical intervention beyond first aid — the standard in Maine law — and only intervene physically if it did. He also had to keep calm if students hit him, he said, because that still did not meet the legal standard.
Every time he did restrain or seclude a child, it stayed with him long after. He said he often questioned whether it had been the right call, thought about how families would respond, and considered the lasting effects the practice might have on the student — and on himself. 
“Anytime there was a hold, a restraint or a seclusion, you’re taking that home, and you’re thinking about that kid when you’re at home, trying to move on with your day,” he said. “I’m a pretty strong-willed person, but there are plenty of times I would quietly be in tears, or going home and having an extra glass of wine, because I’m just not processing it well in the aftermath.”
Other students in the classroom witnessing these incidents are also traumatized, Kavanaugh said. 
“You see the terror on their classmates’ faces, and you feel bad for the kid in a certain way because this is going to hurt their relationships,” he said. 
But talking to parents afterward would always make him feel better, Kavanaugh said, because parents of students with disabilities are often dealing with similar behavior challenges at home.

District response to a parental complaint
Emerson, the parent in Ellsworth, complained to the school board, Superintendent Amy Boles, and the Maine Department of Education in August 2024, alleging that staff members had not met the legal threshold for using restraint and seclusion so often on her son. 
Boles wrote back in October, saying in cases where Emerson’s son was hitting, scratching, and kicking staff, “it is my conclusion that active behavior like this toward another person does create an ‘imminent danger’ that the other person could be sufficiently injured that he or she may need more than ‘routine first aid.’”
“The incident may not in fact have caused an injury requiring that level of care, but a reasonable and prudent person could reasonably conclude that this could occur,” Boles wrote in her letter, reviewed by Maine Morning Star.
But the investigation the district launched in response to Emerson’s complaint found that staff had improperly restrained and secluded her son in at least five of the 18 incidents to which his mother objected. Some incident reports were also vaguely written, Boles wrote, which was the case for the three-hour incident in October 2023 — making it difficult to determine whether restraints and seclusion were warranted. 
Nonetheless, Boles concluded in her letter to Emerson that all staff need training on the proper use of restraint and seclusion, and she agreed the district should rely on the practice less often.
Boles declined to comment on the investigation or specific incidents, but said district staff have undergone an initial training with Lives in the Balance, and followup trainings are planned. 
“Behavior is an issue across the board. I mean, it’s skyrocketing everywhere. It’s not just Ellsworth,” she said. “But we’re working really hard to try to be preventative before it gets to that extreme state, trying to teach staff day-to-day strategies to prevent the behavior before it escalates.”
Emerson said her son is still visibly shaken every time he passes by the school, or even when someone mentions the word “school” around him. 
On April 23, she testified at a public hearing, telling Maine lawmakers restraint and seclusion in public schools must stop. The day before, her son had said he was still afraid to go to school in person. 
“His world has become so small since these events, he rarely leaves our home,” she said. “Everyone continues about their day, and yet I’m left to pick up the pieces.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Health care has proved a vulnerable target for the firehose of cuts and policy changes President Donald Trump ordered in the name of reducing waste and improving efficiency. But most of the impact isn’t as tangible as, say, higher egg prices at the grocery store.
One thing experts from a wide range of fields, from basic science to public health, agree on: The damage will be varied and immense. “It’s exceedingly foolish to cut funding in this way,” said Harold Varmus, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former director of both the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute.
The blaze of cuts have yielded nonsensical and perhaps unintended consequences. Consider instances in which grant funding gets canceled after two years of a three-year project. That means, for example, that $2 million has already been spent but there will be no return on that investment.
Some of the targeted areas are not administration priorities. That includes the abrupt termination of studies on long covid, which afflicts more than 100,000 Americans, and the interruption of work on mRNA vaccines, which hold promise not just in infectious disease but also in treating cancer.
While charitable dollars have flowed in to plug some gaps, “philanthropy cannot replace federal funding,” said Dustin Sposato, communications manager for the Science Philanthropy Alliance, a group that works to boost support from charities for basic science research.
Here are critical ways in which Trump administration cuts — proposed and actual — could affect American health care and, more important, the health of American patients.
Cuts to the National Institutes of Health: The Trump administration has cut $2.3 billion in new grant funding since its term began, as well as terminated existing grants on a wide range of topics — vaccine hesitancy, HIV/AIDS, and covid-19 — that do not align with its priorities. National Institutes of Health grants do have yearly renewal clauses, but it is rare for them to be terminated, experts say. The administration has also cut “training grants” for young scientists to join the NIH.
Why It Matters: The NIH has long been a crucible of basic science research — the kind of work that industry generally does not do. Most pharmaceutical patents have their roots in work done or supported by the NIH, and many scientists at pharmaceutical manufacturers learned their craft at institutions supported by the NIH or at the NIH itself. The termination of some grants will directly affect patients since they involved ongoing clinical studies on a range of conditions, including pediatric cancer, diabetes, and long covid. And, more broadly, cuts in public funding for research could be costly in the longer term as a paucity of new discoveries will mean fewer new products: A 25% cut to public research and development spending would reduce the nation’s economic output by an amount comparable to the decline in gross domestic product during the Great Recession, a new study found.
Cuts to Universities: The Trump administration also tried to deal a harrowing blow — currently blocked by the courts — to scientific research at universities by slashing extra money that accompanies research grants for “indirect costs,” like libraries, lab animal care, support staff, and computer systems.
Why It Matters: Wealthier universities may find the funds to make up for draconian indirect cost cuts. But poorer ones — and many state schools, many of them in red states — will simply stop doing research. A good number of crucial discoveries emerge from these labs. “Medical research is a money-losing proposition,” said one state school dean with former ties to the Ivies. (The dean requested anonymity because his current employer told him he could not speak on the record.) “If you want to shut down research, this will do it, and it will go first at places like the University of Tennessee and the University of Arkansas.” That also means fewer opportunities for students at state universities to become scientists.
Cuts to Public Health: These hits came in many forms. The administration has cut or threatened to cut long-standing block grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; covid-related grants; and grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion activities — which often translated into grants to improve health care for the underserved. Though the covid pandemic has faded, those grants were being used by states to enhance lab capacity to improve detection and surveillance. And they were used to formally train the nation’s public health workforce, many of whom learn on the job.
Why It Matters: Public health officials and researchers were working hard to facilitate a quicker, more thoughtful response to future pandemics, of particular concern as bird flu looms and measles is having a resurgence. Mati Hlatshwayo Davis, the St. Louis health director, had four grants canceled, three in one day. One grant that fell under the covid rubric included programs to help community members make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of hypertension and diabetes — the kind of chronic diseases that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he will focus on fighting. Others paid the salaries of support staff for a wide variety of public health initiatives. “What has been disappointing is that decisions have been made without due diligence,” she said.
Health-Related Impact of Tariffs: Though Trump has exempted prescription drugs from his sweeping tariffs on most imports thus far, he has not ruled out the possibility of imposing such tariffs. “It’s a moving target,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, noting that since high drug prices are already a burden, adding any tax to them is problematic.
Why It Matters: That supposed exemption doesn’t fully insulate American patients from higher costs. About two-thirds of prescription drugs are already manufactured in the U.S. But their raw materials are often imported from China — and those enjoy no tariff exemption. Many basic supplies used in hospitals and doctors’ offices — syringes, surgical drapes, and personal protective equipment — are imported, too. Finally, even if the tariffs somehow don’t themselves magnify the price to purchase ingredients and medical supplies, Americans may suffer: Across-the-board tariffs on such a wide range of products, from steel to clothing, means fewer ships will be crossing the Pacific to make deliveries — and that means delays. “I think there’s an uncomfortably high probability that something breaks in the supply chain and we end up with shortages,” Strain said.
Changes to Medicaid: Trump has vowed to protect Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for Americans with low incomes and disabilities. But House Republicans have eyed the program as a possible source of offsets to help pay for what Trump calls “the big, beautiful bill” — a sweeping piece of budget legislation to extend his 2017 tax cuts. The amount of money GOP leaders have indicated they could squeeze from Medicaid, which now covers about 20% of Americans, has been in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But deep cuts are politically fraught.
To generate some savings, administration officials have at times indicated they are open to at least some tweaks to Medicaid. One idea on the table — work requirements — would require adults on Medicaid to be working or in some kind of job training. (Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid recipients ages 19-64 already work.)
Why It Matters: In 2024 the uninsured rate was 8.2%, near the all-time low, in large part because of the Medicaid expansion under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Critics say work requirements are a backhanded way to slim down the Medicaid rolls, since the paperwork requirements of such programs have proved so onerous that eligible people drop out, causing the uninsured rate to rise. A Congressional Budget Office report estimates that the proposed change would reduce coverage by at least 7.7 million in a decade. This leads to higher rates of uncompensated care, putting vulnerable health care facilities — think rural hospitals — at risk.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”











Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education



Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
Plagued by teacher shortages, some states turn to fast-track credentialing

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)If New Hampshire adopts a law to make it easier to remove books from school libraries, “Nineteen Minutes” by Jodi Picoult could be one of them.
The 2011 novel, set in the fictional Upper Valley New Hampshire town of Sterling, depicts a deadly school shooting committed by a student who was bullied for his sexual orientation. It has been banned in more than 50 school districts; many of those removals were driven by its inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters and themes.
This year, Picoult and other authors are warning that the proposed New Hampshire bill, which is heading to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk, amounts to a book banning bill and should be vetoed. Those pushing for the bill say it is targeted only at obscene content with no educational value. 
“We know from history what the next chapter looks like when we don’t fight book bans, and we know that that is a story that does not end well,” said Picoult at a May 12 press conference hosted by the organization Authors Against Book Bans. On May 15, the Republican-led Senate voted on party lines to advance the bill, House Bill 324, to Ayotte. 
HB 324 would require all New Hampshire school boards to adopt a complaint process that parents could use to object to obscene materials — and potentially remove them. Currently, school districts can choose their own policies for how to allow parents to object to materials. 
Under the proposed law, parents may submit written complaints alleging that a book or other material is obscene. To qualify, the content must appeal “to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,” and depict nudity, sexual acts, or sadomasochistic abuse in a way that is “patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors.”
The material must also lack “serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value for minors,” and be inappropriate to the age group to which it is made available. If it doesn’t meet all four of those requirements, it cannot be removed.
Under the law, the school principal has 10 school days to review the material in the complaint and determine whether it violates the law; if a parent disagrees with that decision, they have 14 calendar days to appeal to the local school board. If the school board also deems the material to be appropriate, a parent can appeal one more time to the State Board of Education, a seven-member panel whose members are appointed by the governor and Executive Council; that board will have the final say on the material. 
The law carries consequences for school districts and teachers who don’t comply with it. School districts can be sued by the state’s attorney general, Department of Education, or any person “claiming to be aggrieved” by the district for not following the law, and educators can face discipline for violating the educator code of conduct.
Rep. Glenn Cordelli, the Tuftonboro Republican who proposed the bill, disagrees that it is meant to ban books. 
“I see it more as a parents’ rights bill for parents to object to materials in some schools,” Cordelli said in an interview Thursday, just before the Senate vote.
Cordelli has read on the House floor passages from some books he says should be removed, including “Here and Queer: A Queer Girl’s Guide to Life,” a 2022 advice book for teenagers, and Speak, an award-winning 1999 young adult book about a high school freshman who is raped.
Both books are present in New Hampshire school district libraries, Cordelli says.
But Picoult and a handful of other authors at the press conference said the excerpts are often taken out of the context of the bigger story that is being told. 
Picoult said she respects a parent’s right to read books themselves before reading them to their kids, something she did too when her children were growing up. 
“But there’s a colossal problem when that parent decides the book isn’t right for anyone’s child,” she said. “These parents will tell you that the books are exposing kids to topics that are salacious or revolutionary. What kids are really being exposed to are lives and mindsets different from their own, which creates compassion and empathy.”
Lara Prescott, the author of the 2019 novel “The Secrets We Kept,” about the CIA’s plot to smuggle Boris Pasternak’s “Dr. Zhivago” out of the U.S.S.R., noted that her book was banned from publication in China due to a love story between two women. 
“It’s hard to believe we’re seeing echoes of that in our own country today: teachers and librarians being criminalized for the books in their classrooms,” Picoult said at the press conference.
She added: “I want my son to grow up exposed to all kinds of stories, perspectives, and voices,” 
Picoult is a plaintiff in a 2024 lawsuit featuring authors challenging a similar law in Florida, and she said if HB 324 were signed in New Hampshire, the state could expect similar litigation. 
The bill touched off heated debate on the Senate floor Thursday. Democrats said the definition went too far and could be used to apply to classic works of literature, such as Shakespeare, which sometimes includes sexual content. And Democrats said the state already has obscenity laws that make it illegal to provide pornographic materials to students; HB 324 is aimed at broader books that feature LGBTQ characters, they alleged. 
Sen. David Watters, of Dover, argued the bill would allow parents who have particular beliefs about LGBTQ students or other political beliefs to remove materials that other parents might be OK with. 
“It violates free speech,” Watters said. “It violates the right of certain parents and their children to have access to materials.”
Republicans said concerns over banning Shakespeare were overblown, pointing to the four criteria that must be met, including that the material has no “literary” or “artistic” value. 
“Shakespeare is there to stay,” said Sen. Daryl Abbas of Salem. “I wasn’t always a fan of Shakespeare, but his books are staying.”
And they said the bill is aimed at obscene material. 
“We’re talking about flat-out pornography and things that if I, as just a regular citizen, handed to a child, I could be arrested for,” said Sen. Victoria Sullivan of Manchester. “And this is why it’s escalated to this point.” 
“All people should be represented. You know, if you want to have a book (with) two moms, two dads, great. But with ‘Gender Queer’ in a second grader school, and it’s got pornographic drawings, and the parents find that, and they go to their school board and they read excerpts from it, that’s a problem,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, of Bedford, referring to a book often removed from school libraries for sexual content. 
The bill will make its way to Ayotte’s desk in the coming weeks. At that point, she can sign it, veto it, or allow it to pass without her signature.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/booksbanningnh-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-05-21 05:03:26.897631

The efforts of North Carolina Republican lawmakers to transform the state Board of Elections into a partisan puppet show continue apace.
First, was the absurd move that placed MAGA state auditor Dave Boliek over the board instead of the Governor.
Then came Boliek’s appointment of a pair of ultra-partisan GOP politicians as board members.
And last week, Republican legislators slipped a provision into the state budget bill that would politicize the board’s professional staff.
The change would allot the board seven new staff positions – all of them political appointees. This represents a huge and troubling shift for an agency in which staff have long been nonpartisan civil servants.
Now, add that the budget gives the board 1.5 million dollars so it can hire private attorneys rather than rely on the state’s nonpartisan civil servant lawyers, and the blatant and disturbing partisanship of the move becomes even clearer.
The bottom line: there is no governmental function for which nonpartisanship is more vitally important than running elections. All North Carolinians should be outraged by these changes.

Ohio Senate Democrats have submitted 423 amendments to the two-year state operating budget — including one removing the $600 million bond package for a new Cleveland Browns stadium in Brook Park, and one to fully fund public schools. 
The Ohio House passed their version of the budget last month and the Senate is currently working on the budget, which Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine must sign into law by June 30.

“This budget steals from our children by defunding public schools, transfers money for health care and libraries to rich benefactors, all the while failing to address the needs of hard working everyday Ohioans,” Senate Minority Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood, said Tuesday during a press conference. 
“This Republican budget prioritizes partisan agendas and handouts to the wealthy and well-connected, also through vouchers, tax breaks, and a stadium giveaway to the tune of more than half a billion dollars, all paid for by the working class,” she said. 
The Senate Democrats had a few different ideas for how $600 million can be spent — a direct shot at how the Ohio House Republicans added a bond package for a new Cleveland Browns stadium for that same amount in their version of the budget.
Republicans hold a 24-9 supermajority in the Ohio Senate, giving Democrats very little power to enact any of their priorities. Nevertheless, Democratic lawmakers laid out their vision of what the state could be doing differently.
The Ohio legislature could restore H2Ohio funding for $121 million, increase library funding to 2.2% for $382 million, offer continuous Medicaid expansion enrollment for $40 million, fund child cancer research for $5 million, and increase funding for food banks for $10 million (which totals to $558 million), Antonio said. 
Or lawmakers could feed all Ohio school children for $574 million and restore mental health support for students for $20 million, Antonio said. 
The legislature could restore the Child Tax Credit for $450 million, increase the Local Government Fund by $598 million, and fairly fund public schools for almost a year for $790 million, Antonio said. 
“If I were queen of the world, all these things would be part of our general fund budget,” she said. 
If $600 million is bonded out for a sports franchise, “Ohioans are still on the hook for that money in the long run,” Antonio said. 
DeWine originally proposed doubling the tax on sports betting from 20% to 40% with proceeds going to fund professional sports stadiums and Ohio youth sports.
“I thought what the governor proposed originally was actually a better way to go because the funds were coming from outside entities,” Antonio said. “It has the whole state in mind, not just one group in one part of the state.” 
She said she would “be much more supportive” of an amendment along those lines. 
School funding 
To fully fund public schools based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan from 2021, schools would need an additional $666 million in funding (more now with inflation), but the proposed budget only gives them about $226 million.
“It breaks the promise we’ve made for our children in public schools by abandoning fully funding the Fair School Funding Plan,” Antonio said.
The Cupp-Paterson Fair School Funding Plan from 2021 was supposed to take six years and was meant to change how public dollars are provided to K-12 schools by giving additional support to local districts so they can rely less on property taxes. 
The first two years were partially fully funded and the second two years were fully funded. There are two more years left. 
“Our caucus has submitted amendments that would fully fund the fair school funding plan,”  Antonio said.
The Senate Democratic amendments would also increase the state minimum teacher salary from $35,000 to $50,000, she said. 
Additional amendments 
Ohio Senate Democrats added an amendment to restore DeWine’s proposed $1,000 child care tax credit and another that would remove the language the Ohio House added to the budget that would make changes to the Ohio Housing Trust Fund. 
The Housing Trust is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas. 
The House budget proposal would remove the requirement for county recorders to send the state Department of Development money to reallocate the funds — something housing advocates say make it less effective across the state.
“Rural areas would also be most impacted by the potential blocks of housing services as well, but all Ohio communities will see service disruption and increases in homelessness and decrease in access to affordable housing,” said Ohio state Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo.  
Ohioans deserve better from the state budget, Antonio said. 
“I think a whole lot of everyday Ohioans are going to be very surprised and have a whole lot of buyer’s remorse when they find out what it is that these people are doing on their behalf,”  Antonio said when asked about the Republican supermajority in the Statehouse.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)There is much discussion in New Hampshire’s General Court regarding public school funding. 
Should the state increase or decrease public funds for education freedom accounts? What is considered an adequately funded education? What are the minimum academic standards of an appropriate public education? Is the current expansion of extended learning opportunities the best use of funds to provide students with career readiness skills?  
These questions deserve much debate at school board meetings and within the General Court. Each question seeks to ensure a strong return on taxpayer investment while equipping students with the skills needed to thrive in the future. A laudable approach for any debate about education. However, there is a flaw in the framework of these questions. Each question predicates its solution as a function of the budget process. It assumes that shifting funding from one solution to another will solve a given educational problem. 
This approach is unlikely to succeed. Regardless of whether funding is increased or reduced at the state and local levels, the deep-rooted generational and technological challenges impacting student learning outcomes will persist.
There are practical solutions that school districts can implement for the 2025-2026 school year to address these challenges and turn the tide on the concerning trends in student learning outcomes. 
Practical solutions for school districts
New Hampshire teachers are keenly aware of the state and nationwide student achievement data. There are downward trends in nearly all empirical categories. Setting aside the debate over whether these data truly reflect student achievement, teachers and parents have valid frustration and concerns about these trends. Much hand-wringing and finger pointing have resulted.
After all, these students are the future guardians of our democratic institutions and habits. We must do better by them. To accomplish this, everyone involved in the educational process has to examine the unique impediments to achievement Generations Z and Alpha (Zers and Alphas) are facing due to the very technology that has defined their generation.
Here are 4 practical, budget-neutral solutions school districts can swiftly implement for the 2025-2026 academic year to combat these impediments. 
1) Districtwide, bell-to-bell cellphone ban
The causal links between teen smartphone usage and higher rates of anxiety, depression, suicide, and the inability to focus have been demonstrated ad nauseam. Any district that truly values its role in nurturing developing minds and supporting youth mental health should implement a full ban from bell to bell — little else should be considered. 
Furthermore, school districts should rethink the amount of technology within the classroom. Zers and Alphas tend to engage with classroom technology — such as Chromebooks, tablets, and gamified tools — using the same unproductive habits they have developed on their personal devices. Consequently, school technology might be creating a similar impediment to learning. 
Consider that during the same period in which schools have rapidly integrated technology into mainstream classrooms, achievement scores have declined. This could be a false correlation, but it still deserves meaningful examination by school districts looking to adopt new technologies. 
2) Professional development examining the unique generational learning challenges of Generations Z and Alpha
When smartphones came on the scene in 2007, they were marketed as community connectors that would allow individuals to build and maintain relationships like never before. Nearly 20 years on we know that this is not the case, especially for developing minds. By offering unparalleled independence, smart technology has drastically isolated its users. 
Students raised in today’s tech-driven environment have missed out on the community-based learning experiences that previous generations once enjoyed. As a result, some have become dependent on screens, while struggling to develop social skills and the resilience needed to navigate challenges.
Resilience is the foundation of learning. To learn, a student must be able to endure the challenges of the unknown. The ease of retreating into a world of carefully curated, pleasurable content at the slightest difficulty has hindered students from building resilience. Every teacher, parent, and school administrator should read Jonathan Haidt’s “The Anxious Generation” to examine the causes of this technological rewiring of young minds in the face of challenges.
3) Committee to examine benefits of low-supervision, unstructured recess for all grades
Since the late 1990s there has been a precipitous drop in the amount of time children have spent at play. Specifically, low-supervision, risky, unstructured play. Think of the type of play seen in “The Sandlot.” In stark contrast, parents have opted for the more physically safe environment of indoor, tech-driven entertainment. 
In this environment, young minds are exposed to all of the negative effects of smart technology and social media. Moreover, they miss out on the developmentally necessary skills learned from play. Playing with peers in a low-supervision, knee-skinning fashion, is an evolutionary process by which developing minds learn resilience, independence, problem-solving, creativity, and peer-pruned habits. Play is the biological mechanism by which we learn to moderate our behaviors within a group.
Every New Hampshire school district should establish a committee to examine the behavioral benefits of student-led recess, where peers can moderate each other in an unstructured block of time. Developing children are more likely to follow and critique the behavioral examples of their peers instead of heeding the advice of an adult. Read any study on the intersection of conformity bias and prestige bias in adolescents and you will find this to be the case.
Perhaps the solution to the rise in conduct issues in schools lies not so much with adults implementing Social Emotional Learning programs, but in the natural habits formed and extinguished through peer interactions.
4) Immediately develop acceptable use policies for AI
Artificial intelligence — in the form of Large Language Models — is the single most significant development in education since the invention of the pencil. Over two years into this technological leap, less than half of teachers and schools have engaged in intensive AI training.
This lack of urgency to train teachers is shockingly inadequate. Shocking because school districts have failed to train teachers on a game-changing tech that could meet the needs of all learners. More shocking because it is a willful abdication of a school district’s responsibility to understand how AI will change the academic and behavioral habits of their students. 
There are an abundance of articles considering the pros and cons of AI within the classroom. School districts should carefully consider both sides of this argument to develop an acceptable use model that meets the needs of its learning community. 
Policies that permit excessive reliance on AI by students risk diminishing their capacity for independent and critical thinking. Conversely, school districts that adopt an abstinence-only approach to AI fail to recognize its growing significance in education and the social lives of their students. 
School districts must act swiftly to establish these policies in light of upcoming federal legislation that could impose a 10-year freeze on state-level AI regulation.
 The 2025-2026 school year

Writing about his trip to America in the early 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville opined that “[a]mong democratic nations, each new generation is a new people.” Each generation in a democracy needs to take ownership of the development of its habits. Habits that will go on to inform the tone and tenor of democratic life. An entire generation is forming its habits around technology that could have devastating or beneficial consequences for American democracy. It is up to everyone within the public education community to help nudge them toward the beneficial outcome. 
If social psychologist Jean Twenge is correct about technology’s role in delineating generations, then a simple debate about educational funding is not enough to correct the problems facing education in New Hampshire. Practical solutions that address the habits being formed in Generations Z and Alpha by technology must lead the discussion of trends seen in student achievement.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/kidsbackpacks-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 05:03:26.897631

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)More than a dozen members of Ohio’s state legislature signed on to a letter with 500 other lawmakers across the nation asking Congress to push back against efforts to reduce or eliminate budget funding that would go to Planned Parenthood health clinics.
The letter, sent to U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate and House Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, lays out support of Planned Parenthood specifically as a provider for 2 million patients per year of “essential, preventive, reproductive health care,” according to the letter.
“We write in support of the millions of patients who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers,” the letter states. “‘Defunding’ Planned Parenthood blocks patients from getting the care they need and increases health care costs for everyone.”
The letter, organized by the State Innovation Exchange’s Reproductive Freedom Leadership Council, comes as congressional budget reconciliation is ongoing, when U.S. legislators decide the funding priorities for the country, under which the Trump administration has attempted to push cuts to areas such as health care. This includes funding to Medicaid, the program that provides health care and services to low-income households, covering things like health screenings and vaccines.
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

The state budget also stands to cut Medicaid funding, in a way that’s triggered by changes to funding at the federal level. The House proposal of the state operating budget would eliminate Group VIII, the state’s Medicaid expansion group, if federal funding for Medicaid dips below 90%. That would leave nearly 770,000 without medical coverage, forcing them to seek other options, like emergency rooms, for care, or even skip or delay care all together.
In the letter, the lawmakers state that a majority of Planned Parenthood patients “rely on Medicaid and other federal and state programs to access care,” and that 64% of the organization’s health centers are in rural of “medically underserved” communities.
“Without Planned Parenthood, many patients would have nowhere to turn for care,” according to the legislators.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio has reported 43% of their patients are covered by Medicaid. Cuts are causing concern for many of the leaders of the organization’s regional arms, who are stressing the effects that funding cuts could have not only on abortion services, but also infant mortality and maternal mortality programs, and health care overall.
“The reality is that stripping Medicaid reimbursements from providers who also provide abortion will do very little to stop abortion services,” said Nan Whaley, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region, in a statement on Tuesday. “Medicaid does not fund abortion care. What it will impact is access to critical preventive services like birth control, cancer screenings, wellness exams, STI testing and treatment, and more, leaving millions of folks in need and at risk.”
Cuts on the federal side also include freezes to Title X funding, which is federal funding historically directed at clinics who “have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and preventive health services,” according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
The Trump administration has frozen $65 million in grants to “family planning services” clinics in April as they look to broad cuts to federal spending overall.
In Ohio, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio received $1.98 million in grants in 2024 from the Title X pot. The Ohio Department of Health also received grant funding, obtaining $7 million that year. The department received similar amounts in the previous two years of grant funding as well.
The state legislators who signed on to the letter were:

While energy prices are set to jump this summer, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law that could provide some relief — eliminating a subsidy from the scandal-ridden Ohio House Bill 6 that requires ratepayers to fund unprofitable coal plants. As this happens, utility companies are moving to increase consumers’ bills.
Back in 2019, Former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder took and funneled $61 million worth of bribes in exchange for legislation to give utility company FirstEnergy a $1 billion bailout, named H.B. 6, all at ratepayers’ expense.
In March 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme that left four men guilty and two dead.
In late June that year, federal judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges got five years for his role in the scheme, but most importantly, he attempted to bribe Tyler Fehrman, an FBI whistleblower, with $15,000 to help kill a repeal effort he was working on. On video, Borges told Fehrman that if he told anyone about the bribe, he would “blow up” his house.
While some of H.B. 6 was overturned already, ratepayers have been paying a subsidy that funds two Ohio Valley Electric Corporation coal plants — one in Southern Ohio and one in Indiana. The main beneficiaries for OVEC are American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy and AES Ohio. Still, FirstEnergy collects payment for it.
But with the swipe of a pen — consumers will likely see their bills go down. DeWine signed a massive energy overhaul bill, H.B. 15, on Friday. It repeals the OVEC charges.
A study commissioned by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association found that in 2024 alone, these subsidies cost ratepayers roughly $200 million. The company lost more than $100 million the same year, so consumers are paying for plants that aren’t profitable.
Consumers can expect to save between $1.30 and $1.50 per month, depending on their utility provider, according to the Energy News Network.
The subsidies may not seem like a lot every month, but they add up when inflation is high and people struggle.
“It makes a difference, especially in today’s day and age with a kind of shaky economy and folks trying to just make ends meet,” Fehrman said.
While this will save citizens a bit of money, Householder attorney Scott Pullins argues that this will hurt the rural areas it serves.
“They are major high-paying jobs in the area, and the kind of area where there aren’t very many high-paying jobs,” Pullins said about the plant jobs. “They generate a whole boatload of taxes for schools in those areas. And if those plants get shut down, it’s going to be devastating for those communities.”
The Ohio plant employs many Ohioans, he added. But now, this may embolden utility companies to ask for more rate hikes, he said. This is already happening.
“Our electric grid needs to be modernized,” Pullins said. “I’m assuming that those are where those costs are going. I think we do need a robust regulatory scheme to make sure these companies aren’t wasting these funds.”
FirstEnergy is now petitioning the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to raise its prices — a $190 million increase in its charges.
If approved, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel estimated that Cleveland Illuminating Company consumers will see a $13 price increase per month, Ohio Edison will have a $3 spike, and Toledo Edison at $1.50.
On Monday, DeWine said he doesn’t have an opinion on the price increases.
“As far as the raising of bills, ultimately, as you know, this is up to the PUCO,” he said.
Fehrman said this shouldn’t be allowed.
“There is this massive scandal where these companies tried to put a larger burden on the backs of every single Ohioan,” he said. “And now, they’re asking for more money in a time when folks are already struggling.”
The bill will go into effect in 90 days.

URBANA, OHIO — Oaks and Sprouts, Tonni and Graham Oberly’s family farm, got the email from the Ohio Association of Foodbanks just after five o’clock on the first Friday in March.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, had notified the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services that it was ending a program that gave state, tribal and territorial governments federal dollars to stock food pantries from farms within a 400-mile radius. The Ohio Association of Foodbanks, in turn, shared the notice with the more than 150 farms that supplied the state’s food pantries with fresh produce, meat and dairy. One of them was Oaks and Sprouts, whose younger and diverse owners are just the type of growers the USDA’s Local Food Purchase Assistance program aimed to connect to food-insecure Americans.
Last growing season, Oaks and Sprouts had a contract worth up to $25,000 with the program, a significant amount for the small farm. The produce made its way to food pantries in nearby Springfield and Dayton and, from there, to the Ohioans who rely on them to feed themselves and their families. For Tonni Oberly, a trained doula with a background in public health, joining that distribution chain connected her work at the farm to the focus of the city and urban planning doctorate she had recently completed: how place impacts the health of Black mothers and children.
“Food is such an important part of that — access to food in your neighborhood, access to healthy food, the affordability of food — how food impacts our maternal and child health outcomes is really crucial,” Tonni explained on a crisp April day as she and Graham walked through the hoop house where they were germinating seeds for spring planting.


The federal program had also allowed the Oberlys to diversify their farm’s revenue stream beyond the traditional sales to restaurants and at farmer’s markets. It had given them a measure of predictability as they built a regenerative farm on land previously cultivated by Graham’s aunt and uncle and, before that, his grandparents.
“We can plant seeds and know that they’re sold, versus with the farmer’s markets, you plant and you hope people buy it — or even selling to restaurants, they don’t preorder months ahead of time,” Graham explained as he and Tonni stood on the  acre of land where they grow garlic, tomatoes, patty pan squash and lettuce varietals that include romaine, butterhead and salanova.
The Oberlys estimate that they were able to hire two of their four seasonal employees last year because of their contract with the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, known as LFPA. They try to pay a good wage for the work — $17 an hour. That’s a decent amount for a place like rural Champaign County, where the median household income is about $20,000 less than nationally and the poverty rate is just over 10 percent. The farm’s goal, they explained, was to grow food in a way that is good for the land, their employees and their customers. Tonni named Oaks and Sprouts for a passage of scripture in Isaiah: “They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.” It is a metaphor for living a righteous life.

The email from the Ohio Association of Foodbanks landed as Oaks and Sprouts was in the thick of planning for its fifth growing season — the third in which the Oberlys planned on participating in the LFPA program. It attached a USDA notice saying that the Trump administration had “determined this agreement no longer effectuates agency priorities and that termination of the award is appropriate.” After the current contract year closes on June 30, the LFPA program, which authorized $900 million worth of locally raised healthy foods for anti-hunger organizations, would end.
Created by the Biden administration in 2021, the Local Food Purchase Assistance program was at once an attempt to support small local farms and an acknowledgement that one of the most direct ways to bring healthy food to hunger-vulnerable populations is to buy it from underserved farmers nearby.
But a USDA press release announcing its creation featured words like “equity” and “climate,” targets of President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency in their efforts to root out so-called “woke” federal programs. Even before Trump took office, the Oberlys’ program coordinator with Ohio CAN (Community + Agriculture + Nutrition), as LFPA is branded in this midwestern state, had warned them that its renewal could be in jeopardy.
Still, Oaks and Sprouts, like the vast majority of the farms participating in Ohio CAN, began planning for the 2025 growing season. There were reasons to be hopeful. For starters, while the Local Food Purchase Assistance program was part of the Biden administration’s broader COVID-19 relief effort, its funding stream was first used for direct food purchases during Trump’s first term. Ohio CAN, like many state-level local food purchase programs, is also widely popular. Independent experts who analyzed its first year in the Republican-led state concluded that it was a “success by any measure.”

Trump’s picks to lead key federal agencies in his current term also seemed to be working in the program’s favor. Take Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. One of the first things she did upon confirmation was to send state, local and tribal governments a letter that outlined her “vision for the Department’s 16 nutrition programs,” including a commitment to “create new opportunities to connect America’s farmers to nutrition assistance programs.”
Then there’s Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former environmental lawyer, the figurehead of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement and an outspoken critic of processed foods. One of his top priorities is encouraging states to prohibit the more than 40 million low-income Americans participating in the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from using benefits to purchase soda and candy; so far this year, more than a dozen states have been considering such legislation. Many experts say a more effective way to encourage healthier eating is to improve access to fresh foods, exactly the type that LFPA farms were producing and selling to food pantries.
More than 1.3 million Ohioans participated in SNAP during fiscal year 2024, or about 12 percent of the state’s population, according to a Center of Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of USDA data. While the majority of SNAP recipients are White, Black Ohioans are overrepresented when compared to the overall state population. An anonymous survey by the Ohio Association of Foodbanks showed that more than 40 percent of people who visited emergency food distribution centers in 2023 had at least one household member under the age of 18 and nearly as many reported living in a household with someone who is disabled.

The country’s safety net to prevent hunger is a complicated web of federal programs. Most are housed within the USDA and many are jointly administered by federal and state governments. These include SNAP, previously known as food stamps; the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC; school meal programs; Meals on Wheels, focused on seniors; commodities purchases for food banks; and the Local Food Purchase Assistance program that Tonni and Graham Oberly’s farm participated in.
Pulling on the thread of one program puts tension on the others. For example, once a family exhausts their SNAP benefits for the month, they may rely on one of the country’s more than 60,000 food pantries and emergency meal centers to feed themselves. As the USDA is ending programs like the LFPA, Congress is looking at other food assistance programs to find the $1.7 trillion in savings over the next decade needed to renew Trump’s 2017 tax package, which primarily benefited corporations and the wealthy.
The confluence of cuts and changes, coming as more Americans than ever rely on government help for food, has hunger-relief advocates worried the safety net will unravel.
Congress has proposed changes to SNAP that include recalibrating the formula used to calculate benefits, adding work requirements for some parents and forcing states to take on a larger portion of the funding. Rollins, for her part, sent a letter to states in April reminding them that it is ultimately the USDA that has the authority to grant their requests to waive the time limit on able-bodied adults receiving SNAP benefits unless they meet work requirements.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration also ordered states to hand over SNAP recipients’ personal data, including their Social Security numbers, addresses and, in at least one state, citizenship status, National Public Radio reported. The directive came amid the administration’s broader push to amass Americans’ personal data and target immigrants.
Though people in the country illegally are not eligible for SNAP benefits, their U.S. citizen children might be. Last month, USDA directed states to enhance identity and immigration status verification as part of Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, even though there is no evidence that immigrants are improperly participating in the program at significant levels. Advocates worry that in the current climate, using the SNAP program to collect participants’ data could have a chilling effect on seeking food assistance.
The USDA also recently paused $500 million from a separate program that buys large quantities of food from farmers for food pantries, with food banks in Ohio, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and elsewhere losing millions of dollars worth of shipments as a result. When the administration ended the LFPA, it also terminated a $660 million program that linked local farms to schools and child care centers.
The changes and uncertainty are coming at what Vince Hall, the head of government relations for Feeding America, the nationwide foodbank network, called an already “very precarious moment for food banks because there’s no resiliency left in the system.”
“They’re stretched to the breaking point. They are serving unprecedented high demand, the highest in over a decade. They are dealing with a decline in donation revenue from the pandemic highs that has been quite steep. The decline of financial donations from the pandemic highs, combined with some of the highest — in fact, record — levels of demand at food distributions has just stretched them to the breaking point,” Hall said.
“If we have policy adjustments that disqualify people from the SNAP program, or if we have a recession and unemployment goes up, or if we have a series of natural disasters, there are any number of things that can work to increase demand, and the food banks just aren’t ready,” he added.
In an emailed statement, a USDA spokesperson noted that as of mid-May, states still had $246 million in unspent LFPA funds. “The secretary encourages states to utilize these dollars for schools, charitable feeding organizations, and other programs that serve those in need,” the statement said.
Alabama has exhausted its funds; Ohio had about $435,000 left from $26.6 million allocated; just $1,500 remained in Tennessee’s coffers, according to an official tally.
The spokesperson added: “On any given day, the Department issues more than $405 million worth of nutrition benefits across its 16 nutrition programs. There is no need for new programs, but perhaps more efficient and effective use of current.” These are not reassuring words to many of the program’s participating farmers and food pantry operators, whose best-case-scenario path forward is for the program to be revived under the administration’s own branding.
Ohio food banks are serving more people than ever, budget would maintain funding at 2019 levels

Graham and Tonni Oberly had to pivot quickly.
After they received the email from the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, they secured a spot for this season in a farmer’s market in Dayton that is larger than the one where they used to sell their produce nearby. They are adding cut flowers to their lineup and growing Chinese Cabbage for the first time, while also trying to expand the number of local restaurants to which they sell what they grow.
But the modicum of predictability that the Local Food Purchase Assistance program gave this new farm for the past two seasons — the USDA considers farmers and ranchers “beginning” for their first decade and eligible for special assistance — will be gone this year. As will the direct line for Oaks and Sprouts to help address food insecurity in their own community.
Graham Oberly grew up on the Ohio-West Virginia border in a family that fought mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia, earned a degree in natural resources management and worked as a sustainability coordinator for The Ohio State University before moving into farming.
Oaks and Sprouts is a marriage of the Oberlys’ passions. The regenerative farm is a way for Graham to tend the land of his ancestors and preserve it for future generations. With the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, the farm was also a way that Tonni could expand her work caring for Black mothers and children.
More than 47 million Americans — including one in five children — are considered food insecure, meaning they do not have enough food to eat or access to healthy foods. Rural Americans are more likely to face hunger due to lack of transportation, lower wages and racial discrimination. The highest rates of food insecurity are among Indigenous and Black Americans, according to a Feeding America analysis, with Black children twice as likely as White children to face hunger. USDA research also shows that households with children headed by a single mother are more likely to be food insecure. And food-insecure women are more likely to be obese than food-insecure men or children, with all of the related health issues, in part because they prioritize providing healthy foods for their children instead of themselves, according to the Food Research & Action Center.
In Ohio, the food insecurity rate is slightly higher than the national average. In 2023, Ohioans visited the state’s food banks 14.7 million times, up more than a third over the year before. Ohioans are eligible for food bank use if their household is at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level — and more than a quarter in the state qualify, or about 3.4 million people. Of the 43 percent who were also receiving SNAP benefits, nearly all of them — 93.4 percent — reported exhausting those benefits within the first three weeks of the month, according to the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-era stimulus package provided direct assistance to taxpayers, $350 billion for state and local governments, and $130 billion to help safely reopen schools, among other provisions. The plan also earmarked $1 billion for USDA programs to build capacity in the country’s food-banking system amid unprecedented need and global supply chain disruptions.
Half of that money went to additional purchases via The Emergency Food Assistance Program — and that is the $500 million canceled by Trump’s USDA in March. Another $400 million was slated for what became the Local Food Purchase Assistance program. Biden’s USDA renewed both pandemic-era programs due to their popularity.
While more than 90 percent of all U.S. farms qualify as “small,” with gross cash annual farm incomes of $250,000 or less, they account for just 17 percent of the total value of food produced in the country, according to USDA statistics. Still, they play a critical role in diversifying the overall food ecosystem by supplying produce, dairy and meat that are not available from large-scale agribusiness. Many grow a variety of crops instead of focusing on one or two. Since they are often serving their own communities, they are less vulnerable to disruptions to complex global supply chains.
In 1973, as global demand for U.S. farm exports exploded, Earl Butz, the agriculture secretary under Republican President Richard Nixon, told American farmers to “get big or get out.” Farmers mostly listened. In the years since, while the number of farm acres has remained roughly constant, the number of farms has continued to decline. When Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary under Biden, released data from the 2022 Census of Agriculture, he noted that in over five years, the country had lost 142,000 farms — a roughly 7 percent decline. “As a country, are we okay with losing that many farms? … Or is there a better way?” Vilsack asked.
The Local Food Purchase Assistance program was an acknowledgement that one of the most direct ways to bring healthy food to hunger-vulnerable populations was to buy it from underserved farmers nearby. More than 95 percent of American farmers are White. They are also older — the average age of a U.S. farmer is just over 58, according to USDA statistics — and predominantly male; women make up only 36 percent of farm operators. Under Vilsack, who also served for the entirety of Democratic President Barack Obama’s two terms, agriculture policy aimed to address the decline in small farms by extending credit and other types of support to people historically less likely to farm — namely women and people of color.
White men’s dominance over U.S. farming is not happenstance. It’s the result of more than 200 years of official government policy that reflects the fraught relationships the country has with race and land.
In the 1830s, the U.S. government forcibly relocated thousands of Indigenous Americans from their ancestral lands in the east, where they had cultivated for generations, to a different climate in the west. Thousands of them died from disease, starvation, exhaustion and exposure to the elements during a brutal journey that came to be known as the Trail of Tears. In the 1860s, in the waning months of the U.S. Civil War, General William Sherman pledged that when the Union won, formerly enslaved Black people, who had farmed for White enslavers, would be eligible to receive 40 acres and a mule to farm their own land. President Andrew Johnson reversed course after he took office, returning the land to White people.
People of color — and women — struggled to access credit, including via the USDA, to buy the land and equipment needed to start even a small farm in the decades of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, throughout the Civil Rights and feminist movements, and into the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2010, the USDA paid settlements in three class actions brought on behalf of Black, Latinx and Indigenous peoples — Pigford v. Glickman, Garcia v. Vilsack and Keepseagle v. Vilsack — arguing that the agency had discriminated against them when they sought loans and other assistance. In 2022, Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act created a $2.2 billion fund to compensate farmers and ranchers who experienced past discrimination, including women.
The federal judge in the Pigford case, Paul L. Friedman, noted that “[a]s the Department of Agriculture has grown, the number of African American farmers has declined dramatically,” and the USDA and “the county commissioners to whom it has delegated so much power bear much of the responsibility for this dramatic decline.”
“The Department itself has recognized that there has always been a disconnect between what President Lincoln envisioned as ‘the people’s department,’ serving all of the people, and the widespread belief that the Department is ‘the last plantation,’ a department ‘perceived as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices,’” Friedman wrote.
This history — and a tacit recognition of the role USDA played via its discriminatory practices — underpinned the ethos of the Local Food Purchase Assistance program.
In its first year in Ohio, the program bought from 164 growers. A majority of them were classified as “socially disadvantaged,” which for the LFPA, the USDA defined as women; Black, Indigenous and other people of color; LGBTQ+ people; veterans; and small, emerging and disabled farmers. That year, nearly 12,000 pounds of grains, 223,000 pounds of dairy and milk, 39,000 pounds of eggs and more than 2.5 million pounds of produce that these farmers produced went into the state’s food pantries. The more than $9 million worth of food was distributed via five hubs and 12 regional food banks, according to a report independent researchers produced for the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
The researchers noted: “Overall, producers were drawn to participate in the Ohio CAN program because sharing high quality products with communities in need was often central to their core mission and personal values.” A farmer called the program a “godsend” and said they felt like they were on the “front lines of food insecurity and food instability.” One foodbank representative in a historically redlined area, where banks discriminated against residents of certain neighborhoods because of their race and ethnicity, said it was the first time a farmer had offered them okra and they hoped “we’ll be able to work more closely with her to get larger, larger quantities in next year.”
The USDA’s decisions to end the Local Food Purchase Assistance program and to cancel planned commodities purchases for food banks have not been popular. The Iowa Farmers Union helped small farms facing lost contracts send press releases about the impact. Singer-songwriter Willie Nelson, a founder of the annual Farm Aid concert, penned an open letter to farmers encouraging them to protest the cuts. Food bank administrators from Oregon to Maryland to Florida have warned it will stress their ability to meet still-historic demand that has not diminished since the pandemic.
There have also been public spats between Trump’s USDA and Democratic governors like Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, who accused the agency of reneging on a three-year deal; Rollins said he didn’t have his facts right and was “trying to make this a political issue.”
For the Oberlys in Ohio, the politics are personal. Their five-year-old farm was just starting to be woven into the constellation of state and federal programs that fed food-insecure neighbors while giving Oaks and Sprouts a toehold in a precarious industry that employs one in eight Ohioans, either directly or indirectly, and generates billions in the state each year.
The end of the Local Food Purchase Assistance program severed the Oberlys’ direct path to care for the people in their community, along with their land. Or as Tonni Oberly put it: “Supporting the local food system is one of the best ways to support the local economy, it supports farmers and community members — it’s a win-win.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-20-at-12.15.06 PM.png,,,2025-05-21 05:03:26.897631

I struggle daily to respond when my young clients ask how one person can use an entire country and its resources to punish people they do not like. Why isn’t someone doing something to stop them? In their minds, it’s as simple as saying no. But in reality, it is much more complicated, and I am ashamed to say that I have no answers.
“@realDonaldTrump
Happy Easter to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting and scheming so hard to bring Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, the Mentally Insane, and well known MS-13 Gang Members and Wife Beaters, back into our Country.”
Just to be clear, for anyone who has been living in complete isolation, without any technology or access to the outside world, this represents bullying.
“Happy Easter also to the WEAK and INEFFECTIVE Judges and Law Enforcement Officials who are allowing this sinister attack on our Nation to continue, an attack so violent that it will never be forgotten! Sleepy Joe Biden purposefully allowed Millions of CRIMINALS to enter our Country, totally unvetted and unchecked, through an Open Borders Policy that will go down in history as the single most calamitous act ever perpetrated upon America.” 
This is known as fearmongering.
“He was, by far, our WORST and most Incompetent President, a man who had absolutely no idea what he was doing — But to him, and to the person that ran and manipulated the Auto Pen (perhaps our REAL President!), and to all of the people who CHEATED in the 2020 Presidential Election in order to get this highly destructive Moron Elected, I wish you, with great love, sincerity, and affection, a very Happy Easter!!!”
And this represents gaslighting — or lying, depending on your state of mind. Less in your face than fearmongering, but if you were to wager that mental or emotional harm was intentionally inflicted upon others, you would most definitely win.
Bullying can escalate to the point that others turn a blind eye, observe with indifference, or become willing participants to avoid becoming victims themselves. This psychological thriller style relationship has no scripted ending because only the bully knows his or her next move. So, everyone, regardless of their role as a bystander, participant, or a victim, walks on eggshells.
Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski was candid in her profession of fear of retaliation for criticizing the current administration. She added that many of her colleagues share her fears. When the legislative branch of the United States becomes ineffective due to threats of retaliation from the executive branch, and the judicial branch is targeted for fulfilling its duties, we are beyond a constitutional crisis. How did we get here?
As Americans, we are taught in elementary school that our democracy uses a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch from taking over the country. For all intents and purposes, it has worked. Despite the differing beliefs of political leaders, protections afforded by the Constitution have held our rights as citizens firmly in place because that is what they were intended to do. Our judicial system has been the reinforcer, the logic standing firmly against one individual’s will becoming the law of the land. Until now.
Having worked with clients who feared reporting abusive and bullying behavior out of fear of retaliation, I have used my position as an advocate to right those wrongs. I did not use bullying or fearmongering to urge a response. Instead, I reminded them of others of their obligation to protect my clients, and the consequences for failing to follow through.
That conversation was enough to change the situation and my client to receive the response they needed.
I know, it sounded like bullying. It wasn’t. As a social worker, I have an ethical obligation “to promote the well-being of clients.” Promotion comes in the form of elevating the voice of the client while respecting the values, principles, and standards of my profession. In other words, not calling people out with aggressive words or threats. Rather, calling them into discussions by seeking understanding that holds people accountable and prevents “domination, exploitation, and discrimination.”
Yes, these conversations can be challenging, especially in the current political climate. To those on the other side of the facts, it can feel threatening. As I have said, words matter in how they are used. Let us be clear that asking for an understanding of the disconnect that exists between policy or rules, and the behavior of those bound by said policies or rules, is not bullying.
It is called accountability. And it is the responsibility of every individual in our state and this great country we call America.
Accountability has a way of pressing upon people to do the right thing when applied appropriately. Or not.
Righteous indignation, the far, far distant cousin of accountability, is often used to justify beliefs that harm basic human rights. The abuse of righteous indignation is what usurps the protections afforded by the Constitution through bullying, fearmongering and gaslighting. It has become second nature to many being held accountable for the current state of our country. We cannot and should not allow it to scare us into silence.
Zora Neale Hurston said: “If you are silent about your pain, they’ll kill you and say you enjoyed it.”
Several years ago, I witnessed a politician being questioned about his obligation to represent the best interests of Kansans who elected him, not ideology or ego. The politician attempted to distract from the question and was cut short by the constituent, who was there for something more substantial. A word salad would not suffice. The politician was reminded that Kansans have an obligation to respond when our political leaders choose not to operate with fairness and integrity.
The issues facing Kansans, and many other Americans, are not partisan. They are human issues. We must resist the temptation to label every demand for justice as an attack, every plea for accountability as aggression and every call for reform as a threat to tradition. The truth is, accountability is not partisan, it is patriotic. It affirms our shared belief that democracy only works when power is checked, voices are heard and leaders remember who they serve.
Kansans deserve more than manufactured outrage. We deserve action rooted in integrity, transparency and care for basic human rights. If speaking up for the vulnerable is seen as radical, then we will be radically committed to truth. If holding political leaders to their promises is seen as confrontational, then we will confront injustice with an unwavering resolve.
Our state, our communities, and our future depend on it.

Did it disappear or was it just tossed into the trash can of history?
We all might be asking these questions if a current ultra-right-wing movement to call a National Constitutional Convention succeeds.
A movement is afoot by organizations like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the Convention of States and the Heritage Foundation — author of Project 2025, a sweeping proposal to remake the U.S. government in support of right-wing beliefs.
The concept is simple and scary. President Donald Trump and ultraconservative brain trusts want all of Project 2025 enacted into law or embedded in the U.S. Constitution. Whatever can’t be delivered by Trump, Congress or the U. S. Supreme Court, they believe, should be added to the constitution by a convention of the states dominated by MAGA delegates.
We have not had a constitutional convention since the original group met in 1787, but convention proponents say a new convention is long overdue.
Let’s say this is a back-up position for ultraconservatives if Trump doesn’t succeed, but a real possibility nonetheless.
The process to call a constitutional convention is outlined in Article V of the U.S. Constitution. It says that if two-thirds of the state legislatures request a convention Congress must create one. That means that 34 states must request the convention.
However, Article V does not specifically outline how a convention would work and what, if any limits, are placed on a convention once it begins. This means that there is potential for a convention to rewrite the whole constitution and to toss out current amendments that delegates may find repugnant — such as the First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and religion.
The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful search and seizure may also be on the chopping block along with Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and due process, Sixth Amendment rights to a fair and public trial with a right to counsel, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection under the law.
Strengthening presidential powers certainly would be a convention agenda item.
Many states are calling for a convention limited to certain issues like placing fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting the powers and jurisdiction of the federal government, and imposing term limits on certain government officials and members of Congress.

However, constitutional experts say that once a convention is called, all bets are off. Delegates would not be limited to specific issues — the delegates could do whatever they wish and create whatever kind of constitution they desire.
Any new constitution or amendment would then need to be approved by three-quarters of the states, or 38.
Does all this sound farfetched and like the rantings of an alarmist?
It’s not.
Some 28 state legislatures are currently controlled by Republicans, 18 are headed by Democrats and four are split, according to the New York Times. In the 2024 presidential election, Trump won the popular vote in 31 states compared to 19 by Harris. That means more Republican state legislatures following the presidential vote.
“In all, Republicans have proven much more adept than Democrats at leveraging presidential vote patterns into even larger majorities in state legislative chambers. The GOP has achieved significant levels of excess seats in about three times as many states as the Democrats have,” according to a study by the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.
 Is Ohio next?

So far, 19 states have called for a constitutional convention: Georgia, Alaska, Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Indiana, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, North Dakota, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Utah, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Nebraska, West Virginia, and South Carolina.
Ohio is attempting to add to that total. In February 2025, joint resolution bills were introduced in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate calling for a national constitutional convention.
Ohio House Joint Resolution 2 is sponsored by state Reps. Riordan McClain, R-Upper Sandusky, and Bernie Willis, R-Springfield. The bill has been assigned to the House Government Oversight Committee and the Committee has already heard testimony from the resolution’s sponsors.
An accompanying bill, House Bill 67 also has been introduced setting the parameters of Ohio delegate actions at such a convention. If passed, the effectiveness of this bill would be questionable, given Article V’s open-ended approach to a convention.
Ohio Senate Joint Resolution 3 is sponsored by state Sens. Michele Reynolds, R-3, and George Lang, R-4, and has been assigned to the Senate General Government Committee.
To date, the committee has had two hearings: one for the sponsors and one for 11 proponents of the resolution. Many were from the Convention of States, including former Pennsylvania senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum.
Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R–2, and Jane Timken, R–29, introduced Senate Joint Resolution 6, which restricts the call for a convention to discussion of term limits. That resolution also is assigned to the Senate’s General Government Committee.
The activist group Common Cause in Ohio is actively opposing the pending legislation.
“Delegates to the proposed Constitutional Convention will be approved by concurrent resolution of the state legislature or by a majority of those present and voting in a joint session of the Ohio General Assembly. Since the GOP has a supermajority in the state legislature, that means delegates would be chosen and approved by this single party,” Common Cause writes.
In a call to action, Common Cause warned: “If a Constitutional Convention were convened, unelected and unaccountable delegates would have the power to rewrite the U.S. Constitution with no checks or balances. This is an unprecedented risky endeavor that puts our democratic principles at great risk.”
 Lawsuit alternative

However, another line of thinking is that this kerfuffle over 34 states asking for a convention won’t be necessary.
In March, ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network teamed with Wisconsin Watch to uncover a “behind-the-scenes legal effort” to force Congress to call for a constitutional convention now, without further state action.
A draft lawsuit, being circulated among certain friendly state attorneys general, claims the 34-state threshold was, in fact, reached in 1979 and therefore, Congress must call for a convention.
The litigation proponents total state “calls for a convention” from before the Bill of Rights was passed to the present. They have stacked them all together and say that the magic number of 34 was reached 45 years ago.
The pro-litigants claim that once a state asks for a convention it cannot repeal the request. Several states have tried but not successfully, according to the proponents.
“The draft lawsuit says those actions don’t count because once the Article V bell has been rung, it cannot be unrung,” says the ProPublica article.
The Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation and ALEC support the draft litigation that is signed by Charles “Chuck” Cooper, a high-powered conservative attorney.
The lawsuit is being circulated among conservative state attorneys general; proponents hope that the litigation will be filed within a few months.
Meanwhile, other constitutional convention advocates are hoping the Trump and GOP congressional leaders will agree to call a constitutional convention without the litigation to promote Trump’s “Make America Great” agenda even further.
 Conclusion

None of this will happen overnight, but the movement for a national constitutional convention is advancing in state legislatures (like Ohio’s) with advocacy groups, and with far-right litigators at a speed greater than ever before.
It is worth understanding, watching, and monitoring.
Now is the perfect-storm moment for a convention, with Trump in the White House, a super-conservative majority on the U. S. Supreme Court, GOP in control of both houses of Congress and most state legislatures.
A convention is the backup plan for getting all of Project 2025 enacted and entrenched into the “new” constitution — but don’t believe for a second that the concept is on the back burner.

Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside US House tax bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

John McCosh/Georgia RecorderBy most common measures, the life of Adriana Smith ended three months ago, when a tragic series of undiagnosed blood clots left her brain dead, with no hope of recovery. Yet today, in a hospital room in Midtown Atlanta, Adriana’s body is still being kept alive by machines, without regard to her family’s wishes.
As someone who has been there, I know how difficult and extremely personal that decision can be, but I can only imagine what it must be like to have that choice stripped away, as it has been stripped away from Adriana’s loved ones by people who don’t know them, who know little of their circumstances and deal with none of its consequences. 
In Adriana’s case, she was nine weeks pregnant at the time the blood clots hit, which under some readings of Georgia law has meant that what remains of Adriana’s body is now under government control under the fetus can be safely extracted.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” April Newkirk, Adriana’s mother, told 11Alive News. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there.”
Doctors and lawyers at Emory Healthcare – but mainly the lawyers, I suspect – say that under Georgia’s anti-abortion law, they are required to keep Adriana’s body functioning as the fetus inside her develops. They are erring on the side of caution – not medical caution, but legal caution. 
The law in question is the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act.” or the LIFE Act.
  Sen. Ed Setzler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The main sponsor of that law, state Sen. Ed Setzler, R-Acworth, says it’s working as intended in this case.
“I’m proud that the hospital recognizes the full value of the small human life living inside of this regrettably dying young mother,” Setzler told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Mindful of the agony of this young mother’s family, the wisdom of modern medical science to be able to save the life of a healthy unborn child is something that I trust in future years will lead to great joy, with this child having a chance to grow into vibrant adulthood.”
Proud as he might be, Setzler isn’t the one who has to watch what’s left of his daughter lay lifeless in that hospital room, not alive exactly, with machines performing basic life functions, week after week. He isn’t the one who has to explain what’s happening to his seven-year-old grandson, Adriana’s son. If the fetus survives, he also isn’t the one who will have to raise the child. Doctors have warned Adriana’s family that the fetus has fluid on its brain, with unknown consequences.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson,” Newkirk said. “But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. “This decision should’ve been left to us.”
According to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, however, Emory Healthcare and Setzler are misreading the legislation.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” his office said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”
Carr’s reading of the law seems to be correct. As his statement indicates, the law defines abortion as “the act of using, prescribing, or administering any instrument, substance, device, or other means with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” and the withdrawal of extraordinary life-maintenance measures on a brain-dead woman would not fall within its restrictions.
But this is the problem when you try to write a law into black and white, when you try to legislate what is right and what is wrong when dealing with decisions that are so personal, so intimate. Moral certainty sounds good, it may feel good, it may play well in a political campaign, but it cannot possibly make such hard choices from a distance. The law cannot act more wisely or with more love than would those who know the situation best.

,California,2025-05-21 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Congress debates two issues with big implications for California: EVs and taxes,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/electric-vehicle-waiver-taxes-congress/,Two of the most contentious issues awaiting votes in Congress would have particularly heavy impacts on California.,"Four months into Donald Trump’s second presidency, Republican legislative leaders are attempting to give him some major victories. Two of the most contentious issues now awaiting votes would have particularly heavy impacts on California.
One pending measure would cancel, or at least try to cancel, California’s long-standing waiver of federal clean air rules that allows the state to impose tighter restrictions on emissions. More specifically, legislation that passed the House of Representatives — with support from several dozen Democrats — is pending in the Senate and would undermine California’s decree that no new gasoline-powered cars could be sold in the state after 2035.
Another issue is whether a $10,000 cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal tax returns, passed in 2017 during Trump’s first stint as president, will remain in force, be repealed or be altered.
It has the effect of raising federal levies on taxpayers in states with high income tax rates, such as California, and is seen by leaders of those states as punitive. When the cap was enacted, California tax authorities estimated that it would cost Californians another $12 billion a year.
When the House voted a few weeks ago to cancel California’s Clean Air Act waiver — and those of other states that have followed its lead — Gov. Gavin Newsom cried foul, contending that the action illegally invoked the Congressional Review Act.
“Trump Republicans are hellbent on making California smoggy again,” Newsom said in a statement. “Clean air didn’t used to be political. In fact, we can thank Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon for our decades-old authority to clean our air.
“The only thing that’s changed is that big polluters and the right-wing propaganda machine have succeeded in buying off the Republican Party — and now the House is using a tactic that the Senate’s own parliamentarian has said is lawless.”
During his first presidency, Trump tried to cancel California’s waiver but failed. The nation’s automakers, although displeased by the 2035 decree, didn’t back Trump’s move.
That was then and this is now. Sales of zero emission vehicles, which were booming a few years ago, have flattened. California had contended that 35% of new vehicle sales in California would be zero emission cars by 2025, but purchases seem to be stuck at about 25%. Major automakers, such as General Motors, now contend that the 2035 mandate is unrealistic.
On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that the chamber would soon vote on the waiver, indicating that he has the votes, and it could garner support from some Democrats, as it did in the House. Its passage probably would touch off a legal battle.
The aforementioned deductibility of state and local taxes, dubbed SALT by the issue’s political warriors, is less settled.
“The SALT deduction has become an outsize stumbling block for Republicans trying to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal that would extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and roll back subsidies for clean energy, among other things,” the New York Times reported last week.
“A group of Republican House members, mostly from New York, New Jersey and California, have vowed to vote no on the package unless the cap, which helped pay for the 2017 cuts and expires this year, is raised or abolished. And even among the holdouts, there is dissension — something that drew attention … during a Republican caucus meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson.”
The issue cuts across party lines, pitting legislators from the most affected states against mostly red states that are largely unaffected. While Trump apparently wants to keep the $10,000 cap, the possibility of raising it, perhaps to $30,000, is kicking around. The issue remains deadlocked.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/022724_EV-Chargers-LA_CC_CM_29.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-21 04:00:58.223911

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderAdvocates are bracing for potential cuts to Georgia’s safety net programs under the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” moving through Congress, though it remains to be seen what changes to programs like Medicaid will end up in the final version. 
As is, the federal measure would cut more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. The savings would go toward extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. 
The U.S. House of Representatives could vote on the bill this week, though as of late Tuesday Republicans had not yet rallied behind the current version. 
Even though the bill appears to be designed to chip away at Medicaid’s expansion under the Affordable Care Act, advocates and others say states like Georgia that did not fully expand Medicaid could still feel the effects of the cuts.
In Georgia, the program covers about 2.2 million people, mostly providing health care coverage and services for children, older Georgians and people with disabilities. In recent years, the program was slightly expanded to include adults who complete 80 hours of work, job training, education or community service every month.
D’Arcy Robb, executive director of the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, said Tuesday that she is not worried about funding for Medicaid-funded services that are considered mandatory, like for care in a nursing home.
But Robb said she is concerned about Medicaid services that are considered optional, such as funding for home and community based services that are designed to keep people with disabilities out of nursing homes. There are already about 8,000 people in Georgia waiting to receive those services, with state lawmakers funding 150 new waivers this year.
“We can’t afford to lose any money. We’re already scraping the bone, and we’re already seeing families that are going to extreme means to support their loved ones,” Robb said.
These waiver programs took a hit during the Great Recession, with Georgia joining all other states in scaling back services to help balance their budgets. Robb is fearing a repeat if a big cut to Medicaid makes it into the final bill.
“I’m not trying to imply that states are going to cut services to people with developmental disabilities because they want to. I don’t think anybody wants that,” Robb said.
“But the reality is the states have to balance their budgets, and history has shown us that when Medicaid takes a big cut on the national level, states have to cut somewhere. One of the places they can cut is waivers,” she said.
As proposed, the bill also includes provisions that would hurt children who are covered by Medicaid, says Callan Wells, senior health policy manager with GEEARS: Georgia Early Education Alliance for Ready Students. About 42% of Georgia children are enrolled in Medicaid.
One proposed change in the bill that has flown under the radar would scale back “retroactive coverage” from three months to one, Wells said.
“This could lead to significant medical debt, especially for families of children with disabilities,” she said. “These children often receive costly care for months before their families learn about and apply for Medicaid. Without full retroactive coverage, families may be left responsible for those early expenses. For many, this coverage is a crucial financial safeguard.”
‘I want to work’
The proposed cuts come at a time when some Georgia GOP leaders had begun to soften their staunch resistance to full Medicaid expansion, though a measure floated this year that had support from a few rural Republicans quickly fizzled.
Natalie Crawford, executive director of Georgia First, a bipartisan advocacy group, urged congressional leaders to rethink sweeping changes that would reduce federal investment in Medicaid. 
Georgia First held a press conference this week with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network to push back against the bill’s reductions to Medicaid spending.
“These proposals could limit access to care and roll back the progress we’ve made in reducing cancer disparities,” said Fabienne Antoine-Nasser, the society’s Georgia government relations director.
Crawford said the bill would also likely worsen the state’s already high uninsured rate. Georgia is tied with Oklahoma for the second highest uninsured rate in the country.
“Fueling the momentum behind such reforms is a trap of divisive rhetoric, misinformation and fear mongering that clouds the understanding of what this program is really delivering for states and who is really benefiting from the safety net,” Crawford said. 
“Despite what influential voices may try to convince you is true, Medicaid is not covering mostly able-bodied men who don’t want to work,” she said. 
Instead, Crawford said the program should be there to help people like Alton Fry, a Franklin County stone mason who was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year. Fry is caught in what is known as the coverage gap, meaning he makes too much for Medicaid and but too little to afford private health insurance.
Fry said he racked up about $37,000 in medical debt in just about half a year before he started receiving donations through a GoFundMe page. He said he is undergoing radiation treatment, which he says is not the most effective treatment for him but it is more affordable than surgery. 
“I want to work. I don’t want to live off the government,” Fry said. “All I’m asking for is temporary help to get me over this hump in life, and it wasn’t there, and it’s not there.” 
The GOP measure would impose a work requirement on Medicaid recipients starting in 2029. The 90% federal match for states that expand Medicaid, though, would remain intact.
Some far-right Republicans, including Georgia Congressman Andrew Clyde of Athens, are pushing for deeper cuts to Medicaid.
Georgia Congressman Buddy Carter, a Pooler Republican, recently defended the proposed changes to Medicaid while on the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Politically Georgia podcast. Carter argued the proposals would help stabilize the program for the most vulnerable.
“You shouldn’t have an able-bodied person who could be doing some type of work – it even includes volunteer work – that is on that program,” said Carter, who is a U.S. Senate candidate. “That’s not who it was intended for, and that’s not who we should be using it for. So, there are all kinds of things that we can do to find savings without kicking anyone off.”

Wes Moore (D) signed 181 bills into law Tuesday, including two that one supporter called “the most substantive energy affordability package that Maryland has seen in several decades.” It came just days before steep rate hikes are set to take effect. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)Days after vetoing an energy-focused bill backed by General Assembly leadership, Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed two others into law Tuesday.
The larger of the two bills, called the Next Generation Energy Act, aims to increase in-state power generation and battery energy storage, while curtailing costs for consumers by limiting how utilities can spend ratepayer dollars.
The second bill, the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, creates uniform siting standards for commercial solar farms in Maryland, in some cases overruling local jurisdictions that had sought to restrict the farms with zoning rules.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the bills make up “the most substantive energy affordability package that Maryland has seen in several decades.” But the new measures come less than two weeks before an expected June rate hike hits.
Prices for Baltimore Gas and Electric customers are estimated to jump $16 per month, and customers of other utilities could see similar increases, according to a report from the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, which represents ratepayers in the state.
The People’s Counsel in April asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to intervene, an appeal echoed in a letter Tuesday signed by 87 Maryland legislators. Their letter argued that the energy auction last year that sparked this summer’s rate hike was flawed.
Ferguson, for whom energy policy was a focus this past session, said that sky-high energy bills over the winter months were a “wake-up call” that spurred the legislature to action.
“We know that older coal plants and oil plants are being retired based on private action, and we have not built up enough alternative energy to fill it fast enough. And so the General Assembly had to act this year,” Ferguson said.

He sponsored the Next Generation Energy Act, which was focused on power generation but became the vehicle for a number of energy proposals, on everything from trash incineration to natural gas infrastructure spending.
The law also pulls about $200 million from a state fund that collects payments from electricity suppliers who cannot meet the state’s renewable energy mandates and redirects the money to refunds for ratepayers. The rebate will average about $80 per household, split between two payments: one this summer and the second in the winter months.
Legislators push back against June rate hike
Some officials, including Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, blame multi-state electric grid operator PJM Interconnection for the coming rate hikes. They say that when PJM held a capacity auction last year, it did not include the power expected to be generated by two fossil fuel powered plants it was requiring to stay open, driving prices at auction higher.
Not only will ratepayers pay the high auction prices for power, they will also pay a premium to keep the two Talen Energy plants — Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner — operating. PJM has already pledged to change its auction policies to prevent a similar situation in the future.
In the meantime, Lapp in April petitioned FERC to reject the cost increases for ratepayers.  On Tuesday, the 87  legislators joined the chorus, urging FERC to reject the costs as “unjust and unreasonable.” The Maryland Public Service Commission also backed Lapp, filing its own comments with FERC on Tuesday.
“Without Commission action, customers still will be stuck paying ‘twice’ as a result of last summer’s auction,” the lawmakers’ letter said. “The Commission must act expeditiously to acknowledge and remedy the problems.”
Lawmakers also called on FERC to “protect Maryland customers from having to pay for windfall profits — far above the costs of service — to Talen to keep its Baltimore-area plants online.” Their letter said the two plants could keep running at a cost of $97 million, but consumers will be charged $180 million.
Ballot referendum campaign is a question mark
Last week, a group calling itself the Maryland Environment Labor and Industry Coalition filed as a ballot issue committee with the state, indicating it intended to challenge the Next Generation bill via referendum. But a representative for the group said that was looking unlikely after Tuesday’s signing ceremony.

“I would bet that they will not go forward with the referendum, and instead work closely with the governor and legislature to promote responsible environmental and labor-friendly laws,” said Doug Gansler, the state’s Maryland attorney general.
He said the group is still reviewing its options. But with no public outreach campaign, and just 11 days to collect the first 20,000 petition signatures from verified Maryland voters, he said the challenge may just be too great.
The group, which has Montgomery County ties, seemed poised to focus on part of the Next Generation Act that would end a “renewable energy” subsidy for trash incinerators that produce power. The state’s two such incinerators are in Baltimore City and Montgomery County.
The solar energy bill signed Tuesday by Moore has also garnered criticism, particularly from Republican legislators representing the rural Eastern Shore, who argued that the policy would make it easier for solar companies to gobble up productive farmland.
But it was perhaps the least controversial bill of the package that found itself the target of a Moore veto Friday: A bill creating a “Strategic Energy Planning Office,” funded by an existing process that also fuels the Public Service Commission and Office of People’s Counsel.
Moore’s veto, citing the cost of establishing the office, surprised sponsor Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery).
“I look forward to better understanding his rationale and will work with leadership in the Legislature to determine next steps,” Hester said in a statement to Maryland Matters Friday.
Next Generation bill gets praise amid controversy
In a statement Tuesday, Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at the consumer advocacy group Maryland PIRG, said the bill made “groundbreaking pro-consumer changes to utility regulation.”
“By prioritizing safety over gas system expansion and reining in wasteful spending by BGE and other Maryland utilities, this new law can save Marylanders hundreds of millions of dollars,” Scarr wrote.
Lapp agreed.

“Maximizing the legislation’s potential benefits will depend on lots of work at the Public Service Commission,” Lapp said. “We look forward to using the new tools to slow or prevent further rate increases.”
Environmental groups were more mixed in their responses to the Next Generation bill. Many were troubled by its potential to expedite a new natural gas power plant in Maryland, including by fast-tracking new facilities on the site of retired power plants. But amendments lessened the blow, and added environmental priorities — like beefing up energy storage and cutting funding for incineration.
The Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, now known as MAREC Action, an industry group representing utility-scale developers of wind and solar, as well as battery energy storage, applauded the bill’s power storage provisions in a statement Tuesday.
“With this legislation, our industry will invest in Maryland, deliver reliable energy resources needed to keep the lights on, and stabilize prices for Maryland ratepayers,” said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action.
The bill calls for two procurement periods, beginning in 2026, when the Maryland Public Service Commission will seek to bring  800 megawatts of energy storage in each period to the state.
Currently, the multistate electric grid that includes Maryland only hosts 375 megawatts of storage, which MAREC said “pales in comparison” to other states such as California and Texas. If Maryland follows through with the procurements, it would be positioned as an “energy storage leader” within the 13-state PJM region, according to the industry group’s news release.
The purchases could work quickly to fill gaps in Maryland’s electric grid, by storing energy for use during peak times, Vaughan said.
“Governor Moore and legislative leaders acted quickly and decisively to ensure Maryland maximizes its energy storage resources,” Vaughan wrote. “These resources meet energy reliability needs more quickly than any other resource.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0147-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 03:01:15.440471

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Family, loved ones and colleagues of Davis Martinez gathered in Annapolis Tuesday for a bittersweet occasion – to witness the signing of a law named to honor the slain parole agent’s memory by boosting protections for state workers.
“His family and his loved ones turned that pain into purpose,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said before signing the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act. “They came to Annapolis to advocate the legislation that would help ensure what happened [to Martinez] would never happen again.”
It was just one of 181 bill signed into law Tuesday in the final bill signing session after a challenging 2025 legislative session. The measures ranged from the mundane to the major — the fiscal 2026 budget — and included moments of personal reflection from House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and pure elation from long-suffering advocates finally seeing victory.
Martinez became the first parole agent killed in the line of duty when he was brutally slain on the morning of May 31, 2024, while making a routine check on a parolee at a home in Silver Spring.
Martinez’s supervisors did not check on him until well into the evening, after coworkers noticed him missing and expressed concern for his well-being. Police found Martinez dead with multiple stab wounds at the home of the parolee, Emanuel Edward Sewell, who was arrested a day later in West Virginia and has since been charged with first-degree murder in Martinez’s death.
Martinez’s family and labor unions called on the legislature to boost protections for state employees in the wake of the killing, which led to Senate Bill 26 and House Bill 176, which passed with unanimous approval. The legislation, now law, will provide better oversight of state workplaces and create a unit within the Division of Labor and Industry focused on public employee safety and health.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Martinez represents thousands of Maryland’s “dedicated state workers that show up to work every single day to serve others.”
“We are so deeply sorry for your loss, and we hope that this piece of legislation … is one small step to honor your loved one’s memory,” he told Martinez’s family.

Tuesday’s bill signing began with Moore and legislative leadership looking back on a legislative session filled with challenges – including a multibillion-dollar budget deficit and rapid-fire policy changes at the federal level. In spite of those challenges, Moore signed House Speaker Adrienne Jones’ (D-Baltimore County) bill combining several current state offices to create a new Department of Social and Economic Mobility.
Jones believes that her legislation House Bill 1253 runs “in stark contrast” to the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“When we say social and economic mobility, let’s be very clear on what we’re talking about,” Jones said Tuesday. “We’re talking about the strength of our diversity. We’re talking about promoting equity and we’re talking about creating inclusion in all spaces. I’m not afraid to say it.”
She noted that the bill was personal for her as a Black woman.
“I’ve walked on to an unleveled playing field. I’ve been kept out of rooms, meetings and buildings solely because of my race and gender,” she said. “We’ve come a long way since these times … and I refuse to let us go back today.”
Jones extended that promise to Maryland’s immigrant community, much of whome feel unsafe from the Trump administration’s increased deportation efforts on undocumented immigrants.
She highlighted House Bill 1222, which directs the Maryland Attorney General to develop guidelines that clarify how officials at “sensitive locations” — which include public schools, places of worship, courthouses, hospitals and similar locations — should interact with federal immigration enforcement agents.
“The fear felt in Maryland’s immigrant communities is real right now,” Jones said. “Marylanders should feel safe while seeking medical care, pursing education and going to church … But as we see the suspension of the process and as we see a continued erosion of basic human dignity in our immigrant communities, we know this work is far from over.”
The Tuesday bill signing also included the approval of the 2026 budget and a dense energy package, two heavily debated topics over the legislative session. But despite the weighty topics, there were also some moments of celebration during the event.

Longtime health care advocate Vincent DeMarco celebrated the governor’s signature on House Bill 424 and Senate Bill 357, which will expand the authority of the state’s current Prescription Drug Affordability Board to help bring prescription drug costs down for all Marylanders. Currently, the board only looks at the cost of drugs for state employee health plans.
During the bill signing, Moore gave a shout-out to DeMarco as someone who “has been a champion for affordable health care for decades.”
DeMarco later said he was “ecstatic” about the board’s expansion.
Moore also signed off on one of his priority bills, to reform the state’s procurement process – a topic that he admitted was “not sexy” but is “absolutely essential in delivering economic growth and building pathways to work, wages and wealth.”
House Bill 500 reworks several parts of the state’s procurement laws to support more minority-owned businesses and veteran-owned businesses, increase oversight of procurements, along with other changes.
Moore said that the bills signed Tuesday were reflective of the hard work the legislature, his administration and advocates put into the bills during the challenging 2025 session.
“We had to be nimble in the face of uncertainty and be courageous in the face of chaos,” Moore said. “If there is one thing we’re able to prove in this session is this: That in Maryland, we can look at challenge squarely in the face and refuse to blink.”

Wes Moore hands a pen he used to sign the state's $67 billion budget for fiscal 2026 to House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s $67 billion spending plan, which includes more than $1.6 billion in taxes and fees, was signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Wes Moore (D), capping what he called a session of challenges and chaos.
The signing ceremony, the fourth and final scheduled event, caps a difficult 90-day legislative session. The budget package — three bills — were part of a tranche of 181 bills signed into law Tuesday by Moore.
In opening remarks, Moore said his third legislative session “wasn’t just … a legislative season of challenge, it was also a season of change, where the obstacles that we’re up against did not change from month to month or from week to week. We all saw they were changing from day to day.”
Lawmakers entered the session needing to resolve an immediate $3.3 billion structural budget deficit projected for fiscal 2026. A similar sized gap was projected for the following year. By fiscal 2030, that gap was projected to widen to more than $6 billion.
The effort was complicated when President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term on Jan. 20. The Republican immediately set about slashing federal spending and employment.
A March report by Moody’s, a major bond rating agency, named Maryland the state most at risk for fiscal problems. A key concern is the large number of federal workers, contractors and grants that underpin the state’s economy, targets of Trump’s cutting, according to the company.

Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) described the session as “by far the most challenging one that I certainly have experienced in my 15 years. And it continues to be incredibly difficult because of the uncertainty that we see and the volatility that’s coming out of Washington.”
The budget plan reflected that chaos as much as any other piece of legislation this year.
“We had to be nimble in the face of this uncertainty and be courageous in the face of chaos,” Moore said. “This was not just about balancing a budget, it was about weathering two very distinct and individual storms, a financial crisis and a fiscal crisis and a new White House that is determined to attack our economy. ”
Those near-daily adjustments pushed the timeline on finalizing a spending plan deep into the 90-day session. The work blew through legislative deadlines.
None of the work, however, guarantees the legislature will not have to return before January to make more budget changes.
The final $67 billion plan, which includes all funding sources including federal aid, is 1% larger than the current year budget.
The general fund budget weighs in about $400 million lower than the current year. The general fund budget represents the spending plan for which the state directly taxes Maryland residents. As part of the effort, Moore said he and lawmakers agreed on $2 billion in budget cuts. But in addition to actual reduced spending, the cuts also include holding vacant positions open, shifting costs to local governments and backfilling by transferring cash from special accounts.
Even so, the Democratic supermajority passed a spending plan that includes more than $1.6 billion in taxes and fees. Included in that is a 3% tech tax that is projected to raise $500 million.
In addition to two new higher-income tax brackets, there is some small tax relief. Moore and lawmakers said 92% of taxpayers will see a refund — $50-$65 on average — or no increase in their income taxes.
Moore signs two energy bills as June rate hikes loom

Republicans said there was little to celebrate, given all the other tax and fee increases approved by the legislature.
“Let’s be very clear — today’s bill signing wasn’t a celebration of tax relief, it was the final approval of a growing list of new taxes,” said Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore). “The Governor has now made permanent the tax-and-spend culture that’s already driving people and businesses out of Maryland.”
Moore last week used his line-item veto power to reject two provisions within the spending plan that were tied to separate bills he vetoed, among nearly two dozen dumped by the governor late Friday afternoon. If lawmakers want to overturn the budget vetoes, they will have to return to Annapolis before the end of June.
The work, however, did not prevent Moody’s from downgrading its rating of the state’s creditworthiness from its treasured Aaa rating to Aa1. It’s the first time the state has not held Moody’s highest rating since 1973.
Moore, Ferguson, House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) and others blamed the downgrade on Trump, but the rating firm raised concerns a year ago about the state’s fiscal situation.

For the first time since its birth as one of the good-government reforms after Watergate, the appointment of the executive director of the State Elections Enforcement Commission would be subject to the approval of the legislators whose campaign finances are overseen by the agency.
The bill passed 34-1 after a brief debate, with the sole dissenting vote cast by Sen. Mae Flexer, D-Windham. She did not enter the Senate chamber during the debate or roll call and voted remotely from elsewhere in the Capitol complex, as allowed by legislative rules. 
Unlike previous efforts to put the elections watchdog on a tighter leash, Senate Bill 1405 is the result of negotiations by the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate and House. The bill now goes to the House for expected passage. Gov. Ned Lamont has yet to say if he will sign the bill.
SEEC, as the elections commission is known, enforces elections and campaign finance laws and administers the Citizens’ Elections Program that was created 10 years ago as an anti-corruption measure. It provides public financing of campaigns once candidates raise qualifying contributions.
The bill would limit SEEC’s post-election audits on publicly financed candidates to no more than 20% of campaigns, rather than the 50% now allowed, and bar the commission from issuing declaratory rulings and formal written guidance in the six months before elections.
As originally drafted, the bill would have given the General Assembly the ability to review and reject the formal guidance the commission often publishes. 
An amendment drafted and adopted Tuesday gives the four legislative caucus leaders the right to review any guidance document that exceeds 40 pages before publication and also allows a hearing on such documents.
The five-member State Elections Enforcement Commission, whose members are appointed by the governor and four legislative caucus leaders, would lose its status as the sole authority to hire and fire the agency’s leader, the executive director and general counsel.

Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, praised the bill as a “delicate balance.” Credit: mark pazniokas
Under the bill, the commission’s choice for the job would be subject to a confirmation hearing and vote by the legislature’s Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, the panel that bottled up the reappointment of the state’s top utilities regulator until the governor agreed to appoint one of the committee members and a former lawmaker to the regulatory authority.
Confirmation also would require a majority vote of the House and Senate.
In a letter signed by all five members, the commission warned against the change.
“[H]aving an executive director appointed and evaluated by the very people regulated by our campaign finance laws will create the perception that elections enforcement is partisan,” they wrote. “This, in turn, will have the consequence of undermining public confidence in campaign finance enforcement.”
The League of Women Voters also urged rejection of the bill, saying the independence of SEEC is crucial to ensuring fair elections and transparency in campaign finances.
“It is not a moment to muck around with the institutions that safeguard free and fair elections. It is not a time to loosen accountability and transparency on how campaigns are financed, or how government funds are used,” the League wrote.
Tom Swan of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, part of the coalition that helped pass public financing 10 years ago, said, “This is a blatant power grab by the legislature, and we will urge the House to amend it to restore the integrity of SEEC and protect the CEP.”
Passage comes at a time of transition for the commission. Its former general counsel and executive director, Michael J. Brandi, took early retirement after 12 years in the job in late 2024 due to poor health. Clare Kindall, the former solicitor general of Connecticut, is the interim director and counsel.
Kindall, an applicant for the permanent job, acknowledged shortcomings at SEEC but questioned the scope and timing of the legislation.
“The Citizens’ Election Program is kind of the crown jewel of Connecticut democracy. I mean, it has made such a huge difference in Connecticut, as far as elections and people’s abilities to run and to keep elections clean,” she said. “And given what’s happened nationally, is anybody reading the room?”
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, who is the co-chair of the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, said in an interview before the debate that he would quiz any nominee for the SEEC job as to their approach and philosophy.
“How they view the role of the agency versus what’s in the law versus what they think otherwise,” Duff said. “How do they view things? Are they there to assist and help, or are they there in a different mechanism?”
Duff objected to lobbying on the bill and other elections measures by Kindall and her predecessor as agency overreach.
On and off the Senate floor, leaders of both parties described the legislation as reflecting grievances about the aggressive efforts at times to verify the legitimacy of qualifying contributions for public financing and a slow and occasionally inconsistent review process of grant applications.
“Sometimes it’s like walking through mud, and I think that’s what frustrates me,” Duff said. “We had an instance where SEEC literally knocked on the doors of people in a community that gave $5 donations to make sure they were real. They harassed some of my own $5 contributors.”
To qualify for public financing, candidates need contributions ranging from $5 to $250. A certain percentage must be in the communities in a legislator’s district. Donors must sign a form attesting to their identity, residence and employer. The commission was slow to approve grant applications in 2024.
Like Duff, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said the frustrations with SEEC have been cumulative.
“This is something that has been problematic, and I think it’s getting in the way of good government,” Harding said. “It’s getting in the way of democracy in action and allowing candidates to get grants, allowing candidates to run their campaigns effectively and efficiently. And so I think this has gone beyond frustration. This is at a point, frankly, where this is getting in the way of elections.”
The legislative leaders eased passage by creating a new committee, the Government Oversight Committee, which originated the bill, bypassing the Government Administration and Elections Committee that is co-chaired by Flexer and formerly handled all elections-related bills.
Flexer was visited in her office immediately before the debate by Duff, Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, and the Senate Democratic caucus’s chief of staff, Courtney Cullinan. Flexer said later she shared her misgivings about the bill.

“I think the bill just went too far, and organizations like the League of Women Voters and Common Cause outweigh the bipartisan and bicameral support. I’m going to vote with them,” she said.
Gadkar-Wilcox, a law professor elected last fall, is co-chair of the oversight committee that produced the bill. On the floor, she was joined by Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, the ranking Republican on the committee, praising the bill as making necessary changes while maintaining a degree of independence.
“I think this bill strikes that balance,” she said.
“I think we found the delicate balance where we’re making good policy to keep the mission of the SEEC intact, but we’re also making reforms that I think will be beneficial to candidates going forward and making sure that our system is fair and is just,” Sampson said.
Gadkar-Wilson, Sampson, Harding and Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, were the only lawmakers to speak on the floor.
Looney called public financing a success but said SEEC is in need of reform.
“We all know that treasurers often find it very frustrating to operate in dealing with SEEC in terms of the procedures they have to go through during the course of the campaign,” Looney said. “We know there have been many times where information has been provided and then seek claims that they’ve never received. It has to be provided all over again.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7538-1024x783.jpeg,,,2025-05-21 02:00:35.887042

March 3, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal seeking to help implement Nebraska’s voter-approved medical cannabis laws failed Tuesday, facing a tougher floor fight than four years ago despite widespread support in November.
The latest measure, Legislative Bill 677, failed to garner the 33 votes needed to shut off a filibuster, with the bipartisan effort to stop debate falling 23-22. The regulatory push secured the support of eight Republicans, 14 Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive in the officially nonpartisan 49-member body (State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, the only other Democrat, was absent from the final vote but had supported the bill).
Republican State Sens. John Arch of La Vista, Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Merv Riepe of Ralston declined to take a position and were “present, not voting.”

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, a Republican with a Libertarian bent who sponsored LB 677, sought to appeal to his conservative colleagues that “on a limb,” everyone could agree that medical cannabis could at least help someone.
“If that’s the case, you believe in medical cannabis, and that’s OK,” Hansen said. “I know sometimes that scares some of us.”
Freshman State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender was one Republican who heeded Hansen’s call.
“I would hope, and hope’s not a plan, but I do have faith in this body, I would expect intelligent people with good hearts, which I believe this body is, can find a way to provide relief with some medical marijuana,” Meyer said.
The other six Republicans joining Hansen and Meyer were State Sens. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Myron Dorn of Adams, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, Jana Hughes of Seward and Dave Wordekemper of Fremont.
But at the end of the day, Gov. Jim Pillen, Attorney General Mike Hilgers and Nebraska’s junior U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., Pillen’s predecessor, prevailed in their public calls against passing LB 677, peeling off enough Republican senators to stop the bill.
Voters legalized medical cannabis with 71% approval in November, for up to 5 ounces of cannabis with a physician’s recommendation. A separate regulatory law secured 67% approval.
‘We can always come back’
Leading the charge against LB 677 was freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who echoed the calls of Hilgers and Ricketts that legislation wasn’t needed to help implement the state’s new medical cannabis laws.

Storm and multiple Republicans said the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which voters created and charged with “exclusive” regulatory authority, should be left to act on its own first, without legislative changes.
“If we have any issues, we can always come back as a body and tweak those issues, not jump off the cliff,” Storm said of Hansen’s LB 677 and an accompanying amendment.
He added: “I don’t want anybody to think that I’m some cold-hearted monster here that does not have sympathy for children and adults that are suffering through pain. But we have to get this right.”
The hesitation also came as Hilgers’ office continues challenging whether the ballot measures were properly placed on the 2024 ballot and an expected future state-led challenge arguing the voter-approved laws violate federal law. The AG’s Office was in court earlier Tuesday asking for a citizen-led lawsuit alleging the same legal challenge to be tossed so Hilgers’ staff can sue.
Hilgers also organized opposition to LB 677 from 53 sheriffs, including the Nebraska Sheriffs Association, and the Police Chiefs Association of Nebraska.

‘Let’s help shape it’
State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, a mental health practitioner, said cannabis would not “leap off the shelves” and corrupt Nebraska youth, as some opponents contended. He said senators sometimes needed to go outside and “touch some grass and just think about what the world is like outside of this room.”
“Let’s not get too concerned about ‘fighting against the will of the people,’” Fredrickson said. “Let’s help shape it. Let’s help put in the right guardrails in place, and let’s help build a system that we can be proud of and puts our patients first.”
Hansen said a strong regulatory system could also save lives from over-reliance on opioids, which State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island echoed.

Quick said he thought medical cannabis might one day be able to help his son who has struggled with opioid, drug and alcohol addiction for about 25 years. In that time, Quick said he and his wife have administered life-saving meds to reverse overdoses. 
“I think this is an important bill that could help a lot of people, and we need to take that into consideration in what we’re doing,” Quick said.
State Sens. Megan Hunt and Dunixi Guereca, both of Omaha, said opponents also needed to grow up and embrace the modern acceptance of medical cannabis.
“The 1990s have called, and they want their ‘Reefer Madness’ back,” Guereca said. “It is the year of our Lord 2025. Medical marijuana is not controversial.”
‘The will of the people’
Multiple opponents targeted Democrats for their support of LB 677 but opposition to other measures this year to water down voter-approved laws related to paid sick leave and minimum wage. In those cases, 32 of 33 Republicans support changing what voters approved, including Hansen. State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln is the lone Democrat in favor of the sick leave and minimum wage changes, and she proposed the minimum wage tweaks.
“This bill’s unnecessary, inappropriate, undermines the will of the people and implements recreational marijuana,” State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said.

Hansen and State Sens. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and George Dungan of Lincoln repeatedly pushed back and noted that backers of the medical cannabis ballot measure asked for LB 677, unlike supporters of the sick leave and minimum wage changes.
Public support for medical cannabis was widespread in November, with majority approval in all 49 legislative districts for legalization and 46 of 49 districts favoring a regulatory system.
Cavanaugh and Dungan said LB 677 was stricter than they would have liked but helped voters whose will Dungan said would “once again be stifled” if LB 677 failed.
Cavanaugh, who offered amendments to make the bill less restrictive, said its negotiated constraints were “in the interest of accessibility, safety, reliability.”
‘Let’s cool our jets’
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman called out “political theater” and said part of the urgency for passing LB 677 was an effort by supporters of medical cannabis to get around legal challenges.
“Don’t be fooled about the why, about the panic, about why the marijuana proponents are playing on your fear and emotion that we’re going to have mayhem and chaos if we don’t pass 677. If we pass it, we put it in state statute,” Storer said.

Some senators, as well as Hilgers, have said LB 677 could weaken his office’s pending appeal before the Nebraska Supreme Court alleging improper notarizations during the ballot measure process, which a Lancaster County District Court judge widely rejected in November, after the election. Ballot sponsors have also consistently denied wrongdoing.
Some opponents flaunted that decision and said they hope the Nebraska Supreme Court “gets it right,” including State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, who asked whether LB 677 would incentivize people to “dummy up a bunch of signatures.”
Jacobson and State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, a lawyer, repeatedly pointed to the fraud-focused case and said Hilgers was protecting the ballot measure process.
“Let’s cool our jets. Let’s slow down the pace,” Jacobson said.
‘This issue isn’t going away’
Conrad and the ballot sponsors have said it is Hilgers and Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s alleged fraud case who are threatening the petition process and seek to “ruin the lives of grassroots activists who peacefully petitioned their government for change.”
Despite opponents’ best efforts, Conrad said, the Legislature had already affirmed the ballot measures with an earlier cleanup bill passed Feb. 21 in a 48-0 vote: LB 1.

Conrad also blasted some opponents for drumming up the very evidence that Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong, a Ricketts appointee, had rejected, including texts among campaign volunteers. Conrad, citing Strong, said she found them “completely out of context, legally irrelevant and cherry-picked.”
“To regurgitate them here on the floor of the Legislature, again, out of context, again, to sling mud, again, to drag moms of sick kids who are petitioning their government to try and find a cure, that says a lot about you,” Conrad said.
Meyer said that even if signatures are ultimately tossed, and the state Supreme Court sides with Hilgers’ appeal, voters’ strong approval would still carry weight.
Many of the same campaign volunteers, including all but one of the main notaries being targeted by the AG’s Office, showed up for the debate. In the early hours of debate, one of the long-time advocates had seven seizures. Her mom helped start the legislative push more than a decade ago.
Some volunteers said that while the defeat of LB 677 was a loss, they wouldn’t stop fighting and would keep showing up.
“This issue isn’t going away. I don’t believe the people will let it go away,” said Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, who described the defeat as an “absolute failure.”
Hansen predicted that LB 677’s defeat could accelerate the push for recreational marijuana, as early as the 2026 election. That would come at the same time Pillen, Hilgers, Evnen, Ricketts and half of the seats in the Legislature are up for reelection.
‘Choke it to death’
Another major theme of the debate was whether the Legislature should step in before the Medical Cannabis Commission has a chance to, as the Legislature has not yet considered or confirmed two final gubernatorial appointees.
Both of those Pillen picks — Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna — have a confirmation hearing Thursday. Each has consistently opposed the same measures that Eggers and other long-time supporters have fought for. Mueting opposed LB 677 but was “neutral” on a much stricter bill from Storm.
“Why would we as a Legislature start messing with the commission that hasn’t even started doing its work yet?” State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk asked during debate.

But Hansen said the commission’s broad authority and the apparent lean of the appointees could signal where the regulations ultimately end up, which he said does nothing but hurt patients.
“If they take the reins, they can choke it to death,” Hansen said of the commission.
Four years ago, an earlier medical marijuana bill failed 31-18 in face of Republican opposition. Hilgers, a former state senator, opposed the 2021 bill, too. 
But unlike that narrow defeat, LB 677 faced one of the toughest fights for advocates in a decade, even as the 2025 debate came at a different political moment than in 2021. That includes Ricketts no longer being governor. He had said legalized marijuana would “kill your kids.” It also includes overwhelming approval of the ballot measures.
“I think you know in your hearts that people deserve this, and you know in your hearts what’s going to happen if we don’t,” Hansen told his colleagues. “The people voted for you to make a decision, not to push it off to somebody else.”

 With 370,000 acres of active farmland, our agricultural sector contributes more than $4 billion annually to the state economy and supports 30,000 jobs. Yet despite this economic and social importance, Connecticut’s agrarian future is precarious. Between 2017 and 2022, we lost 463 farms. Rising production costs, climate pressures, and an aging farmer population threaten the future of farming in our state.

Zane Tickoo
To support our farmers and secure a more resilient food system, we must start by rethinking how we value food, not as a commodity, but as a connector. Connecticut, one of the most urbanized states in the country, may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of farmland. Yet it is precisely because of our size and geographic diversity that we are uniquely positioned to lead in local food innovation, if we invest in the right programs.
Farm-to-school initiatives like CT Grown for CT Kids and the Connecticut Local Food for Schools Incentive Program are shining examples of what this kind of investment looks like. These programs connect local farmers with schools, ensuring that students receive fresh, nutritious meals while providing farmers with a stable, reliable market. It’s a win-win, children are better nourished, and farms are better supported.
That’s why recent developments are so alarming. In 2025, both programs faced devastating federal and state funding cuts. The USDA unexpectedly ended the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program, stripping $5.6 million from Connecticut’s farm-to-school pipeline. At the state level, Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposed budget would cut $1 million from the Department of Agriculture, effectively eliminating CT Grown for CT Kids. Without meaningful intervention, these setbacks threaten to undo years of progress toward building a healthier and more resilient local food system.
Fortunately, the legislature has a chance to reverse course. House Bill 7013, now under consideration, offers a path forward. It proposes measures to strengthen program coordination, outreach, and technical assistance with schools and ensure smoother implementation. The bill also expands program eligibility to include childcare providers, broadening the reach of local food access beyond K–12 settings.
Just as importantly, HB 7013 and the proposed Appropriations budget seeks sustained funding for both programs, providing the financial stability needed for them to thrive. Organizations like the Connecticut Northeast Organic Farming Association (CT NOFA) have voiced strong support, recognizing the bill’s potential to bolster local agriculture, improve student nutrition, and increase public awareness around food systems.
This isn’t just smart policy,  it’s a moral imperative. Supporting farm-to-school programs isn’t just about feeding kids; it’s about shaping the next generation of Connecticut’s farmers, food entrepreneurs, and engaged citizens. When students learn where their food comes from, they gain a deeper appreciation for the land, labor, and community behind every meal.
Moreover, these programs can help address one of the most pressing challenges in agriculture today: a lack of young people entering the field. Farming is often viewed as inaccessible, outdated, or financially unviable. But by embedding food literacy into school curricula, expanding school gardens, and exposing students to sustainable farming practices, we can help change the narrative and inspire a new generation to see farming as both a calling and a career.
If we want a future in which Connecticut’s farms flourish and our children grow up nourished in every sense of the word, we must start by protecting and expanding these programs. That means not only preserving existing farmland but also investing in the infrastructure, both physical and educational, that connects people to it.
The future of Connecticut’s food system depends on bold, community-centered action. HB 7013 and funding for farm-to-school represents a critical next step to affirm a vision for Connecticut in which every child has access to healthy food, every farmer has access to a strong market, and every community has a stake in the resilience of our local food system.
Contact your legislators. Let them know that food matters, not just to our plates, but to our economy, our health, and our shared future.

Unfortunately, the special education bills currently speeding their way through Connecticut’s legislature, HB-7277 and the identical SB-1561, would make the system far worse and reduce the ability of families—and even school teams—to meet the needs of children with disabilities. Worse, they would further erode the rights and protections for these children and reduce accountability and transparency in our public schools.

Diane Willcutts
For example, the bills call for removing from children’s Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) a column called “service implementer.”  Why should families care?  Because if that column is removed, districts will have free rein to use anyone to provide specialized instruction. It could be a special education teacher, a paraprofessional, or the next random person to walk past the principal’s office. 
Many short-staffed districts already try to provide special education services with unqualified staff, but students are entitled to have those services made up by the implementer listed in the IEP. Without that column in the IEP, there is no accountability or transparency, and it may be impossible for families to contest the district’s decision-making. 
This is just one example; a baffling number of other such “poison pills” lurk in the 63-page bills, despite the supporters’ stated intentions to make special education more accessible.
Most of the April hearing focused on the high cost of private special education placements, and Rep. Maryam Khan, House Chair of the Committee, stated, “As a teacher. . . I’ve been in PPTs (special education Planning and Placement Team meetings) where I’m, like, this child should be elsewhere, but I know I can’t say that as a teacher. That’s just the reality. . .because of what districts are faced with. Districts can’t pay what they are going to be asked to pay if they actually want to provide what the student needs.” 
She also stated, “Our goal is to fix the system, not just to save the couple (students) that we can.”  Note that Khan is herself a special education teacher in East Hartford. My translation of her alarming remarks:  Because of budget concerns, school districts are failing to meet the needs of all but a few students with disabilities. And even if a teacher believes the child needs a private special education school, the teacher cannot speak up for the child but must remain silent, even knowing the child’s needs are not being met.
Khan added, “The education system itself is very broken. . . some students, if they are lucky enough to get access to an advocate or attorney or they have a parent who really knows or understands the system, they may be able to make it, but everybody else is not in a good space.  So through some of the measures in this bill we try to address that, so everyone has equal access. . .” 
(Khan’s remarks begin at around 8:34:30 of the above video and continue to 8:35:32. The quotes are exact but are out of order.)
But instead of providing more access to special education protections for all children and their families, HB-7277 and SB-1561 move in the direction of eliminating any ability of families to enforce the law. I suppose that could be considered “equal access,” but it is certainly not in the interest of children.
So how do we fix special education?  
1) Teach our kids to read! 
According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 36% of all Connecticut fourth graders are at or above proficiency in reading. In contrast, research tells us that, if students received structured literacy delivered in a way that is consistent with reading science, 95% of ALL students are capable of reading proficiently. 
Unfortunately, most of our universities have not provided our K-3 teachers, special education teachers, or even our reading specialists with adequate preparation to effectively teach reading in a way that is consistent with reading science. Most teachers require two years of training and supervised practicum specifically in structured literacy, which can be done through Orton-Gillingham certification, CALT certification, etc. 
Most children, including those with dyslexia, require structured literacy, and all students benefit from it. Providing effective reading instruction —which requires teachers to be certified in structured literacy— will help all students, not just those with disabilities.
2) Districts need to use evidence-based social/emotional/behavioral programming that published, peer-reviewed research has determined to work. 
For example, Ross Greene’s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions has an entire body of peer-reviewed publications showing that his model is successful in reducing restraints/seclusions and reducing exclusionary discipline. It is also likely to reduce bullying in our schools. This too requires extensive training and increased staffing in our public schools. But again, this investment helps all students, not just those with disabilities.
We need to keep our eyes on the ball —meeting the needs of all our children, including those with disabilities. The reality is that educating children who need special education does cost more. We can either invest the money to provide children with disabilities a meaningful education now, or we can pay exponentially more throughout their lifetimes. 
Ninety-eight percent of students with disabilities are capable of becoming independent adults. Let’s prepare them to be productive taxpayers rather than setting them up to be incarcerated or to need a lifetime of public assistance.

For Democrats, these slips often expose a cynical deceitfulness —an eagerness to impose taxes, rules, and sprawling legislation while dismissing the public’s ability to notice or care. From Rep. Anne Hughes’ recent quip regarding taxes to the Greenwich Democrats’ brazen falsehoods about “slashing” school funding, the party’s penchant for deceptive rhetoric exposes a disconnect between their private beliefs and public posturing.
On Tax Day 2025, Rep. Anne Hughes (D-Easton) was caught on a hot mic during a Connecticut press conference, high-fiving a colleague and laughing, “We’re not rich. But I always tell the governor to tax my people —they won’t even notice.” 
The comment, made while pushing a capital gains tax hike, wasn’t just tone-deaf—it was a stark admission of exploiting perceived voter apathy and a haughty contempt for overtaxed families. In a state with one of the nation’s highest tax burdens, Hughes’ casual dismissal betrayed a belief that taxpayers are either too numb or too naive to resist. This wasn’t a policy debate; it was a celebration of squeezing constituents, cloaked in the guise of “tax equity.”
Hughes’ gaffe echoes a broader Democratic pattern, where unguarded moments expose a love for expansive legislation and the power it grants. Take Nancy Pelosi’s 2010 comment on the Affordable Care Act: “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” Delivered publicly but with a cavalier air, the remark suggested that the ACA’s 2,700 pages were too complex —or inconvenient— for public scrutiny before passage. It revealed a truth Democrats preferred to obscure: their urgency to enact legislation outstripped their commitment to transparency. The comment fueled distrust, painting Democrats as architects of opaque rules who prioritized political wins over public understanding.
This same cynicism is playing out in a more public manner in Greenwich, where Democrats have twisted the 2025 education budget debate into a masterclass in deception. The Board of Estimate and Taxation (BET) reduced the proposed budget increase by $4 million, leaving a still-generous $8 million year-over-year hike. Yet, Democrats have cried “slashing” and “devastating cuts,” whipping up parents and teachers with apocalyptic rhetoric and orchestrating a letter writing campaign with similar jeremiads. They know the budget remains robust, as Greenwich’s schools continue to enjoy funding levels envied by many districts. Their public histrionics mirror Hughes’ private assumption: voters won’t notice the truth if the narrative is loud enough.
Democrats’ hot mic slips sting more because their sanctimonious rhetoric —casting opponents as uncaring while claiming a moral high ground— sets a high bar that their cynicism betrays. In Greenwich, this hypocrisy fuels their budget distortions, assuming emotional appeals will obscure the fiscal reality of a hefty increase. Off-mic, they might concede the budget’s adequacy, just as Hughes admitted taxpayers wouldn’t feel new taxes.
This pattern —private truths and public deceptions— reveals a Democratic playbook that thrives on control and manipulation, whether through taxes in Hartford or distorted narratives in Greenwich. As hot-mic gaffes expose their cynicism and budget falsehoods unravel, Greenwich’s taxpayers are slowly starting to see through the con. 
Hughes’ laugh may fade, but its echo lingers. Taxpayers in Easton and Greenwich are beginning to notice after all.

(Commonwealth Media Services)One hour after polls closed Tuesday, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said that “it’s been a relatively calm and successful primary election day,” in the Keystone State. 
“As always, I’d like to thank the hundreds of county election officials and the approximately 45,000 poll workers who made democracy possible today,” Schmidt said. “Because of them, Pennsylvanians were able to cast their vote at more than 9,000 precincts across 67 counties.”
“A quiet day like today is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our county election officials, especially those new ones who are running elections for the first time and have done their part to make sure voters in their counties can cast their ballot and make their voice heard,” he added.
The 2025 primary election featured contested Republican races for the state’s Superior and Commonwealth courts. There was only one Democratic candidate in each race who will move on to the general election.
Despite few statewide races, several of the state’s biggest cities had big-ticket contests Tuesday. Pittsburgh and several other Democratic strongholds held mayoral primaries, while Philadelphia Democrats voted in a closely watched district attorney primary.
Schmidt said that although municipal primaries are lower profile elections, in his experience, they are some of the most complex.
“There are so many different candidates running for so many different offices, down ticket at the local level, that makes them a particular challenge,” Schmidt said. “Nevertheless, we had reports of only a few minor and isolated issues occurring in the Commonwealth.”
Schmidt said that the Department of State received approximately 500 calls on its voter hotline, which is fewer than the municipal primary election in 2023, when the state received about 600 calls.
“It’s not an insignificant number, of course, but it does demonstrate that Pennsylvania voters overwhelmingly encountered an improved voting experience this year,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt said that with a “successful primary election day” behind them, it was now time for election workers across the state to count the votes. Although voter turnout tends to be lower during these primary elections, he urged patience, saying “this work takes time.”
As of 7:30 p.m., Schmidt said counties reported at least 70% of the 800,000 mail-in ballots issued had been returned.
The official vote count will be available in a few days, according to the Department of State, but it added that “anecdotal reports indicate turnout was typical for municipal primary elections.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Democratic lawmakers in Montana asked the state’s congressional delegation Tuesday to defend “affordable health care access” for Montanans and oppose efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood and “slash Medicaid” in the reconciliation bill under consideration in Washington, D.C.
The letter, signed by Democratic legislative leaders in the Montana House and Senate plus 45 other legislators, said Planned Parenthood is a “trusted, irreplaceable part” of the state’s health care system, and it has served communities for more than 55 years.
“We write in support of the thousands of Montanans who rely on Planned Parenthood health centers, especially those who live in rural, remote and medically-underserved communities where Planned Parenthood is the only provider who can care for patients, many of which are Medicaid recipients,” said the letter.
The lead signers to the letter were Rep. Katie Sullivan of Missoula and Sen. Pat Flowers of Belgrade, minority leaders in the House and Senate, respectively.
The massive tax and spending bill is in the U.S. House, and Republican Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Tuesday it still has “a number of loose ends to tie up,” according to States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. bureau.
The letter from Montana Democrats was directed to U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, all Republicans. Daines, Sheehy and Zinke did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment.
Downing, however, said many Americans don’t want federal money to pay for abortions.
“For too long, the U.S. government has subsidized abortions at Planned Parenthood with complete disregard for the sincerely held beliefs of millions of Americans,” said Congressman Downing in an email from his office. “If the brutality of abortion should exist in this country, may it never receive another penny of federal funding.”
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana describes Planned Parenthood as the largest provider of sexual and reproductive health care in Montana, with four health centers in the state and telehealth services for thousands of patients, including Medicaid recipients.
The advocacy group said Planned Parenthood is like any other health care provider, with health centers reimbursed through health programs like Medicaid: “Medicaid funds are not used for abortion other than in rare exceptions due to the Hyde Amendment.”
The federal law known as the Hyde Amendment disallows federal funds for abortion except to save the life of the parent or for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.
Mary Sullivan, with Planned Parenthood Advocates, said language in the bill is specifically pointed at Planned Parenthood, but because the Hyde Amendment already restricts funding for abortion, the effect would be a limit on other services.
“Really, where they’re drawing the line is birth control, cancer screenings, STI (sexually transmitted infection) screenings,” Sullivan said.
The bill (Sec. 44126) identifies entities prohibited from receiving funds as nonprofit organizations that receive more than $1 million and are “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”
Sullivan, of Planned Parenthood Advocates, said if health care centers were forced to close, many patients would have nowhere to turn, and the health care landscape in Montana is “already overwhelmed.”
In a statement, Quinn Leighton, with Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said the organization would continue to work to ensure care remains available and affordable for Montanans.
“Every Montanan, no matter where they live or how much money they have, deserves access to essential, affordable health care,” Leighton said. 
A  2025 public opinion report about abortion and reproductive health policy said respondents generally opposed “a number of actions” the Trump administration could take, including taking away funds from Planned Parenthood.
“Opposition crosses party lines — with about four in 10 Trump voters or more in opposition (including 63% who oppose taking away funds from Planned Parenthood),” said the report from PerryUndem, which describes itself as a nonpartisan public opinion research firm.
In the letter from Democrats, the legislators said the consequences of “defunding” Planned Parenthood “could be catastrophic.” 
“No other provider would be able to fill the gap left by Planned Parenthood, and making cuts to Medicaid would put rural hospitals and medical centers in jeopardy,” the letter said.
A separate letter Monday organized by the State Innovation Exchange’s Reproductive Freedom Leadership Council described the prohibition in the federal bill as the latest in “politically motivated attacks” against Planned Parenthood and abortion providers.

A narrow House majority didn’t stumble
During the session, legislators contended with falling oil revenue. Legislators didn’t pass any tax increases, instead adopting significant budget cuts. The Alaska House navigated partisan divisions that left its majority coalition — 14 Democrats, 5 independents and 2 Republicans — with only a one-vote margin over a 19-person House Republican minority.
That coalition majority, and a similar one in the Senate, had to negotiate with a governor who has significantly different policy views from the coalitions.
Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said the early adjournment is something to be proud of.
“I’m pretty pleased that we achieved it,” he said.
It was the first time since 2018 that the Legislature did not reach the constitutional limit of 121 days to complete the session, though the 2020 session was interrupted by a seven-week break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“In a year where the House was sharply divided in terms of numbers, oil prices sank, we did our best to work with the governor, who, at many times, was not seemingly here in the building, and we put it all together,” Edgmon said.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said her caucus wasn’t satisfied with the result.
“I think we’re disappointed that we didn’t address more issues related to energy and the challenges we have and the opportunities that we have with resource development and energy and dovetailing with the president and our congressional delegation,” she said. “So we wanted more legislation in that area. But as far as adjourning, it is what it is, and we’re just going to gear up for next year.”

Spending plan has limited increases
One of the Legislature’s final acts before adjournment was to pass the state’s operating budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
“You could say that both the operating and the capital budget, the two main budgets, were maintenance-level budgets,” Edgmon said.
The capital and operating budgets, including money for next fiscal year and changes to the current fiscal year, spend $6.2 billion, when looking only at general-purpose state spending. If federal funding and things like fees, college tuition and other money is included, the budget bills spend $16.3 billion. 
General-purpose state spending is down significantly. The enacted budget bills from last spring totaled more than $6.5 billion.
Legislators started the budget-drafting process with the expectation that North Slope oil prices would average $68 per barrel in the next fiscal year. 
By the end, that expectation had dropped to $64, and the federal government — which pays for about 40% of the combined budget bills — had begun cutting its contributions.
As revenue projections declined, legislators slashed programs from the budget, including things like new state troopers for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. 
A relative handful of budget increases made it through the process — money for mental health treatment in Anchorage, early childhood education programs, and child advocacy centers, which help the survivors of child sexual abuse.
Those increases — and all other parts of the budget — are subject to approval by the governor, who has the power to veto individual line items. Every year of his term, Dunleavy has vetoed significant amounts from the budget.
In the House, legislators failed to pass one part of the budget — a roughly $200 million draw from the state’s principal savings account, the Constitutional Budget Reserve, in order to pay for a deficit in the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.
Conditional language in the budget says that if the CBR vote fails, the state will instead take up to $100 million from the accounts of the state’s investment bank — the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority — and the state’s higher education investment fund.
The vote failed after members of the House Republican minority opposed it. Thirty votes are required to spend from the reserve.

“I wasn’t comfortable going into savings,” said Costello. “I felt like we could have done more work on the budget and involved our House Finance Committee team, which has a lot of experience, so I just wasn’t willing to give my CBR vote to go into savings.”
Costello said she feels that other members of the minority felt similarly. 
Next year, legislators expect that they will need to spend heavily from the CBR in order to balance the budget.
In addition, legislators are expected to pass major policy bills, including a revival of the state’s pension program for public employees, and election reform bills. 
“Hold on to your hat, Nellie, for next session, because it could be much more challenging, as we all know,” Edgmon said.

Bob Ferguson entered office warning that a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall would require spending cuts and, as a last resort, higher taxes.
On Tuesday, the first-term Democrat appeared satisfied with lawmakers’ work to close the financial gap, signing a two-year state budget and a tax package to produce billions of dollars in new revenue to keep it in balance.
“To get a budget in a challenging situation to the finish line, it’s going to require working together and a lot of compromise,” Ferguson said. “I believe we accomplished that with this budget.”
Ferguson’s approval ended weeks of speculation about whether he would reject tax increases in favor of deeper cuts. It also capped off months of wrangling between the governor and Democratic lawmakers over how far to go in raising taxes. Republicans slammed Ferguson for agreeing to the hikes after he’d voiced support for greater fiscal restraint.
This all came in the face of an estimated $16 billion shortfall over the next two budget cycles and uncertainty about federal funding.
Also Tuesday, the governor approved a 6-cent increase in Washington’s gas tax to ensure planned transportation projects move forward.
In the end, he only used his veto power to remove one significant piece of a tax bill, related to community banks, and to nix about $25 million from the operating budget.
Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, the lead budget writer in the Senate, said she was “very pleased” with the limited use of the veto pen.
“I think he’s sincere and understands the difficult decisions that were made,” she said. “The fact that he didn’t make significant changes shows he respects our views.”

The two-year operating budget signed Tuesday calls for $77.8 billion in spending across government, including public schools and colleges, health care, social services, housing, corrections, and environmental protection. It also funds new two-year collective bargaining agreements with most, but not all, public employee unions.
It relies on about $4 billion from new and higher taxes and transfers from other accounts into the general fund, the central pot of money used to pay for most state spending. The state will end the fiscal cycle with $225 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund. 
The suite of revenue bills inked by Ferguson includes a permanent across-the-board boost in business taxes, a temporary surcharge on high-grossing firms, and higher tax rates on large financial institutions and computing giants. Sales tax would be applied to more services, some tax breaks disappear, and an existing tax on tobacco products gets broadened to include nicotine pouches, like Zyn.
A wide swath of private sector firms and health care providers urged Ferguson to reject some of the measures, insisting higher costs would be passed on to customers and patients. For the most part, he did not heed their requests.
However, he restored a tax break for community banks that allows for a tax deduction for interest they receive on loans for residential property. That exemption helps people afford housing, he said. It will trim the tax package by $215 million over four years, a state budget official said.
Republicans panned the governor’s approval of the taxes as an about-face.
“On his first day in office, Governor Ferguson spoke of fiscal responsibility, yet today he’s supporting the largest tax increase in state history,” Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said in a statement. “That’s disappointing. The majority Democrats who don’t believe government can ever have enough money were unhappy with him back then; they must be elated now.”
Ferguson said he planned to further scrutinize the tax increases on businesses in the interim. 
“There are some revenues there that I think require a closer look to make sure there are not unintended consequences,” he told reporters Tuesday. “So I would not be surprised if you see some changes beyond technical changes to those revenue streams.”


The Big 5
Five tax bills signed Tuesday are counted on to bring in roughly $3.6 billion for the next budget and $9.4 billion over four years. Here’s where those dollars would come from.
House Bill 2081, the largest money maker, is projected to generate $2.1 billion in the next budget. It has an across-the-board boost in business taxes, a temporary surcharge on high-grossing firms and higher tax rates on large financial institutions and computing giants.
Senate Bill 5814 is relied on to raise $1 billion for the next biennium, mostly by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as digital advertising and temporary staffing. There is also a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches.
Senate Bill 5813 will bring in $321 million by adding a layer to the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets, another 2.9% will be levied on gains above $1 million. 
Senate Bill 5794 aims to bring in $148.5 million by getting rid of a variety of tax breaks enjoyed by around 4,000 taxpayers, including operators of self-service storage facilities and sellers of precious metal bullion.
House Bill 2077 is expected to generate $54.5 million with a new tax on the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington.


Critics of where majority Democrats landed point out that state spending with the operating budget has increased from roughly $38 billion to upward of $70 billion over the past decade. Spending in the current two-year budget cycle that ends June 30 is around $72 billion.
Transportation budget also rides on tax hikes
Ferguson also approved separate spending plans for transportation and capital construction for the 2025-27 biennium that begins July 1.
The $15.5 billion transportation spending plan funds Washington State Ferries, highway megaprojects and maintenance of state roads and bridges. Washington State Patrol and public transportation are also paid for through this budget. And there’s over a billion dollars for the court-ordered removal of barriers to fish in waterways that cross under state roads.
Similar to the operating budget, transportation faced a major shortfall due to diminishing gas tax receipts and ballooning costs for the state’s already-expensive road projects.
To fill the gap, Ferguson signed a separate six-year, $3.2 billion transportation revenue package intended to pay for promised infrastructure. While the state’s first gas tax hike since 2016 anchors it, there are a number of other new and higher fees and taxes, including on rental cars, non-commercial aircraft, luxury vehicles and car sales, among others.
Washington’s gas tax — already among the highest in the nation — will rise from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents per gallon in July, then by 2% each year.
“The people of the state of Washington expect us to invest in those projects, but we have limited revenue options right now,” Ferguson said. “The gas tax, unfortunately, is one of them.”
The capital budget authorizes $7.6 billion in new spending. It will drive $760 million into affordable housing, most of it through the Housing Trust Fund. There’s nearly a billion dollars for K-12 school construction, plus funds for salmon recovery and behavioral health facilities.
How we got here
In the final weeks of the session, Ferguson objected to budgets passed in the House and Senate, saying they each relied too much on taxes. At that time, he called on lawmakers to “immediately move budget discussions in a different direction.”
Before that, he refused a proposed “wealth tax” on investments held by the richest Washingtonians. He felt the new tax was sure to face legal challenges that could threaten the stability of the state’s budget and that it would be difficult to implement.
In response, Democratic lawmakers dropped the idea for this year. The new governor also opposed a proposal to repeal a voter-approved limit on property tax growth in Washington, so legislators abandoned that, as well. 
By the time Democrats’ slate of revenue proposals reached the governor’s desk, lawmakers had dropped it from a total of $21 billion over four years to $9.4 billion, excluding the separate transportation taxes and fees.
Lawmakers are scheduled to next return to Olympia in January, when they will hash out a supplemental funding plan for the final year of the cycle.
But Ferguson didn’t rule out a special session before then to deal with potential havoc wreaked by the Trump administration or cuts under consideration by the Republican-controlled Congress. He said federal funds make up about one-fifth of Washington’s budget.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Nearly 300 striking workers from Butler Hospital took to the Rhode Island State House around 2 p.m. Tuesday. The purple-clad filled the rotunda and surrounding hallways. They filled the line to get through the metal detector at the front door, and when the House and Senate floor sessions started around 4 p.m., they filled the viewing galleries in both chambers.

The throng was there to call attention to the ongoing walkout by about 800 employees of the hospital, demanding better pay and working conditions.
Before sitting quietly in the legislative chambers during the session, the workers participated in a series of chants, the collective roaring peaking at around 119 decibels when measured from the third floor balcony by Rhode Island Current. A chainsaw, by comparison, measures about 125 decibels.
Jesse Martin, the Executive Vice President of SEIU 1199 New England, told Rhode Island Current after the rally had finished around 5 p.m. that he was confident the legislature was listening to the striking workforce of the Providence psychiatric hospital. 
“I think they had no other choice but to listen today,” Martin said. “And I know that the champions for working people in this state house heard that hospital workers need to be included in how policy is set for funding our hospitals.”
On the House floor, Rep. David Bennett, a Warwick Democrat, was listening, and prompted his colleagues to do the same.
“If you notice, there’s an ocean of purple above the speaker, and behind me,” said Bennett, a retired registered nurse who previously worked at Butler. He motioned to the viewing galleries stationed on opposite ends of the House chamber. “They’re fighting for fair wages, a fair contract, and I’m with you.”

Bennett was not the only lawmaker to support the strike in their State House rally. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, was coordinating a different but adjacent casino workers’ rally the same afternoon, and she greeted the purple-clad SEIU members awaiting the security checkpoint with a smile. A big megaphone slung over her shoulder, Tanzi offered a friendly reminder to the union members to empty their pockets before reaching the metal detector.
The line to get in the State House stretched out the front door, but by the time the SEIU members had packed in, the spectacle and noise was unmissable. Over more than an hour, Senators, state employees, lobbyists, and other curious onlookers would crane their head over the marble balustrade on the third floor, their eyes meeting a rotunda filled with purple, yellow, and signs of white and red with the tagline: “ON STRIKE. DUE TO UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES.” 
About 800 unionized workers at Butler Hospital — who comprise mental health staff, nurses, clerical workers, and custodial and dietary employees — have been on strike since May 15, after contract negotiations with Care New England, the 168-bed hospital’s parent company, fizzled. 
During contract negotiations, the workers pushed for higher wages, pension access for future hires, and more robust safety protocols after several years of increased workplace violence. All four of the union’s contracts with Care New England expired on March 31. The union voted to authorize a strike on April 25, and the last bargaining session was held May 7. 
Days into the strike, hospital management notified workers that their health, dental, and vision coverage would conclude on May 31. Employees can elect to continue coverage through COBRA, but those costs will come out of their pockets. The last paycheck for employees will be May 23.
A mix of 44 senators and reps added their names to a May 8 letter to Butler President and CEO Mary E. Marran which urged the hospital to resume talks with the union. Missing from that list of allies was House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi — who, immediately ahead of Tuesday’s floor session, offered his own statement on the strike.
“Having access to the critical high-quality mental health services provided at Butler Hospital is vital to so many struggling Rhode Islanders, as well as those who love them,” Shekarchi wrote. “I am calling on both the management of Butler Hospital and health care workers represented by SEIU 1199 New England to get back to the bargaining table to negotiate in good faith and come up with a fair deal. Patients, family, friends and neighbors in every Rhode Island community are being impacted by the ongoing strike at Butler Hospital. My hope is that management and the union at Butler Hospital reach a fair deal in the very near future.”
Reps. David Morales and Rebecca Kislak, both Providence Democrats, picketed alongside the workers for multiple days during the strike. Providence City Council President Rachel Miller joined the picket on Monday.
Finger pointing over stalled talks
Care New England has maintained that it has been transparent about negotiations. The hospital set up a dedicated website with information on the contract process around Jan. 30, according to domain registration information. When bargaining stalled months later, Marran’s messages posted to the site argued that media coverage and the union narrative had skewed the reality.
Martin disputed that, saying that Butler walked away from the negotiating table.
“What comes next is, we’re going to stay on strike one day longer than Butler Hospital is willing to stand,” Martin said. “When they want to negotiate, they know our phone number.”

A Care New England spokesperson did not provide a fresh statement Tuesday, but pointed to a Monday comment from Marran: “Despite SEIU 1199 NE taking its members off the job, Butler Hospital remains open for business. While we would prefer to have our own employees working with patients, we have highly qualified replacement workers here who will continue to be here, fulfilling Butler’s essential role in the community by providing vital behavioral health services.”
“Our team will be here when the union decides it is ready to come back to the table and work toward a solution,” Marran continued. 
The Butler strike emerges during a volatile stretch for Rhode Island’s hospital finances, as shown by hospital leaders ramping up advocacy this legislative session amid shifting federal rules and chronically underfunded Medicaid reimbursement rates. Another example of ailing hospital finances can be found in a recent study by Brown University researchers, which found that the state’s 2010 hospital price-growth cap cut average commercial prices by 9% — a win for some consumers, but one that has cost hospitals about $158.3 million since the regulation took effect, researchers estimated.
Jillian Scott, a Hospital Association of Rhode Island spokesperson, said via email that the coalition does not provide official commentary on labor negotiations, but she did relay a statement from Interim President Howard Dulude on what can be done policywise. 
“Right now, Rhode Island’s health care system is in crisis, and hospitals face ongoing financial pressures in delivering high-quality care and supporting their workforce,” Dulude wrote. “Continued collaboration with the legislature on the 2026 State Budget is critical to ensure hospitals have the resources needed to invest in staff and meet the health care needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Martin agreed that hospitals aren’t getting enough money, but he wasn’t sure the money should be going toward “CEO pay and CEO golden parachutes.”
“It’s really hard to take someone seriously when they make multiple millions of dollars in salary, but most of their workers live in poverty on state assistance,” Martin said. “That seems to be hypocritical.” 
Martin said he believes the General Assembly is largely sympathetic to union needs, but urged lawmakers to “first put themselves in the shoes of a health care worker,” and allocate Medicaid dollars to hospitals with guardrails in place. Martin cited a 2022 infusion of $75 million to nursing homes and hospitals from the General Assembly, but argued that money didn’t reach unionized workers like those at Butler.
“A hospital repaid themselves for the overtime that workers had already worked,” Martin said. “They used that money to buy them pizza. I’m sorry, but pizza doesn’t lift people out of poverty. Might fill your belly for a meal, but it doesn’t fill your belly for a lifetime.”

Columbia City Council deferred a contentious vote Tuesday on whether to roll back the 2021 ordinance that threatens a $500 fine for counseling that attempts to change the sexual orientations or gender identities of children. It is the only South Carolina city with such a law.
Columbia has been under pressure from state Attorney General Alan Wilson to repeal the local law.
And at the Legislature, Sen. Josh Kimbrell, R-Boiling Springs, has pushed a one-year measure in the budget to cut $3.7 million in state funding to the city if it does not reverse course. State budget writers have yet to make a final decision on the proposed budget rule.

Under the 2021 ordinance, any licensed therapist found in violation could be fined. Leaders of organizations advocating to keep the ban in place were not aware of any instances of the city issuing a penalty as most so-called conversion therapy is performed by private religious groups rather than the licensed therapists and counselors the law governs.
In the meantime, city leaders voted to move money around in its own budget, holding back revenue generated from hospitality taxes in an effort to cover any gaps should the state budget amendment be upheld.
“There’s a significant amount of (state) money,” said Mayor Daniel Rickenmann. “So, we need to know where that lands.”
LGBTQ+ groups and advocates considered the wait a win.
“I think that it speaks volumes that they voted to hold over,” said Matthew Butler, LGBTQ Advocacy Strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina. “I think that might indicate more than just a little bit of discomfort with what all is going on. So, I do commend the city for acting by not acting, and we will work to make sure that they stand by this provide by this ordinance.”

During the council meeting, some 20 people testified for more than hour before a crowd that spilled over to a second room. Many shared their own experiences with conversion therapy, as well as instances of physical and mental abuse, rape and suicide attempts.
“(People) are having to relive some of the worst memories of their lives to come up here and support something that we shouldn’t even be discussing. It’s barbarous, it’s treacherous and it’s disastrous for our youth,” said Enid Campbell, of Columbia.
Butler of the ACLU called a letter, sent by the attorney general on April 23 claiming the ordinance violates state law and constitutional rights, political “posturing.”
“It’s a dangerous thing when the top law enforcement officer of the state uses the power of his office, not to protect the public, but to bully cities into submission for political sport,” Butler said.
“This ordinance is not unlawful. It is simply inconvenient to men who confuse bluster with leadership,” Butler continued. “But threats only work if you surrender to them.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken up a Colorado case that could decide at the national level whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0660-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 22:04:23.887104

After HB265 passed this year, schools started scrambling to make the most efficient plan to reallocate their resources, with many exploring program consolidations, cutting courses and layoffs.
The process seems abrupt, Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, told the Executive Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, especially since many faculty members have inundated her inbox, worried about the potential elimination of curriculums and jobs.

“There’s a lot of frantic behavior and in government we never want to be frantic,” Riebe said. “We want to be methodical. We want to be research driven and data driven. And I understand where this bill is going, but it’s been a very hard, abrupt turn, and there’s a lot of pain points in our universities.”
That, she added, may scar the reputation of Utah universities, frightening off staff and prospective professors wanting to apply for jobs in the state. 
HB265 passed comfortably in Utah’s Republican supermajority Legislature while being opposed by most of the Democratic Caucus. The bill’s goal, its supporters said, is to cut “underperforming programs” and direct those funds to highly-sought degrees.
With tight deadline, Utah universities scramble to cut 10% of budget for courses

That’s a premise that House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, defended during the Tuesday discussion, arguing that some of the cuts were overdue, and may even keep tuition costs low. 
“Liberal arts, for some reason, keeps being the topic of discussion,” Schultz said. “Yes, maybe every one of those programs might not be available at four or five universities across the state. You may not be able to take a program at the University of Utah, you might have to go to Weber State to take the program, or vice versa, but I think that’s a wise use of the way that our dollars are spent.” 
The cost of attending college “is a huge concern,” putting higher education increasingly out of reach for many, Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, said. As many Republican lawmakers emphasized the intent of making college more efficient, affordable and accessible, she asked whether tuition will decrease as a result of HB265. 
No more ethnic, women and gender studies at WSU as state-mandated budget cuts start

Those numbers were not available during the committee discussion. But Schultz, who recently spoke with Weber State University leaders about their reallocation plans, highlighted that the school’s overall tuition increase this year was 2% for bachelor’s degrees and it kept the same costs for its associate degree programs.
“They were very proud that they found ways to take the savings and find savings and not increase for their associate’s degrees,” Schultz said. “So if the universities are not doing that, then I think that they are being a little bit derelict in their duties.”
While he understands faculty and staff members’ concerns, Schultz said he hopes that schools find the right balance in their process, and that the Legislature continues these types of initiatives more often.
“We do it on a regular basis with our state agencies,” he said. “And with as much money as the state spends on higher education, and with the cost of higher education growing more and more out of control, I really think that this ought to become a little bit more of the norm.”

The federal government last week released the latest population counts for the nation’s more than 3,000 counties, as well as all incorporated cities and towns. 
In Montana, 32 of the state’s 56 counties saw a population increase, concentrated in the state’s western counties, while the mostly eastern counties that saw population declines did so by just over a thousand cumulative residents. 
As a whole, Montana added 5,931 new residents between July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2024, for a total state population of 1,137,233. The state’s growth rate of .52% was slower than the national growth rate of 1%, partly due to a last-in-the-nation level of international migration, and far lower than in recent years. Between 2020 and 2021, Montana added a whopping 19,000 new residents.
The United States has added 3,304,757 people between 2023 and 2024.
In the last release of census data, Gallatin and Flathead counties added 1,055 and 1,032 new residents, respectively, the first time since the population boom began in 2020 Flathead County hasn’t led in raw numbers. But the northwest county had a higher rate of change at .91% compared to Gallatin’s .84%. 
Broadwater County had the highest percentage population increase in the last year, 2.96%, and over the last four years, with 22.2%, but the county’s 8,302 residents makes it just the 27th most inhabited in Montana. 
Since 2020, however, Flathead County has led the state in sheer number of additional residents, adding more than 10,100 to Gallatin’s just over 8,000 and Yellowstone County’s 6,800.
Meanwhile, Kalispell, the county seat of the Flathead, added 1,125 new residents between 2023 and 2024 for a population of 31,296, a nearly 4% increase stemming from the city’s annexation of new developments and migration into the area. 
Bozeman added the second most residents, 788, followed by Billings (686), Missoula (557) and Helena (360). Of the state’s most populous cities, Great Falls, Havre and Sidney all lost residents. 
Kalispell’s growth is even more drastic over the last four years. Between 2020 and 2024, the city added 6,218 new residents, a 24.8% increase that ranked the city 39th in the nation for growth among cities with more than 20,000 residents. 
Helena, which grew by 8.2%, and Bozeman, which grew by 8.1%, ranked in the 260s.  
Kalispell City Manager Doug Russell said seeing the actual numbers isn’t a big surprise for the people who have been working to accommodate the rising population. 
“We’ve experienced that large growth in person over the years,” Russel said. 
Russell said that planning for increased growth is key to keeping city services and infrastructure at a level to handle the demands of a rapidly growing population.
“Our public works department has done a really great job updating facilities plans on a routine basis and updating growth models to to anticipate where we’ll need to prioritize infrastructure projects,” Russel said.
Among the major infrastructure projects Kalispell has prioritized in recent years are construction of a new water tower to bolster the municipal water storage and working with the state transportation department to address potential bottlenecks along major transit corridors, such as W. Reserve Drive, along the city’s north end. 
Russell said the city is currently updating its land use policy, which will allow city officials to prepare for the next round of anticipated growth. 
If Kalispell’s growth trend continues, it could soon overtake Helena and Butte-Silver Bow in size. 
Just north of Kalispell, Whitefish has also grown by nearly 20% since 2020, adding 1,481 residents, while nearby Polson and Columbia Falls have grown 9.6% and 7.4%. 
Belgrade, a suburb of Bozeman, one of the state’s least affordable cities, is the only other large city in Montana to exceed 20% growth, adding 2,265 residents since 2020. 
On the other end of the spectrum, Montana’s smallest incorporated town, Ismay, has stayed exactly the same, with 21 residents since 2020, according to Census data. 
A call placed to the only publicly listed phone number in Ismay, the Ismay Community Church, did not get a response on Tuesday to verify the town’s 21 residents.
Two other incorporated towns in Montana showed flat growth rates since 2020, both on the Hi-Line in Phillips County — Dodson, which increased from 126 residents to 127 in 2023, but then returned to 126 in 2024, and Malta, which has fluctuated around 1,853 residents for several years. 
Nationally, of the 10 fastest growing cities in the country, six are in Texas, and one each is in Florida, Utah, South Carolina and North Carolina.
Forney, Texas, added 15,079 residents between 2020 and 2024, a 62.2% increase.  
The nation’s fastest shrinking city was Big Spring, Texas, which lost 14% of its population. 
 A county shift 

The U.S. Census Bureau data breaks out changes to county population by natural change — the difference due to birth rates and death rates — and net migration into and out of a county. 
While Flathead and Gallatin counties each grew by roughly the same 1,000 residents between 2023 and 2024, they did so in vastly different ways. 
A quarter of Gallatin County’s increase was due to a younger population. The county’s birth rate was 1,141 people while only 686 individuals died during the year of record. 
Meanwhile Flathead, Missoula, and Yellowstone counties had almost equal numbers of births and deaths in their communities, trends that extend back to 2020. 
Flathead County’s primary source of growth is new residents moving to the county. Ninety-nine percent of new residents between 2020 and 2024 relocated to the area, while just three-quarters of new Gallatin County residents did. 
Both on the eastern side of the state, Montana’s two least populous counties, Treasure and Petroleum, with 739 and 535 residents respectively, saw the largest population percentage decline in residents. 
Petroleum lost 18 residents in 2024, six from a higher death rate than birth rate, and 12 who moved out of the county. Treasure County dropped by 28 residents, gaining two from natural change, but losing 30 to relocation. 
The state’s largest county, Yellowstone, with 171,583 residents, is more populous than the state’s 36 least inhabited combined.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241231_093900-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 20:59:16.702944

Josh Shapiro has proposed another $25 million for Solar for Schools grants in the upcoming state budget.,"A solar array.  (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)Pennsylvania has awarded grants totaling $22.5 million to 73 schools across the state to help pay for solar energy installations, the Commonwealth Financing Authority announced Tuesday.
The awards under the Department of Community and Economic Development’s Solar for Schools program will provide up to $500,000 to each school. The solar arrays they help pay for could save school districts millions of dollars in energy costs, state Rep. Elizabeth Fieldler (D-Philadelphia) said.
“I am so happy for each of these schools and excited to see names from nearly every corner of the state,” Fiedler, who introduced legislation to create the program last year, said. “I’ve heard from rural schools who plan to include their solar panels in agricultural education and from city schools that are thinking strategically about rooftop solar with limited space. I have no doubt that the recipients will benefit from the program’s flexibility to meet their school’s needs and to make the most of their strengths.”
The grant awards come as the legislature is preparing for the final month before the state budget is due June 30. The current budget included up to $25 million for the Solar for Schools program and Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed to match that amount in the upcoming budget.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fiedler’s bill, which passed both chambers of the General Assembly with broad bipartisan support last summer, was created as a way to address the school funding crisis, rising utility costs and climate change together, her office said.
“As energy costs rise, diversifying our energy sources is more important than ever. Increased energy usage throughout the country also puts us at a higher risk because of the inadequate power grid,” state Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R-Greene) said. “Schools that use solar panels will counteract that problem by improving Pennsylvania’s energy security and lowering costs – saving millions of dollars of taxpayer money.”
It also received strong support from building trade unions, whose members will benefit from the construction jobs the grants help to create.  
“These new projects through Solar for Schools will open up doors for workers across the state,” said Robert S. Bair, president of the Pennsylvania Building Trades Council. “Energy jobs are crucial in Pennsylvania. Labor needs to be on the forefront of growing industries like solar.”
Union support was, in part, the result of a yearslong effort to strengthen relationships between environmental and labor advocates, who recognize the adoption of renewable energy sources requires skilled workers just as fossil fuel plants do. 
In the initial round of applications for Solar for School, districts from rural, suburban and urban areas requested $88 million, more than three times the amount available in the current budget. The grants awarded totaled less than the full $25 million because the money is divided between three regions and the DCED did not find enough qualifying applications in one of them, Fiedler said. 
While interest in renewable energy is growing and political support for such programs is broadening, solar energy still faces hurdles in state government. With the overwhelming response to the initial appropriation, Fiedler said she is hopeful that at least another $25 million Solar for Schools will be approved as part of the next budget.

Alaska’s 20 centers were in limbo, facing a $5.5 million shortfall after federal grants were ended or cut, as well as uncertainty over whether operations and services would continue past June. 
On Friday afternoon, the budget conference committee – tasked with hammering out the final budget between the House and Senate versions – approved the funds to fill the gap and provide $5.5 million in state funding.
Rep. Andy Jospephson, D-Anchorage and chair of the committee, said it was made clear that funding for the centers was a priority. “They’re critically important, and they rose to the very, very top of my list,” he said. “In other words, there was no ask, given their financial predicament and importance, that I thought was more significant.”
Mari Mukai, executive director of the nonprofit Alaska Children’s Alliance, said she was grateful for the funding. The alliance provides support, training and technical assistance to Alaska’s 20 child advocacy centers around the state. “I know what a difficult fiscal situation we’re in right now and understand that many difficult decisions needed to be made,” she said in a phone interview on Monday.
Child advocacy centers provide services for children and their caregivers after suspected physical or sexual abuse, including trauma-informed interviewing, forensic services, streamlined investigations, and victim advocacy through the life of the case. They served 2,061 families statewide last year, Mukai said. 
The centers are funded at $10.9 million through a mix of federal and local grants, as well as other funding they raise. Mukai said the state’s backstop funding will make up about half of their budget, and enable the centers to continue current operations and services. 
“Unfortunately, Alaska is consistently on the top of the nation for rates of child abuse and violence, and domestic violence, and so unfortunately, yes, I do think that there’s still a lot of need, but this would be a great first step,” she said. 
The Alaska Legislature voted to approve the final operating budget on Tuesday, and Gov. Mike Dunleavy will issue budget vetoes of individual line items before July 1. 
Mukai added that another federal grant the centers rely on is in danger – the Victims of Crime Act, provided by the U.S. Department of Justice through penalties related to crimes. Alaska advocates are urging the congressional delegation to push the U.S. Congress to protect this funding, as the Trump administration has moved to cancel hundreds of grants and millions of dollars supporting victims services through the Department of Justice.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that bans carbon sequestration over, under or through portions of the Mahomet Aquifer passed out of the Illinois General Assembly on Tuesday.

The bill has been a point of contention in the Statehouse during this year’s legislative session, after it was found that a leak occurred during carbon injections carried out by ADM, a Decatur-based agriculture giant.

Carbon sequestration is a relatively new technological process that pumps liquified carbon dioxide deep underground for long-term storage. Proponents say it could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions for high-emissions industries like ethanol production.

The ADM injection site, which opened in 2011, received the first federal permit for “geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide” in 2017. Since then, the project has stored more than 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide more than a mile underground.

Although the leak did not take place in the Mahomet Aquifer area, roughly 8,000 metric tons of liquid carbon dioxide and other ground fluid escaped the area it was permitted to be in. ADM temporarily paused carbon injections in October after another issue with a well was identified.

The Mahomet Aquifer supplies water to hundreds of thousands of people in central Illinois.  Estimates for the number of Illinois residents served daily by the aquifer range from 500,000 to 1 million people.

In 2015, portions of the aquifer in 14 Illinois counties were designated as a sole source aquifer by the EPA, since contamination of the aquifer could cause significant public health risk. That EPA designation also indicates that there are no “reasonably available alternative drinking water sources” that could be used if the water in the aquifer were contaminated.

Senate Bill 1723 passed on Tuesday with bipartisan support. The bill was spearheaded by Sen. Paul Faraci, D-Champaign, and Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet. It comes after Illinois lawmakers passed a law last year allowing carbon sequestration anywhere in Illinois.

“Proposals under consideration by the U.S. EPA today would store 50 times the amount of carbon that has been stored at the ADM facility under the Mahomet Aquifer,” Andrew Rehn, the climate policy director of Prairie Rivers Network, said during a Senate committee hearing on the bill in March. “Last year's bill leaves a critical gap. It says you have to replace drinking water if you damage it through your carbon sequestration activity, and the sole source designation means that there is no alternative.”

Charles Harvey, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spoke on the dangers of carbon sequestration in the wake of the recent ADM leak during the committee hearing. He called the ADM injection facility an “experiment,” as the injection of carbon at such a depth had never been done before.

He said the pressure and depth of the injections led to fissures in both the injection pipes and the levels of rock the carbon was being pumped into and stored under. Since carbon dioxide is a gas, he said it began to seep through the cracks and the fissures and rise back to the surface, which began the leak.

“To do this, it had to move at an alarming velocity of at least three meters a day to have reached it in the four months that after injections for when the seismic inference was made,” Harvey said. “Now, the original report predicted that with 90% confidence this would not happen.”

Due to the aquifer’s sole source designation, bill proponents also argued that central Illinois residents can’t afford the water to be at risk.

“Eighty-five percent of the geographic land mass in the state of Illinois can be used for carbon sequestration. The aquifer is a very small piece of that, it's just kind of the width of Central Illinois,” Rose said. “You can sequester north or south of this without putting anybody's water in jeopardy.”

Opponents of the bill argued that since the Mahomet Aquifer sits at roughly 200 feet under the surface, it isn’t at risk to leaks, as carbon injections pump the gas thousands of feet underground.

“The geology under and around the Mahomet Aquifer is the best geology to ensure that thousands of feet below the aquifer — we’re not talking immediately under the aquifer, we’re talking thousands of feet, up to a mile below — is the best geology to ensure that the carbon capturing is taking place,” Donovan Griffith, the vice president of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said during the committee. “It's the best in the state.”

The bill passed out of the Senate in April 55-0. It now awaits approval from the governor after passing out of the House on Tuesday with a vote of 91-19.

IMA released a statement on X following the passage of SB1723 urging Gov. JB Pritzker to veto the bill.

“Carbon capture and sequestration is a safe and proven technology that is key to maintaining economic growth and advancing our state’s decarbonization goals. We urge Gov. JB Pritzker to veto this legislation, which discourages investment in clean energy projects including sustainable aviation fuel,” said Mark Denzler, President and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)“NO MORE SMOKE! NO MORE SMOKE!” 
That was the chant from about 150 casino workers who packed the steps inside the State House Tuesday — their backs to the House chamber, but their voices aimed directly across the rotunda to the Senate floor.
It’s the fourth such year they’ve backed the bill by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, seeking to end the Lincoln and Tiverton casinos’ exemption from the state’s 2005 indoor smoking ban.
“For the last 20 years, there has been a grave injustice happening in our casinos,” Tanzi told the crowd. “These are our workers who are there day in, day out — they’re doing a service for our state.”
Tanzi’s proposal has yet to reach the House floor. But unlike previous years, casino workers now have some additional institutional backing. For the first time, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is a co-sponsor on Tanzi’s legislation.
Casino workers from 11 separate unions had help making noise from yellow and purple-clad striking Butler Hospital workers who gathered at the State House Tuesday to call on House Democrats meeting for a budget caucus. The Butler workers, who are members of SEIU 1199NE, want lawmakers to prioritize any state funding intended for hospitals for wages and staffing for frontline staff. 
“Workers deserve a smoke-free workplace,” Jesse Martin, the executive vice president of SEIU 1199NE, told the crowd. “People deserve the ability to do their work free from injury, free from these types of concerns.”
Across the rotunda, companion legislation sponsored by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski has still yet to be heard by the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming chaired by the chamber’s newest majority leader: Frank Ciccone III.
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, has been a staunch opponent of the ban citing concern that the state would lose millions in revenue should smoking completely disappear from the two casinos.
It’s the same position shared by the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, whom many advocates saw as the main reason smoking still remains inside Rhode Island’s casinos.
Newly-elected Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has previously stated she personally supports a smoking ban. But she also indicated that she would like to see the standard committee review process play out.
But Ciccone is instead looking to reach an agreement between Bally’s and the union to expand existing non-smoking areas in the casinos. Ciccone said in an interview Tuesday that talks remain ongoing.
“If anything looks fruitful, we’ll set up another meeting with everyone again,” he said in an interview Tuesday. “Hopefully we’ll get closer.”

Whether Bally’s wants to expand its nonsmoking offerings — or reduce the size of the smoking area — is still being kept under wraps.
“We don’t have anything to report right now on the smoking issue,” Bally’s spokesperson Patti Doyle said in an email Tuesday. “Will certainly share updates when/if we do.”
Union leaders remain adamant that a compromise won’t solve the problem.
Matt Dunham, president of Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, told Rhode Island Current that even with a larger non-smoking section at the state’s two casinos, some workers would still be exposed to smoke.
“A lot of people are going to be left out,” he said in an interview before the rally. 
Dunham pointed to the 2024 non-smoking expansion at Bally’s Lincoln casino, which he said has flaws.
“We still have to walk through cigarettes to get to our own break room,” he said.
Ending Bally’s smoking ban exemption is also a top priority for the AFL-CIO, which commissioned a poll in February that found nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban at the state’s two casinos.
“We’re taking the lead from the workers,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO Political Director Autumn Guillote said in an interview just before the rally. “And the demand is still 100% from the advocates.”
Vanessa Baker, an iGaming supervisor at Bally’s Lincoln casino, said staff are constantly “abused and assaulted” by the second-hand smoke that lingers throughout the two Rhode Island facilities.
“The Rhode Island casinos are allowing the safety and wellbeing of their employees and patrons at risk and showing that their employees are expendable,” Baker said. 
There was a time when smoking was temporarily banned inside Bally’s two Rhode Island casinos: when they first reopened after being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But those rules were eventually lifted by March 2022.
“And all our lives changed for the worse,” Baker said.
Philip Farinelli, a floor supervisor at Bally’s Twin River Lincoln Casino, told the crowd he has dealt simultaneously with stage 3 neck and head cancer and stage 1 lung cancer, along with a heart attack, because of conditions caused by lingering smoke.
“I’m still here fighting today so I can work in a healthy environment,” he said. “We all suffer — nose running, eyes itching — it’s just every day, it’s terrible.”
Maegan Tikiryan, a server and bartender at Bally’s Lincoln for 14 years, said she regularly deals with congestion and headaches from the casino’s smoke. She’s said she’s seen three coworkers diagnosed with cancer and is worried it could happen to her as she begins to pursue a law degree at UMass Law.
“I don’t want the smoke to kill me before I earn my degree,” Tikiryan said.

Spencer Cox is among 20 Republican governors who have sent a gushing letter to President Donald Trump expressing support for his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill that’s been held up as U.S. House Republicans continue to fight over it. 
“As Republican Governors, we stand UNITED in strong support of your One, Big, Beautiful Bill,” the governors wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. “This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival.”
They added that the bill “truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
Giant tax and spending bill in U.S. House remains snagged by GOP disputes

The massive, 1,116-page bill package includes sweeping tax breaks and controversial cuts of more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health program for low-income individuals and those with disabilities. However, negotiations continue over the bill and it’s not yet clear whether it has the support it needs from the U.S. House Republicans’ slim majority.
Earlier Tuesday, Republicans who have yet to rally behind the bill huddled in Speaker Mike Johnson’s office to hash out agreements on Medicaid and other outstanding issues. Johnson said he hopes to pass the legislation this week, though he didn’t appear to have the votes as of Tuesday afternoon. 
Even as the bill remains snagged, Republican governors signaled to the president that he has their support, writing “after four long years of tremendous hardship under President Joe Biden and (Vice President) Kamala Harris, the American people cannot wait any longer for Congress to enact the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”
“The American people have witnessed the tireless work undertaken by you and your administration to reverse the disastrous consequences of President Biden’s failed and often illegal policies,” the governors’ letter says. “You have demonstrated a commitment to using every ounce of Executive authority available to reinstitute fiscal sanity, fight the deep state, secure our borders, and achieve energy dominance.”
‘Counterproductive and cruel’: Advocates form coalition to protect Medicaid from federal cuts

Cox and other governors also called on Congress to act to “fully and permanently implement” Trump’s “America First agenda.”
“Thankfully, your One, Big, Beautiful Bill would accomplish this,” their letter continues. “It would provide you with the resources you need to permanently secure the border, remove barriers needed to truly unleash American energy production, protect Americans by making a once-in-a-lifetime investment in military technology that once seemed like science fiction, give working class families tax cuts worth thousands of dollars each, and ensure your administration has the tools needed to deport illegal alien murders (sic) and rapists.”
They concluded their letter saying they agree that Republicans must “UNIFY around this unprecedented piece of conservative legislation.” They added that “we cannot miss this chance to save taxpayers $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.”
“We stand by your side and will support you in any way to ensure this necessary piece of legislation is enacted,” the governors wrote.

Boise State Public Radio)This story was first published by Boise State Public Radio on May 20, 2025.
The federal government is suing a small Idaho town for denying a conditional use permit to let a far-right, evangelical church hold services in its downtown.
City Council members in Troy, Idaho, which is about 12 miles east of Moscow in Latah County, denied the permit to Christ Church elder Matt Meyer in March 2023 and a subsequent appeal.
The Department of Justice said in a press release Tuesday that denial was based on animus against the church and its teachings, which violates the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

Boise State Public Radio explored Christ Church and its ideology in-depth in Extremely American: Onward Christian Soldiers. The church stresses strict gender roles and advocates for limiting civil rights for women and those who don’t follow its interpretation of Christianity.
“RLUIPA unequivocally forbids local governments from deciding zoning matters based on their dislike of certain religious groups,” said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
Meyer had purchased a former bank building along the city’s main street, which had been vacant for about a year.
Meyer planned to split the property between office space and event space, including exclusive Sunday use for religious services by Christ Church.
At the time, Troy’s land use ordinance required conditional approval from the city for any new church, regardless of the zone in which it would be located.
Nearly all public comments submitted opposed issuing the permit – several of which included pushback against the church’s conservative ideology.
“The City of Troy welcomes any church to our community,” the denial states. However, it must be denied because the church’s use of the property “… is against the will of the people and will have a negative effect on the City’s ability to grow its business community.”
Just last month, Troy City Council members adopted a new land use ordinance banning 39 different uses within the central business district, including churches and religious facilities.
The suit asks a federal judge to force the city to grant the church permission to worship at the location, along with mandating training for city personnel on federal religious discrimination laws.
A request for comment from the city’s attorney wasn’t immediately returned Tuesday afternoon.

(Photo courtesy NV Energy)Doug Cannon, president and CEO of NV Energy for the last six years, is leaving the post to join American Electric Power Transmission, according to a news release. 
Cannon will be replaced by Brandon Barkhuff, who currently serves as a vice-president, general counsel, and chief compliance officer for NV Energy, according to a statement from the utility. 
“Brandon is a lifelong resident of Nevada, providing him with a strong understanding of the needs of the customers and communities NV Energy serves,” spokesperson Meghin Delaney said.
Cannon’s departure comes amid a call from regulatory staff at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission for an investigation into allegations that NV Energy overcharged some 80,000 customers statewide by at least $17 million, then failed to fully refund them. 
Cannon, while president and CEO, shepherded legislative approval for Greenlink, a massive transmission project that was partially rejected by regulators out of concern for the cost to customers. 
In 2021, Cannon told lawmakers that ratepayers would not be on the hook for Greenlink’s estimated $2.5 billion cost for at least five years.  
“We will put thousands of people to work today and Nevadans will not be asked to pay for this investment until at least five to six years down the road.” Cannon told legislators.
A year later, NV Energy asked federal regulators to grant permission (called incentives) for the utility to come back and request that ratepayers offset the costs of the project’s construction and pay for its troubles should Greenlink be canceled. 
Greenlink’s estimated cost has since ballooned to $4.2 billion.

(Photo provided by Gadsden Independent School District) While the State of New Mexico reported gains in its most recent high school graduation rates, they still remain below the national average.
According to recently released graduation rate data by the state Public Education Department for 2024, the state’s average graduation rate was 78.04%, or 20,375 students, which reflects an increase of over one percentage point from the 2023 rate.
The 2024 rate also marks the state’s highest graduation rate and the largest number of graduating students in the last 15 years. 
“This increase reflects the hard work of our educators, students and families, and it underscores our shared commitment to student success,” PED Secretary Mariana Padilla said in a statement. “At the same time, we recognize that too many students are still not making it to the finish line—and we must continue working together to ensure every student has the support they need to graduate.” 
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, a nonpartisan federal statistical agency, the national high school graduation rate has been about 87% since the 2021-2022 school year. 
Some districts have met the national rate, such as Gadsden Independent School District in the southern part of the state, which has been on par with the national average for several years.
GISD Superintendent Travis Dempsey told Source NM the district’s success does not boil down to just one factor, but multiple steps teachers and administrators have taken. For instance, he said, the district partnered with outside consultant Marzano Resources for additional support. 
The district also releases students two hours early every Wednesday to allow teachers to participate in “professional learning communities” to learn from one another and improve individual instruction. 
“A third factor, I would say, is we’ve really tried very hard to come at this from a perspective that we have to meet our kiddo’s needs, basic needs, before we start trying to press in academically,” Dempsey told Source. 
He pointed to breakfast and dinner programs in several schools, as well as an addition of six mental health therapists to the district’s secondary schools. He added that Career Technical Education programs have also allowed students to explore and meet their needs in other areas. 
“Please don’t think that we’re perfect, because we are far from that, but I think that’s part of the success that you’ve seen over the last couple of years,” Dempsey said. “Stability in a district makes all the difference in the world, in my opinion. And listening to your…community about what they think is important.”
He told Source that because GISD encompasses multiple rural communities in Doña Ana and Otero counties and students often come from low income families, parents have voiced that they feel their children get limited experiences. To address this concern, Dempsey said the district tries to bring experiences to the students and “put learning tools in their hands as much as” possible.  
Dempsey added that GISD also has a low staff turnover rate, which contributes to the stability of the district, its schools and the students. 
“When we hire a teacher, we typically keep them for a whole career,” he said. “And it’s very common that many of our teachers are from Gadsden, so we get a lot of people who come back home to serve their community. And that fact just does wonders for us.”
According to the PED news release, improving graduation rates throughout the state is a primary goal of the department’s strategic plan. The department noted that about 2,400 more high school students need to graduate on time annually for the state to reach the national benchmark by 2027. 
The department added that districts that reported higher graduation rates typically all closely monitor students’ course completion; identify and support at-risk students early; implement school improvement plans; participate in CTE programs; and have students set personal goals before entering high school. 
“Our kids work hard,” Dempsey said. “There’s a culture here in Gadsden of, we expect kids to perform, and they do.”

Greg Gianforte vetoed two bills respectively designed to make the executive and judicial branches of government more transparent to the public — but acknowledged the public’s strong right to know in the Montana Constitution.
In a veto letter, Gianforte also acknowledged his frustration with “judicial activism.”
House Bill 271 was aimed at ensuring transparency by the executive branch by limiting “executive privilege,” or the governor’s power to withhold specific government information.
Senate Bill 40 would have required Montana Supreme Court deliberations to be recorded and, after a case closed, be made available to the public.
Gianforte, a Republican, vetoed both bills on Friday using similar rationale, and proponents of HB 271, including the bill sponsor, soon pushed back against “secret decisions” made by the executive branch.
However, University of Montana law school faculty member Constance Van Kley said the rationales offer consistency, and she said members of the public don’t lose any rights to information and remain free to request government documents.
“Fundamentally, what it reinforces is that … the existence of privileges from the right to know raises constitutional questions, and the scope of any privilege that is asserted against the right to know raises legal questions,” Van Kley said.
 ‘Chill candor among justices’

In his veto letters, the governor said although the Montana Constitution “contains some of the strongest — if not the strongest — rights to public information,” limitations exist.
He said during the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention, delegates acknowledged that privileges, “such as judicial privilege,” shape the scope of the right to know, or allow for some information to be protected.
Gianforte said legislators passed SB 40 “in response to rampant judicial activism,” and he understands and shares their “deep frustration” and sees it “as a threat to our constitutional order.”
“Time and time again, judges across Montana issue rulings that infringe on the Legislature’s policymaking authority and a governor’s ability to faithfully execute the laws,” Gianforte said in the letter. “The effect of Senate Bill 40, however, will chill candor among justices against the public’s interest and weaponize those discussions in future litigation.
“Legal arguments will no longer be properly focused on majority decisions of the court and discussion among justices may become less honest and robust.”
Van Kley said the delegates in 1972 generally wanted openness in government, but with limits.
“At the Constitutional Convention, the delegates were really focused primarily on transparency and not exceptions to transparency,” Van Kley said. “However, they did recognize that judicial deliberations were generally not open to the public already, and so that did seem to be on the delegates’ minds as an exception to the transparency provision.”
 ‘“Right to know” will die’

The governor used a similar argument in his veto of HB 271, although he also cited the Montana Supreme Court’s order in O’Neill vs. Gianforte.
In that case, a citizen and former government official, Jayson O’Neill, sued the Governor’s Office after it would not provide him forms used to track legislation, citing executive privilege and the need for candor in decision-making.
The Supreme Court found a gubernatorial privilege is “necessary to the integrity of government,” but it also said it is not an absolute privilege, and the governor must meet “a high bar” to keep information private.
In the veto letter, the governor said HB 271 attempts to repeal a “constitutional privilege,” and signing it into law would be contrary to the public interest.
“House Bill 271 categorically limits a governor’s constitutional expectation of privacy where he is executing his constitutional duties,” Gianforte said in the letter.
Democrat Rep. Ed Stafman of Bozeman sponsored the bill, and he said earlier this year that it would “restore transparency and open government in the executive branch to what it has consistently been for at least 50 years.”
In the earlier interview, Stafman also said Montana hadn’t previously recognized executive privilege, the Supreme Court crafted a narrow decision based on common law, and the Legislature has the authority to overturn common law through statute, which his bill aimed to do.
In a statement this week about the veto, Stafman said it allows a backslide in Montana’s history of open government.
“Even as the judicial and legislative branches become more transparent, if we let the executive branch become the place where secret decisions are made and deals are cut, then that’s where the public’s constitutionally protected ‘right to know’ will die,” Stafman said.
The Right to Know in Article II Section 9 of the Montana Constitution states the following:

        “No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.”    
House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, also said Montana’s governor answers to the people, and previous governors, both Democrats and Republicans, have made documents available to the public.
“But Gov. Gianforte now sees himself above the law,” Sullivan said in a statement. “He is hiding documents from the public, battling transparency requests in court, bending the rules, and making new ones, all to hide from the people. What is he hiding?”
 Veto won’t make documents private — unless they already are

Van Kley said it would be difficult for other branches of government to claim privilege if HB 271 became law and was found to be constitutional.
That’s because, according to one view of privilege, it’s reasonable to expect that privileges among branches “should be roughly equivalent to each other,” said Van Kley, with the UM Alexander Blewett III School of Law.
Van Kley argued on behalf of plaintiff O’Neill in front of the Montana Supreme Court, so would speak only generally about the Constitutional issues it raised when contacted by the Daily Montanan on Tuesday.
In his veto letter, Gianforte discussed the same: “The Legislature itself has legislative privilege. Senate Bill 40 upsets the separation of powers by eroding the privilege of one branch of government while retaining it in another.”
Van Kley said the veto letter outlines a legitimate view of the separation of powers, and it is consistent with the veto letter for SB 40 which claims the judicial privilege is grounded in the separation of powers.
The order from the Montana Supreme Court, however, said gubernatorial privilege is among the “candor privileges,” such as those protecting the confidential relationship between a priest and churchgoer.
The order said those privileges are rooted not in separation of powers but in the “historical and practical need of society for candor between individuals and those from whom they are seeking counsel,” including government officials.
Van Kley also said the vetoes take off the table any questions about the constitutionality of the bills, and she said a citizen can still request records and claim a constitutional right to examine documents in Montana.
“The veto is not going to privilege any documents that aren’t already privileged,” Van Kley said.
Now that a court ruling recognizes executive privilege “to some degree,” Van Kley said she expects specific questions to emerge and end up litigated.
In January 2025, the Montana Supreme Court directed the district court to do a private review of the documents O’Neill had requested to determine whether they were protected or could be released to the public.
The case was filed in 2021 and is pending.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerWe’re now well into overtime, at least compared to legislative sessions past, under the Golden Dome. Committee agendas are looking light, but floor calendars have been packed — and word is it won’t be until next Friday, May 30, that the House and Senate gavel out for the session. So, what will the next two weeks in the Statehouse look like?While legislators have already sent Gov. Phil Scott their proposed state budget for the upcoming fiscal year — typically their last act before adjournment — there are still several major bills working their way through the building that deal with some of the headline issues from last fall’s election. Top of mind this week is lawmakers’ landmark education bill, H.454. The legislation — which faced sharp criticism last week as it was voted out of the Senate Finance Committee, including from committee members who voted for it — could be up for consideration on the Senate floor this week, though there was uncertainty Tuesday over how, exactly, that process would go. The House and Senate are far apart on several key provisions in the legislation.There’s also S.127, which contains a smorgasbord of housing policy changes including a new program to finance infrastructure for housing, such as water lines and sidewalks. The House Appropriations Committee approved the bill Tuesday, but lawmakers are expecting to consider further changes to it Wednesday before taking it up on the House floor Thursday. Meanwhile, there’s H.91, a bill that would create an off-ramp to the state’s mass use of motel rooms as a primary form of emergency shelter. That bill was voted out of the Senate Appropriations Committee Tuesday and is also set to come up for a floor vote Thursday.Lawmakers need more to fill their time, though, (and to justify those per diems,) than just voting on key bills. House committees are planning to hold hearings on the implementation and efficacy of past legislation and, in some cases, are set to take field trips to sites and projects that are relevant to their work, according to Conor Kennedy, chief of staff for Speaker Jill Krowinski.Committees are also taking a close look at the role of federal funds in different areas of state government — and preparing contingency plans for what would happen if President Donald Trump’s administration pulls that funding, as it already has in some cases, Kennedy said.    House and Senate leaders, he added, expect their annual adjournment resolution to include language that would allow Krowinski and Sen. Phil Baruth, the Senate President Pro Tempore, to call their colleagues back into session if the state loses certain amounts — still to be finalized — of its federal funding. The governor could also, under his existing authority, call legislators back if he thinks it is necessary.“I think we’re all hoping that we do not have to come back, right? Everyone’s got normal jobs, and seeing family and stuff,” Kennedy said. “But we’ll see.”— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowGov. Scott told Baruth and Krowinski at a meeting Tuesday afternoon that he would use his power to call legislators back into session after they’ve adjourned for the year if they do not pass an education reform bill first, Baruth told his Senate Democratic colleagues at a caucus meeting Tuesday evening. The meeting focused on the prospects of the Senate’s version of H.454, and a number of senators expressed displeasure with the current state of the bill. The governor “did say that we wouldn’t be going home until it was done,” Baruth said. H.454 had been scheduled for a vote on the Senate floor Wednesday, but toward the end of Tuesday’s meeting, Baruth said he now plans to skip over it and allow more time for his caucus to build consensus around what should be included. In its current form, “a majority of our caucus cannot vote for what’s come out at the end of the process,” Baruth said. — Shaun RobinsonForty-four Vermont state legislators joined more than 500 of their colleagues from other states in signing a letter to the majority and minority leaders of the U.S. House and Senate, calling on them to oppose language in the budget bill working its way through Congress that would block patients using Medicaid insurance from accessing care at Planned Parenthood clinics. — Kristen FountainOn the moveThe Senate approved H.238, a bill that seeks to ban PFAS chemicals from dental floss, cleaning products and containers treated with fluorine from being manufactured or sold in the state. The chamber added new language to prohibit sales of firefighting protective gear containing PFAS, including respirators. Firefighters have particularly high exposure to PFAS from the chemicals’ prevalence in their gear and fire-fighting foam. The occupation also carries a higher risk of cancer, which scientists suspect is linked to heightened PFAS levels in their blood.  With the addition from the Senate, the bill now makes its way back to the House for a vote. If passed, the bill would expand existing state law that keeps the chemicals out of cosmetics, menstrual products and other consumer products. Bans on different categories of product take effect at different dates through mid-2028. The ban on firefighting gear and respirators would go into effect in mid-2029 and 2032, respectively, following a report from the Agency of Natural Resources on their availability and cost at the end of 2028.— Olivia GiegerGov. Scott has already signed several bills into law this week, including the so-called “yield bill,” which sets property tax rates for the upcoming fiscal year. Property taxes are the primary source of revenue for public education in the state.This year the average property tax bill increase will be 1.1%, a sharp contrast to last year’s average increase of 13.8%. However, achieving that low tax rate required allocating over $40 million in surplus funds to the task as well as a $77 million transfer from the general fund. That plan did not sit well with some legislators, and it also drew a warning from the governor:“Buying down rates year after year isn’t good fiscal management and we should only view this as a bridge to the real education transformation our system needs,” he said in a written statement. “Before this session adjourns, it’s critical we work together to deliver an education bill that sets us on a path to a better more sustainable funding system, a more efficient and effective governance structure, and a commitment to doing the education quality work needed to make sure all students have access to educational opportunities, at a price Vermonters can afford.”— Kristen FountainVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: It’s T-minus 2 weeks until the Vermont Legislature plans to adjourn.

Lawmakers are taking up library books as conservative activists around the state pore over material in young adult and teen library sections for sexual content.
The post Legislative panel pursues bills to regulate Wyoming library books with sexual material appeared first on WyoFile .","TORRINGTON—A Wyoming legislative committee decided Tuesday to draft bills to police books in libraries, taking steps down a constitutionally fraught path out of concern that literature dealing with sexuality and gender identity can corrupt minors.
Lawmakers are reviewing the content of library books, which has become a national crusade by religious conservatives, as activists and lawmakers around the state pore over material available in young adult and teen sections of libraries, hunting for sexual content.
They have focused specifically on books exploring LGBTQ+ issues that are written for young people, though some books dealing with issues like drug use are also under the microscope. 
In Torrington, the Joint Judiciary Committee voted nearly unanimously to draft bills that would remove books containing sexually explicit materials from the children’s sections of libraries, and also police minors’ access to library materials accessible online. 
The first and more consequential bill draft, as proposed by Casper Republican Rep. Jayme Lien, would list out specific sexual acts and rule any literature depicting them as sexually explicit material. It would also punish librarians with criminal and financial penalties if minors gain access to such books, and allow citizens to bring civil actions against library officials they believe are violating the rules.
Some lawmakers on the committee said they were voting for the bill draft to carry the policy discussion forward, but would likely later oppose the penalties in the legislation — a chief concern of the Wyoming Library Association.

Any such penalties are also a concern of the Wyoming Education Association, that group’s lobbyist Tate Mullen told the committee. His organization, which represents the state’s professional educators, worries that any effort to penalize librarians could hurt efforts to attract and retain teachers and school staff for Wyoming. 
Rep. Ann Lucas, a freshman lawmaker endorsed by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, has led the charge to involve the Legislature in the selection and placement of books in public libraries. At Tuesday’s meeting, the Cheyenne lawmaker brought a bag of books, some checked out from libraries and some she had purchased herself, which she said contained material inappropriate for children.
“I sat here for the past week and I went through a lot of books and I looked for all the nasty words,” she told the committee. Lucas put sticky notes on certain pages in the books, and one title in particular, the book “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe, drew the committee’s opprobrium. 
“I don’t think there is a single person up here … that would look at this book ‘Gender Queer’ and think it belongs in a children’s section,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne. 
The only no vote on Lien’s bill draft came from Rep. Kenneth Chestek, a Laramie Democrat and University of Wyoming law professor, who said he feared the Legislature would struggle to regulate books without running afoul of the U.S. Constitution. In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that regulation of materials as obscene must pass what’s called the Miller test, after a 1973 case. In Miller v. California, the justices found that for material to be considered obscene under the law, it had to lack serious “literary, political or scientific value.”
Lawmakers asked Wyoming Library Association President Lindsey Travis and other bill opponents several times if they thought copies of Hustler, a pornographic magazine, should be available to minors. Travis responded that Hustler was considered obscene under the law and pornography wasn’t available in the library. The books in question aren’t the same thing, she said. 
“Gender Queer” is described by the author as a memoir written as a graphic novel. Through words and drawings, it recounts the author’s experiences as an adolescent and young adult grappling with her gender identity, and includes explicit depictions of masturbation and later sexual encounters as the author enters adulthood. Kobabe wrote the book for young people facing similar turmoils, according to an online interview with Michigan news outlet MLive, and considers it most appropriate for high school students. 
“I felt very alone in my gender experience as a teenager and I’m very grateful that as an adult I’ve been able to share this and I’ve been able to build such a loving and strong community out of sharing,” Kobabe said in the interview, in which the author called for tolerance from people seeking to ban or isolate the book.
“Even if they can’t see the value of this book, it could be valuable to someone else,” Kobabe said of crusaders against the text. “Just let it be, as a resource, one among many in a community, and know that the people who read it will mostly be the people needing it.”
In Wyoming, Kobabe’s book is located on bookshelves in the young adult or adult sections, Travis told WyoFile. What ages are considered young adult is a decision made by each local library, Travis said, but it generally includes teenagers. Libraries pick their own collections and display locations, she said. They are governed by local library boards, and the Legislature’s efforts would take some of that control away. 
“Wyoming libraries are locally controlled, and I think we need to maintain that,” she said. 
But lawmakers worried that children could access “Gender Queer” and other books as they roam through libraries, regardless of what shelves they’re placed on. The practicalities of keeping younger children away from books for adults and teenagers weren’t substantively discussed at the meeting in Torrington, though Lucas noted the public library in Cheyenne keeps its young adult section in an area of the library that doesn’t sit behind closed doors.

Wyoming libraries have drawn conservatives’ ire, particularly when they highlight LBGTQ+ literature in special sections or social media posts. In Campbell County, for example, where the political dispute has played out most sharply, trouble started in 2023, after the library highlighted a series of such books for Pride Month. 
Furor over that post kicked off sustained scrutiny of books in the Gillette library from a group of local residents. That conflict ended with the firing of a library director who had resisted such efforts, and the regulation of certain books to a special library section. The library board later ended the special section, and placed the books into the adult section of the library, current Campbell County library director John Jackson told WyoFile on Tuesday.
The ousted-director, Terri Lesley, has sued both a local family and government officials for discrimination and wrongful termination. The two lawsuits accuse residents of harboring clear bias against LGBTQ+ people and lifestyles, and violating the First Amendment in their quest to limit access to books on the topic.

“Do you know that discretion is allowed?” Eva Vekos said on one of the recordings to a state police trooper processing her on the DUI offense. She added, “No photographs. My face is not going to go out in the paper.”

Screenshot from video footage provided by the Vermont Department of Public SafetyThe state Department of Public Safety has released audio and video recording of the arrest of Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos on a charge of drunken driving more than a year ago.The recordings, which include videos from troopers’ body worn cameras and dash cam footage from a cruiser, show about two hours of interactions between police and Vekos, mostly after she was taken into custody. The recordings, however, do not capture all the interactions that led up to the arrest, including some instances when troopers reported observing the prosecutor allegedly slurring her speech and smelling of alcohol, according to charging documents.The recordings and the Vermont State Police troopers’ observations of Vekos may prove critical in her case since Vekos refused a breath test that could have shown a measure of any intoxication.The release of the recordings follows a decision earlier this month by Judge Timothy Tomasi in Washington County Superior civil court ruling in favor of the Vermont Journalism Trust, the parent organization of VTDigger, which brought a lawsuit seeking the recordings.  Tomasi, in his decision ordering the release of the recordings to VTDigger, told the state Department of Public Safety to produce the previously withheld records to the news outlet within 10 days, making Monday the deadline. The department provided the material Monday afternoon to VTDigger.
VTDigger filed the lawsuit after the Department of Public Safety refused to provide the recordings to the news organization. Officers from Vermont State Police, which is within the department, arrested Vekos.Vekos has pleaded not guilty to the DUI charge and a trial has not yet been set. A judge told attorneys in the case at a recent hearing that he expected it to take place sometime this fall. Vekos has continued to serve as the Addison County state’s attorney while the criminal case against her remains pending. The prosecutor’s post is an elected position.The recordings released Monday begin shortly before a trooper placed Vekos in handcuffs, put her in a cruiser and drove her to the state police barracks in New Haven to be processed for drunken driving. READ MORE
Vekos was arrested on the night of Jan. 25, 2024, after she allegedly drove impaired to the scene of a suspicious death investigation in Bridport, according to the charging documents.Recordings show very little interaction between Vekos and Trooper Kelsey Dobson, who was driving the cruiser, during the roughly 25 minute trip to the barracks, according to the released video. The videos do show that moments before Vekos was placed in the cruiser she was handcuffed by a trooper. She then walked a short distance from her vehicle, which was parked at the scene at the time, to a nearby cruiser. She appeared steady while walking and without any support before she took a seat in the back of the cruiser.  The recordings also don’t clearly show slurred speech, though the videos released do not show much of her interactions with police at the scene. At the barracks, the videos and audio recordings show Vekos appearing uncooperative at times, though never raising her voice when Sgt. Eden Neary, who conducted the processing, read her rights and questioned her.Vekos immediately told Neary when the processing began at the barracks she was not going to answer questions, take a breath test or have a mugshot taken.“Do you know that discretion is allowed?” she said to Neary, adding: “No photographs. My face is not going to go out in the paper.”“As far as discretion, we as a department don’t take any discretion with DUI,”  Neary replied.“There wasn’t any DUI,” Vekos said to him. “There was alcohol on the breath and alleged slurred speech.”“Which are enough indicators to request an evidentiary test, which you know as the state’s attorney,” Neary responded.Vekos then spoke about the impact the incident would have on her office. “We’ve been working really hard with law enforcement to build a good relationship and this is gonna knock that really down and my office is going to suffer now,” Vekos said. “I’m not gonna argue with you about it,” Neary said to her. “That’s a discussion for another day, not right now.” Vekos then talked about how much she had to drink.“I came out to participate in a homicide scene investigation,” she told Neary. “I understand that, and I guess that’s where maybe your discretion would have been better used,” Neary said.“In what way?” Vekos asked him.“Well, if you knew you had a drink or two,” Neary said. “An hour ago – one – an hour ago with a meal,” she said. “It doesn’t make me inebriated.” Vekos spoke in a normal tone during the roughly 45 minute interaction with Neary. At times, she appeared to be crying.Charging documents in the case included an affidavit by Detective Trooper Mengbei Wang who wrote about being inside a residence in Bridport as part of the death scene investigation. Wang wrote in the filing that, while standing next to Vekos, she detected a “strong odor of intoxicants emanating” from Vekos and heard her slurring her speech.There is no body camera footage of Wang’s interaction with Vekos.Detective Trooper Ryan Normile, in a separate charging affidavit, wrote that he was present when Vekos arrived driving a Volkswagen Golf. Normile wrote that he walked beside Vekos at the scene and “recognized an odor of intoxicants emanating” from her  Later, as Vekos was sitting in her vehicle, Normile wrote that he asked her how much she had to drink that night. Vekos replied that she had one gin and tonic with a burger for dinner about an hour ago, Normile wrote in his affidavit.Normile wrote that Vekos’ speech appeared slurred and he asked her to undergo field sobriety tests, which she refused. Vekos, according to Normile’s affidavit, then asked him: “Are you serious Ryan, can’t you just have a friend come and get me?”Normile was not wearing a body camera, but footage from Dobson captured the interaction between Normile and Vekos as she sat in her vehicle before she was placed in custody. However, the exact words exchanged between the two at times aren’t entirely clear.Vekos can be heard saying that it doesn’t matter if she performs the field sobriety tests because she would be arrested anyway.“Eva, that is not true,” Normile replied. Adam Silverman, a spokesperson for state police, stated in an email Tuesday that since Wang and Normile are both detectives, they typically dress in business attire and “generally” do not wear body-worn cameras. “In addition,” Silverman wrote, “BWC policy requires activation of cameras during anticipated interactions with members of the public; in this case, the situation at hand was a controlled scene with access limited to law-enforcement personnel, including the state’s attorney. When the nature of this encounter changed, troopers activated their BWCs as required.”David Sleigh, an attorney representing Vekos on the drunken driving charge, said Tuesday that he has reviewed the audio and video footage from state police in the case and didn’t believe it indicated his client was guilty of the charge. “Other than showing that she was distraught and upset at being arrested, there doesn’t seem to be any clear indication of impairment or lack of control of her physical or mental faculties,” Sleigh said. “We think that largely the recorded evidence is consistent with innocence.”He also disputed that comments Vekos made to police indicated any intent to seek favoritism to get out of a DUI arrest, including when she asked them to use discretion, and when she requested to have a friend pick her up, rather than undergo sobriety tests. He said police “make discretionary decisions” at many points when considering whether to arrest someone for drunken driving. “I don’t take her requesting a ride home from somebody else as asking for a favor or admitting that she was impaired, but rather saying, ‘Look, if you guys have even the slightest concern about my ability to operate, I’ll have somebody else come get me,’” Sleigh added. Near the end of the video recordings of Vekos’ processing at the state police barracks, she can be heard asking a trooper about the status of her vehicle that was left parked at the scene she had been seeking to keep from being towed. A trooper replied that a tow truck had already been called to remove the vehicle. “Thanks,” Vekos said to him in apparent sarcasm, adding, “just a little consideration.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  State police release arrest recordings of Addison County state’s attorney on drunken driving charge.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Eva-Vekos-States-Attorney-Footage-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 19:06:29.763435

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal is investigating the cause of Tuesday’s early morning fire that engulfed the popular Matunuck Oyster Bar in South Kingstown.
No injuries were reported from the blaze that seriously damaged the waterfront restaurant on Succotash Road ahead of Memorial Day weekend. Heavy smoke and flames were coming from the restaurant at the time firefighters arrived at approximately 3:45 a.m., according to Associated Press reports.
“Currently, the cause of the fire is undetermined. Updates will be shared as they become available,” Matt Touchette, spokesperson for the fire marshal’s office said in an emailed statement.
Perry Raso opened Matunuck Oyster Bar in 2009, selling the fresh oysters harvested at the Matunuck Oyster Farm, the wading depth aquaculture farm he founded on Potter Pond in East Matunuck. The restaurant had commercial docks that facilitated access for work boats.
Restaurant employees surrounded Raso in a group hug outside the burned out building late Tuesday morning as firefighters continued to work at the scene.
Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training Chief Public Affairs Officer Edwine “Drine” Paul said a department official connected with the restaurant’s owner Tuesday afternoon. 
“The department is coordinating efforts with the restaurant to expedite our rapid response services to support all of the impacted workers,” Paul said. “We want to make sure that we support them at this difficult time.”
It was unclear how many employees worked at the restaurant. Raso was unavailable for comment.
Matunuck Oyster Bar has received numerous accolades, including making USA Today’s Restaurants of the Year list.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City federal judge on Tuesday put a two-week hold on the state’s enforcement of a law criminalizing immigrants living in Oklahoma without legal residency.
House Bill 4156 created the state crime of “impermissible occupation” last year. Federal District Judge Bernard Jones blocked enforcement of HB 4156 from June until March, when President Donald Trump’s administration dropped his Democratic predecessor’s lawsuit challenging the law.
Two undocumented immigrants living in Oklahoma and two organizations based in the state refiled the case this month. Jones agreed, like he did last year, that their case against HB 4156 is likely to succeed in court.
The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly found that control of immigration is an exclusively federal power, he wrote in his decision issued Tuesday. Jones found that federal law on this issue is likely to preempt state laws.
“Based on the comprehensive and exhaustive immigration framework that Congress designed, the Court is left with one conclusion: H.B. 4156 must fail,” Jones wrote.
Jones’ decision blocks enforcement of the law until June 3, but the order could be extended. 
The judge decided the undocumented residents could proceed under the pseudonyms Barbara Boe and Christopher Coe. His ruling also provisionally creates two classes of plaintiffs, an “Entry Class” including those who unlawfully entered the country and a “Reentry Class” made up of individuals who were deported and have returned to the United States.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the judge’s decision is “outrageous.” He said HB 4156 is essential to stopping drug trafficking and other illegal activities in the state.
“In the name of federal law, the court is protecting admitted lawbreakers from federal and state consequences,” Drummond said in a statement. “This is perverse, contrary to the rule of law, and we will be evaluating all options for challenging the ruling.”
Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma are leading the plaintiffs’ legal team.
“The court’s decision today is a victory for Oklahoma’s immigrant community, but the damage of HB 4156 and the national rhetoric repeated by local politicians has already created an environment of fear in our state,” ACLU of Oklahoma executive director Tamya Cox-Toure said in a statement. “No matter what someone looks like, sounds like, or what their immigration status may be, they should feel safe in their own communities. We will continue to fight for the rights and dignity of immigrants and their families.”

[…]","Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) at his weekly press briefing. May 20, 2025 | Photo by Ben SolisMichigan House Speaker Matt Hall said Tuesday that it wouldn’t be difficult to cut $326 million from state government to pay for road funding – but the items that could be on the chopping block include a key DEI and refugee resettlement program, arts and culture grants and money for the state’s COVID-19 Task Force.
Hall (R-Richland Township) keyed in on those items during a regularly scheduled news briefing with reporters. Although the House has yet to pass a budget like its Senate counterpart, Hall said his Democratic colleagues have told him that finding $320 million in cuts to divert to roads would be nearly impossible or costly to the state in the long run.
Not so, Hall said Tuesday, touting at the very least a potential framework for making deep cuts. The speaker said he and Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, were going line-by-line to find maximum benefit for taxpayers in their version of the budget.
Hall showed where they might be going with a slide presented during Tuesday’s briefing, 
The largest item on the block was $115 million in what Hall said were remaining corporate handouts. That includes $100 million in business attraction and community development money and $15 million for entrepreneurship ecosystem funding.
Additional cuts Hall noted that could be made included $61 million from other programs – the top line being $28 million from the Office of Global Michigan. The office is a creation of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration, and touts itself as the state’s arm in advancing equity and inclusion initiatives throughout the state. The office also facilitates smooth transitions for newcomers from foreign countries, immigrants, refugees and members of marginalized communities.
Of that remaining $61 million, Hall eyed $22 million in cuts from the COVID-19 Task Force, also created by Whitmer, and $11 million in arts and culture grants.

Hall did not mince his words on cuts for “corporate handouts.”

“None of them, and none of these things are resulting in any job creations,” Hall said. “We’re just saying local roads are probably more important to most people than these big corporate giveaways.”
Nor did he pull his punches at the various social programs that could see cuts.
“The COVID-19 Task Force. … What are these people doing?” Hall asked. “Are they going around asking people to wear masks still? I’ve talked about the arts and cultural grants. The Capital City Film Festival, barbershop quartets, I mean, it’s incredible. What’s more important, puppet art, or roads? I think most people in Michigan would say roads.”
Whitmer’s Office of Global Michigan was another area Hall appeared to see as expendable in any House-passed budget, saying that the initiative housed and subsidized “illegal aliens.” That office has been a target of Republicans for its Newcomer Rental Subsidy program, which they contend encourages illegal immigration by providing up to a year of rental assistance for “Refugees and other Newcomer population-eligible households,” even though eligibility is based on having a legal immigration status.
Another $150 million could be eliminated, he said, by cutting 2,900 unfilled state government positions, which Hall called phantom jobs. The speaker said the fact that the state hasn’t filled those positions was, in his view, a product of government expanding too quickly and without a plan. 
Overall, Hall said the slide illustrated that deep cuts were possible despite objections from the House chamber’s Democrats.
“It’s very easy to do, and there’s a lot more things that we could cut,” Hall said. “I just put this up here for simplicity to show you some things that we’re contemplating that are very easy to cut in this budget.”

“Vermonters have always been in the forefront of standing up for civil liberties, and they've always been in the forefront of standing against the abuse of governmental power,” said Sen. Peter Welch. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont delegation, municipalities take action to uphold the right to due process.","From left: Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Becca Balint and Sen. Peter Welch. Photos by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerOn Monday night, the towns of Shaftsbury and Bennington joined a growing number of municipalities that have passed a resolution condemning attacks on due process and affirming the rights of residents granted in the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, members of Vermont’s three-person congressional delegation have also been speaking out in recent weeks in defense of the Fifth Amendment — the right to not be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process — on the floor of the U.S. House, at rallies and in letters to officials in the administration of President Donald Trump. “Due process is the heart of enforceable liberty against overreach by government, and every citizen has an interest in being entitled to due process to restrict the government from arbitrarily arresting them,” said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., in an interview.“We’re seeing unprecedented use of arbitrary power in some of these recent cases” such as the international students who were detained in Vermont, Welch said. The Shaftsbury Select Board passed the resolution unanimously with little discussion. Board Chair Naomi Miller said she supported the resolution because due process rights are under “existential threat from the current government in Washington” and so she believes any action “people can take to resist the erosion of democracy is essential.”The Bennington Select Board passed the resolution 5-2 after ample discussion by members and the public. Tom Haley, the board’s chair, said the initiative to bring the resolution forward for discussion was “citizen-led” and he was grateful for the civil discussion of the resolution. Haley said he voted in favor because he knows that residents of Bennington, particularly LGBTQ people, immigrants and people of color, have expressed to him that they are afraid their due process rights will be violated, and he said he believes that in Vermont “you take care of your neighbors.”While the language of the resolution has been adapted to fit the context of each municipality, the “resolution condemning attacks on due process and affirmation the constitutional rights of all persons,” first passed in Rutland City on April 21, has served as a model for towns around the state.Michael Talbott, a member of the Rutland City Board of Aldermen who penned the original resolution, said the document aimed to show to residents, through a “symbolic action,” that their local governing body will uphold their due process rights, and he hopes that other local boards will take the resolution up.“It was meant to be reassuring to members of our community who are pretty scared and uncertain about the current moment and the future because of things going on at the federal level,” Talbott said. “I found statements made by the federal government to be pretty disturbing in that they run counter to the protections that are guaranteed to everyone in our country, regardless of citizenship status.”Acting nationallyWelch spearheaded a letter sent last week to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, calling for a hearing to evaluate the Trump administration’s infringement of due process rights in the case of the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Garcia was deported to a prison in El Salvador, where he remains, despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the administration has an obligation to facilitate his return and the Trump administration admitting Garcia was deported due to “administrative error.”Welch said Garcia’s case is among several instances of violations of due process, including the detainment of the Palestinian Vermonter Mohsen Mahdawi during a citizenship interview and of Rümeysa Öztürk by masked, plainclothes ICE agents outside her apartment for exercising their right to free speech. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., along with other congressional colleagues also held a press conference on April 29 calling for the release for Mahdawi after his detention without due process, before he was released a day later on April 30.The letter sent to Grassley also mentioned that Trump administration officials have said they are assessing the possibility of suspending habeas corpus, or the right against arbitrary detention, which Welch said is “an explicit threat to abuse executive authority.” Balint also spoke on the U.S. House floor Monday about her concern with the threat to the right of habeas corpus. She said only Congress has the right to suspend habeas corpus, and its suspension would mean the abandonment of a “core principle that no one in this country will be imprisoned unlawfully.”Acting Locally Welch said he is heartened and inspired by the governing bodies in municipalities around the state taking up resolutions to protect due process and constitutional rights.“Vermonters have always been in the forefront of standing up for civil liberties, and they’ve always been in the forefront of standing against the abuse of governmental power,” Welch said. Since the resolution passed in Rutland City, resident and U.S. Army veteran Peter Franzoni said he has sent the resolution to the town clerk or selectboard members of every municipality in Vermont and has attended board meetings in various towns to advocate for the resolution’s passage. Franzoni said he has taken action to drum up support for the resolution around the state because he believes that despite partisanship, people should work together to protect constitutional rights. “We’re being torn apart by all these other forces in our culture and our society. Right now, we can’t find any common ground, but the one common ground we all have is our Constitution,” Franzoni said. “It’s literally what binds us together as a nation, and if we start letting people chip away with it, it will be destroyed.” The selectboard for the town of Wallingford passed the resolution unanimously on May 5, and the town of Rockingham selectboard passed the resolution on May 6. The Brandon selectboard then passed the resolution unanimously on May 12, and the selectboards for the towns of Jericho and Pittsfield also unanimously passed the resolution on May 15. Several municipalities including East Montpelier, Rutland Town, Proctor and Middletown Springs have also placed the resolution on their agendas for upcoming meetings. The Burlington City Council passed a resolution on April 28 to uphold the constitutional right to free speech and the free press, free association and dissent and to express support for student activists Mahdawi, Öztürk and Mahmoud Khalil. Council Chair Ben Traverse said he adapted some of the language of the due process resolution, which had already passed in Rutland City at the time, and said Vermont’s political leaders on the local and national level will need to continue efforts and “band together” to uphold democratic principles. “I think that the free speech resolution and these due process resolutions are just the beginning — not the end — of various efforts that we’re going to need to undertake to support and maintain a resilient community,” Traverse said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont delegation, municipalities take action to uphold the right to due process.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bernie-Sanders-Becca-Balint-Peter-Welch-Vermont-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-20 19:06:29.763435

(Image from Iowa PBS video)Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig announced Tuesday he will not pursue a gubernatorial election and will instead seek another term as agriculture secretary.
Naig was one of the many Republicans considered a potential candidate in the race to succeed Gov. Kim Reynolds after she announced she would not seek reelection in 2026. Naig had said in April he and his family were “thoughtfully discussing that possibility.” But on Tuesday he said he had decided not to run, adding that there was “still work to be done growing our state and economy as secretary of agriculture.”
Naig has held his current position since being appointed in March 2018 after serving as deputy agriculture secretary under Bill Northey, who was appointed undersecretary for farm production and conservation in the U.S. Department of Agriculture during President Donald Trump’s first term in office. Naig won reelection in the 2018 and again in 2022 against Democratic challenger John Norwood.

SPRINGFIELD — A long-awaited bill to reform the Prisoner Review Board will soon go to Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk after receiving approval in the legislature Tuesday.

The House voted 74-37 to approve Senate Bill 19, which contains a series of reforms designed to include victims’ participation in Prisoner Review Board decisions. The measure now needs only a signature from the governor to become law.

The bill would give victims the right to file victim impact statements ahead of hearings, provide them with additional notice when their offender is granted early release, and allow them to seek an order of protection against an offender who is incarcerated.

It would also create the Office of the Director of Victim and Witness Services, which would ensure the board complies with victims’ rights, and mandates the board provide victims with contact information for the State Victim Assistance Hotline.

The bill also extends the terms for PRB members from six to eight years.

“The bulk of this bill is focused on ... making sure that victims, survivors, are more engaged in the process at PRB because unfortunately, too often, we’ve heard from victims and family members that they simply haven’t been given a voice in this process,” bill sponsor Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said.

Reforms pushed by the General Assembly last year failed to advance to the governor’s desk despite nearly unanimous support from the legislature. Pritzker opposed a requirement in the bill that board hearings to be livestreamed, and the bill was never called for a vote in the final days of last year’s session.

Guzzardi said the bill passed Tuesday includes many of the portions lawmakers agreed on last year, but many Republicans have expressed concerns the latest version was too weak compared to the previous version.

The reforms come after Crosetti Brand allegedly murdered an 11-year-old Chicago boy in 2024. That February, the board voted to release Brand, finding there was not enough evidence he had violated his conditions of release. His ex-girlfriend, Laterria Smith, was denied an emergency order of protection by a Cook County judge while Brand was imprisoned at Stateville in Crest Hill.

Brand was charged with attacking Smith the day after his release and killing her 11-year-old son, Jayden Perkins, who attempted to protect his mother. Two PRB members, including the board chair, resigned in the wake of the incident.

Brand’s history of domestic violence against women prompted both advocates and lawmakers to call for stricter review of prisoners’ backgrounds before their release.

Response to Sonya Massey’s death

Another bill needing only the governor’s signature to become law would change hiring practices for law enforcement agencies after it passed through the House on May 15.

Senate Bill 1953 would require all law enforcement agencies in the state to obtain all of the investigations, examinations and records about a potential hire from all entities that previously employed them. Previous employers and law enforcement agencies are required to release the information within two weeks of receiving such a request.

Sen. Doris Turner, D-Springfield, has been pushing for legislation in response to the death of Sonya Massey, a Springfield resident who was shot and killed in her home by a Sangamon County Sheriff’s deputy in July 2024.

The former sheriff’s deputy, Sean Grayson, was originally called to Massey’s home in Springfield about reports of a prowler. After not finding anything outside, Grayson and his partner spoke with Massey inside her home.

The deputies stood in the living room while Massey, with permission, removed a pot of boiling water from the stove in the adjoined kitchen. Massey said, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus” after comments from deputies about the hot water, then Grayson threatened to shoot her. Body camera video showed Grayson shooting her seconds after the threat as Massey apologized.

Grayson is awaiting trial on first-degree murder charges and has pleaded not guilty.

Following Massey’s death, Capitol News Illinois unearthed documents showing Grayson was disciplined at a previous job for disobeying orders from superiors, general aggression and posting about drug busts online. Grayson was also found to have lied about being honorably discharged from the Army.

“We can't legislate for judgment,” said the bill’s House sponsor Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, during a news conference last week. “What we can do is make sure that the answer that we got from the Sangamon County Sheriff's Department was that they did not know. That will no longer be the case when we pass this bill.”

Turner sponsored another bill in response to Massey’s death that would give Sangamon County residents the power to recall an elected official, like the sheriff. Cook County already has the power to hold recall votes.

Senate Bill 1954 passed through the Senate but hasn’t made its way through a House committee, meaning its passage could be an uphill battle.

“It's not done for this year,” Buckner said. “We just need to figure out what's going to happen in these next couple of weeks.”

Tornado-safe warehouses

A mile-wide EF3 tornado tore through St. Louis on Friday afternoon before crossing into Illinois and inflicting more damage in parts of Madison County. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado passed less than a mile from a complex of warehouses where a man was killed when a similar strength tornado demolished an Amazon warehouse in December 2021.

In response to the 2021 tornado, Illinois lawmakers convened a task force to issue recommendations on how to make warehouses safer in a tornado. In response to those recommendations, the House voted 83-28 Tuesday to pass House Bill 2987, which creates a series of new requirements warehouses must follow to protect their employees during a tornado warning.

""It’s very timely that I’m calling this today as I spent part of my Friday and the last three weekends hunkered down in the basement with a tornado coming through my area,” Rep. Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, said.

Read more: Task force recommends tornado shelters in warehouses following deadly 2021 storm

The bill now heads to the Senate. It requires warehouse operators to work with local first responder agencies to craft safety plans for severe weather. New warehouses would need to be built with shelter spaces compliant with building codes for tornadoes and other types of natural disasters.

The 2021 tornado hit as the Amazon warehouse was bustling ahead of the holidays. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado traveled through the south half of the building. The tornado first impacted the west-facing wall, causing it to collapse. That caused other structural failures, including the roof to collapse.

An Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigation into Amazon did not find any violations, according to the task force report. OSHA recommended the company review its severe weather procedures, ensure employees are provided training and participate in drills, have site-specific information about severe weather plans, and ensure audible warning devices are accessible. The warehouse was rebuilt and reopened in September 2024.

Loss of a National Endowment for the Humanities grant, which was 80% of its budget, led the 55-year-old organization to dramatically downsize come June. 
The post Wyoming Humanities staff cut from 6 to 2 following DOGE-driven funding freeze appeared first on WyoFile .","A banner atop the Wyoming Humanities’ website warns that its work promoting the stories and cultures that shape Wyoming “is at risk” after losing a federal grant and two-thirds of its staff as a result.
On Tuesday, the statewide nonprofit sent word of what it needs to keep the lights on without an $870,000 National Endowment for the Humanities grant that was abruptly frozen by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency in early April. Faced with losing 80% of its funding, the Wyoming Humanities Board recently decided to shrink its staff from six full-time employees to two, in order to keep the 55-year-old nonprofit from fully shuttering.

Shawn Reese (Wyoming Humanities)
“The whole situation is unfortunate,” Wyoming Humanities Executive Director Shawn Reese told WyoFile. “Congress had authorized direct funding to state humanities councils, and DOGE still decided to cut the funding. That was unexpected and questionable, but nevertheless, it’s the position that we’re in.”
Reese is among the four Wyoming Humanities employees whose positions will be eliminated come June 1. Other staff whose jobs are casualties of the federal funding freeze are Emy DiGrappa, executive producer; Lucas Fralick, program coordinator; and Katie Beuman Parrish, director of advancement. 

Chloé Flagg (Wyoming Humanities)
Chloé Flagg, formerly the director of grants and programs, was retained and named interim executive director. Michele Carter will stay on as the group’s director of operations. 
“We plan to continue to operate at the fullest level we can,” Flagg said. 
Wyoming Humanities will be able to sustain several programs despite its reduced state. Its grant program will continue thanks to the Wyoming Legislature, which appropriates funding for its community culture and Spark grants, Flagg said. The Wyoming Center for the Book program also is expected to continue, she said, as is Native American programming that mostly takes place on the Wind River Indian Reservation and in Teton County. 
Flagg, Carter and their board members in the months ahead will have to pick up the pieces and figure out what’s next for Wyoming Humanities. A strategic plan just completed in 2024 will need to be revamped.
“The work of Wyoming Humanities is more important than ever,” Wyoming Humanities Board Interim Chair Stacy Stebner said in a statement. “In times of uncertainty, we need more, not less, connection. More dialogue. More stories.” 
The soon-departing executive director, Reese, said he’s pleased his board isn’t dissolving the organization and is instead recalibrating and planning for a future likely to include much less government funding. Wyoming Humanities is one of many cultural, historical and art-focused organizations facing financial conditions right now that are forcing them to “regroup,” he said. 
“It’s going to take some time to understand what the revenue situation will be with a reduction in property taxes, but I think museums and libraries are going to be in a challenging position,” Reese said. “There’s just a lot of headwinds.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma House on Tuesday advanced a measure to lower the state’s income tax despite concerns it would have little impact on residents.
House Bill 2764 creates a process for ultimately eliminating the state’s income tax when revenues hit certain triggers.
The measure would initially reduce the state’s top income tax to 4.5% from 4.75%. 
It would also collapse the six income tax brackets into three.
Rep. Mark Lepak, R-Claremore, said the measure has safeguards to compensate for economic downturns. A tax cut would not occur if a revenue failure is declared, he said.
It would take nearly 20 years before the income tax could be eliminated, Lepak said.
Tax collections for the past 20 years on average grew at 4%, even when taxes were reduced, he said.
A 0.25% cut would cost state coffers about $340 million, Lepak said.
“While it will have a small amount of savings for those in poverty, it is not sufficient enough to really have an impact on their circumstances,” said Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa.
Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, questioned the timing of the cuts. Proposed federal changes to Medicaid could cost the state $841 million, she said. Congress is considering proposals that could require states to pick up more of the cost.
Cutting taxes is an effort to check a “political box” when there has been no substantial evidence that people want it, Pogemiller said.
“I think people would rather have daycare,” she said. “I think people would rather have health care. I think people would rather have good roads.”
Cutting the income tax by 0.25% equates to a Starbucks coffee a month for his constituents, said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City.
“Maybe if you add it up over a year, it’ll let them buy a couple dozen eggs,” Fugate said.
The state expects to have $3.5 billion in surplus, said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow.
“You reach a point as a state where you have so much surplus, you start to ask is it time we restore some of that back to the taxpayers to let them keep a little bit more of their hard earned money,” Hilbert said.
He said the bill was responsible.
It sets up a mechanism where an additional tax cut is only triggered if revenue projections are met plus more than what the tax cut would cost in terms of lost revenue to the state, Hilbert said.
Even if the triggers are met, the Legislature could still put a tax cut on hold, Hilbert said.
The measure passed by a vote of 74-19 and heads to the Senate for consideration.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Abbey Cutrer)Families of victims of a mass shooting at a Louisville bank in 2023 may proceed with their lawsuit against a firearms dealer who sold the shooter a semi-automatic rifle and accessories, a judge in Louisville has ruled. 
Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry in a Monday order denied attempts by defendants to dismiss the case, writing that the case arose “from one of the worst acts of mass violence this community has ever experienced.” 
“The court is required to take the allegations in the complaint as true and view the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. That is what this court has done here,” Perry wrote in his order. “As such, the litigation may continue in the ordinary course.” 
Six people died, including the shooter, and eight people were injured in April 2023 at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville. The shooter was an employee of the bank. One of the eight people injured, Louisville police officer Nickolas Wilt, was shot in the head while responding to the shooting. Wilt left a rehabilitation facility months later as he was recovering from his injury. 
Families of the victims brought a lawsuit in early 2024 against River City Firearms, the gun store that sold the shooter an AR-15, and against companies that manufactured accessories sold to the shooter at the store which included large-capacity magazines, a red-dot sight and a vertical grip for the rifle. 
Plaintiffs alleged employees of the firearms store should have noticed suspicious and erratic behavior of the shooter, who bought the weapon days before the shooting. The plaintiffs further alleged the manufacturers of the firearm accessories incentivize gun stores to upsell customers in a way “that places profits over safety.” 
Defendants had argued the lawsuit should have been dismissed because a federal law bars the plaintiffs claims from being heard. Congress has enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which protects firearms manufacturers, dealers and distributors from being held liable for crimes committed with their products.
Perry disagreed with those arguments in his order. 
“The plaintiffs here have carefully crafted their complaint to avoid the protections of the PLCAA,” Perry wrote.

The bill does provide exceptions for situations where public safety is at risk, under a court order and if the police officer believes the child is a danger to themselves or others.
A provision that would have gradually prevented young people under the age of 14 from being arrested and tried for a crime was stripped from the bill prior to Senate passage. Children under the age of 14 instead would have been diverted to a Juvenile Review Board, a community-based program designed to keep young people who have committed crimes out of the court system.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, noted that the Judiciary Committee had been discussing raising the age of arrest for several years. 
In 2021, the legislature voted to raise the minimum age of arrest from 7 to 10. In 2023, lawmakers introduced two bills — one to raise the minimum age of arrest to 12, and one that would have raised it to 14. Neither made it to a public hearing.
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, said on Tuesday that he strongly supports the prohibition of handcuffing young children, and believes the bill reflects “fundamental basic human rights and the dignity of young people.”
Kissel said the bill would give “wide latitude” for law enforcement officers to make a determination whether a young person is or is not a threat. 
Under the bill, law enforcement officers are not penalized if they place handcuffs on a young person when they mistakenly believe them to be older than they are. 
Kissel said the testimony at the bill’s public hearing clearly showed that the way police officers interact in communities directly affects whether a young person falls into a life of crime, and what law enforcement looks like to the community overall. He noted that for some young people, being arrested might be their first interaction with a police officer.
“If it’s all just automatically cuffing them and being rough and throwing them up against a wall and throwing them into the cruiser — that’s the first message. And it may send that person off on a course that’s not the best,” said Kissel.

Sen. Herron Gaston, D-Bridgeport, referred to the bill as “a step in the right direction to try and cure some of the societal ills around putting handcuffs on young people.”
Gaston said that because young people were still developing emotionally and cognitively, the “trauma” they experience while handcuffed will have a “lifelong impact on their psychological and mental well-being.”
He also noted the disproportionate number of Black people who are arrested and incarcerated and said that, for many years, he felt afraid to see a police officer walking nearby or driving behind him. He also said he felt the bill would help law enforcement better interact with those with autism or ADHD. 
“I think that [kids] should see our law enforcement profession similarly to how they see their teachers — you’re there to be guardian of the community, to help them to right wrongs when you see it, and to use other mitigating factors when appropriate to make sure that we are disciplining people appropriately,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HOUSE-SESSION-0520-SR-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Library of Congress photo)Thomas David Carruth, a former Monroe County district judge and deputy prosecutor, was sentenced Monday to two years in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI.
Carruth, 65, of Clarendon, was accused in 2022 of soliciting sex from the girlfriend of a defendant in his court. He had previously been admonished by the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission for unethical behavior over contact outside the courtroom with defendants appearing before him. The contact included allegations of soliciting sex from defendants, according to court documents.
  T. David Carruth, former Monroe County district judge
A federal grand jury indicted Carruth in January 2023 on three counts each of honest services wire fraud and interstate bribery and one count each of lying to the FBI and federal program bribery. A ninth count was dismissed ahead of his trial last year.
After a two-day trial in a federal court in Helena, a jury of six men and six women convicted Carruth on Aug. 30, 2024, only of making false statements to the FBI.
In a sentencing memorandum filed in April, federal prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge D. Price Marshall Jr. to upgrade the sentencing guidelines applicable to the crime from a maximum of six months to a maximum of 18 months in prison with a year of supervised release.
The memo cited Carruth’s “decades of abuse of authority, his ardent refusal to accept an ounce of responsibility for his misconduct, and his abhorrent behavior during trial” as reasons for a harsher sentence.
In the memo, Assistant U.S. attorneys Madison Mumma and Nicholas Cannon from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Peters with the Eastern District of Arkansas wrote that “throughout his career, Carruth has repeatedly abused [his positions of authority] for his own sexual gratification.”
An FBI search of Carruth’s electronic devices found surreptitiously-taken video of his nude stepdaughter and sexually graphic email exchanges with a court employee, according to the document.  
The memo also contains as exhibits the JDDC’s 2018 admonishment and a Feb. 11, 2025, letter to the court from Emily Abbott, executive director of the judicial disciplinary body.
“Before Mr. Carruth left the judiciary, I considered him to be one of the top five threats to the integrity of the Arkansas state-level judiciary,” Abbott wrote. She said his conviction was “a great relief” because it means he can no longer serve as a judge in Arkansas, but his inability to return to the judiciary or continue to practice law “is not an adequate punishment for misrepresentations to the FBI.”
“He is a predatory liar and has been for quite some time. My hope is that his sentence will match the magnitude of his actions,” Abbott wrote. 
Defense attorney Jeffrey Rosenzweig of Little Rock argued in separate memos that Carruth’s underlying conduct should not be considered in his sentencing and for probation.
In a court document, Marshall accepted the government’s position that Carruth’s behavior should be taken into consideration, and on Monday sentenced the former judge to 24 months with no required supervised release. He also allowed Carruth to remain free on bond and self-report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Aug. 22.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jacob-Trieber-Federal-Bldg-Helena-1024x456.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

DemasMichigan lawmakers on the state House Election Integrity Committee approved a bill Tuesday aimed at confirming if longtime non-voters are still eligible to vote before elections.
Many people have lost trust in elections, Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres) told lawmakers on the committee last week as he presented his bill, House Bill 4356, aimed to “clean up” the qualified voter file of eligible voters. Hoadley, whose 2022 House campaign was backed by President Donald Trump, remarked that after weeks of testimony from individuals, many of which question the integrity of the 2020 election where Trump lost to former President Joe Biden, that there are real doubts from Michiganders about the sanctity of electoral processes.
Speakers who have provided testimony to the committee over the first few weeks of the committee have included a Detroit-area pastor who delivered the benediction at President Donald Trump’s second inauguration in January and vocal critic of Michigan’s voter roll and co-founder of Check My Vote Phani Mantravadi.
House Bill 4356 would require the Michigan Secretary of State to send mailed notices to Michigan voters who have not voted in the last 10 years in order for them to confirm they’re still eligible voters who should remain on the qualified voter file.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Those notices would have to be sent to voters within 180 days after each general November election with information on what will happen if a response is not received. Parties interested in remaining on the voter file would have to complete and sign a card enclosed in the notice confirming their current address to their local clerk at least 15 days before the next election.
If the person does not submit the card or engage in a “voting-related activity” such as requesting an absentee voter application or updating their voter registration, they would have to confirm their current address at the polls before they could vote.
Upon receiving the card from a voter who would like to remain on the voter file, the local city or township clerk would compare the signature on the card to the one on file in the qualified voter file and if the signatures don’t match, the registration will be considered “challenged” and that person would have to provide proof of their residency and their voter certification when trying to vote.
The process of sending the notices and processing them will take time, Hoadley told the committee last week, but it’s “time well spent”.
The committee cleared the bill to be considered by the House as a whole with approval from all of the Republican members of the committee except for Rep. Joseph Fox (R-Fremont) who voted against the bill while the three Democratic members passed.
Oversight Committee Chair Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Twp.), who previously served as the clerk of St. Clair County, overseeing elections, supported Hoadley’s sentiments last week, telling the committee that whether elections have been secure or not in the past, there are plenty of people who have completely lost confidence.

Free.,Giant tax and spending bill in U.S. House remains snagged by GOP disputes,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/giant-tax-and-spending-bill-us-house-remains-snagged-gop-disputes,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House Republicans who have yet to rally behind the party’s “big, beautiful bill” huddled in the speaker’s office Tuesday as different factions tried to hash out agreement on taxes, Medicaid and a few other outstanding issues.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters before those meetings began there were “a number of loose ends to tie up” with deficit hawks and members from high-tax states, who are pressing to raise the state and local tax deduction, also known as SALT.“We got some hours ahead of us to work this out, and I'm very confident we will,” Johnson said. “I'm going to have a series of meetings that will begin right now in my office to try to tie up the final loose ends. This is a 1,100-page piece of legislation. We're down to a few provisions so we are very confident, very optimistic we can get this done and stay on our timetable.”Johnson hopes to pass the legislation this week, though he didn’t appear to have the votes as of Tuesday afternoon.Trump pays a House callThe smaller meetings followed a closed-door huddle between all the chamber’s GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump earlier in the day that didn’t quite have the intended effect of immediately convincing holdouts to vote for the bill.Trump, however, appeared to declare victory before leaving the Capitol.“I think we have unbelievable unity. I think we’re going to get everything we want,” Trump said after the morning meeting. “And I think we’re going to have a great victory.”House Republicans have an extremely thin 220-213 majority, requiring nearly every GOP lawmaker to support the 1,116-page package in order for it to reach the Senate.Getting SALT-yThe reconciliation bill currently proposes lifting the SALT cap from $10,000 to $30,000 for married couples filing jointly, with a phase-down for those earning $400,000 or more, but that’s not enough for Republicans from states most impacted by the aspect of tax law.New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota told reporters in the early afternoon that he would likely lose reelection if he can’t secure a better SALT agreement than what was on the table.“If I do a bad deal, I would expect my constituents to throw me out,” LaLota said. “If I did a deal at $30,000, my own mother wouldn't vote for me.”LaLota said Republicans leaders should prioritize a deal that benefits swing voters to avoid the party losing centrist members and possibly the House majority in the 2026 midterms.“If we win that one issue, they'll have a much easier November of 2026. And thus we'll be able to keep the House and do other fiscally responsible things for the next couple of cycles here, if we get this one issue right,” LaLota said. “Conversely, you get this issue wrong — you vote for a bad bill and you keep the cap low — those folks are getting thrown out of office, we lose the majority, and then we have an open border, then we have an impeached president, and then we have all the other things that America voted against.”LaLota said later Tuesday, after GOP leaders proposed different SALT cap numbers, that there was still “no accepted deal, yet the parties are talking a little more with an understanding of each other's position.”""Leadership understands better what our pain threshold is,” LaLota said. “We clearly rejected the $30,000 number that's in the Ways and Means bill.” He declined to say if the SALT Caucus was prepping a counteroffer for leadership, but said that staff were conducting “some research on some of the mixes of income caps and what SALT cap there would be and how much that would be valued at relative to the entire $4 trillion package.”‘Bad faith negotiation’Rep. Mike Lawler, a staunch supporter of raising the SALT cap for his constituents north of New York City, would not comment to reporters outside the speaker's office about a specific dollar amount but said there's an “improved offer” on the table.“We’re waiting on more details. We’ll have more to say later,” Lawler said.Speaking to Fox News in the hallway, he said, “I'm not going to sacrifice my constituents and throw them under the bus in a bad faith negotiation, which is what this has been by leadership and Jason Smith,” he said referring to the chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means.“We need to come to an agreement. We need to provide real and lasting tax relief, and that's what I'm fighting for, for my constituents. I respect the president … but I'll respectfully disagree,” Lawler said.Trump urged House Republicans Tuesday morning that raising the SALT cap benefits Democratic governors.Conservatives still unhappyComplicating negotiations, some far-right House Republicans remain opposed to the bill, saying it does not go far enough.Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who did not support the bill during a committee vote Sunday night, told States Newsroom Tuesday afternoon that his “concerns and problems still exist.”Roy argues the massive reconciliation deal does not reduce deficit spending enough, particularly with respect to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits.When asked whether lawmakers were approaching an agreement, Roy said “Not sure. We're still talking. We've had literally like five meetings today already.”Thune predictionsThe House passing the package this week would only be one of many steps in the long, winding process.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon, just after Johnson spoke during a closed-door lunch, that changes to the package are expected in the upper chamber.Thune said one of the major questions for GOP senators is whether the legislation holds “sufficient spending reforms to get us on a more sustainable fiscal path.”“I think most of our members are in favor of a lot of the tax policy and particularly those portions of the tax policy that are stimulative, that are pro-growth, that will create greater growth in the economy,” Thune said. “But when it comes to the spending side of the equation: This is a unique moment in time and in history where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about government spending.""Thune said that GOP senators would likely make “tweaks” to the tax provisions once the House sends over a package, especially around how long certain tax policy lasts.“They have cliffs and some shorter-term timeframes when it comes to some of the tax policies,” Thune said. “We believe that permanence is the way to create economic certainty and thereby attract and incentive capital investment in this country that creates those good-paying jobs, and gets our economy growing and expanding, and generates more government revenue.”",,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The state House is on track to pass its proposed budget that includes substantial raises for beginning teachers while cutting thousands of vacant jobs and delaying future tax cuts.
The House votes this week are a prelude to the coming negotiations between House and Senate budget writers who must reconcile the differences between two distinctly different spending proposals before sending a compromise plan to Gov. Josh Stein.
“We continue to give that tax relief while also making sure we’re investing in the state’s most important asset, which we believe are its people,” said House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) during a press conference Tuesday morning.
The House budget includes a 2.5% raise for state employees, with some of the money for raises coming from the elimination of thousands of jobs. Though the vast majority of the job cuts are to positions that are currently vacant, the total also includes about 62 currently filled positions, lawmakers said.
In addition to the 2.5%, the House budget allows state agencies and universities to use money saved by cutting vacant jobs for raises and retention bonuses.
The State Employee Association of North Carolina urged its members to tell legislators to reject that plan.
“Employees are stressed and burned out from trying to fill the gaps, ensuring citizens receive the services they pay for with their tax dollars,” SEANC posted on Facebook. “Robbing Peter to pay Paul is no way to run a state government and no way to treat dedicated career employees.”
Hall said the cut vacancies would free up money for agencies to use as needed, including to amp up pay for current workers. He said the decision to eliminate the jobs “doesn’t mean we can’t come back later and add those positions” back.
Contrary to the proposal for most other agencies, the House budget adds more than 60 driver’s license examiner jobs at the DMV and provides money to open new DMV offices in Fuquay-Varina, and in Brunswick and Cabarrus counties.
Legislators had said they would wait for an auditor’s report on the DMV before they put more money into the agency. But they have been inundated with complaints about long lines at DMV offices and unavailable appointments.
“All the members get a lot of questions about DMV,” said Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a lead budget writer. “We needed to respond to the needs that we’re hearing all across the state to get the wait times down.”
Nevertheless, the House Appropriations Committee rejected a proposed amendment from Rep. Mary Belk (D-Mecklenburg) for 10 more DMV self-service kiosks at a cost of $43,000, which would have doubled their number.
The House budget raises beginning teacher base pay from $41,000 to $48,000 in 2025-26 and to $50,000 the following year. The increases would rank the state first in the Southeast in beginning teacher pay. Average teacher salaries would increase 8.7%.
The House budget also restores salary supplements for teachers who hold advanced degrees.
When they get to the negotiating table, lawmakers in the House and Senate will have to talk through their different perceptions of revenue growth and related tax cuts.
The state’s 2023 budget built in up to three automatic personal income tax cuts in tax years 2027 to 2034 that depend on the state meeting revenue targets. The House budget changes those targets, meaning the state would need to bring in more money to trigger the next cut. That plan could delay future cuts.
“When we ran the numbers, Mitch and I had true concerns that we needed to adjust those numbers,” said Rep. Julia Howard (R-Davie). She and Rep. Mitchell Setzer (R-Catawba) are senior co-chairs of the House Finance Committee. “The first trigger is okay. The second trigger could create some problems, and that’s why we adjusted it so that second trigger is most likely not going to click in,” Howard said.
Population increases and inflation “caused enough concern” to make the change, she said.
Nonpartisan economists in the state budget office and the legislature have projected state revenue to drop in 2026-2027, as planned tax cuts take effect. Republicans have focused on cutting taxes since they took control of the legislature in 2011. In addition to incorporating graduated cuts in the personal income tax rate, Republicans are phasing out the corporate income tax. Corporations will pay no income tax after the 2029 tax year.
The Senate budget proposal added more revenue-triggered tax cuts. Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters last month that he did not believe the forecast and anticipated revenue will continue to grow.
House Republicans were less rosy in their assessment of the state’s financial future. “We’d need about an hour” to discuss the challenges they face, Lambeth said Tuesday morning. Chief among those challenges is uncertainty out of Washington.

“We made a strategic decision — let’s just assume that we’re going to continue business as usual,” Lambeth said. “When something comes down the road, we may have to reconvene and deal with those changes.”
In his budget request, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, froze the tax rate and urged Republicans to do the same. The governor has repeatedly warned of a coming fiscal cliff.
House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said Tuesday that the plan was a step in the right direction, getting “closer to what Gov. Stein proposed” on teacher pay and revenue concerns. But he criticized “cuts to public safety, public services and negative impacts on clean air and water efforts,” and the continued funding of school vouchers.
“Democrats will be offering amendments to improve our public schools, invest in health care for working families and protect public safety and clean air and water,” Reives said in a statement.
In the Appropriations Committee, Republicans took care to protect the voucher reserve fund, rejecting Democrats’ requests to shift relatively small amounts of money to support a program for high school students who aspire to teach, or for a pilot on sustainable teaching practices within the New Teacher Support program.
Democrats condemn corporate tax cuts, call for health and education funding
House Democrats took aim at the budget plan in a Tuesday afternoon press conference for spurning increases to health and education funding in favor of corporate tax cuts.
Putting forward their own proposal, entitled “Make Corporations Pay What They Owe,” the representatives focused their criticism on Republicans’ plan to lower the corporate income tax to zero by 2030, which they said will cause the state to lose about $2 billion annually. They also criticized the elimination of thousands of positions under the House budget plan, which they said will make North Carolinians less safe, healthy, and educated.

Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) condemned the plan for corporate cuts as a “house of cards” that “cannot be sustained.”
“This shortfall is not because our state spends too much taxpayer dollars on handouts to the poor or to our public schools or to immigrants — it’s because we have eroded revenue and put corporate interests over people,” Morey said.
Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake) focused her criticisms of the budget on health policy, calling out the House’s plan to eliminate 50% of funding for community-based mental health crisis services. “We cannot build a healthy economy by gutting the health of our people,” she said.
State employees also gave remarks during the press conference, including Charles Owens, a health care technician at Cherry Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Goldsboro. He singled out increases to state employee health care costs, including higher co-pays, premiums, and deductibles, despite health benefits being a key incentive to join the state workforce.

“We could deal with some of the wage problem, but now you increase our health care costs to the point where employees can’t afford to get sick,” Owens said. “It’s time to stop taking care of corporations and giving them tax cuts and start taking care of the people that take care of this state.”
Owens added that cutting positions at facilities like his, which house “the most vulnerable, exploited, and some of the most dangerous people in this state,” endanger the lives of state employees.
“It’s a safety issue. We’re understaffed, and as we were saying, 300, 400 positions — it may [not] sound like a lot to most people, spread across the number of hospitals, but for me and my staff, that’s one less person watching your back, that’s one patient that could sneak up and smack you in the back of the head with no recourse,” he said.
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) said Republicans’ lack of funding for public education runs counter to their stated aim of making North Carolina more attractive destination for corporate investment. She pointed out that the quality of local school systems is a key factor businesses rely on to determine the suitability of a location, in order to attract a skilled workforce willing to raise their families in the community.
“How do you attract qualified workers to move from other states to North Carolina if the school system where you’re going to put that entity isn’t very good?” Budd asked. “Put your money where your mouth is, pay for what you need, not for what you want.”
Nicole Price, associate executive director of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said it is critical for lawmakers to halt the cuts to corporate taxes and instead “reinvest in the future of our state.” She cited a petition that has garnered more than 1,800 signatures calling for the protection of public schools, health services, and other vital programs.
“Now is the time to invest in students’ future by investing in our schools,” Price said. “We can prepare every child regardless of gender, race, ability, family income, to reach their potential, but only if we truly commit to investing in our students.”
House Democrats registered some amusement that a few of their past proposals that had been derided when they submitted them had now made their way into the budget bill. Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) noted that she had proposed reducing the triggers for income tax cuts in March, citing the state’s revenue shortfalls, a change House Republicans have now adopted as their own. Likewise, Cervania had previously proposed a back-to-school tax holiday that’s now in the budget bill.
“Let’s be clear: there’s still a structural deficit. The triggers may have been adjusted, but the damage of revenue erosion continues,” Butler said. “We’re still asking our state to do more with less, and we’re doing it with a straight face. Meanwhile, the federal government has been quietly shifting costs to the states.”
Butler and Morey also expressed dissatisfaction with a lack of transparency and bipartisan engagement in the budget-writing process. Butler noted that she only gained access to the bill at 3:30 p.m. Monday when she was due to discuss it in committee at 8:30 a.m. the following morning. And Morey noted that the first item lawmakers received in their subcommittees was “an entire page” of restrictions barring amendments that would increase overall funding, allocate money to Helene relief, and make numerous other changes.
“They set the lines and we can’t draw out of the box,” Morey said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1812-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 21:44:38+00:00,CT Mirror,"With deadline approaching, CT lawmakers’ energy bill comes into focus",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-electric-rates-bill/,Latest draft of the bill includes measures to offer immediate relief and longer-term reforms to lower CT's electricity costs.,"When Senate Democrats rolled out their signature bill addressing Connecticut’s energy affordability crisis more than four months ago, the text intentionally left a lot to be desired. The legislation, Senate Bill 4, began as just a single sentence promising to “provide for improved service and reduced costs for electricity ratepayers in the state.”
Since then, proponents have been working — mostly behind the scenes — with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration on a broader package to provide immediate relief to utility customers as well as longer-term reforms to lower Connecticut’s nagging electric costs.
With just over two weeks to go before lawmakers must wrap their work June 4, the details of that plan are coming into focus.
The latest draft of the bill, topping 150 pages and 45 sections, is expected to be released as soon as Tuesday evening, according to state Sen. Norm Needleman, D- Essex, who has been heavily involved in the negotiations as co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee.
“Not close in certain buckets, but close in some other buckets,” was how Needleman described the draft, which is expected to be revised further in the coming days and weeks. “I mean, it’s comprehensive.”
According to Needleman, the new bill includes a plan for the state borrow up to $260 million a year in order pay for bill arrearages, EV charging infrastructure and energy efficiency programs that are currently covered by utility customers through what’s known as the public benefits charge. As a result, the cost of those programs would be removed from customers’ bills and paid back using taxpayer dollars.
In addition, he said, the legislation would allow utilities to securitize their expenses from storm damage and switch to smart meter systems — essentially spreading those costs out over time and at lower, state-backed interest rates.
Needleman said his “very rough estimate” is that the bill could save a typical utility customer around 5% off their current monthly bill. That would come on top of recent reductions in the public benefits charge and anticipated lower supply costs starting this summer.
While that amount is well below the demands of Republicans who sought to shift most or all of the $1-billion-a-year cost of the public benefits charge off of customers’ bills, Democrats argue it is a more realistic approach given the state’s fiscal constraints.
“I think we have pretty good agreement on the energy bill,” Gov. Ned Lamont said this week when asked about negotiations with lawmakers. “I think we’re going to be shifting some of the costs from ratepayers over to bondholders. You know, they’re all pretty much the same people. So that’ll reduce the public benefits a little bit.”
On Monday, the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee voted along party lines to advance a slimmer version of S.B. 4, even as lawmakers on both sides conceded that the measure remained a work in progress.
The co-chair of that committee, state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, has been another leading voice among Democrats on energy policy, with many members pointing to his years of experience gained as Needleman’s predecessor on the Energy Committee. (The senator has also attracted scrutiny over his ownership of several energy-related companies, conflicts with regulators and efforts to secure his own appointment to a seat on the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.)
Earlier this year, Fonfara released his own proposal promising to immediately lower electricity bills by up to 20% through state borrowing that would cover nearly all of the public benefits charge. In addition, he proposed the creation of a new quasi-public authority tasked with directing energy procurement, in hopes of saving customers more over the long term.
That effort caused tensions between Democrats to spill briefly into the open. 
During one particularly contentious hearing last month, Needleman insinuated that portions of Fonfara’s bill had been drafted by the utilities, and he accused the senator of trying make an end run around the Energy and Technology Committee. Eventually, the two chairmen agreed to sit down and begin crafting a compromise that incorporated aspects of both their bills, as well as some Republican proposals.
“There is a good faith effort to meld those concepts as best we can,” Fonfara said Monday, before adding “there is a lot of work yet to be done.” 
As a practical matter, S.B. 4 will become the vehicle for whatever plan the lawmakers come up with to move through both the Senate and House.
Republicans who voted against the bill in committee on Monday said they did so because they felt the existing, incomplete proposal didn’t go far enough to address voters’ dissatisfaction with electricity prices. The ranking Republican on the committee, state Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, acknowledged the ongoing negotiations at the time and said he was “cautiously optimistic” those conversations would bear fruit.
“We are butting up against the end of session, so everyone is kind of at the edge of their seat hoping and praying for a bill, a comprehensive bill, that will ultimately lower bills here in the state of Connecticut,” Polletta said, adding that it would be a “shame and massive failure,” for the legislature to take no significant action on the issue.
Even before drafters revealed a more complete version of the bill Thursday, some of their ideas had come under scrutiny from people keeping track of the bill’s progress.
For example, a proposal endorsed by Fonfara and other legislative leaders to adopt mandatory time-of-use electric rates that charge customers more for power during hours of peak demand was opposed by the American Association of Retired Persons, whose leadership encouraged members to write legislators in opposition to the concept.
“The problem we have is that the poor, the elderly, the disabled, disproportionately need to use electricity at peak times,” said John Erlingheuser, a lobbyist for the group. “You’re an elderly person who’s disabled or uses oxygen or medical devices — those don’t make a difference between day and night, right?”
Needleman said that he was sympathetic to the group’s concerns, and that the final version of the bill would include an opt-out mechanism allowing customers to revert to single, constant rate. Erlingheuser said he was still concerned that solution could prove confusing to some customers.
Lori Brown, the executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, said she feared the latest version of the bill would include language paring back Connecticut’s incentives for rooftop solar panels, causing significant disruption for the industry and the state’s clean energy goals. Needleman responded that those aspects of the bill were still being worked on as of Tuesday afternoon.
Environmental advocates have also raised concerns that borrowing the money necessary to pay for recurring programs like energy efficiency could doom their existence once the money runs out. 
“I’ve not heard of anything positive in the bill yet,” said Charles Rothenberger, a climate and energy attorney with Save the Sound. 
In addition to Fonfara and Needleman, those involved in the negotiations around S.B. 4 have included the House chair of Energy and Technology, state Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, Lamont’s energy advisor Jonathan Dach, as well as representatives of PURA, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Office of Consumer Counsel.
The state’s two investor-owned electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, were not directly included the discussions, though lawmakers said they would solicit feedback from the companies after releasing the latest draft of their bill.
“We had a lot of bright people in the room” Steinberg said adding “there were also disagreements, not all of us were on the same page.”
One of those disagreements had to do with the procurement process for power supply, which is currently handled by utilities. In his earlier bill, Fonfara proposed creating an entirely new government entity, the Connecticut Energy Procurement Authority, to take over that process, similar to a system currently used in Illinois.
While that idea drew initial support from utilities like Eversource — who earn no profits off the sale of power under Connecticut’s deregulated energy market — Lamont and other Democrats have been more skeptical about the costs and bureaucratic challenges associated with the proposal. Both Needleman and Steinberg said this week that while the bill will include some language offering the utilities additional flexibility in how they purchase power, it will not put the state in charge of that process.
The ranking Republican on the Energy and Technology Committee, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, said he expected that some portions of S.B. 4 will come from ideas originally raised by his GOP colleagues, though he declined to share more details until a draft of the bill is released publicly. 
“I feel that there’s a good opportunity to come up with something that we can all get on board with,” Fazio said. “But there’s still issues that need to be bridged where there’s not agreement.”
Democrats also hope to gather at least some bipartisan support for the measure in order to avoid a lengthy filibuster that could derail their agenda in the final days of the session.
When asked Monday whether rank-and-file lawmakers would have enough time to digest the final draft of the bill before voting on it, Fonfara noted that work on the state’s massive, $26 billion annual budget routinely lasts until the final days of the session.
“I think there’s plenty of time,” he said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A growing number of high-dollar executive hires and “questionable spending” on a Super Bowl commercial and Narcan machines have contributed to the financial disarray at the state’s mental health department, the state auditor reported Tuesday.
The audit of the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services also reported that leadership at the agency is unable to understand and explain some complex issues within the agency and that employees were forced to sign nondisclosure agreements and discouraged from cooperating with investigations.
State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd said the report’s preliminary findings, released Tuesday, revealed “some glaring financial and systemic issues” at a “massive state agency” that has a budget of over $750 million. 
“It needs a director with executive managerial experience and a mastery of basic budgetary and compliance skills,” she said in a statement.

The audit comes amid reports of financial shortfalls, canceled or cut contracts and other disarray at the department. The Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector’s Office expects to release a more detailed audit at a later date.
Although Gov. Kevin Stitt requested the audit in March, on Tuesday his spokesperson said the report didn’t fulfill his request, is “politically charged” and wastes taxpayer dollars because it duplicates work already completed. 
The audit found that since January 2024, when Stitt named Allie Friesen commissioner, her agency has hired 38 people at a salary exceeding $100,000 and awarded 376 employees pay raises greater than 10%. Only 17 of new hires were medical while the rest were executive hires. The agency’s payroll was over $150 million in budget year 2024, according to the audit. 
The audit urged the agency to reexamine its recent executive hires and review terminations to ensure they weren’t retaliatory. 
The state’s transition to a Medicaid managed care health care insurance system has created issues paying providers which also impacted the agency’s budget. The agency also hasn’t communicated effectively that there have been changes in the federal government’s Medicaid reimbursement rates since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, the audit found. 
The transition to managed care “caused a lag in both billing and payments after implementation,” the audit found, creating issues with properly paying claims. Payments have been made to the wrong parties and sent to wrong locations. 
The payment issues affect the department’s cash flow, the report found.
The audit also questioned the decision to spend state funds on a regional Super Bowl commercial promoting 988, a suicide hotline.
The mental health department’s existing budget request, made by Friesen to lawmakers at the beginning of the year, was impacted by the governor’s request for executive branch agencies to submit flat budget requests and “difficulty explaining complex and misunderstood needs related to topics like Medicaid growth and pended payments, which resulted in a lack of urgency around these issues,” according to the audit.
The mental health department also began the current budget year with a deficit as $9.4 million from its current budget was used to pay last year’s debts, according to the audit. But the audit also flagged “questionable” spending and said there’s increasing pressure on employees from agency leadership with required nondisclosure agreements.

The pressure on employees also included “employing armed guards, locking down the administrative floor, and even threatening employees in meetings,” according to the report. One lawmaker on the select committee previously asked agency leadership about a report that someone had threatened to go “full cop mode” on staff that hadn’t signed an NDA, but leadership said they were not aware of this instance. 
While testifying to a select committee of state lawmakers, Friesen admitted that some employees were asked to sign NDAs, but that it was an optional practice. 
But the report from the state auditor’s office revealed agency staff told investigators they were “required” to sign the NDAs. Staff also reported to investigators issues with leadership not attending meetings, signing documents, having to learn about “internal events” through the media, and frequently changing the supervisor structure so they don’t know who to report to. 
Friesen did not directly comment on the findings, but agency spokesperson Maria Chaverri said the department is reviewing the state auditor’s report.
“We’ve created a large table of external diverse experts to help us bring light and end years of corruption,” she said in a statement. “… We look forward to the additional contributions from third party investigators and financial auditors in the coming months.”
Friesen’s agency has come under fire and is the subject of a handful of probes. A certified public accountant appointed by Stitt most recently reported a nearly $30 million shortfall for the current budget year, and lawmakers are currently working to finalize the agency’s budget for the upcoming fiscal year. 
Byrd said the state agency needs $28.7 million in emergency funding to make it through the current budget year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLESome providers have reported a lack of reimbursements for services provided to indigent populations, and Byrd’s report found over $87.6 million of those. These payments are historically reimbursed with funds still available at the end of the budget year, but not at 100%. 
Stitt has continued to express his support for Friesen and previously said she is “shining a light” on bureaucracy and agency mismanagement. The commissioner has previously blamed her predecessors for many of the issues at the state agency. 
“This is disappointing,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “On behalf of the Oklahoma taxpayers, I asked for a financial audit of the financial management of the last five years, not an exploration into whether or not Cindy Byrd approves of the culture of the department. This reeks of politics. Oklahomans deserve an audit done in good faith and a report that gives them the answers they deserve.”
Byrd said the urgency of Stitt’s audit request forced her office to put other investigations on the “backburner,” including one of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, but plans to resume them immediately. 
In addition to the report from the state auditor, reports from the Legislative Office of Fiscal Oversight, a select investigative committee of lawmakers and David Greenwell, an accountant appointed by Stitt, have publicly shared their own findings. None of their numbers for the agency’s deficit have been the same.

Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski. Questions and comments spanned a gamut of issues faced by Winooski residents, from immigration enforcement to federal budget cuts and tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump’s administration.More than 60 people attended, with several parents, students and residents sharing their thoughts and questioning state leaders on matters ranging from schools and health care to property tax and flood response.Attendees and panelists roundly criticized H.454, an education reform bill first introduced by Republican Gov. Phil Scott and the Agency of Education that aims to overhaul Vermont’s education funding and governance model over several years.“It’s a really hard time right now because we are taking on a massive reform that will likely result in our students not getting what they need,” said Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, one of the panelists.The reform proposal “is being used as a political tool to achieve specific agendas” to benefit the interests of the people with the most means to maintain power, said panelist and Winooski School District Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria, who oversees one of Vermont’s most diverse school districts.READ MORE
He was not consulted on the matter and neither was the state Office of Racial Equity, he said. Panelists expressed frustration that big decisions seem to be made based on gut feelings rather than data.“Nobody, except for our delegation – two senators out of three – have asked me what this will do for Winooski,” Chavarria said. “But Winooski has done the modeling and none of the scenarios they’re looking at is going to do anything good for the taxes in Winooski. If anything, there’s a potential for substantial increases, and a substantial decrease in the quality of education our students will be receiving.”Gulick agreed, adding that the bill the Senate is considering “doesn’t address cost drivers” like health care, inflation or the deferred maintenance of school buildings.Mea Ree Jan, a senior at Winooski High, asks a question at a community forum in the  school on Monday, May 19. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDigger“If we do save money, it’s just because we are slashing, we are cutting and not in a thoughtful way. So that is problematic,” she said.That led residents to raise concerns about escalating property taxes in a city with many immigrants and young families.While it may be too early to predict the bill’s impacts, State Treasurer and Winooski resident Mike Pieciak, another panelist, said the overarching goal of the bill is to provide “a really exceptional education at a price that Vermonters can afford.”That was the hope when a previous education reform law, Act 60, was enacted, he said, but the state did not adequately track “clear, articulable, measurable goals for what they were trying to achieve from a financial savings standpoint.” Pieciak said he hoped the state could learn from that as it considers new legislation.Tul Niroula, a multilingual liaison for the Winooski school district, speaks to state leaders at a community forum on Monday, May 19. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerEnacted in 1997, Act 60 significantly changed how public education is funded in Vermont with the intent to allow towns to pay equal tax rates for equal spending, regardless of local property wealth.A Yale University student who last year analyzed the effect of Vermont’s education finance system to see if school district mergers, like the ones prompted by the passage of Act 46 in 2015, saved money. Her analysis did not find any significant savings in spending per pupil between the merged and the non-merged districts.George Cross, who formerly served as superintendent of schools in Winooski and in the Vermont House, recalled participating in “the Act 60 revolution.” The fight then was not just between communities but also between the rich and the poor, he said, a divide he said the Legislature is not addressing in the current bill.“The Legislature does not represent the people of Vermont and that’s a big problem,” he said. “It might have represented the people of Vermont 100 years ago, but it doesn’t represent them today.”That divide was evident throughout the public commentary offered during the two-and-a-half-hour forum where many referenced unequal access that marginalized community members face. Some residents spoke of the anxiety immigrants in the city are feeling five months into an administration that often illegally targets them.A community organizer, who spoke on behalf of Latin American families in the city, said undocumented workers who contribute to the economy are particularly scared and being subject to scams promising legal services.“They just don’t know who to trust,” said Corali Cotrina. “The reality is, there is a deep disconnection between legislators, representatives, State House and the grassroots, especially the Black, Brown community, who are undocumented, who are the current invisible slaves and are being treated like animals by ICE.”Nepalese and Bhutanese residents talked about refugee deportations they’ve heard about in the United States and the anxiety and fear that have gripped their communities.“And what are the processes for those families? What resources can support us?” asked Tika Timsina, a tax preparer for refugees.Attorney General Charity Clark, also on the panel, said a scam is a crime and her office has a consumer assistance program that can help residents without requiring them to share their background information. She further assured residents she will continue to take legal action against the Trump administration when it violates the Constitution. Clark said her office is creating a document to alert immigrants of their rights this week, particularly if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents come knocking.President Trump’s approach to immigration “has been offensive, appalling and un-American,” she said. “We are this wonderful melting pot of immigrants. We believe in freedom, and our Constitution is fundamental, and we have no kings.”Chavarria said the Winooski School District has a 30-member rapid response team that includes a home-visiting program and interpreters that can be used in an emergency.Panelists directed concerned speakers to resources available in the state, such as Vermont Legal Aid, Vermont Law School clinic, Vermont Asylum Assistance Project and pro bono and low-cost lawyer options available through the Vermont Bar Association.Berbeco, who moderated the panel, reminded attendees that Winooski has adopted a sanctuary schools policy, meaning students and families are protected from the impact of federal immigration enforcement actions there, reflecting that “schools should be places of trust, not enforcement.”Pieciak said immigrants have always been part of the American story and immigration is an economic issue and also a moral one. “The future of Vermont, if it’s going to be successful, is going to require a lot of immigrant labor,” he said.Mea Ree Jan, a senior at Winooski High School, asked panelists how they keep their decisions honest and free of bias when considering bills that have the potential to negatively impact communities of color.Berbeco said she uses an impact assessment questionnaire created by the state racial equity office to confront biases in committee; Gulick said she tries to listen to her heart and her moral compass to imagine how constituents might react.Read the story on VTDigger here:  At Winooski forum, education reform, immigration and taxes on residents’ minds.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Winooski-ed-reform-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

It isn’t working in California,"Wendy Fry, Mohamed Al Elew and Sergio Olmos",,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/05/expedited-removal-pomona-home-depot/,Unauthorized immigrants can be deported quickly if they're detained near the border. The Trump administration wants to expand expedited removal inland.,"In summary
Unauthorized immigrants can be deported quickly if they’re detained near the border. The Trump administration wants to expand expedited removal inland.


The Trump administration is backing off a push to rapidly deport three Guatemalan day laborers who were detained 200 miles north of the Mexico border after a federal judge blocked it from fast-tracking their removal. 
The administration wanted to deport the men under a new policy that it adapted from one that previously was used nearly exclusively at the border, and only for immigrants who recently arrived in the U.S. Advocates said the case had the potential to signal whether the Trump administration could carry out its promised mass, rapid deportations across California
Judge Dana Sabraw issued a temporary restraining order Friday, prohibiting the government from removing the workers from the Southern District of California after their attorneys argued the agents stopped them without reasonable suspicion, in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. The men were detained by Border Patrol agents in Pomona.
“There’s no dispute that the Fourth Amendment applies to people within the interior of the United States, is there?” Sabraw asked the attorney for the federal government, who argued the court didn’t have jurisdiction over the workers’ claims and who characterized the stops as consensual.  
On Monday, the administration backed down.  
Assistant U.S. Attorney Erin Dimbleby said during a court hearing that the men were no longer being processed for rapid removal without a hearing before an immigration judge. She added she was seeking assurances from federal immigration authorities that they would not be placed back in the process called expedited removal. 
“No reason was given by the government, but we would guess that the government decided it did not want to produce the arresting Border Patrol agents to testify in court under oath on Thursday to justify the legality of their actions,” said Niels Frenzen, an attorney with the USC Gould School of Law Immigration Clinic who filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of the workers. Habeas corpus is a constitutional right protecting people from unlawful imprisonment by the government. 
The workers have not yet been released from custody, but they will now have a chance to appear before an immigration judge in court, giving them the opportunity to challenge their return to Guatemala and to argue that their due process rights were violated.  
This case is similar to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the United Farm Workers about sweeping immigration raids that rattled Kern County in January. In response to the ACLU’s claims that those raids violated farmworkers’ constitutional rights, the Department of Homeland Security said in court papers that it would retrain the Border Patrol agents on how to follow the Fourth Amendment, which governs police searches and arrests. 
In that case, the judge barred the El Centro Border Patrol from carrying out warrantless immigration sweeps in areas governed by the federal courts’ Eastern District of California, which spans the Central Valley from Redding to Bakersfield. The district does not include Pomona, where Border Patrol agents arrested the day laborers in a raid on a Home Depot parking lot on April 22. 
Detained while looking for work
The agents conducted the Home Depot arrests without warrants, court records show. At least nine people total were taken into custody in the parking lot sweep, the records state.
Jesus Domingo Ros, one of the men detained in Pomona, said in an interview that he was standing on a street corner near the Home Depot when agents appeared from all sides, grabbed him, and threw him to the ground, leaving him with bruises on his shoulder and knee. 
“I panicked,” he said in Spanish, describing the instant he realized he was in custody of U.S. immigration authorities. “Just with everything you’re seeing on the news right now, I really panicked because we didn’t know what was going to happen.” He spoke to CalMatters last month at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, where he is now being held.

The 38-year-old Guatemalan said he crossed into the United States without federal authorization nearly three years ago and has been working in construction in Pomona ever since. He said he was looking for work when agents surrounded him. “I’ve never been arrested. I’ve never been detained. This is my first experience,” he said. 
Before transferring him to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said the El Centro Border Patrol agents held him and others in freezing cold cells for days while interrogating them about who they might know. The agents hung enlarged mug shots along the walls of their cells, demanding to know the names of the people in the mug shots and whether the workers knew them. “When we said we didn’t know them, they argued with us,” he said.
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agents arrested 10 people that day in Pomona and placed them into removal proceedings. No other agencies were involved, said Michael Scappechio, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Advocates are adamant that more than 20 people were initially taken into custody, based on piecing together the accounts of different witnesses about what happened. 
Federal officials defended their actions, saying agents were initially targeting a single individual with an active arrest warrant — a barber who they arrested at gunpoint. During the operation, nine other people were also taken into custody. Some of those detained had prior charges, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon, immigration violations, and DUI, said Hilton Beckham, the assistant commissioner for the Border Patrol’s office of public affairs.
At least two other Guatemalans — Yoni Jacinto Garcia and Edwin Juarez-Cobon — detained during the same immigration sweep outside the Home Depot in Pomona were facing the rapid removal process, court records show. 
“All three men have been living in the United States for more than two years,” said Alexis Teodoro, Worker Rights Director at the Pomona Economic Opportunity Center. 
Domingo Ros said he fled violence and poverty in his hometown, located directly on the border of Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico. His brother is a legal permanent resident in Pomona, having successfully won an asylum case in the United States, he said.
“Looking for work is not a crime. Waiting for a job opportunity outside a Home Depot isn’t a threat to anyone,” said Teodoro. 
Advocates said federal immigration authorities last week told Domingo Ros that he’d be back in Guatemala within days. 
That’s because the Trump administration was trying to apply a new policy to his case that expands the powers of immigration officers to fast-track removals of people arrested in the interior of the country.
Trump’s push to speed deportations
The process, known as expedited removal, allows immigration officers to remove certain non-citizens from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge, according to the American Immigration Council. Historically, the process for bypassing immigration courts has been reserved primarily for areas close to the border and for migrants who arrived by sea or crossed the border within the prior two weeks.  
The Trump administration released a new expedited removal policy on Jan. 21, allowing immigration officers to apply expedited removals across the entire United States, instead of only near the border and for people who had been in the country longer than two weeks.
“The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,” says the notice of the policy change published online.
Advocates say it’s part of a broader effort to boost deportations by chipping away at the limited due process afforded to immigrants in the United States. The Trump administration has also cancelled grants that funded legal representation for children and for families separated during his first term. It fired dozens of immigration judges in Massachusetts, California, and Louisiana, and removed people to remote locations outside of the United States without a hearing, including to a notorious El Salvadoran high-security prison. 
Trump and his supporters argue that using expedited removal will help alleviate the long-overburdened and backlogged immigration court system, which has more than 3.5 million cases pending. The swelling backlog has tripled since 2020, meaning detained migrants are waiting months and even years for their hearings.
“We have thousands of people that are ready to go out, and you can’t have a trial for all of these people,” Trump said last month from the Oval Office.

The policy places the burden on the person detained to prove that they’ve been in the country continuously for more than two years “to the satisfaction of an immigration officer.” In the past, it’s led to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being mistakenly deported.  
“It isn’t reasonable to expect someone to carry around 24 months’ worth of utility bills on their person at all times. There must be an opportunity, a reasonable opportunity, to provide evidence that they have been in the U.S. for longer than two years, if that is the case,” said Christian Penichet-Paul, the assistant vice president of policy & advocacy, at the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy non-profit in Washington D.C. 
Similar efforts to speed up the process for deportations during Trump’s first administration were challenged in federal court. Initially, a district court granted a preliminary injunction in 2019 blocking the expansion of expedited removal, but this was overturned by the D.C. Circuit, allowing Homeland Security to expand its use of expedited removal while the lawsuit continued. 
The legal battle blocked the policy from going into effect until late 2020. The Biden administration then rescinded it in early 2021. 
The ACLU is suing again in D.C. District court to try to stop the expanded use of expedited removal. The government has filed a motion to dismiss the suit, claiming the court does not have jurisdiction. 
“We think it’s unconstitutional. People who have been in the country clearly have due process rights, and the entire expedited removal process gives people less process than you do when you get a traffic ticket,” said Anand Balakrishnan, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
The use of expedited removal to bypass the court system and deport people was rising before Trump was re-elected president. In fiscal year 2013, the numbers peaked when Barack Obama was president, at 193,032 people detained at the border who went through the expedited removal process. That represented 44% of the total number of removals that year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050625-PomonaRaidProtest-TS-CM-06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

IDALS will host an informative webinar on the handbook Wednesday, May 28, to give an overview of the tool, which provides agency-specific, and species-specific, guidelines. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the department’s animal health staff developed the handbook so that partners across the state have the tools to respond with IDALS to animal welfare complaints. 
“The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship is responsible for keeping animals in our state safe and healthy, and it’s a responsibility we take very seriously,” Naig said in a statement.

Mindi Callison, of the animal advocacy group Bailing Out Benji, called the guidebook “a phenomenal resource.” 
“This is the most comprehensive handbook out there outside of the USDA,” Callison said.
Callison said while the U.S. Department of Agriculture has a thick handbook, it’s geared towards licensees and inspectors. Callison said the plain language of IDALS handbook will make it easier for law enforcement to step in without having to look through and interpret Iowa code.
Officials who might respond to an animal welfare call have different roles. The USDA and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, control the licensing, inspection and outreach for any groups transporting, researching, exhibiting or dealing animals. The agency works to ensure these individuals meet standards set by the Animal Welfare Act.
Local law enforcement, including animal control groups, and county attorneys may also be involved in animal welfare cases to respond to calls, determine the course of action and build animal abuse cases when applicable. 
The handbook outlines how law enforcement should respond to and investigate an animal welfare complaint, which Callison said is an “immediate resource” that will allow authorities to respond to calls sooner.
“We’ve seen cases where law enforcement agencies were hesitant to step in because they didn’t know how to handle the case … But this guidebook really lays it out for them, and it kind of shows them who to contact in different cases for support,” Callison said. 
The handbook advises local authorities to plan in advance, by identifying facilities that could house animals in the event they need to be relocated, and building relationships with local partners and veterinarians. 
It also encourages communities to build a response plan in the event of animal welfare complaints, to “ensure a collaborative approach to safeguarding animal welfare.” 
Callison said she believes these community connections can also “really help” facilities to “do better” before it comes to a complaint and animal welfare investigation. 
The handbook also serves as a quick reference guide for Iowa code related to animal welfare, including statutes on livestock, the mistreatment of animals, animals in commercial establishments and rescuing animals. 
Don McDowell, communications director for IDALS, said “a lot of work” went into developing the handbook. 
“We identified a significant need for this resource in working with and communicating with local law enforcement partners over the past few years – both larger urban counties and smaller rural counties,” McDowell said in an email.
He said the guide emphasizes the importance of advanced planning for law enforcement officials, but is also meant to help “county attorneys document the situation and build a strong animal neglect case.” 
For several years, Iowa has placed high on the list of states with the highest number of puppy mill violations. 
Part of the issue, which Callison’s organization Bailing Out Benji has highlighted, is that federally licensed facilities do not have to follow the same standards as state licensed facilities. Callison said the handbook helps to clarify the role each agency plays, regardless of where a facility is licensed, which she said “will provide some clarity.” 
Legislators proposed a fix to this “loophole” as Callison called it, but the bill did not advance before the close of Iowa’s legislative session. 
Bailing Out Benji is based in Iowa but works to expose animal cruelty situations across the country. Callison said she has not seen similar handbooks in other states but hopes the IDALS move will inspire other states to create similar guides.
“This is a great move by the department,” Callison said. “I’m shocked that our state has the most comprehensive handbook out there. I’m excited to see how it changes what’s going on in our state.” 
Those interested in attending the webinar on the handbook can register online.

Larry Scott (R-Hobbs) speaks during a committee hearing during the 2025 legislative session. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)As a panel of state lawmakers on Tuesday planned out their work for the rest of the year, their hopes to improve health outcomes for New Mexicans were overshadowed by the looming threat of federal cuts to health insurance coverage.
At the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee’s first meeting since the most recent legislative session, Rep. Larry Scott (R-Hobbs) told the committee lawmakers need to be ready if the U.S. government turns administration of Medicaid over to the states.
“I don’t think any of those changes should try to take us by surprise,” Scott said.
State and federal officials say the GOP budget bill making its way through the U.S. Congress could not only reduce federal spending on Medicaid but also the oil and gas revenue that the state government could use to cover the costs.
In the worst-case scenario, the proposal would translate to cuts of more than $1.1 billion for New Mexico’s Medicaid program, according to one of the Legislature’s top budget advisers.
The worries over Medicaid cuts come as New Mexico is in the middle of restructuring its entire behavioral health care treatment system, with the state’s Medicaid program expected to create a group of licensing boards to help streamline mental health providers’ credentialing.
During public comment at Tuesday’s meeting, Rick Madden, chair of government affairs at the New Mexico Medical Society, told the committee that his organization strongly supports the committee’s focus on the potentially extreme effects of funding cuts and work requirements on local patients and communities.
Sen. Liz Stefanics (D-Cerrillos) said she wants the health panel to receive updates from the Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee, which legislative leaders created late last month in order to track all federal money coming into New Mexico.
“Many of us, of course, are very concerned about it, and it’s not just Medicaid that we need to be concerned about,” Stefanics said.
Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) suggested the panel have a joint meeting with the Legislative Finance Committee for any health care-related cuts coming from the federal government, not limited to Medicaid.
“When we’re talking about funding and affordability, knowing that we’re going to have to plug holes, what realistically does the picture look like for us?” Anaya asked.
During the legislative session, New Mexico created a new Medicaid Trust Fund that aims to generate enough in interest to pay for at least some of what the federal government could cut in Medicaid spending. Rep. Eleanor Chavez (D-Albuquerque) wants the committee to review what’s happening with that money.
The committee’s next meeting is scheduled for June 25 through June 27. Lawmakers also suggested where they will hold their meetings, however, a complete schedule was not available as of Tuesday.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)The parental “bill of rights” overhaul, one of the most divisive bills approved during this year’s Washington state legislative session, was signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday. 
The legislation stems from Initiative 2081, a citizen initiative lawmakers approved last year that granted certain rights to the parents of public school students under age 18. It allowed parents to easily access school materials, their child’s medical records, and promised immediate notification if a child is involved in a crime. 
Democrats said they would write a “clean-up bill” if the initiative clashed with other state and federal laws. But Republicans said the law signed Monday goes much further and undermines the initiative, which hundreds of thousands of voters signed on in support of in 2023. 
The law contains an emergency clause. This will allow it to take effect immediately, and it eliminates the possibility of a referendum that would give voters a chance to weigh in on the law. Democratic lawmakers have said the emergency clause would help provide schools more clarity right away. Republicans criticize it as a ploy to block any referendum effort.
Meanwhile, some opponents are already saying they will seek alternative paths to a repeal.
Along with parental rights, students’ rights are included, such as the right to receive an education in a safe and supportive learning environment, free of harassment and bullying. The law also makes clear that students are free to exercise constitutionally protected rights at school.
Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, the lead sponsor of House Bill 1296, said students deserve to have a diverse curriculum that reflects the true history and experiences of people, to be able to experience a school system without discrimination, and that student rights can coexist with parental rights. 
Ferguson echoed that view during the bill signing. “The top priority for our schools must be to ensure a safe learning environment where every student has a chance to thrive,” he said.
Parts of the earlier parents’ rights initiative, such as allowing parents to review school curriculum and textbooks, and requiring school districts to “immediately” notify parents if a student is a victim of abuse, sexual misconduct, or assault, were kept in the rewrite. 
A significant change from the initiative was the removal of access to medical records. Democrats have said separating educational and medical records was necessary to prevent confusion. For example, a 1985 law gives children 13 years or older the right to mental health treatment without parental consent.
Republican critics of the new legislation argue that the definition of mental health care has expanded over the past 40 years to include gender-affirming care, psychiatric medications and other health services that parents should know about.
New parental rights would also be added, including ones for parents to be notified of their child’s unexcused absences and to engage in efforts to reduce those absences and to request information about special education programs and determine eligibility. 
Throughout the session, debates related to the legislation flared over gender inclusivity and diversity, equity and inclusion. Republicans introduced several unsuccessful amendments to prevent transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports and entering girls’ locker rooms.  
The law also adds ethnicity, homelessness, immigration or citizenship status, and neurodivergence as protected classes and clarifies protections for sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity. 
A new complaint process is established as well. This directs the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to investigate complaints if schools fail to comply with state laws in areas like civil rights, nondiscrimination, harassment, and the physical restraint or isolation of students. 
In cases where districts are found to be willfully disobeying state law, they could see 20% of their state funds withheld and redirected to resolving the issues identified by the state. This option is intended as a last resort. Even so, Republicans view it as too punitive and claim it takes away local control.
Let’s Go Washington, the group behind Initiative 2081, plans to mount a repeal effort against the new law, according to Hallie Balch, a spokesperson for the group. Balch did not specify whether this might involve a ballot initiative or a new initiative to the Legislature. 
Unlike a referendum, both of those options would be open to the group. But they would require the collection of nearly 400,000 signatures. The deadline to file initiatives, including required signatures, for the 2025 general election ballot is July 3. Initiatives to the Legislature, for next year’s session, can be filed until Jan. 2, 2026.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2712-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)HARTFORD, Conn. — The House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a proposal that would grant Connecticut State Police troopers a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase next fiscal year.
The proposal, which is also expected to win approval in the Senate, passed 134-12 in the Democratic-controlled House, enjoying bipartisan support despite objections from GOP leaders.
Legislators from both parties have lamented a state police force that’s now about 25% smaller than the 1,200-plus troopers who served Connecticut prior to 2010.
Democrats said the raises, which would affect an estimated 885 troopers, are essential to recruitment efforts.
But both House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, argued against the raises.
“We’re facing a collision course with a rather ugly truth” — that state employee compensation is becoming unsustainable, said Nuccio, who is the ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
Nearly all unionized workers have received a 2.5% general wage hike and a step, which typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise, each fiscal year since 2021-22.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, which negotiated the wage deal with the troopers, also is bargaining new contracts with all other major state employee unions. And it would be difficult for state officials to convince labor arbiters that Connecticut could not afford effective 4.5% annual increases for other state employees if the legislature approves one for troopers.
The House GOP proposed a $54.4 billion biennial budget earlier this month that counts on more than $300 million in savings over the next two fiscal years by freezing pay for all workers.
Candelora said troopers earn an average of $116,000 per year in base pay, but compensation rises to $175,000 per year once overtime is considered.
“There’s no amount of pay that’s going to be able to recruit more officers,” he said.
The solution, Candelora added, involves criminal justice reforms that give officers greater legal protection when performing searches or pulling over motorists on the highway.
“What they really need is our support,” he said. “They need real criminal justice reform.”
Despite Nuccio and Candelora’s arguments, 35 of the 47 Republicans who cast ballots in Tuesday’s joined 99 Democrats in supporting the raises.
Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union and a former president, noted before a legislative panel earlier this month that union concessions packages have weakened retirement benefits for troopers.
Before 2011, a trooper was eligible for a hazardous duty pension based on the three highest annual salaries of a minimum 20 years of service.
Now Connecticut requires 25 years of service that offers a hybrid pension/401(k) benefit calculated on average wages over the entire 25-year span.
But Matthews also said workers deserve the raises in the deal and more.
“It’s a dangerous job,” he said at the time, adding that 26 troopers have died in the line of duty and that post-traumatic stress injuries are “a real thing” many troopers face.
The legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated the agreement would cost state government nearly $4.1 million next fiscal year. Municipalities that participate in the resident state trooper program would collectively incur an added cost of $301,675 next fiscal year, nonpartisan analysts estimated.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Lancaster County district judge is reviewing whether to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that Nebraska’s voter-approved medical cannabis laws violate federal law after in-person arguments Tuesday.
This is the second medical cannabis case to reach District Judge Susan Strong, who in late November ruled against a preelection lawsuit challenging that the ballot measures shouldn’t have been placed on the ballot because of allegedly fraudulent notarizations. Strong rejected those arguments. In the latest case, Strong must first decide whether to let the federal preemption case proceed based on whether a longtime marijuana opponent, John Kuehn, has the necessary “standing” to sue.

That’s the legal term of art required for cases to proceed, meaning that Kuehn, a former state senator and former member of the State Board of Health, must show injury as a result of the new medical cannabis laws legalizing and regulating the drug.
The ballot measures overwhelmingly passed in November, with 71% approval for legalization and 67% approval for a regulatory law. Tuesday’s arguments came on the same day state lawmakers are considering Legislative Bill 677, a separate effort to create a clearer regulatory scheme around medical cannabis to assist in the program’s implementation.
‘He couldn’t wait’
Many of the arguments in court Tuesday mirrored legal briefs filed earlier. Largely, they argue that Kuehn is not the right party to challenge the measures under “taxpayer standing,” or that, as a taxpayer, he should get to challenge “illegal” taxpayer spending.
All 11 defendants named in the case from Kuehn have filed to dismiss the case. Attorney Jason Grams, for the three members of the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that voters’ regulatory law established, told Strong no taxpayer funds had been spent by Jan. 10, when Kuehn amended his lawsuit to include the commissioners.
“He couldn’t wait to take the time to meet the demand requirement for taxpayer standing,” Grams said.

Grams represented the Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana campaign in 2020 against a lawsuit brought by Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner. The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled against the campaign and removed the measure from the 2020 ballot.
A ‘recycled argument’
Attorney Daniel Gutman, who is now representing the three sponsors of the 2024 cannabis ballot measures, said the “ship has long sailed” for election-related challenges against his clients. Gutman continues to defend the sponsors as Kuehn and the Attorney General’s Office appeal the earlier notarization case, also from Kuehn, to the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
Gutman said the sponsors didn’t agree to be “sued in perpetuity” for any challenge from Kuehn.
Of the dozens of states that have legalized medical cannabis, Gutman and Grams said no court has tossed the laws.
Gutman said states are meant to be “labs of democracy” and that the federal government and Congress do not preempt the Nebraska laws. He also noted a provision in annual federal spending bills prohibiting the U.S. Department of Justice from spending federal money to prosecute people following state medical cannabis laws.
“We would literally be here all day if I cited all the cases rejecting this recycled argument,” said Gutman.

Deputy Solicitor General Zach Pohlman, defending Gov. Jim Pillen, Secretary of State Bob Evnen, Treasurer Tom Briese and two other state defendants in the case, summed up morning arguments that someone should challenge the laws, but Pohlman said it shouldn’t be Kuehn.
“Just because that statute is on the books doesn’t mean that Kuehn can run around the normal standing requirements,” Pohlman said.
Instead, the AG’s staff has said Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and his staff should be the ones to challenge the law, which they’ve pledged to do if and when the Medical Cannabis Commission issues any dispensary licenses under the new laws.
‘Snip this off at the bud’
Attorney Eddie Greim of Kansas City, representing Kuehn, said the challenge should proceed in part because public records requests indicate that staff for the Liquor Control Commission, which the regulatory law voters passed and tied closely to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, have discussed how to implement the laws and estimated possible costs.
“If we can snip this off at the bud, and we can enjoin the NMCC from doing anything,” Greim said, “then the harms will never flow down to the other defendants.”

Some of the records received include fiscal or lobbying requests related to pending legislation just down the street from the courthouse at the Nebraska State Capitol, which Greim said show regulatory steps being taken. Grams said the records are “utterly irrelevant” to the lawsuit.
Grams also filed affidavits from each of the three commissioners on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission stating that the commissioners had taken no regulatory action as of Jan. 10, when the commissioners were added to the lawsuit.
Greim objected to that evidence, saying he needed to be able to “look behind the veil” and challenge the commissioners’ statements.
Strong said she would take the evidence challenges and the motions to dismiss from all defendants under advisement and rule at a future date.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 21:15:32+00:00,CT Mirror,CT bill to require ‘just cause’ when firing teachers passes Senate,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-teacher-terminations-bill/,Proponents said the bill would protect teachers in ‘very politicized times.’ Opponents said it infringes on local board of education control.,"A piece of legislation that would change the teacher termination process in Connecticut passed out of the Senate Tuesday afternoon on a 27-8 vote.
Senate Bill 1371 would now require a valid reason, or a “showing of just cause,” for why a teacher would be facing termination. It also removed language in current state statute that allows a board of education subcommittee to uphold the termination and would instead now require local boards to hire an impartial hearing officer to make the final decision.
Democratic lawmakers said Tuesday that the proposed bill would better protect educators from political bias.
“Currently, we are in the position where we have teachers who could be terminated by a decision of board of education, and in these very politicized times, that might not be neutral, and impartial, and a fair process,” said Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, who championed the legislation. 
Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, added that teachers have more commonly come “under assault” across the country both online and from parents.
“Because of social media, people are able to organize and talk and then pounce on teachers,” Duff said on the Senate floor. “There’s a lot of pressure to get rid of them if they don’t agree and it’s not because they’re not doing the job that they’re supposed to do … it’s because of the fact that maybe somebody doesn’t like their political views or that maybe a teacher put up a certain flag that is offensive to somebody.
“When we see teachers getting attacked for various views, or perceived views that they may have, we need to offer them a little more protection,” Duff continued. “We need to say that we’re standing with our teachers because of the work that they have done for our children decade upon decade.”
The bill was supported by the entire Democratic caucus. Senate Republicans broadly rejected the legislation, except for Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, who said the measure was “appropriate, right, fair and a part of what I would consider due process.”
Other Republicans, including Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, argued that the bill was overstepping on local control.
“If this becomes law, you will lose a say that you have right now as a citizen in the great state of Connecticut. You will lose the ability to have a say over whether a teacher is fired or not. You lose that right,” Sampson said Tuesday. “I would much rather have communities having their own boards of education that are responsible to their constituents … making the decisions.”
Sampson raised two amendments Tuesday. One measure proposed keeping the new just cause standard, but eliminating the second part of the bill that said termination decisions would be determined and finalized by an impartial hearing officer. Another amendment called for a task force to study school discipline.
“We have other problems in education. The quality of education is at stake and that is what we ought to be doing here today — is finding ways to actually hold institutions of education more accountable to providing a quality education and not protecting what could be teachers that are failing at their job,” Sampson said, adding that though he has “tremendous respect for this noble profession,” he was fearful the legislation would protect “bad teachers.”
Both amendments failed.
“The focus on this bill is much less about teachers and protecting teachers and protecting good teachers from being terminated and it’s more about advancing the cause of organized labor,” Sampson said.
“My personal frustration is that I’m going to be on the record at the end of the discussion voting against this bill, and really, it’s not fair because I’m somebody who supports teachers … but I think this is bad policy and deprives the local community of the control of making sure of the status of teachers in their district and handing it over to a binding arbitrator,” Sampson added.
S.B. 1371 didn’t define what “just cause” was, but an Office of Legislative Research bill analysis said “‘just cause’ is a concept developed in case law that involves a termination for employee misconduct that is so serious that it (1) violates an essential condition of employment, (2) breaches the trust or faith inherent in the working relationship, or (3) is fundamentally or directly inconsistent with the employee’s obligations to the employer.”
Kushner said Tuesday that “every unionized employee for the state and municipality have this right guaranteed,” and that it was “long overdue” for the protection to be extended to educators.
At the bill’s public hearing in February, it received overwhelming support from educators across the state.
“Increasingly, decisions to terminate a teacher are driven by politics, not justice. The result is good teachers leaving the classroom and new and aspiring educators seeking different career paths. SB 1371 would take politics out of discipline and reduce the intensifying climate of political fear in schools,” Connecticut Education Association Union President Kate Dias wrote in public testimony.
The only written opposition for the bill came from the commissioner of the state Department of Education, who echoed some of Sampson’s concerns.
“Currently, the arbitrator makes factual findings — which are binding on the school board — but only recommends appropriate discipline, which the board can accept or reject. This change would give the arbitrator the unilateral power to determine discipline, and the school board would be bound by it,” wrote Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker. “This would remove the right of local and regional school boards to make the fundamental determination as to the qualifications of individuals who teach in their systems and interact with their students.”
The bill next faces a vote in the state House of Representatives.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HOUSE-SESSION-0520-SR-7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 18:08:39.188083

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature is poised to undo a decision it made last year to join a pact that presents an eventual path to do away with the Electoral College. 
The Maine House of Representatives passed legislation, LD 252, on Tuesday that would repeal the decision, but did so after some Democratic members first attempted to buck a committee recommendation and reject it. 
While the bill is sponsored solely by Republicans, it has been backed by some Democrats in committee and floor votes. The bill now heads to the Senate. 
In 2024, the Legislature adopted something called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which Gov. Janet Mills allowed to become law without her signature. 
States that are part of the compact pledge their Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate with the most overall votes across the country, but it would only take effect once states with a total of 270 Electoral College votes have joined. Including Maine, 17 states and the District of Columbia have ratified the agreement, giving the compact a total of 209 electoral votes. 
During floor speeches, lawmakers disagreed on which system would give more of a voice to Mainers.
“We were the first state in the nation to split our Electoral College votes by congressional district — a system that reflects our political diversity and values every voice, whether rural or urban,” said Rep. Barbara Bagshaw (R-Windham), the bill sponsor. 
Maine and Nebraska are the only states that split their electoral votes across candidates. Other states use a winner-take-all system where the candidate with the majority of the state’s popular vote gets all of the state’s electoral votes.
“By joining the National Popular Vote Compact,” Bagshaw said, “we have undermined that.”
However, Rep. Arthur Bell (D-Yarmouth), who sponsored the legislation to enter the pact last year, argued the Electoral College system results in candidates only paying attention to voters in swing states, which Maine is not.
“To me, it’s as simple as every vote should be equal,” Bell said. 
Rep. Sean Faircloth (D-Bangor) said he is sympathetic to people who he hears say, “My vote doesn’t matter,” given that twice in this century a candidate who has lost the popular vote has become president. 
Others pointed to the founding intent behind the Electoral College when explaining their opposition. 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), an attorney, pointed to Federalist Paper 68 when making the point that the Electoral College is based on the idea that regular citizens can’t be trusted to elect the president. 
When the Electoral College was conceived, its design was intended to advance the political power of slave states, said Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor). Enslaved people were counted toward the electoral population of the states in which they were enslaved despite not having the right to vote.
Subject matter aside, several Republicans took issue with procedure. Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) made a motion to accept the minority report of the Veteran and Legal Affairs Committee, which would have preserved the agreement, though that motion failed 71-76 and was preceded by a half hour of floor debate.
“This is just poking the eye [of] the committee,” said Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield). 
In April, the majority of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted in favor of LD 252, with eight legislators in support of the measure and five opposed, a breakdown that did not fall along party lines.
While five of those in favor were Republicans — Reps. David Boyer, Quentin Chapman, Ann Fredericks, Benjamin Hymes and Sen. Jeff Timberlake — two are Democrats — Sens. Jill Duson and Craig Hickman — and one is unenrolled — Rep. Sharon Frost. However, the committee members who voted against its passage were all Democrats: Reps. Sean Faircloth, Anne Graham, Marc Malon, Parnell Terry, and Supica.
The committee voted against legislation, LD 1356 sponsored by Lee, that seeks to change Maine’s method of allocating electoral votes from the current district split to a winner-take-all system — but only if Nebraska also adopts winner-take-all. Lee’s bill has yet to be heard on the floor.
In April, the Nebraska Legislature killed a bill that sought to make this switch, after Republicans failed to secure enough votes to overcome a four-hour filibuster.

At some elementary schools in north and central Jackson, nearly all the students passed the third-grade reading test on the first try. But the results show that a majority of third graders at schools in south Jackson failed the test, raising the possibility that those students will be retained this fall. They have multiple chances to test again before that happens.
Students at Barack H. Obama Elementary and McWillie Elementary had the highest scores, with more than 95% passing, while students at Key Elementary, Shirley Elementary and Wilkins Elementary had the lowest, with less than 40% of students passing at those three schools. 
There are likely many reasons for this disparity, but local educators say the low reading scores reflect that it can be hard to be a kid in south Jackson right now. 
Learning to read is all the more challenging for kids whose basic needs are not being met. 
“The less resources you have at home, the heavier that burden is going to be,” said Pam Franklin, the program director at Operation Shoestring.
The nonprofit is one of several groups in the city that are working to get Jackson’s third graders reading at the level they were just 10 years ago, when nearly 85% of the city’s public schoolers passed the third grade reading test. 
But without nutritional meals, clean clothes, playtime, sleep and a supportive parent who reads to them, kids will struggle to be friendly with their peers or respectful to teachers, let alone concentrate on vocabulary or phonics. 
“Before I walk in the door, I’m bringing all of that with me,” Franklin said. 




These challenges exacerbate the urgency educators face in teaching them to read by the end of third grade. It’s not just because students must, with some exceptions, pass the third-grade reading test to advance to the fourth grade. The failure to learn to read by this age has been linked to poor outcomes later in life, such as dropping out of school, earning low wages or delinquency. 
That’s partly because knowing how to read is a crucial life skill, said Greer Proctor-Dickson, the executive director of the Mississippi Reading Clinic. 
“We’re not conscious of all the reading that we do,” Proctor-Dickson said. “Street signs, bills, legal documents, menus.” 
For instance, students need to learn how to read in order to solve math problems that are posed in paragraph form. 
“Now I’m getting a double strike,” Franklin said. 
As Jackson loses population, fewer families are sending their children to JPS, leaving the district with less funding.
Ironically, that’s exactly what educators say Jackson’s kids need: More resources and more support. 
During the school year, the Mississippi Reading Clinic hosts classes at local middle schools to work with students with poor reading skills. 
Proctor-Dickson recalled a story of a JPS teacher the clinic was coaching who noticed that something was off with a boy in her class. When she asked him what was wrong, he said he was long overdue for a haircut and embarrassed to be seen in public. 
So the teacher called a barber who volunteered to come to the school and cut the boy’s hair that day.

(Screenshot from White House livestream)Speaking from the Oval Office, U.S. Sen. Jim Banks touted the inclusion of Indiana companies in a multi-billion missile shield project known as the “Golden Dome.” It is currently part of the massive reconciliation bill working its way through Congress.
“Your legacy with Space Force, Mr. President, is already big, but the Golden Dome is going to be an even bigger legacy for our country,” Banks told President Donald Trump in a live briefing on Tuesday.
“And Indiana is going to help you make it,” Banks continued, citing Fort Wayne’s L3Harris as a source for space satellites and the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane as a supporter.
L3Harris recently underwent a $125-million upgrade to support the Golden Dome project and is expected to be the “most advanced payload production center supporting the project,” per WANE.

“Hoosiers are very proud of that; we’re proud of you,” concluded Banks, who was introduced by Trump as a “great senator.”
The Golden Dome missile defense shield, introduced by Trump in January, will cost a projected $175 billion, but Republicans opted to include a $25 billion down payment in a contentious defense reconciliation bill.
The project is inspired by Israel’s land-based Iron Dome, which protects the country from missiles and rockets shot by nearby enemies. Trump said the dome would be complete by the end of his term in January 2029, naming Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana as states that would benefit from the project.
Canada will also be a partner, Trump added. General Michael A. Guetlein, the vice chief of space operations, will lead the project.
Details about the bidding process are still scarce, as reported by Reuters, though he said all components would be made in America.
SpaceX, Palantir and Anduril have emerged as potential frontrunners to build the project. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, has proposed a governmental “subscription service” as part of the Golden Dome project, a concern for some critics.

(Photo credit Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix.)Two Florida newspapers are reporting there is an open investigation into the Hope Florida Foundation, First Lady Casey DeSantis’ signature social-services program, which came under legislative scrutiny this year over its finances.
The House Health Care Budget Subcommittee, chaired by Pensacola Republican Alex Andrade, held a series of meetings this year investigating the transfer to the foundation of $10 million from a $67 million Medicaid overpayment settlement with the state. The nonprofit organization steered the funds to two groups that wound up directing a combined $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to oppose Amendment 3, the failed 2024 ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana.
The anti-marijuana campaign was of particular importance to Gov. Ron DeSantis, and was chaired by James Uthmeier, then DeSantis’ chief of staff, now the governor’s appointee as state attorney general.
According to a report published Tuesday by the joint Capitol bureau for the The Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald, the papers requested documents that State’s Attorney General Jack Campbell — who investigates and prosecutes alleged crimes in Franklin, Gadsden, Jefferson, Leon (the seat of Florida state government), Liberty, and Wakulla counties — may have received from Andrade regarding the Hope Florida Foundation. Andrade had suggested the financial arrangements might have been illegal.
The state attorney’s office declined to release any information because it was “part of an open, on-going investigation,” the newspapers reported.
The Florida Phoenix asked Campbell on Tuesday whether his office was investigating the Hope Florida Foundation. He did not respond.  The Phoenix also put in a request for any documents related to the Hope Florida Foundation that Campbell’s office may have received from Andrade.
“The information you request is part of an open, on-going investigation,” public records administrator Lori Abbey replied. ” I cannot verify what information is contained or referenced within the investigation. Also, I cannot verify how any information has been provided to this office. “
Meanwhile, the governor and First Lady held a lengthy press conference in Tampa Tuesday, touting the Hope Florida program and its success.
When asked about the reported investigation Tuesday, DeSantis seemed surprised and said, “Based on what?” Then he defended the program, championed by his wife.
“Well, I mean, I can tell you, this has been a very successful program,” DeSantis said. “Everything that’s been thrown at it is pure politics.”

“I believe in this program deeply, and I stand by it 100%,” he added.
Hope Florida uses state employee “navigators” to help connect people who rely on Medicaid and supplemental nutrition programs with the private sector and faith-based communities in an effort to help them gain financial independence.

His food had just arrived when the leader of the Senate Education Committee called. Tinney’s confirmation to the Oklahoma State Board of Education, which had been mired in uncertainty, was going to move forward.
Tinney, a Norman attorney, said he was unsure before that point whether the committee would consider his confirmation at all. His home senator had declined to support his nomination by Gov. Kevin Stitt to the board, which typically is a death knell for a nominee’s chances at Senate confirmation. 
He learned in that Friday phone call that the Senate’s top lawmaker, President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, would step in to carry his nomination. With Paxton’s support, the Senate committee voted 10-2 on Tuesday in favor of confirming Tinney to the state board through April 2027. He must pass a vote by the full Senate for it to be final.
“I’m just glad this is done,” Tinney told reporters after the vote. “You guys probably know the hurdles that my nomination overcame. I don’t want to rehash all that. I’m just thankful that things got worked out and thankful I got the opportunity to be heard. Hopefully I’ll be confirmed by the Senate, and then I will get on with doing my job.”
The committee on Tuesday also advanced the confirmation of two other state Board of Education nominees, Ryan Deatherage, of Kingfisher, and Becky Carson, of Edmond. It did so for board member Chris Van Denhende, of Tulsa, last week.

Paxton said Sen. Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, asked him to take over Tinney’s nomination. Standridge, who did not return multiple requests for comment from Oklahoma Voice, told other media outlets she objected to supporting Tinney because she is a friend of the state board member he replaced.
The governor appointed Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende to the board in February while ousting three members he said were complicit in “needless political drama.” Stitt did so after the removed board members voted in favor of collecting public school students’ immigration status.
Paxton said he decided to carry Tinney’s nomination after speaking with Stitt, Tinney and Education Committee leader Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond.
“We didn’t want time to run out in the session without going ahead and getting this accomplished,” Paxton said. “We’re going to be able to get that done.”
Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende already have had a tumultuous three-month tenure on the board.

In their first board meeting Feb. 27, they voted on new academic standards for social studies education. They said they later learned the standards included significant changes they were unaware of at the time of the vote, including new language that casts doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election results. 
The controversy led to a confrontation during the board’s April meeting between the three new members and state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who directed the last-minute changes.
During that meeting, Walters said the updated standards were provided to the board members before the meeting, but he couldn’t force them to read the information. Records that Walters’ administration provided indicated the board members received the lengthy document at 4 p.m. the evening before the Feb. 27 meeting.
The episode stirred up questions about the standards’ legitimacy and Walters’ compliance with public transparency. A lawsuit already has been filed over whether the approval process of the standards followed proper procedures.
“I hope things smooth out, and the board as a whole can start moving forward and doing some good for education in Oklahoma,” Tinney said.
Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende faced numerous questions from the Senate committee about their approach to the board.

“I want to think of it as the state superintendent is like the team captain and the state Board of Education are like the coaches,” Deatherage told the committee. “The team captain helps run practice and lead the team, but the coaches make the game plan, choose the plays they were running and make sure the captain is doing a good job.”
Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, peppered Tinney, Deatherage and Van Denhende with questions and voted against their confirmation. Deevers, a member of the far-right-wing Freedom Caucus, said during Van Denhende’s hearing last week that he had no qualms with the nominee but believes “there’s been a disservice done to our board.”
He said he wouldn’t support Tinney because of the candidate’s connection to a professional organization for teachers. His wife, Ginger Tinney, leads Professional Oklahoma Educators and his son, Daniel Tinney, is the group’s government relations liaison. Tinney co-founded POE with his wife in 1998.

“I think there is too severe a conflict of interest for me to approve this,” Deevers said during the committee meeting.
Tinney said his proximity to POE will be an asset rather than a conflict. He said he would recuse from certain votes, if necessary, and wouldn’t share confidential board information with his family.
“I think it’s a real advantage that I have access to all those teachers and resources and knowledge about education,” Tinney said of the organization. “It will help me immensely on the board.”

The governor nominated Carson, a retired Edmond Public Schools teacher, to the board three weeks ago. She is the only recent board nominee who hasn’t yet taken office. If confirmed, Carson will fill a seat representing Congressional District 5 that has been vacant for two years.
Carson said Oklahoma must focus on improving student absenteeism rates, classroom funding, teacher retention and test scores.
“There shouldn’t be the controversy that is happening in this board right now,” Carson said during the committee meeting. “They’re there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to make sure that students are given a quality education in the state.”

Bill Lee's veto of a measure giving more authority to parole boards. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference is denouncing Gov. Bill Lee’s first veto and urging state lawmakers to override him on a bill giving the parole board more power.
Passed overwhelmingly with little fanfare by the legislature this year, HB527/SB455 expands the Board of Parole’s “authority to deny early release when the severity of the offense demands it or where it sends a critical message that serious crimes carry serious consequences,” a DAs Conference letter from early May says.
“These are not abstract concepts —- they are the bedrock of public safety, justice for victims, and confidence in the rule of law,” the letter says.
The state’s prosecutors, led by Executive Director Steve Crump, further say ignoring the “gravity and specific facts of an offender’s crime when determining early release eligibility is not only irresponsible, it is dangerous” because it disregards victims’ suffering and erodes trust in the criminal justice system.
The letter grows harsher, saying some crimes are so “egregious” the defendant should not receive “early” release.
Lee vetoed the bill May 5, calling it a “step backwards” from the advances of the Reentry Success Action of 2021. That measure passed with strong support and led the state to record its lowest rate of return to prison in history, Lee said when he defended his position.
Current statute allows the parole board — which is appointed by the governor — to deny parole based solely on the seriousness of the offense for 22 violent felonies. The bill seeks to broaden that authority beyond those crimes.
Republican Rep. Rick Scarbrough of Oak Ridge, a former Clinton Police chief, and Republican Sen. Paul Rose of Covington sponsored the measure.
Scarbrough said after the veto that the bill was designed to handle “critical gaps” in the state’s parole system to make sure serious offenses aren’t “minimized.”
A spokesperson for the governor did not respond to questions immediately Tuesday.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Budget-Public-Safety015-1024x596.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Free.,Democrats in Congress decry 'outrageous' DOJ charges against New Jersey colleague,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-congress-decry-outrageous-doj-charges-against-new-jersey-colleague,,"WASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats on Tuesday blasted the assault charges the Trump administration is pursuing against New Jersey U.S. Rep LaMonica McIver following a clash with law enforcement earlier this month outside an immigration detention center in Newark.Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, Democratic Women’s Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus defended McIver at a press conference attended by dozens of Democrats outside of the U.S. Capitol, arguing that the New Jersey Democrat was simply doing her job in conducting oversight of the facility.In a criminal complaint, McIver is charged with two counts of “assaulting, resisting, and impeding certain officers or employees,” with one charge involving a Homeland Security Investigations special agent and another surrounding an Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer.The charges are tied to McIver’s May 9 visit to the detention center, where she was accompanied by fellow New Jersey Democrats — Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman. The lawmakers had said they wanted to inspect the detention center.Federal authorities say McIver assaulted two officers as she tried to prevent the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Alina Habba, acting U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, announced Monday that she would be dropping a trespassing charge against Baraka stemming from the same standoff.‘Reprehensible political stunt’At the Capitol press conference, Rep. Yvette Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, described the charges as a “reprehensible political stunt.”The New York Democrat said “members of Congress have every right to conduct oversight at ICE facilities and any other federal agency, and when egregious, undeniable and vicious violations of the law and people’s freedoms are taking place, we, they, in fact, have an obligation to do so.”New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said McIver, Menendez and Watson Coleman “stood their ground, used their voice and did their job.”“They actually are obeying the Constitution. They are standing up to give checks and balances to this administration at a time that the Republicans in control of the House and the Senate are laying down and completely abrogating their duties to check and balance and give oversight to the president,” he added.New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone also condemned the charges on Tuesday, calling the Justice Department’s actions “outrageous.”Ahead of a Tuesday hearing in the House Judiciary Committee on “threats to ICE operations,” Pallone led several other New Jersey Democrats in writing to the panel’s chair, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, and ranking member, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, to express their support for the three lawmakers’ oversight visit to the detention center.The group also condemned what they see as efforts from the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “politicize and suppress lawful Congressional oversight through acts of intimidation and threats of legal action against our colleagues.”‘Baseless charges’Rep. Greg Casar, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the Department of Justice “filing baseless charges against a member of Congress for simply doing her job should send a chill down the spine of every American.”The Texas Democrat said the caucus held a meeting just before the press conference where they decided that they are “just about to go and do a lot more oversight visits at ICE facilities.”He said the members of the caucus recognized at the meeting that President Trump “doesn’t want us conducting oversight at ICE facilities like these brave members of Congress were doing — he wants to intimidate us out of doing that.”",,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330
,DC,2025-05-20 21:01:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House spending panel indicates it will boost Interior funding above Trump request,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-spending-panel-indicates-it-will-boost-interior-funding-above-trump-request,,"Just after President Donald Trump rallied U.S. House Republicans to pass a giant legislative package containing most of his domestic policy goals Tuesday, members of both parties on a U.S. House Appropriations subcommittee told Interior Secretary Doug Burgum they would likely provide his department more funding than Trump requested.Even as Republicans professed a deference to Trump — with the subcommittee’s chairman calling him “the boss” — they also reaffirmed Congress’ power to direct spending, winning a promise from Burgum to spend congressionally appropriated money for its intended purpose.Republicans and Democrats on the House Appropriations Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee raised concerns with Burgum about proposed deep cuts in the administration’s “skinny budget” request to the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Education and other Interior Department programs.“The administration proposed some deep funding cuts that we will likely not see eye-to-eye (on), especially when it comes to Indian programs and the operations of our national parks,” subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican, said.The subcommittee’s ranking Democrat, Maine’s Chellie Pingree, was more blunt in her objection to the budget request, saying she “wholeheartedly” opposed it.“Secretary Burgum, the document we're here to discuss today is more than just a budget,” she said. “It's a blueprint for dismantling the very mission of the Department of Interior, making it impossible to protect our natural resources and iconic national parks or uphold our commitments to tribal communities now and for future generations.”In his opening statement, Burgum highlighted efforts by the administration to increase oil and gas development, which he said would increase federal revenues from the department.Burgum rejects impoundmentThe panel’s hearing started late as Republican members were delayed listening to Trump address their conference’s weekly meeting.“I want to apologize for the half-hour late start; we were listening to the boss over at conference,” Simpson said, referring to Trump’s appearance at the House Republican Conference meeting.But, he continued, the panel would likely not accept the president’s recommendation to reduce the department’s budget by 30%, and he used his first question to put Burgum on the record about the administration’s duty to spend congressionally appropriated funds.“If Congress chooses to provide discretionary appropriations for the agency that are at levels above the president's budget request, how would you handle that?” Simpson asked. “In other words, would you spend the amounts provided in an enacted bill and for the specific programs that Congress identifies?”“Yes,” Burgum responded. “That would be the law.”While Congress has the constitutional authority to make federal spending decisions, spending hawks within the administration, including budget chief Russell Vought, have broached the idea of “impounding” money that Congress has directed. The legality of the concept is untested.Burgum’s response to Simpson rejected the use of impoundment, but Pingree noted that his department has still been unable to access appropriations due to delays at the Office of Management and Budget, which Vought oversees.‘Congress has the power of the purse’The continuing resolution that Trump signed in March included a provision that the Interior Department would have funds available within 60 days, she said. That deadline has passed but the money had not yet been apportioned, threatening job losses in Maine and other states, she said.Pingree asked Burgum if he was “pushing the OMB to appropriate your department’s funding.”Burgum said he was.“Okay, pushing is good,” she said. “So just from my perspective, if you don't get this funding, then that is impoundment. It is breaking the law. And I think perhaps on both sides of the aisle, we're feeling very frustrated this administration is not expeditiously appropriating what we funded.“Congress has the power of the purse,” she continued. “We meet in this committee, and we do an incredible amount of work negotiating back and forth on both sides of the aisle to arrive at these numbers and to figure out what should be done. And to have this administration just wantonly disregard what we have done, and to worry about having to do that in the next, 2026, budget, I would ask, you know what, why do committees meet? Why do we do the work that we're doing if, in fact, we can't count on the OMB?”Cut in spending on Park ServiceThe president’s budget request included a $900 million decrease in spending for the National Park Service, which is part of the Interior Department. The administration proposed turning some NPS assets over to the states to manage as a way to reduce expenses.Asked by Simpson about that idea, Burgum said no one was considering removing any of the 64 “crown jewel” national parks, but that some of the more than 400 other NPS sites could be managed by state or local authorities. Those sites may include historic battlefields or presidential birthplaces, he said.“There's, I think, zero intention of transferring any actual national parks,” he said. “I mean, the 64 crown jewels that we have, there's zero thought about that.”Full committee Chairman Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, noted that Burgum had taken the 64 large parks off the table, but was supportive of transferring smaller sites. He urged Burgum to look not just at states but at tribal governments.“Look at the Chickasaw National Recreational Area sometime,” Cole, a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation, said. “I guarantee you, we’d manage it better. And that's not to say the federal government does a bad job. They don't, but we would put more resources into it.”Tribal educationMembers also questioned Burgum on the administration’s proposed $187 million decrease for the Bureau of Indian Education construction.Burgum said his team was trying to understand the challenges of BIE facilities and noted that some were in need of maintenance.But he said that his experience as North Dakota governor showed him that poor outcomes at BIE were not necessarily related to funding.“It's not always correlated between the more money you spend, the better outcomes you get,” he said.Cole said he agreed with that idea, but said funding was also a statement of priorities.“But I also think that kids have to have a good place to learn,” he said. “And sometimes that's an expression of whether or not you care about them very much. And I've been to some excellent BIE schools… but I've been to some places I wouldn't send my kid to simply because the resources aren't there and haven't ever been there.”",,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Patrick Morrisey announced in a video message on Tuesday, May 20, 2025, that he has formally asked the federal government to disallow the state’s SNAP program from paying for soda. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey has formally asked the federal government to disallow the state’s food assistance program from paying for soda. Morrisey submitted a request for a waiver to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to make the change, the governor announced in a video message Tuesday.

“For a long time I’ve talked about the fact that SNAP — the N should stand for nutrition,” Morrisey said. “Well, now it’s going to, even more than you’ve seen in the past. We’re promoting healthy bundles. That’s fresh produce and lean meat, and good opportunities for some hot foods for West Virginians for some products that you’ve never been able to have before.”
Morrisey first announced the SNAP proposal during an event in March with federal Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted the idea of states prohibiting SNAP from covering soda. 
The SNAP changes are part of a statewide health initiative Morrisey called the “Four Pillars of a Healthy West Virginia.” Other pillars included prohibiting the sale of certain food dyes in the state, and the “Mountaineer Mile,” challenge to walk at least a mile a day.
Legislation similar to the SNAP change was introduced during the 2025 regular session, but went nowhere. House Bill 2350 would have required the state to submit a SNAP waiver so that the program could disallow coverage of soda and candy. Opponents of the bill expressed concerns it would hurt local grocery stores, particularly near the state border, by causing SNAP recipients to use their assistance to buy the sweets in stores across state lines.
One in six West Virginians, or approximately 277,000 residents, rely on the SNAP program for food assistance, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. The program is paid for by the federal government’s Department of Agriculture and administered through the state.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 20:53:36+00:00,CT Mirror,CT state police contract: House approves raises for troopers,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-state-police-contract-raises/,The proposal to boost pay by an effective 4.5% had bipartisan support despite objections from GOP leaders and is expected to pass the Senate.,"The House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a proposal that would grant state police troopers a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase next fiscal year.
The proposal, which is also expected to win approval in the Senate, passed 134-12 in the Democratic-controlled House, enjoying bipartisan support despite objections from GOP leaders.
Legislators from both parties have lamented a state police force that’s now about 25% smaller than the 1,200-plus troopers who served Connecticut prior to 2010. 
Democrats said the raises, which would affect an estimated 885 troopers, are essential to recruitment efforts.
But both House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, argued against the raises.
“We’re facing a collision course with a rather ugly truth” — that state employee compensation is becoming unsustainable, said Nuccio, who is the ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
Nearly all unionized workers have received a 2.5% general wage hike and a step, which typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise, each fiscal year since 2021-22.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, which negotiated the wage deal with the troopers, also is bargaining new contracts with all other major state employee unions. And it would be difficult for state officials to convince labor arbiters that Connecticut could not afford effective 4.5% annual increases for other state employees if the legislature approves one for troopers.
The House GOP proposed a $54.4 billion biennial budget earlier this month that counts on more than $300 million in savings over the next two fiscal years by freezing pay for all workers. 
Candelora said troopers earn an average of $116,000 per year in base pay, but compensation rises to $175,000 per year once overtime is considered. 
“There’s no amount of pay that’s going to be able to recruit more officers,” he said.
The solution, Candelora added, involves criminal justice reforms that give officers greater legal protection when performing searches or pulling over motorists on the highway. 
“What they really need is our support,” he said. “They need real criminal justice reform.”
Despite Nuccio and Candelora’s arguments, 35 of the 47 Republicans who cast ballots in Tuesday’s joined 99 Democrats in supporting the raises.
Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union and a former president, noted before a legislative panel earlier this month that union concessions packages have weakened retirement benefits for troopers.
Before 2011, a trooper was eligible for a hazardous duty pension based on the three highest annual salaries of a minimum 20 years of service.
Now Connecticut requires 25 years of service that offers a hybrid pension/401(k) benefit calculated on average wages over the entire 25-year span.
But Matthews also said workers deserve the raises in the deal and more. 
“It’s a dangerous job,” he said at the time, adding that 26 troopers have died in the line of duty and that post-traumatic stress injuries are “a real thing” many troopers face.
The legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated the agreement would cost state government nearly $4.1 million next fiscal year. Municipalities that participate in the resident state trooper program would collectively incur an added cost of $301,675 next fiscal year, nonpartisan analysts estimated.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_071-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

(Photo by Getty Images)As health care providers warn of depleted funds hampering services, the Maine Legislature appears poised to close off a path that would make already allocated Medicaid funding available sooner. 
With a 93-50 vote on Tuesday, the Maine House of Representatives failed to reach the two-thirds support needed to enact an emergency measure. 
The contents of this bill are already law. The funding was included in the two-year budget passed in March. What’s new is that this bill would make that funding available immediately.
Democrats pushed through a two-year budget that continued government spending at the same level but also included additional funding to address emergency needs, notably to address a $118 million funding deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. 
However, because that budget bill also failed to garner the support of two-thirds of the Legislature, the funding will not be available until late June. 
The Democratic majority moved ahead with that plan without GOP support after Senate Republicans refused to support an earlier change package for the current fiscal year to address the MaineCare deficit and other urgent needs unless it included structural reform to the health care program.
Legislative leadership accepted a late-submitted emergency bill, LD 1948, as a way to try to get the funding out to providers sooner. 
“This bill before us here is just the blank check part without the other reforms that we had agreed to,” House Minority Leader Billy Bob Falkingham (R-Winter Harbor) said ahead of the vote on Tuesday. 
However, not all members of the minority party felt the same way. Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) voted against the supplemental budget because at the time she’d felt that there was an opportunity to push for reform, but she said on Tuesday that the measure before the body was different. 
“Now what’s before us is, we’re asking ourselves, do we want to pay our bills?” Henderson said. “I would urge my colleagues, let’s let the past be the past.” 
Despite not clinching the support needed, the bill will still head to the Senate for enactment and could return to the lower chamber if the emergency threshold is reached in the upper chamber. 
The state started withholding some payments to health care providers on March 12 amid the budget debate to ensure some level of funding would be available for the duration of the current fiscal year. Several hospitals said then that they were not in a position to absorb the payment cuts.
Now, the total withheld to community-governed hospitals in the Maine Hospital Association is  approaching $100 million, Jeffrey Austin, vice president of government affairs for the association, told Maine Morning Star. 
“This is a lot of cash to not have available to pay bills with,” Austin said. “Maine hospitals have some of the lowest margins in the country and the highest debt.”
The load hospitals bear gets heavier with each day that goes by without a full restoration of reimbursements, Austin said. 
“It’s made a tough situation that much tougher,” he said, “and the sooner it’s over the better.” 
Several legislators said on the House floor Tuesday that they’ve heard similar concerns from constituents, both those who work in the health care field who are worried about layoffs and those who rely on Medicaid worried about accessing services. 
“So when I’m asked, ‘What’s in it for us?’” Rep. James Dill (D-Old Town) said. “The answer is simple: people.”
Hearing similar concerns in his district, Rep. David Rollins (D-Augusta) acknowledged LD 1948 won’t fix all of the financial challenges providers are currently facing, “but it will provide some relief by ensuring that the providers get the MaineCare funding they’re owed by the state.” 
Speaking with Maine Morning Star, Scott Hanson, president of the Maine Medical Association, which represents the state’s physicians, residents and medical students across all clinical specialties, had a similar view of the emergency legislation. While noting challenges with hiring and retention and what he sees as inadequate reimbursements rates, Hanson said MaineCare payments are a crucial part of providers’ bottom lines, so having that funding restored sooner is a priority for the association. 
Regardless, Hanson is concerned about the state of Medicaid, given possible cuts coming from the federal budget being considered by U.S. Congress. 
“Things are so, how shall we say, topsy turvy, or uncertain coming out of Washington,” as Hanson put it. 
The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees health care, approved a bill last week that proposes the largest cuts to Medicaid in the history of the program. The full House is expected to vote on the package this week and, if it passes, it would then head to the Senate, where GOP lawmakers are expected to rewrite numerous sections of the bill.
“That’s going to trickle down to the states as a lack of funding,” Hanson said. “So it could make the current crisis for Augusta legislators a whole lot worse.”
The two-year budget Democrats passed in March did not include any policy changes to address the sizable budget deficit the state faces over the next biennium, including another expected shortfall for MaineCare. Gov. Janet Mills’ proposals to close that gap — tax increases and program cuts — as well as the requests from the public and lawmakers are being considered for the next iteration of the budget plan.

On Tuesday the union announced it would strike starting May 27. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Nurses at Madison’s Meriter hospital plan to walk off the job for five days starting Tuesday, May 27, after negotiations on a new union contract ended Monday night without an agreement.
The hospital management and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin, which represents about 950 nurses at the hospital, are divided over pay, security provisions and whether the hospital should commit to specific ratios of how many patients are under a nurse’s care.
The union and the hospital management have scheduled another bargaining session for Monday, May 26 — the day before the strike is scheduled to start. If the strike goes forward, it is scheduled to last for five days, with union members returning on Sunday, June 1.
In order to allow hospitals to secure temporary replacement staff or move patients, federal law requires hospital workers to give at least 10 days notice before striking, which SEIU Wisconsin gave May 9. The union also opted for a fixed duration for the walkout.
“We don’t take going on strike lightly, but we truly feel in order to make the changes that are necessary we’re willing to fight to make things safe for our patients,” said Pat Raes, a long-time Meriter nurse and also president of SEIU Wisconsin, in an interview May 14.
“Nurses have been clear with Meriter management that we will strike for patient and staff safety, improved compensation to retain nurses, and staffing solutions that include the voices of bedside nurses who care for patients day in and day out,” declared a union statement issued Tuesday morning. “Meriter is still not listening to the nurses.”
The hospital, UnityPoint Health-Meriter, is one of 17 regional hospitals in the large, Iowa-centered nonprofit health care chain, UnityPoint Health.   
“We’ve been in a union environment for decades and know that a strike could happen. We always work very, very hard to avoid that,” said Sherry Casali, market chief nursing officer for the hospital, in a statement released to the press Tuesday. “I think both parties would prefer not to have a strike.”
In past years, the union and the hospital have worked with federal mediators during contract talks. This year federal mediation wasn’t available after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in March gutting the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), nursesan independent federal agency.
Although that order was blocked by a federal judge May 6, the union and hospital turned instead to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission.
Defined patient-nurse ratios have been a longtime goal for union nurses. California and Massachusetts both have state laws setting certain minimum ratios, according to  NurseJournal.org. A limited number of other states require hospitals to publish their nurse-to-staff ratios.
“The more patients you take care of once you get above that ratio puts every patient that you’re taking care of at higher risk for complications and higher risk for mortality,” Raes said.
The statement the hospital issued Tuesday acknowledged that “both parties agree on the importance of safe and effective staffing,” but said that mandated ratios “limit flexibility” and could make it more difficult “to adjust to patient needs and staff availability in real time.”
The hospital statement said the facility relies on its charge nurses, who “are key to staffing and have clear avenues to discuss any patient care needs throughout each shift.”
There are limits to flexibility, however, according to the members of the nursing staff. Flexibility “sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t,” said Amanda Husk, a postpartum nurse. “We just know there’s always a base need for nurses to make sure patients are safe.”
Husk said ensuring that the ratio of nurses is always sufficient “also prevents burnout and turnover of nurses. That’s a big deal.”
Raes said nurses also wanted stronger security measures — including metal detectors — in light of violent incidents at hospitals across the country that have led to injuries or deaths of health care workers.
The hospital’s statement said its security staff regularly updates security measures and plans additional unspecified changes this summer.
On pay, Raes said that while nurses in their first 12 years have had significant raises, those at the upper end of the scale for pay and longevity don’t see their pay keeping up.
The shift to a 401(k) retirement plan from a standard pension has diminished the incentive for more experienced nurses to stick around, said Raes, while the original pension plan encouraged longevity on the job.
Meriter’s statement said the hospital’s most recent pay offer would keep its nurses “some of the best-paid nurses in Wisconsin” as well as in Madison.

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), joins colleagues introducing the DOGE BROS Act, to increase penalties for improper access to personal info","Congressional Democrats say the DOGE BROS Act is needed to counter Elon Musk and DOGE's efforts to access individuals' personal information. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Several Congressional Democrats on Tuesday, including U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), announced a new bill aimed at countering what they describe as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency’s “continued efforts to improperly access” individuals’ “personally identifiable information,” such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and Social Security numbers.
The Defending Our Government’s Electronic data: Bolstering Responsible Oversight & Safeguards (DOGE BROS) Act would increase five penalties for violation of federal privacy laws.
As Source reported this week, the New Mexico Health Care Authority recently informed the contractor who manages payments on its behalf that it did not consent to such information being shared with the federal government, which requested the data. The United States Department of Agriculture, earlier this month, wrote a letter to all U.S. states asking them to provide the “names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers” of anyone who is receiving or has applied to receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP).
“From day one, Elon Musk’s DOGE has taken a wrecking ball to the federal government and critical services for the American people, all while carelessly pursuing their sensitive personal data,” Luján said in a statement. “Congress must do more to protect that information and keep it out of the wrong hands.”
Specifically, the law proposes the following penalty increases for improper disclosure:

identifiable information in any agency record from its current penalty of up to $5,000 to up to $30,000
information obtained from a computer in any U.S. agency or department without proper authorization from $250,000 up to $750,000
any Social Security or Medicare data would increase from $10,000 to $25,000
tax return information, which now carries a penalty up to $5,000, would increase up to $25,000
census data, now with a penalty up to $5,000, would increase up to $25,000

Lead sponsor U.S. Sen. Mark Warren (D-V.A.) said in a statement, “As unvetted and unqualified DOGE employees continue to recklessly access the sensitive personal information of millions of Americans, it’s important that we take steps to better protect this data. For too long, our privacy laws have sat outdated, barely serving as a deterrent for improper handling or potential release of information. This legislation would enforce that privacy must be a priority when handling the data of the American public.”

(Inset photo provided by Ryan Peterman campaign, background via Canva)Democrat Ryan Peterman announced he will run for Iowa secretary of state in the 2026 election.
Peterman, 34, who grew up in Bettendorf. He served 10 years as a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Navy after graduating from the Naval Academy, and later returned to work at the Naval Academy as a honor education officer. He also spent a year working as a legislative fellow for U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire. In a news release announcing his campaign, Peterman said these experiences give him a foundation to serve Iowans in the role “with integrity, transparency, and nonpartisan professionalism.”
If elected, Peterman said he would plan to focus on making voting more accessible for Iowans while protecting election security. Under the Republican trifecta at the Iowa Capitol, GOP lawmakers have passed several measures in recent years that Democrats say limits voters’ ability to participate in elections, such as shortening the early voting window and a ban on providing citizens with non-English ballots, voter registration forms and other materials.
“Iowa needs leaders who put country and community before politics” Peterman said. “Our elections should be free from partisan interference and focused on empowering voters. I’m running for Secretary of State because I believe in making it easier — not harder — for eligible Iowans to legally vote, and I will fight every day to ensure they can trust that their voice will be heard and their ballot will be counted.”
The seat is currently held by Republican Paul Pate, who won his fourth reelection to office in 2022 against Democratic challenger Joel Miller, former Linn County auditor. Pate has not yet announced whether he intends to seek another term.
Peterman also said he would focus on ensuring Iowans have faith in the state’s election systems. The most recent changes to Iowa’s voting laws came during the 2025 legislative session through a bill proposed by Pate allowing the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, as well as private entities, for voter roll verification. The legislation also allows voters to be challenged at the polls over their citizenship status, and laid out a process for marking a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” if local or state officials have received information the voter may not be legally qualified to vote, primarily in cases involving unconfirmed citizenship status.
These changes came following Pate’s directive to county auditors ahead of the 2024 general election to challenge the ballots of 2,176 voters identified as “potential noncitizens” based on state information that the Secretary of State’s office was unable to cross-check using a federal database. Pate said in March 277 people on the list were confirmed to not have U.S. citizenship, and 35 noncitizens cast ballots that were counted in the 2024 election.
Peterman kicked off his campaign with an event at Grumpy’s Saloon in the Village of East Davenport, and plans to hold another campaign launch event in Des Moines Wednesday at Star Bar.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ryan-Peterman-green-background.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Democrats and Progressives deliberated into Monday night on a request by more than 100 businesses to relocate a free lunch program in a downtown parking garage.

Photo by Corey McDonald/VTDiggerTensions emerging in the Burlington business community came to a head Monday night when the City Council, after hours of deliberation, voted to direct the mayor to relocate a free lunch program located in a downtown parking garage.The mutual aid program, Food Not Cops — the local chapter of Food Not Bombs — has operated out of the Marketplace Garage off Cherry Street for five years. There, volunteers and organizers distribute home-cooked meals to people struggling to find shelter or anyone in need of a meal.Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak on Monday said she has been in discussions with the group for months about a potential relocation. But earlier this month, a letter signed by more than 100 city businesses asked city officials to find a new location for the program.Its operation out of the parking garage “has had a negative impact on the area,” and the signatories suggested that “some attendees have repeatedly stolen from businesses or caused harm,” the letter reads. “We respectfully ask that this program be relocated to a more appropriate and secure setting—not eliminated.”The letter, sent directly to Mulvaney-Stanak, came days after Nectar’s, the famed bar and music venue, announced it would be closing for the summer.Signed by dozens of local businesses, restaurants and other property owners, the letter underscored feelings of uncertainty many community members have about the future of downtown. Business owners have said the downtown core has been beset by drug use and petty theft, which has contributed to a deterioration of foot traffic and business.Meanwhile, ongoing construction on Main Street has further compounded the issue. City officials say gross receipts tax revenues are down by about 10% over the past year as a result.“Businesses are closing their doors, valued long-term employees are leaving, and residents are increasingly choosing to avoid the downtown area. Those of us who remain feel neglected and increasingly unsafe,” the letter reads. “Our expectations are not for an unattainable ideal, but for effective leadership, genuine support, and the fundamental resources necessary to operate businesses that are safe, welcoming and sustainable.”A resolution, written and sponsored by Democratic Councilor Becca Brown McKnight and presented to the council on Monday, offered a boost to the business community by tackling these issues head on.The resolution called on the city Department of Public Works to conduct a feasibility assessment and timeline for reopening Main Street to one-way traffic, and urged the city’s Business and Workforce Development agency to conduct “more effective coordinated marketing and PR efforts that promote downtown and re-establish it as a vibrant, safe, and inclusive space.”But the resolution’s provision to find a new permanent location for the meal program prompted some backlash.A counter letter, signed by dozens of organizations and businesses, expressed support for the meal exchange program, while dozens of people protested outside of City Hall on Monday before the council meeting began.During the council’s public forum, Burlington resident Gabriel Nelson called the resolution “baseless scapegoating.” Leif Taranta, an Old North End resident, said the program was meeting the survival needs for many in the community.Sam Bliss, an organizer and spokesperson for Food Not Cops, contested that there was a safety issue at the garage.“Business owners want to move our lunch so that Church Street shoppers don’t have to look at poor, suffering people on their walk from their vehicles to the stores they’ll shop at,” Bliss said. “And I get it, I don’t like seeing my neighbors and friends unhoused or desperate either, but that’s not a safety issue, that’s a discomfort issue. Is the solution to avert our gaze? To push poor and suffering people out of sight, out of mind, so that business as usual can just go on?”Others who spoke at the meeting, however, supported the resolution. “Being pro-downtown and pro-business does not mean that we are against those that are unhoused,” said Megan Meinen, a downtown Burlington resident who works at Home and Garden Vermont on College Street. “We are not against those people. It also does not mean that we want mutual aid to stop or food distribution programs to stop. What businesses are against is behavior that is illegal. We want those behaviors to have consequences.”Progressive and Democratic city councilors on Monday deliberated into the night over the provisions addressing the meal exchange program, with Progressive Councilor Marek Broderick making a motion to strike its relocation from the resolution.Progressive councilors said the mayor needed more time to discuss the relocation with the group. Councilor Gene Bergman at one point asked Democratic colleagues to join them in removing the language, so they “could get as close to a unanimous vote on this as absolutely possible, because there are a number of good things in here that we should all be united on.”The two parties ultimately reached an agreement, with some Democratic councilors joining Progressives in an 8-4 vote to strip a provision that would have required the program to find a new location by June 14.It appeared at first to be a rare compromise between the city’s Progressive and Democratic councilors. But later in the meeting, Democratic Councilor Allie Schachter introduced an amendment to the resolution establishing a later deadline — July 14 instead of June 14 — for the mayor to find an alternative long-term location for the program.Progressive councilors accused Democrats of backing out of a compromise, while Mulvaney-Stanak accused Democrats of “legislating on the fly.”Schachter said the amendment “sets an intentionality” around the conversation, while McKnight later added that “the public deserves to know that the choice to allow it to continue is a policy choice and an enforcement choice.”“We need to be honest about the choices that we’re making here,” she said.The resolution eventually passed, with Councilor Carter Neubieser joining the Democratic majority to pass the resolution in an 8-4 vote. Mulvaney-Stanak now has a July 14 deadline to find a long-term location for the lunch service.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tensions mount in Burlington business community as council orders meal program relocation.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/food-not-cops-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

May 20, 2025 | Photo by Ben SolisIt was a rough day for the Michigan Department of State on Tuesday as lawmakers from two separate legislative committees grilled officials about major ongoing issues with the state’s new campaign finance reporting system.
The haranguing was a bipartisan affair, with lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle taking turns sharing the frustrations and disbelief over the lack of functionality of the state’s $9 million Michigan Transparency Network project, which launched late last year and replaced the aging Michigan Electronic Reporting and Tracking System.
Much of the ire was aimed at Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in the 2026 race. Christina Anderson, Benson’s chief of staff, appeared before the joint committee Tuesday to apologize for the shape of the system and vowed that the department would work nights and weekends until the issues are resolved.
“The current performance and usability of all functions of the MiTN system is below [Benson’s] standard of excellence and we will be working nights and weekends until it is fixed,” Anderson said. “The problems with the MiTN launch are deeply serious to us. We have a dedicated, talented team along with our top executives engaged in resolving this. … We will not pay another dime on this project until the system meets our standards, and I know that my team and the team at Tyler are committed to making this work, quickly.”

Halting payment to Tyler Technologies, the vendor chosen for the project, was included in the department’s next steps to fix issues and bring the site up to full functionality, Anderson added.
Republican members of the House Oversight Committee and the House Appropriations General Government Subcommittee, which met jointly on Tuesday to discuss the website’s woes, raised concerns about the cost of the project, its vendor and the bid process used to select them, as well as privacy and data concerns with the new website.
Several Democratic members of the committee had different concerns, like being able to submit accurate information on time according to Michigan campaign finance law, and worries about future ballot access if that information isn’t transmitted to the state properly.
Anderson testified before the committee with representatives from Tyler Technologies. In an overview of the decision to move to the MiTN system over the old MERTS program, Anderson said the previous system was antiquated, inefficient and had consistent problems that required significant updates. 
Anderson said a request for proposal was issued on the project in July 2022. The state had two bids – one from Tyler Technologies and another from TenX Software. New finance disclosure laws were passed a year later, necessitating an overhaul to the system to include that data along with the normal course of campaign finance reporting. MiTN was slated to launch in July 2024, but that date was pushed back until the end of the year, when it launched its system for lobbyist and agent disclosures. MiTN’s campaign finance module was launched in March of this year.
Issues arose with the new system upon launch, with many frequent users complaining about the lack of search functionality, a new login page that was not part of the old system and incomplete data. A summary page for candidate filings that outlined the total expenditures, contributions or campaign committee debts on one easy to read page was also absent.
Overall, Anderson said Benson and the MDOS team in charge of the project were pushing to complete the overhaul in an off-election year, but also by the end of the secretary’s term. In their zeal to meet that deadline, however, mistakes and data issues arose that led to the release of a faulty product.
“These launches, while able to capture the required filings, did not meet our standard of excellence,” Anderson said. “We struggled through a complicated data migration and had problems with our test environment reflecting the production environment. Essentially, things we thought were fixed were not.”
Of the total five-year, $9 million contract term with Tyler, the state has spent just more than $3 million, including $2.3 million on implementation and the rest on maintenance and hosting. Further payments were suspended to Tyler until each of the current list of 40 separate website issues were resolved.
Anderson said substantial work was being done to get the system up and running properly by the next candidate filing deadline, July 25. Search and bulk data upload functionality are a priority, Anderson added, and the website will again feature a summary page for easier access.
House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay) asked who made the decision to switch the systems. Anderson said it was a joint decision from several individuals in the Bureau of Elections, but she said she also supported the decision to launch the module when the department did because she believed the issues were fixed. Anderson said she would have not made that same decision, in retrospect.
DeBoyer also questioned the bidding process that selected Tyler Technologies, which has been the subject of bad press over its technology products and was named in several lawsuits across the nation. Although the Department of State had two initial bidders, TenX was disqualified, leaving only Tyler to bid on the project. DeBoyer equated that to a single-source bidding process because the department didn’t seek an alternate after punting the TenX bid.
It was also revealed in DeBoyer’s questioning that Tyler had purchased the subsidiary company that owned the state’s former MERTS system, raising conflict of interest concerns.
Abby Diaz, chief administrative officer with Tyler, told DeBoyer and other legislators who raised reputational concerns that the reporting on their company was largely inaccurate and that several of the lawsuits were without merit.
Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw) asked if Anderson believed the vendor had lied to her about the progress and functionality of the system. Anderson said she did not, noting that the data was displaying differently – and efficiently – in the test environment while the production environment displayed poorly. Kelly continued to question why department staff signed-off on the project each step of the way when issues persisted up until launch.
Anderson said that, with any software launch, issues will arise after launch that weren’t anticipated, which she said was regrettable.
Some Democrats, like Rep. Will Snyder of Muskegon and Rep. Dylan Wegela of Garden City, also said the issues with the website were alarming.
Wegela called for a refund of the state’s money. Rep. Reggie Miller (D-Van Buren Township) questioned the need for a refund or halting payment if no mistakes were made. She also wondered if Benson had been properly briefed on the issues as they occurred.
It was Snyder who raised concerns about barriers to getting on the ballot for sitting legislators and prospective candidates if they can’t accurately or timely file their campaign finance and financial disclosures.
He asked if the department would be willing to attest, in writing, that no legislators or candidates would be disqualified by the Bureau of Elections due to ongoing issues with the website. Anderson said she needed to be careful in her response because election law was tricky, but said she would submit a response in writing to the committees.
In a regularly scheduled news briefing with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), the speaker blamed the mess on Benson being distracted with her political ambitions for governor. He also agreed with Snyder’s ballot access concerns, noting then-presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s ballot access issues in Michigan and Benson’s refusal to remove him from the ballot when he turned to support now-President Donald Trump.

“If I were someone like [Detroit Mayor and independent gubernatorial candidate] Mike Duggan, I’d be pretty worried,” Hall said. “Cornell West, she found some way to disqualify him. With all this chaos, with a website that doesn’t work, and a very political Secretary of State running for governor, I’d be worried.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6631be2b-5867-49f5-b5d9-1bda1d5448b7-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

Free.,DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stumbles over questions from Democrats on habeas corpus,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dhs-secretary-kristi-noem-stumbles-over-questions-democrats-habeas-corpus,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Tuesday was grilled by senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee about funding estimates for a barrier along the southern border, as well as concerns about the Trump administration’s adherence to due process in immigration enforcement.Noem was sharply criticized by Democrats for her answers to questions about habeas corpus, which they said she did not define correctly. “Habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country,” Noem said before she was cut off by Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who had asked her for a definition.“That’s incorrect,” Hassan said. “Habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people. If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason.”As for the cost of President Donald Trump's border plans, even Republicans expressed doubts.“I know the wall is (of) great symbolic value, but I think we should reassess the cost,” Republican Chair Rand Paul of Kentucky said about the House’s reconciliation package, which calls for $46 billion in border wall funding.Noem appeared before the committee to discuss President Donald Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request for Congress along with the border security provisions in the reconciliation package. Congressional Republicans are using reconciliation — a special procedure that skirts the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — to put together one bill to fulfill Trump’s priorities on border security, tax cuts, energy policy and defense.“The border crisis is the biggest problem that was facing our country, and it was one that was imperative to fixing for our nation's future,” Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, said. “We're solving this crisis at a record pace, and we have delivered the most secure border in American history.”Senate Democrats pressed Noem about DHS spending, noting that she is on track to run out of funding by mid-July, and her agency’s immigration crackdown that has led to expensive immigration enforcement.The top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, noted that detaining migrants at the Guantanamo naval base costs as much as $100,000 a day, compared to $160 a day at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. “I think that's kind of outrageous,” Peters said. “I'm concerned by the staggering cost of this, and I would hope, Secretary (Noem), you could commit to providing this committee a detailed breakdown of the total cost of that operation there.”Noem said she would get the cost breakdown for him. Questions about habeas corpusSeveral Senate Democrats, including Hassan, Andy Kim of New Jersey and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, questioned comments from senior White House officials such as Stephen Miller, who has said discussions about suspending habeas corpus were underway.Habeas corpus allows people in the U.S. who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court, and it can be used to challenge immigration detention.The U.S. Constitution in allowing for habeas corpus to be suspended says “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” That provision is within Article I of the Constitution, which covers the functions of the legislative branch, or Congress.Habeas corpus has only been suspended four times in U.S. history, during the Civil War; in almost a dozen South Carolina counties that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during reconstruction; in a 1905 insurrection in U.S. territories in the Philippines; and after the Pearl Harbor bombing in Hawaii.Slotkin told Noem she was concerned by her response that she believes the president has the right to suspend habeas corpus.“You sat here in front of all of us and swore an oath to the Constitution,” Slotkin said to Noem, adding that if the president were to suspend habeas corpus, it would be a “complete overreach.”“It is a right that we all get, that American citizens get, that people who are in the United States legally have,” Slotkin said.Kim asked Noem, a former member of the U.S. House, if she knew what section of the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus and which article it’s under.Noem did not know the answer to either question.“It’s in Article I,” Kim said. “Do you know which branch of government Article I outlines the tasks and the responsibilities for?”Noem said Congress. She then argued former President Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus.Lincoln suspended habeas corpus between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia because of the Civil War and initially did so without congressional approval. He later called Congress back into session to get congressional approval for it.Reality show with competing immigrantsDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut asked Noem if DHS was considering hosting a reality show that would make immigrants compete for citizenship, according to multiple media reports.Noem vehemently denied that DHS was looking at it.“There may have been something submitted somewhere along the line, because there are proposals pitched to the department, but me and my executive team have no knowledge of a reality show, and it's not under consideration,” she said.Kim pressed Noem about the recent confrontation between House lawmakers and immigration officials at Delaney Hall in his home state of New Jersey.Three New Jersey Democratic members – Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez — were in Newark protesting the reopening of Delaney Hall, an immigrant detention center.The mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, who was also protesting, was arrested.The Trump administration Monday levied two felony charges against one of those members, McIver, accusing her of assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest.Kim said he was concerned about the incident and asked Noem if she was aware that members of Congress do not need prior notice to conduct oversight at DHS facilities.Members of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any DHS facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions in an appropriations law.Noem accused the three House members of “storming” the facility.“We give tours when members of Congress ask for it, we just ask that they not be politicized,” she said.Prep for big sporting eventsFlorida GOP Sen. Rick Scott and Rand Paul asked Noem about how prepared DHS is for providing security to big sporting events such as the Super Bowl and soccer's World Cup.Scott wanted to know how security preparations for the 2026 World Cup, which includes games in Miami, are going.Miami is one of 11 U.S. cities hosting the World Cup. The others are Atlanta; Boston; Dallas; Houston; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay area; the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area; Philadelphia; and Seattle.“We are working diligently with FIFA and other entities to ensure that cities and states have the assets that they need. This will be an unprecedented world event,” Noem said. “It will be taking place in three different countries and many cities across our country, but also Mexico and Canada, and it will take place over a month.”The World Cup, which first began in the 1930s, is typically held in one country every four years. The last time two countries hosted the month-long event was in 2002, with Japan and South Korea.Paul asked Noem if the NFL or FIFA, international soccer's governing body, ever paid DHS for its security measures.Noem said no.“Here's my point,” Paul said. “The NFL makes billions of dollars. These people ought to pay. I mean, it's ridiculous that the average taxpayer could never afford to go to an NFL Super Bowl, (and) has got to pay for their security.”",,,,2025-05-20 17:07:22.965330

(Getty image)The Rhode Island Ethics Commission is contemplating major changes to the state ethics code for the first time in over a decade.  
A pair of unanimous votes by the commission Tuesday start the rulemaking process to explicitly ban lobbyists from giving gifts other than campaign donations to public officials, and to increase the maximum value of “insubstantial” gifts that can be accepted to account for inflation.
The last time the ethics panel substantially updated state ethics laws was in 2012 to require public officials to include out-of-state travel on their annual financial disclosure documents, John Marion, Common Cause Rhode Island executive director, said.
Ciccone can vote on assault weapons ban, other gun bills, R.I. ethics panel says

The ethics panel’s votes Tuesday came without discussion, though Chairman Lauren Jones noted the two proposed rule changes were debated extensively in prior meetings.
One rule change was born out of a three-year state investigation into Gov. Dan McKee’s relationship with ILO Group, an education nonprofit awarded a 2021 multimillion-dollar state contract. An October report detailing the investigation by the Rhode Island State Police and Office of the Attorney General found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by McKee or his former advisor, Mike Magee. But Common Cause maintained that McKee’s acceptance of $90,000 worth of consulting services — some of which was for his reelection campaign — paid for by Magee’s education company, exposed flaws in the state ethics code. Common Cause in December wrote a letter to the ethics panel, asking it to consider updating ethics rules around gifts.
The state ethics law presently bans public officials and employees from accepting gifts above $25 in value from “interested persons,” defined as anyone with a “direct financial interest in a decision” that a public official or employee might make. 
While most state lobbyists adhere to this ban as a matter of practice, the law does not explicitly ban lobbyists from giving gifts to public officials in exchange for personal or business gain. That is why Magee was not penalized for paying for McKee’s consulting services in exchange for help steering a $5 million state education contract to Magee’s former colleague.
Common Cause has proposed expanding the definition of “interested persons” to explicitly include lobbyists, following practices adopted in at least 22 other states, according to its letter.

$25 limit may be too low for 2025
A second rule change being contemplated by the ethics panel would increase the monetary value of gifts that public officials or employees can accept. Existing limits of $25 per gift, with no more than $75 worth of gifts from the same person or group per year, were set in 2005. But some state lawmakers want the ethics panel to up the limit, as laid out in legislation sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III.
Ciccone’s bill, which received an initial vetting before the Senate Committee on Judiciary on April 8, calls for a $50 per-gift limit, with no more than $250 worth of gifts per year. 
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, said his proposal aimed to account for inflation.
“If you go to McDonald’s, you can get a great meal for $18,” he told the Senate Committee on Judiciary during a preliminary hearing on April 8. “If we go back to the late ‘90s early 2000s, I think this bill would put us $1 ahead of what it would bring that number to with inflation.” 
A $25 gift in 2005, when Rhode Island last updated its gift limit, equals $41 today based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator. A $75 per-year cap in 2005 is the equivalent of $126 today.
Gramitt countered that the Rhode Island Supreme Court in a 1992 advisory opinion empowered the ethics panel — not the legislature — to change the state ethics code.
“We think the Ethics Commission is the proper and appropriate place to handle it,” Gramitt told the judiciary committee on April 8. “We are taking it seriously.”
Examples of public officials or employees violating the existing gift limit are scarce — mostly because the law is very clear, Gramitt said at the April 8 hearing. But when the limit is surpassed, the repercussions are “really bad,” he said.
And they can take years to resolve. 
Ethical violations from a state investigation into the infamous 2023 Philly trip by a pair of former state officials remain pending after one of the officials, former administration director James Thorsen, refused to settle or admit wrongdoing. The panel is expected to get an update on the adjudicative hearing process, for which attorneys are taking depositions, at its June meeting.
Other states have $50 limit
The proposal put before the Ethics Commission Tuesday comes from a review of gift limits for public officials in other states. A $50 per gift limit — with a $150 limit per year — is the most common across states, according to a May 14 letter to the commission from Gramitt. Massachusetts relies on a $50 per limit, while Connecticut limits gifts to no more than $10, with a separate $50 cap for food and beverages.
Gramitt’s letter, however, noted the difficulty in making a direct comparison with other states, based on varied applications of who is subject to gift rules, and a host of exceptions such as for food, drinks and celebration of life events. Some states adjust gift limits based on changes to the consumer price index, Gramitt wrote.
Both changes will go through an extensive internal deliberation and review process before taking public feedback and eventually, a formal vote. Gramitt said he expects the commission will hold public hearings on the proposed changes “by the end of the summer.”
 A two-thirds majority of the nine-member panel is required to approve any changes to the state ethics code.

(Image via Maine Legislature live stream)The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday granted an injunction overruling the Maine House of Representatives’ decision to block Maine Rep. Laurel Libby from voting or speaking on the chamber floor after she was censured for posting personal information about a transgender student on her legislative Facebook page.
In a statement, the Republican from Auburn said the ruling was “a victory not just for my constituents, but for the Constitution itself.”
“The Supreme Court has affirmed what should never have been in question — that no state legislature has the power to silence an elected official simply for speaking truthfully about issues that matter,” she said. 
Libby has been barred from speaking on the chamber floor since late February, when the House voted 75-70 along party lines in favor of the censure, which would have ended if the legislator apologized to the body, which she has declined to do. 
Libby petitioned the high court last month after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure, which she argued disenfranchised her constituents. 
The ruling was issued by the so-called “shadow docket,” which is traditionally how the court handles procedural matters and does not involve extensive hearings or arguments, and the decisions often come with little-to-no explanation. There was no opinion issued in Libby’s favor. 
However, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson penned a dissenting opinion, arguing that the case raised a number of important questions about the rights of state legislatures to enforce its rules that the court “neither addressed nor answered.” She also questioned whether Libby’s appeal actually warranted emergency relief. 
“Not very long ago, this Court treaded carefully with respect to exercising its equitable power to issue injunctive relief at the request of a party claiming an emergency,” Jackson wrote. “Those days are no more. Today’s Court barely pauses to acknowledge these important threshold limitations on the exercise of its own authority. It opts instead to dole out error correction as it sees fit, regardless of the lack of any exigency and even when the applicants’ claims raise significant legal issues that warrant thorough evaluation by the lower courts that are dutifully considering them.”
“Also, as a practical matter, it is plainly prudent to reserve our emergency docket for applicants who demonstrate that they truly need our help now,” Jackson added.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor also said she would have denied the application.
The Facebook post at the heart of the dispute is credited with kicking off a firestorm that has since led to the U.S. Department of Justice suing Maine over its protections for transgender students. 
Days after Libby’s viral post, which contained the name and image of a transgender student athlete, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from the state for not complying with his executive order seeking to ban transgender women from competing in sports that correspond with their gender identity.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill to ban the sale of firefighter protective gear containing “forever chemicals” is gaining momentum in the Illinois General Assembly, as lawmakers, union leaders and firefighters themselves warn that the very equipment designed to save lives may be silently endangering them.

House Bill 2409, co-sponsored by Rep. Mike Kelly, D-Chicago, and Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, seeks to expand on the state’s existing PFAS Reduction Act by targeting a lesser-addressed but critical source of firefighter exposure to these harmful substances: their turnout gear.

Turnout gear, also known as bunker gear, is the specialized protective clothing worn by firefighters to protect them when they respond to fires or other hazardous situations.

“We know the damage that PFAs can do to our bodies,” Kelly said in an interview. “While this is supposed to protect us, it’s doing us serious harm.”

PFAS have long been used to make products -resistant to water, heat and staining, but research has increasingly linked them to serious health issues, including multiple forms of cancer. According to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization trying to protect environmental health through better industry standards, PFAS were first added to firefighters’ personal protective equipment in 1976.

The bill is backed by the Associated Firefighters of Illinois, a statewide union representing more than 17,000 firefighters and paramedics in 237 communities. Advocates argue that the legislation is crucial in addressing the leading cause of death among firefighters today—chronic illnesses such as cancer.

“Little did we know that the bunker gear, the very gear that is supposed to protect us, to keep us safe, is actually killing us,” AFFI President and retired firefighter Chuck Sullivan said. PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” because they can stay in the human body a long time.

Numerous scientific studies from the American Cancer Society, National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate the correlation between exposure to PFAS and the increased number of firefighters developing various forms of cancer. Kelly and Villavalam cited this research as the impetus driving the legislation.

Sullivan said the Illinois bill closely follows similar legislation passed in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Connecticut. Under HB 2409, manufacturers would be banned from selling gear containing PFAS in Illinois after Jan. 1, 2027. In the interim, labeling requirements would take effect beginning in 2026. Fire departments would be mandated to phase out affected equipment, such as self-contained breathing apparatuses or certain rescue harnesses, by 2030.

“When we put our gear on, it's not on the forefront of our mind that that is also dangerous and also giving us additional exposures,” Steve Shetsky, a member of AFFI’s executive board, said. “So this bill would absolutely limit those exposures, which would make this profession safer.”

Retired Chicago Fire Department Lieutenant Jim Tracy knows the risk firsthand. Diagnosed with colon cancer six years ago, he endured chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to eradicate the cancer he blames on the uniform.

“I was 22 years in the field when I got diagnosed,” Tracy said. “It is unfortunately one of those cancers you get from PFAS.”

Tracy, who spent 28 years working as a firefighter, said it was only recently that they received one set of gear that is “99% PFAS free.” The new equipment was delayed in production, he said, because manufacturers had to remove PFAS-laced materials from collars and cuffs and replace them with 100% cotton. Many firefighters, however, still wear older gear that is laden with forever chemicals.

“Personal protective equipment,” Tracy said. “It’s not very protective if it is giving us cancer.”

In addition to his own health battle, Tracy said he has many colleagues in the department who have gotten sick but do not report their illnesses out of fear of losing their jobs.

“They don’t want to get kicked off the job, so they go through it on their own and don’t tell the department,” he said.

‘Financial unknowns, replacements under testing’

HB 2409 passed the House 114-0 on April 10.  It passed a Senate committee unanimously and is awaiting final action on the Senate floor before it can head to Gov. JB Pritzker for a signature.

Despite bipartisan support in both legislative chambers, the Illinois Fire Chiefs Association has been vocal in its opposition to the bill, citing concerns about the availability and cost of compliant gear.

John Buckley, executive director of the IFCA, testified before the Senate Labor Committee on May 6, urging lawmakers to amend the bill to delay the enforcement date.

“Our ask and our solution to the problem was to move the date from Jan. 1, 2027, to Jan. 1, 2029 — to give two years to determine if gear would be available and meet the needs of the firefighters in Illinois,” Buckley said.

While Buckley emphasized that the IFCA supports eradicating PFAS from firefighter gear, he warned that the current timeline does not allow enough time for departments to identify, test and purchase safe alternatives, which he said are not affordable or readily accessible.

“Currently, nothing’s been tested and vetted that meets that requirement,” he said. “The gear that’s out there that is PFAS-free is in very limited use, and some of it does not meet national standards,” Buckley said.





Buckley also pointed out that the proposed legislation lacks a funding mechanism to help departments cover the cost of new gear, which he said could “range from $4,000 to $5,000 per set.”

According to the Office of the Illinois State Fire Marshal, the state has 39,564 firefighters. Outfitting each with PFAS-free equipment could cost between $158 million and $198 million—a significant expense as Illinois faces a tightening budget picture for fiscal year 2026.

Still, sponsors said protecting firefighters from potentially deadly chemical exposure should take precedence over its price tag and logistical concerns.

“Our first responders deserve to work with equipment and clothing that does not pose a risk to their health,” Villivalam said. “This measure ensures they are able to continue to be protected while doing their work effectively.”

Even if HB 2409 becomes law, Buckley said he plans to continue pushing for a 2029 effective date when the 104th General Assembly reconvenes in January 2026.

Mike Kehoe and First Lady Claudia Kehoe take a moment by the casket of Christopher S. “Kit” Bond during a memorial service Tuesday the Missouri State Capitol rotunda (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri said goodbye Tuesday to Kit Bond, the Republican former governor, U.S. Senator and auditor who spent 34 of his 86 years in public office.
During a memorial service in the Missouri Capitol Building’s rotunda, Bond was eulogized by John Ashcroft, the Republican who succeeded him in office as governor, and U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who said the two formed a lifelong friendship during Bond’s first term as governor from 1973 to 1977.
 Kit Bond’s portrait in the Hall of Governor’s is marked by a black band to memorialize his death (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
“Talk is cheap, but doing takes the devotion of one’s lifetime,” Ashcroft said. “Bond was a doer.”
Cleaver said he first met Bond as a civil rights leader, and the friendship was cemented during his time as mayor of Kansas City and when he was elected to Congress in 2004. 
On Cleaver’s arrival in Washington, Bond, starting his fourth term in the Senate, held a reception for the freshman Democrat. They worked together to restore the Liberty Memorial, obtain funds for a new courthouse and find money for bridge and road projects, Cleaver said.
“I will be delighted for the rest of my life to have worked with Kit Bond,” Cleaver said.
The hour-long ceremony also featured prayers from former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth, an Episcopal priest who, along with Bond and Ashcroft, were the young Republican leaders who broke a Democratic monopoly on state offices in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Bond’s casket will remain in the rotunda until 1 p.m. Wednesday, when he will be taken to St. Louis for a family memorial service and private interment.
Bond died May 13 and was survived by his wife of 22 years, Linda Holwick Bond, and his son, Samuel.
Bond grew up in Mexico, Missouri, the grandson of the founder of A.P. Green Industries, a fireclay manufacturer and a major employer at the time. He attended a boarding school in Massachusetts, Princeton University as an undergraduate and studied law in Virginia, practicing law in Washington, D.C., until he returned home in 1967. 
Bond lost a bid for Congress in 1968 before winning the race for state auditor in 1970. When he was elected governor in 1972 at the age of 33, he was — and remains — the youngest person ever to win the state’s highest office.
In 2020, veteran journalist Phill Brooks, who covered both Bond administrations for KMOX and the University of Missouri School of Journalism, wrote that Bond won office in 1972 by campaigning on a platform to restrict special interest influence in government.
“His victory empowered him to lead the successful, bipartisan legislative effort for campaign and lobbyist disclosure requirements, as well as the state’s ‘Sunshine Law’ requiring public access to government meetings and records,” Brooks wrote.
In his first term, Bond also won passage of stronger consumer protection laws and, in 1975, issued an executive order rescinding former Gov. Lilburn Boggs’ 1838 order that Mormons “must be exterminated or driven from the state.”
Bond also reorganized state government, taking it from 96 independent agencies to 14 state departments organized along lines of responsibility such as health, education and corrections.
After losing a bid for re-election, Bond made a political comeback in 1980, winning the governor’s office again. He won his seat in the U.S. Senate in 1986 and was re-elected three times.

The turnout Tuesday, which filled the rotunda for the 45-minute memorial service, included former governors Bob Holden and Mike Parson, former U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, people who had worked with Bond in Jefferson City and Washington, and current officials elected since he left office in 2010.
Warren Erdman, executive vice president-administration and corporate affairs for Kansas City Southern railway, was Bond’s chief of staff in his U.S. Senate office and an aide to Bond in his second term as governor. He said Bond embodied the spirit of the early Pilgrims, who founded a society, described by John Winthrop in 1630, as one of “communal charity, affection and unity.”
“Kit loved and practiced these beliefs throughout his lifetime and in his public service,” Erdmann said. “They were foundational to his approach to public service.”
In his second term as governor, Bond had to deal with state budget shortfalls as the economy weakened. He promoted and won passage of a $600 million construction bond issue to boost employment and renew state facilities.
As a senator, Bond became known for his work on the Senate Intelligence Committee, his commitment to national defense and, as illustrated by buildings like the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center at the University of Missouri, the source of earmarked federal funds for local projects.
When his son was born, Bond was introduced to the program for parental guidance of education that became known as Parents as Teachers. 
“I think that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export,” Bond said in an oral history interview in 2014. “We believe that when you advocate Parents as Teachers, you are telling people across the country that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export.”
In that same interview, Bond said “the job of governor was one of the most satisfying jobs I’ve ever had.”

Bond’s 1972 victory energized new leaders to go into public service, Ashcroft said in his eulogy.
“Over and over again. Kit launched the careers of young people, talented, committed, dedicated people who later, after appointment, found opportunity beckoning them to achievement levels they had not anticipated,” Ashcroft said.
Danforth, who has parted ways with Republicans over many issues in recent years, said Bond made state government better and enjoyed doing it.
“He elevated the quality of government,” Danforth said. “And besides that, in his day, politics was fun. I don’t think it’s fun anymore.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052025_kitbond12-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

The family of the late James Joseph Foster Jr. is suing the City of Sioux City, Sioux City Fire and Rescue, the Sioux City Police Department and 10 of their employees in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit claims that in the early hours of Aug. 18, 2023, a Sioux City police officer responded to a call about Foster, who was sitting or lying along the curb of a deserted residential street. Foster told the responding officer he had injured his arm, and eventually eight people from the police department and Sioux City Fire and Rescue responded.
According to the lawsuit, the 26-year-old Foster “never posed any threat” to the responders and was instead acting disoriented and fearful, repeatedly moving away from them.

At one point, paramedic Deanna LaMere allegedly decided the situation called for the use of a chemical restraint in the form of the incapacitating drug ketamine. With the assistance of other responders, Foster was “held down and injected against his will,” the lawsuit claims. “However, instead of injecting him with ketamine, LaMere injected him with a lethal dose of the paralytic medication rocuronium,” the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit claims body-cam footage shows Foster soon was gasping for air while asking, “Am I gonna die?” and repeatedly crying, “I can’t breathe.”
“You’re not gonna die, you’re fine,” Sioux City Police Officer Alan Schmeckpeper allegedly replied.  
“LaMere realized that she had given the incorrect and life-threatening medication rocuronium, but she did not notify anyone, nor did she take any action to protect his airway and/or intubate him before he became paralyzed and unable to breathe,” the lawsuit states. “Not a single person on-scene mentioned Mr. Foster’s objectively obvious respiratory distress and, instead, police officers handcuffed the chemically incapacitated Mr. Foster and strapped him to a gurney.”
Minutes later, Foster lay motionless with his eyes open and one of the individuals on scene told him, “Night-night,” the lawsuit claims.
In an ambulance en route to a hospital, Foster’s heart stopped and LaMere allegedly called ahead and falsely reported Foster had been given a dose of ketamine. Upon their arrival at the hospital, the lawsuit alleges, LaMere “finally informed medical personnel that she had injected him with rocuronium. She then continued her clumsy cover-up when she improperly disposed of the vials of rocuronium and ketamine in a sharps container in contravention of Sioux City Fire and Rescue’s policies and procedures.”
Foster died two days later, allegedly from an anoxic brain injury due to the administration of rocuronium, according to the lawsuit.
Criminal charge filed in the case
The lawsuit claims LaMere falsely recorded in an incident report that she had conducted an advanced life support assessment of Foster when she arrived on scene, although body-cam footage reportedly shows that this was never done. LaMere also is alleged to have falsely recorded that she and her EMT partner had verified the correct dose of the injection administered to Foster,
In addition, the lawsuit alleges LaMere “had one or more incidents similar to the one at issue in this lawsuit that she was not properly disciplined, retrained or dismissed and her employment continued despite her previous failures endangering multiple patients.”
The lawsuit seeks compensation for past and future economic losses and funeral and medical expenses, plus punitive damages. The city has yet to file a response to the allegations, and a representative of the city’s legal department declined on Tuesday to comment on the case.
The individual Sioux City employees named as defendants in the case include LaMere, Drake Carnahan, Dustin L. Johnson, Brandon R. DeRocher, Jordan Reinders, Jim Haden and Randall Wood of Sioux City Fire and Rescue, as well as Schmeckpeper, Carolina Ochoa and Donette Sassman of the Sioux City Police Department.
Separate from the civil lawsuit, court records show that on Jan. 16, 2025, LaMere was criminally charged with involuntary manslaughter and that she entered a not-guilty plea on Feb. 3, 2025.
According to an affidavit filed by Assistant Woodbury County Attorney Loan Hensley, LaMere realized her error when she went back to the ambulance to give what she believed would be a second dose of ketamine to give Foster. LaMere, Hensley states, “did not take the appropriate actions” at that time, and “did not take the appropriate steps to notify anyone or treat the patient any different. It wasn’t until they got to the emergency room at Mercy One Medical Center that the defendant told the ER physician about the medication error.”
A pretrial conference in the case is scheduled for July 18, 2025.
State records indicate LaMere’s paramedic license with the Iowa Bureau of Emergency Medical and Trauma Services is in good standing, with no history of public disciplinary action, and that it expires in March 2027.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)After outcry from several corners of the legal community, Louisiana lawmakers scuttled a controversial proposal backed by Attorney General Liz Murrill that could have moved thousands of criminal cases involving children and teenagers from juvenile to adult courts every year. 
The Louisiana Senate Finance Committee voted 6-5 Monday to reject Senate Bill 74 by Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport. The committee’s decision came a few weeks after state voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar constitutional amendment. 
The legislation would have mostly affected Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes, where juvenile courts operate separately from district courts. 
Larry Frieman, chief deputy attorney general, told senators the bill was crafted specifically to address New Orleans juvenile court judges who are too lenient on the teens and children who come before them. 

“They are one of the ones that have created this problem that we are trying to fix,” Frieman said. 
Pushback for the bill came from a wide swath of people involved in the criminal justice system who often aren’t aligned with each other. District attorneys, public defenders, judges and anti-incarceration groups all spoke out against the proposal. 
“The logistics of it are not as simple as everyone seems to think,” said Kyla Romanach, chief public defender for East Baton Rouge Parish, who opposed the legislation. 
Had it been approved, the bill would have allowed district attorneys and the attorney general to transfer 15- and 16-year-olds accused of felony crimes from juvenile courts to state district courts that mostly handle adult cases. 
District attorneys and the attorney general also would have gained the ability to move cases involving children under 15 accused of any crime, misdemeanor or felony,  from juvenile courts to city and parish courts that focus on adult cases. 
District attorneys can already move 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds into the adult criminal justice system, but only when they are accused of the most serious crimes such as murder, manslaughter and rape.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The Louisiana Legislature also passed a statute last year that reclassifies all 17-year-olds as adults in the eyes of the criminal justice system. They are automatically tried in adult court and face adult prison sentences.

The attorney general’s failed legislation would have further blurred the lines between punishments for adults and minors in Louisiana, though the additional children and teenagers transferred from juvenile to adult courts under the bill would have been subjected to juvenile law standards, Frieman said. 

Judges, prosecutors and public defenders from the four parishes with juvenile courts indicated the attorney general’s proposal would cost their courthouses and offices hundreds of thousands of dollars each. 

District attorneys and public defenders from East Baton Rouge, Jefferson and Caddo all said they would have to hire more staff to track cases in juvenile and district court if the legislation had been approved. 
Federal and state law also require minors to be separated from adult detainees. District courthouses in the four affected parishes don’t have the appropriate accommodations for minors and would have had to retrofit their buildings. 

East Baton Rouge judges said the changes they would have to undertake at their courthouse would have cost between $3 million and $10 million, according to a legislative financial analysis.

Legislators initially delayed a vote on the bill last week over questions about the accuracy of the financial analysis attached to it. An earlier version didn’t have as many of the potential costs included, in part, because State Public Defender Rémy Starns told the legislative staff to disregard information about potential expenses. 
Daniel Druilhet, a member of the Legislative Fiscal Office staff,  said Starns asked him to ignore any costs public defenders had initially said would be associated with the attorney general’s proposal. 
“[W]hile I did receive an initial response from the Office of the State Public Defender, including information from those four jurisdictions related to potential costs, I was contacted by Mr. Starns on May 2, 2025, instructing me not to include that cost in the fiscal note,” Druilhet told senators at a public hearing last week. 
In response to Druilhet’s comments, the senators put off a vote on the matter for a week so a new financial write-up could be put together. 

Sen. Katrina Jackson-Andrews, D-Monroe, chastised Starns for intervening in the legislative process. 

“I want our state employees to understand there’s not a time when they can tell our fiscal office  not to consider costs that have been submitted,” she said after Druilhet’s testimony. 
Starns told Jackson he had decided, after an amendment was added to the legislation, that the expenses his office had turned over to the fiscal office were no longer relevant. 
Starns has been working closely with the attorney general on other criminal justice bills filed this session that would give Starns more authority over local public defender office budgets and personnel.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5974-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of groups that reject transgender rights sued Colorado officials Monday over a newly signed law that put protections for transgender people, and how they are addressed, into Colorado’s anti-discrimination law.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, alleges that House Bill 25-1312 violates the First and 14th Amendments .
“The purpose of H.B. 25-1312 is clear. The law punishes those who refuse to speak using chosen names and pronouns, and it does so in order to suppress traditional beliefs about sex and gender. In other words, the law openly discriminates based on viewpoint,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit was brought by the Virginia-based conservative group Defending Education, the Colorado Parent Advocacy Network, Protect Kids Colorado, a health group called Do No Harm, and Grand Junction dermatologist Dr. Travis Morrell. CPAN and PKC are both parental-rights groups that advocate against “gender ideology” topics in schools, often from a far-right perspective.
It names Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, and the members of Colorado’s Civil Rights Division as defendants.
HB-1312, also known as the Kelly Loving Act after a transgender woman who died in the 2022 Club Q shooting, expands Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws to include a person’s chosen name and pronouns. Those laws apply to workplaces, schools and other places of public accommodation.
The law also includes provisions to make it easier for transgender people to change their name and gender markers on birth certificates, drivers licenses and marriage documents.
It was sponsored by Rep. Lorena Garcia of Adams County, Rep. Rebekah Stewart of Lakewood, Sen. Faith Winter of Broomfield and Sen. Chris Kolker of Centennial. It passed with entirely Democratic support, and Gov. Jared Polis signed it on May 16.
The bill was amended to remove several controversial provisions during the legislative process and faced stiff opposition from Republicans and conservative groups, including the parties in the new lawsuit.
They allege in the filing that the law could impact their ability to hold public advocacy events, publish materials and do other work. CPAN and PKC use “biologically accurate pronouns and birth names” for transgender people, a practice also known as misgendering and deadnaming. The groups worry that continuing to use those names and pronouns will result in an investigation from the state’s civil rights commission and individual lawsuits.
They argue that recent legal decisions — including 303 Creative v. Elenis, where a Colorado website designer did not want to create a hypothetical website for a gay couple — support the claim that HB-1312 unconstitutionally compels speech, in this case forcing them to refer to a transgender person by their name.
The lawsuit repeatedly misgenders and deadnames state Rep. Brianna Titone, former state legislative candidate Vivian Smotherman and transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney.
“When CPAN and (Executive Director) Ms. Gimelshteyn use birth names and biologically accurate pronouns, they are not doing so to be malicious or hurtful. They do so because this expression reflects their deeply held beliefs that sex is fixed in each person from the moment of conception and cannot be changed,” the lawsuit says. If they cannot use that language, their impact will be “greatly diminished.”
Morrell, the dermatologist, contended in the lawsuit that using someone’s “biological pronouns” is necessary for clear communication, as a person’s sex assigned at birth could be important when determining proper treatment.
Representatives from the Colorado Civil Rights Division and the attorney general’s office were unable to comment on the litigation.

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Vault in Tampa on May 20, 2025 (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)When Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended two Democratic state attorneys in recent years, he contended that both deserved to be removed because they were ignoring the law and not following their duties. But when asked on Tuesday in Tampa why he now supports his hand-picked attorney general saying that he wouldn’t defend the state law banning individuals 21 and under from purchasing a long gun, the governor called it a “different situation.”
DeSantis told a Phoenix reporter at a news conference in Tampa Tuesday morning that he stands behind Attorney General James Uthmeier’s decision to not fight the law if the case is accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court.
“You have an obligation to support and defend the Constitution,” he said. “And there are times when you have to make judgments about that. Now, those state attorneys were basically saying that they didn’t want to enforce statutes that the Legislature had done. They made their arguments as to why, but ultimately, I didn’t find those arguments to be persuasive.”
Uthmeier stated in March that if the National Rifle Association decided to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denying their claim that Florida’s 2018 law barring individuals under the age of 21 from buying a long gun is unconstitutional, his office would not defend the law in front of the nine justices in Washington D.C.  That possibility now exists after the NRA announced on Friday that they would appeal the 11th Circuit’s ruling to the highest court in the land (the Supreme Court has not said if it will hear the case).
Uthmeier has not said anything publicly about the NRA lawsuit since the gun rights organization filed the appeal on Friday
DeSantis said Tuesday that he personally has always believed the law to be unconstitutional. That measure was passed just weeks after the mass shooting at Parkland on Feb. 14, 2018, that claimed the lives of 17 people. The governor said that “it was an emotional time” in describing why the GOP-controlled Legislature passed the law, which received bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott. But he maintains that Uthmeier’s stance to not fight for the law in the U.S. Supreme Court is a “good faith position” because he doesn’t believe it’s consistent with the state Constitution.
“So that’s different than just saying that laws that have been passed you don’t like,” he added. “You can say that they’re unconstitutional, but that’s gotta be credible. It is credible. There’s a lot of people who have contested the constitutionality of suspending entirely someone’s right under an enumerated provision of the Constitution. I mean, I’m not just saying, ‘I have a right to this.’ There’s an enumerated provision. You’ve got people that are 18 years old that will be sent halfway around the world to carry a rifle in the Marine Corps. Then they finish that and they’re 20 and they can’t buy a rifle to go hunt? I think that’s a big problem.”
While the 11th Circuit has denied the NRA’s case, other federal courts have split on the issue of whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The 3rd, 5th and 8th circuits have ruled that they do, while the 10th and 11th circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
When DeSantis suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren in August 2022, he said “State attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law, not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda.”
The Phoenix reached out to Andrew Warren for a response.

“It’s clearly hypocritical,” he said in an email. “Asking him to explain himself is a complete waste of breath; they all lie with impunity.”
Warren was unsuccessful in his court battle to win his seat back, and ended up losing to Republican Suzy Lopez, the woman DeSantis appointed to replace him, last fall. The other state attorney the governor suspended, Orange/Osceola County State Attorney Monique Worrell did win her seat back last fall, defeating candidate Andrew Bain, whom the governor appointed to replace Worrell in 2023.
DeSantis has said that he also backs Uthmeier’s decision not to obey a federal court order requiring law enforcement agencies in Florida to halt immigration arrests under a new state law. That federal judge has said that Uthmeier needs to show cause why he should not be held in contempt or sanctioned for violating her order and will hold a hearing on the matter next week.
The Florida House of Representatives in March repealed the ban by supporting a measure that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third year in a row they have done so, but none of those proposals ever reached DeSantis’ desk because the Florida Senate chose not to follow suit.
A gun safety advocate blasted the decision by DeSantis and Uthmeier to not stand up for the law banning individuals under 21 from being able to purchase a long gun.
“Florida’s law was passed in the wake of the devastating Parkland mass shooting, and it’s beyond doubt constitutional. (U.S.) Attorney General Pam Bondi and her successors defended this lifesaving law against the NRA’s attacks for years as Florida’s attorney general, and ultimately the 11th Circuit upheld it by a vote of 8 to 4, in a decision joined by both Republican and Democratic appointees,” said Janet Carter, managing director of Second Amendment litigation at Everytown Law. “It is absurd for Florida’s governor and new attorney general to try and claim otherwise, especially when research shows prohibiting 18-20 year-olds from purchasing firearms is a commonsense tool for preventing gun violence.”

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals says convictions must stand against three adults who are in prison for their roles in the death of 8-year-old Raylee Browning.
The high-profile case has spurred attempted legislative changes — a bill known as “Raylee’s Law” — by a Democratic lawmaker who says the state’s limited homeschool regulations create a loophole to shield child abuse and neglect. Raylee was being homeschooled. 
The girl was underweight when she died in 2018 from sepsis because of a severe bacterial pneumonia infection. Raylee’s father, Marty Browning Jr., his wife and another adult ignored her deteriorating condition, a judge said, and court records said the adults failed to provide medicine or water. They were found guilty of neglect and sentenced to prison for 3 to 15 years. 
Marty Browning, his wife Julie Browning and Sherie Titchenell each appealed their convictions for a list of reasons that included a denial to a speedy trial and improperly admitting certain evidence. 
In three separate opinions issued Monday, the state Supreme Court denied their appeals, upholding the adults’ 2022 convictions in Fayette County Circuit Court.
Browning had been removed her from public school after her teachers reported suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services. According to testimony during the adults’ trial, CPS didn’t respond to the referral. 
The legislation, sponsored for multiple years by Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, seeks to pause a parent’s request to homeschool if there’s a pending child abuse investigation against the parent.
A bill including Raylee’s Law passed the House of Delegates this year, but wasn’t taken up by the Senate.

Taylor, who was elected to the Court of Appeals in 2023, will run against conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley in a race that will decide if liberals expand their majority on the Court. 
The two previous state Supreme Court elections, which consolidated the current 4-3 liberal majority, broke national spending records for judicial races. While the stakes won’t be as high in next year’s race, Bradley has been a prominent supporter of conservative causes since she was appointed to the Court by Gov. Scott Walker in 2015. 
Bradley sided with President Donald Trump in his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has been a vocal member of the right-wing Federalist Society. 
The election takes place just seven months before the midterm elections when statewide offices including governor and attorney general, as well as control of the Legislature, will be up for grabs — giving the state a view of the voting public’s mood before November. 
Taylor previously worked as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin’s public policy director and served in the Assembly from 2013 until she was appointed to the Dane County Circuit Court in 2020. 
“As an attorney, public servant, and now as a judge, I’ve always been committed to making sure everyone is able to access our justice system,” Taylor said in a statement. “The law is a powerful tool for protecting Wisconsinites, holding people accountable, and making our state stronger.” 
“Justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court must be fair, independent, and impartial,” Taylor said. “Justice Rebecca Bradley has proven that she’s more interested in pushing her own right-wing political agenda than protecting Wisconsinites’ rights and freedoms. Extremism and partisanship have no place on our state’s highest court. Everyone who comes before the court deserves to be heard, respected, and treated equally – that’s exactly what I’ll do as a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice.”
While Taylor has been elected to office six times, she has only faced a Republican opponent once. She ran unopposed for her Madison-area Assembly seat in 2012, 2014 and 2018. When she had an opponent in 2016, she won with 83% of the vote. She also ran unopposed for re-election to the Dane County Court in 2021 and for her seat on the District IV Court of Appeals in 2023. 
In a statement, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chair Brian Schimming noted that she’s never had to win the votes of people outside of heavily Democratic Dane County.
“Chris Taylor’s extreme partisan record has never been on full display outside of Dane County,” Schimming said. “After ‘liberal express lane’ elections in Dane County and an appointment from Tony Evers, Radical Democrat Chris Taylor will now have to answer for her extremely partisan record in the Legislature and on the bench.”

As a result, new premium hikes are on the way for employees, retirees and their families to close the gap.(Stock photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)  State Treasurer Brad Briner has been sounding the alarm for months. Faced with a $507 million deficit, North Carolina’s State Health Plan will require a combination of strategies to address the fiscal cliff and ensure the long-term care of the plan’s nearly 750,000 teachers and state employees.
On Tuesday, the State Health Plan’s Board of Trustees gave its initial approval to a series of actions that would reorient the plan, incentivizing members to use “bundled” participating providers or facilities.
  Treasurer Brad Briner and State Health Plan trustees discuss benefit changes to help stabilize the system. (Screengrab from May 20, 2025 meeting)
State employees and teachers would also be asked to do their part by paying higher health insurance premiums starting in 2026.
“We began this conversation in January around premium increases for the first time in eight years, a tack that nobody wanted to take,” said state Treasurer Brad Briner. “But buried in the materials here, you’ll see that what was going to be a $20 (monthly) premium increase at the lowest tier. It’s now a $5 premium increase at the lowest tier.”
Briner said significant time has been spent trying to insulate North Carolina’s lowest compensated employees from increases as much as possible, while determining the highest and best use of the dollars that are available. Out-of-pocket maximums would not change substantially, he pledged.
The State Health Plan is also taking steps towards eliminating all prior authorizations for independent primary care, another incentive for plan participants.
Thomas Friedman, executive administrator of the State Health Plan, said state employees who are members of the plan can expect several changes in the months ahead. For starters, the names of the most common plans will change.
  Source: State Health Plan presentation
The 70/30 plan will become the “Standard PPO plan” with annual deductibles rising from $1,500 to $3,000 for individuals, and families seeing their deductibles rise from $4,500 to $9,000. The average monthly premium would jump from $25 per month to $40 per month and could be adjusted higher based on the employee’s salary.
The 80/20 plan will be known as the “Plus PPO Plan” with annual deductibles rising from $1,250 to $1,500 for individuals, and from $3,250 for families under the current plan rising to $4,500. Those on the 80/20 plan would see their premiums jump from an average of $50 per month to $100. Higher income earners could see a monthly premium of $130.
While the numbers may not be popular with state workers or teachers, trustee Dr. Brad Miller noted that on the private insurance market, individuals are paying an average premium of $119 a month, with families paying a premium of $532.

What members pay for prescription drugs would also rise next year and in some cases substantially. Specialty medications (Tier 5) would increase from $350 under the current 70/30 plan to $600 under the new Standard plan.
Friedman noted that manufacturer coupons exist for many high-end, specialty drugs, allowing patients to pay little or nothing at all.
“Why not have the manufacturers pay more if they’re willing to do it?” Friedman offered.
Coverage of the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs remains “under development,” but nutrition and weight loss coaching would be available to everyone.
Moving forward, the State Health Plan is working to make it attractive to members – both financially and in terms of access – to engage with preferred providers.
Tuesday’s meeting of the Board of Trustees came as members of the state House advanced their own budget blueprint.
Friedman said that both the House and Senate budget proposals have fully funded the requests of the State Health Plan at a 5% premium increase per year.
“Given everything going on in the state and how little the budget increased, we are a substantial portion of that, and we are very grateful that they listened.”
Treasurer Briner also offered praise for the budget proposal emerging from the House.
“The House proposal fully funds the pension plan and increases funding to the State Health Plan to help in our effort to provide affordable, high-quality health care for state workers. Investments made in salary increases and cost-of-living bonuses will help ensure that the state can retain top talent.”

But Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said that the legislature should step up its funding, rather than ask school employees and state workers to shoulder higher health care costs.
“It’s not only unfair, but it is unsustainable,” Walker-Kelly told the trustees.
“We are already facing a critical staffing shortage, more than 8,000 school positions were vacant at the start of this year and one-in-five teachers left the classroom over the past two years. If we increase the cost for those who stay, how will we fill the gaps and who will be there for our students?”
Walker-Kelly said the decision is not simply about numbers on a spreadsheet; it is about the people who keep our schools and state services running.
A vote by the board to set the premiums for 2026 is set for Mid-August. Open enrollment with the new 2026 rates will be October 13-31.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic will know by Friday whether it will have to delay plans to begin holding Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees in June at its Leavenworth facility.
The city of Leavenworth in March filed suit in U.S. District Court asking for an injunction barring CoreCivic from moving forward on a contract with ICE to turn its closed Leavenworth prison into an immigrant detention facility.
The city also asked the court to determine whether CoreCivic must obtain a special use permit before reopening the prison, as the two parties disagree about whether CoreCivic falls under the city’s development regulations.
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse heard more than two hours of arguments Tuesday and questioned attorneys about why the injunction should be put in place. He promised a quick decision so the city would have time to appeal, if necessary, before CoreCivic follows through on its stated intent of reopening the facility June 1 as the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“The complaint talks a lot about the scene on the ground,” Crouse said. “I’m not focused on whether this is a good idea or a bad idea.”
Crouse referred to the city’s initial filing that, in part, highlighted what it called the “unquantifiable harm caused by CoreCivic’s mismanagement.” 
The city’s filing alleged difficulties CoreCivic caused in Leavenworth in the past, including failing to cooperate with city police, failing to report the death of an inmate for six days and “routinely refusing to turn over evidence.” 
Instead, Crouse spent his time questioning whether the city and its attorney, Joseph Hatley, had included a good cause of action in its filings. A cause of action, according to Cornell Law School, is “a set of predefined factual elements that allow for a legal remedy.”
“What basis do I have to act?” Crouse asked Hatley.
Hatley told the judge and asserted in an interview after the hearing that a solid cause of action was CoreCivic officials declining to apply for a special use permit as required by Leavenworth development regulations.
The city of Leavenworth put development regulations in place in 2012, during the time when CoreCivic ran the prison as the Leavenworth Detention Center. At that point, it was grandfathered in because it was already operating, Hatley said.
However, the facility closed in 2021 and has not operated as a detention center since, Hatley said. That means CoreCivic must get a special use permit to reopen, a statement CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann said was inaccurate.
She told Crouse that because CoreCivic has not changed the business it operates at the facility, which was open from 1992 to 2021 as a detention facility, and because they did not abandon the facility, they should not need to get a new special use permit.
Hausmann also said she believes the actions the city is taking are politically motivated. 
“We think it is telling that the decision to attempt to revoke the special use did not come until after CoreCivic entered into a contract with ICE,” she said. “That’s really what this is about, to leverage greater control over CoreCivic’s operations at the MRRC. We don’t think that’s appropriate.”
Hatley said the city had not filed in court previously because CoreCivic initially agreed with the city and in February applied for a special use permit. Then the company withdrew that application in February and said it did not think one was needed.

Hatley said an injunction stopping CoreCivic from housing ICE detainees at the facility would be a temporary measure while CoreCivic walked through the process of getting a special use permit.
“We’re not talking about lengthy delay, 2 to 3 months,” he said.
Leavenworth Mayor Holly Pittman, who attended the hearing along with several other city officials, said after the hearing that the city would be amenable to working with CoreCivic.
“I think we’d entertain any business, but they need to do it the right way,” she said.
City manager Scott Peterson, also at the hearing, denied that Leavenworth’s actions are politically motivated.
More than 20 people gathered outside the Frank Carlson Federal Building in Topeka where the court hearing was held to protest CoreCivic and the for-profit detention of immigrants. Many were part of the Kansas Interfaith Action advocacy group, said Rabbi Moti Rieber, who spoke passionately about why he objected to reopening the Leavenworth prison as an ICE facility.
He called CoreCivic a “bad corporate actor.”
“It’s the confluence of a lot of dysfunction,” Rieber said. “The private prison industry and Trump’s racist immigration policies are all coming together. At the current time, we’re seeing Trump’s ICE gestapo taking people off the streets, putting them in prison without due process. CoreCivic wants to take advantage of that.”
Others, like Pastor Jordan Stone from Atonement Lutheran Church in Overland Park, said this went against her faith.
“I think caring for our neighbors, caring for the least of these is important,” she said. “Standing up as a person of faith and saying this is not okay is important.” 
Stone said others may have different viewpoints about that, but she believes it comes from a place of fear.
“I think it doesn’t come from a place of caring,” she said.
Pastor Joanna Harader, of Bethel College Mennonite Church in Newton, spoke against private prisons and CoreCivic’s track record. She also was concerned about the current administration’s treatment of immigrants. 
“I’m disturbed by the lack of due process being given to immigrants,” Harader said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200575-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

Long, who worked as an auctioneer before serving six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district, also denied seeking donations from anyone associated with those companies that he used to pay off a personal loan he gave to his unsuccessful 2022 campaign for U.S. Senate. 
“You know as well as I do that anytime you’re dealing with the (Federal Elections Commission), you have to follow FEC guidelines,” Long told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. “And that’s exactly what I did all the way through.”
Democrats on the committee were not convinced that Long didn’t ask for the money.
“You expect us to believe that the money just fell out of the sky and it showed up in your campaign treasury?” said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. 
In December, Trump nominated Long to lead the IRS. At the time, Long’s campaign committee had $130,000 in debt — money that Long had loaned the campaign himself.
By early January, his Senate campaign committee raised $137,000, with much of the money coming from executives at companies that have been accused of selling fraudulent tax credits.
Billy Long’s bid to lead IRS under scrutiny over donations that paid off personal debt

In addition to the campaign donations, Wyden hammered Long for allegedly raking in “referral fees, steering clients to firms that sold fake tax shelters and pushing small businesses to unknowingly commit tax fraud.”
A financial disclosure Long submitted as part of his confirmation process shows him receiving at least $5,000 in compensation from White River, an Arkansas-based oil and gas company that sold a tax credit that the IRS says doesn’t actually exist. 
White River said in a statement that Long made an “insignificant amount of referrals of these credits to third parties” for the company, and that no federal agency has ever told it the credits are invalid. 
Long on Tuesday denied he’d ever met or interacted with anyone at White River and claimed he had only referred the credits to a few friends.
The Missouri Republican also faced tough questions from U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, over whether President Donald Trump is allowed to use the IRS to strip organizations of their nonprofit status.
Warren pointed to a portion of federal law that prohibits any member of the executive branch to request the IRS to conduct or terminate an audit on a taxpayer. 
“In the first place, he wouldn’t do that,” Long said.
“That’s not my question, Mr. Long,” Warren responded. 
A few seconds of back and forth later, Long said he was “going to follow the law,” but that “I’d have to go to the lawyers at the IRS to tell me.” 
Warren wasn’t impressed. 
“If you think follow the law is you get to make it up on the spot,” she said, “then you don’t get to be the IRS commissioner.” 
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat, continued the line of questioning later, pressing Long over whether he had previously said he would ignore an order from Trump to audit a taxpayer. 
“I think I told you that he wouldn’t do that in the first place,” Long responded, “but if he did, I’d do exactly what you said. So, yes.”
In his opening statement, Long vowed to make long-needed changes at the agency if confirmed to be the next IRS commissioner. And if he isn’t ultimately confirmed, he’ll gladly head back to Missouri.  
“I have the opportunity to make real transformational change to an agency that needs it more than any other federal agency,” he said. “Or I can go back home to southwest Missouri where the fish are biting and as they say, they ain’t going to catch themselves.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

In a letter to President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr, the Democrats said public health shouldn’t be a “casualty of political ideology” and called on the administration to reverse its policies.
“We are especially alarmed by the termination of $42 million in grants for HIV research. Florida has the third-highest rate of new HIV diagnoses in the country, and our communities rely on these programs to test, treat and prevent the spread of HIV.

“The minor events of history are valuable, though not always showy or picturesque.” — Mark Twain, 1891
“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary.” — Donald Trump, 2025
If I could slow time down just a kiss it would all come back, clear as that wink of a moon over freshly planted rows of cotton on Trout Valley Farm. Seems like only yesterday I was living out my calling, farming with my family in Tallahatchie County. The year before we had picked our best crop on record, and 2018 promised healthier markets for the fiber. Heading into spring I couldn’t wait to prep fields for planting. 
As farmers we are fundamentally hopeful people. The mere act of putting a seed into the earth and hanging the well-being of an entire family on it is itself an act of radical hope. As I once heard my father say, “Every year I take all I have and all I hope to ever have and plow it into the ground.”
And so, we entered the 2018 planting season with even more cotton acres than 2017. We didn’t know then there was doom on the horizon, though no one in our universe had ever heard of Wuhan, China.
And yet, China loomed large in our daily discussions about the future. A trade war simmered throughout the Spring. It was like the child’s game “King of the Hill: Tariff Edition.” The contestants: President Trump and General Secretary Xi JinPing. Every time cotton and grain markets went on a run, a presidential tweet or an announcement from Beijing would send commodities tumbling, as Sisyphus after a traipse up the mountain. 
By 2019 the markets were severely depressed for both. A tariff-induced depressed market, untimely drought, runaway production costs, and uncertainty due to the trade war forced us to close the doors on a 148-year-old, multi-generational, family-run farm. We became another victim of economic central planning and the hapless confluence of calamitous circumstances.

It caused my wife, our young daughter and me to upend our lives. The dream I worked for all my adult life and upon which my future depended, dead. At 40-years old, I had to recalibrate. My wife and I had to move from my community where we were both hopeful and active participants in its revitalization. 
In 2019, there was a 20% increase in farm bankruptcies across America. And this despite government largesse in the form of an inflation-inducing 28-billion-dollar bailout. While bankruptcies ran rampant, we don’t even know the total number of farmers who simply stopped, as we did, rented their land and moved away. In the final accounting, we’ll likely find that depopulation and dispossession of our rural and agricultural class is what led to America’s demise. 
While a farm is a dynamic and complex enterprise whereby any number and any combination of things can cause its failure, there is one thing that poses a greater immediate threat to any farm at any moment: Tariffs. 
Agrarian people have always known this. Our history is replete with political and sectional strife over the federal government’s use of tariffs and the redistributionism that comes with it. This history needs a little sunshine as agricultural people have always pulled the short straw with protectionist tariffs. 
The current iteration, as far as I can tell, is a negotiating tactic, yes. Revenue tariffs, it seems. But, President Trump has also been adamant that they are protectionist, intended to bring manufacturing jobs back, which, of course, is a laudable goal. It’s not clear that further impoverishing farm families, many of whom are already in financial straits, is the way to do it.
A recent Farm Journal poll showed that 54% of farmers don’t support tariffs as a negotiating strategy. The same poll found a bleak 92% of agriculture economists believe tariffs will hurt farmers in the long run. All the while the number of farmers has dwindled to a point where we are no longer a statistically significant parcel of the population.
Conflicts concerning tariffs along the urban/agricultural divide go back to the early years of the Republic. In 1816 Congress approved the first protective tariff, the Dallas Tariff at 20% to help pay off the debt from the War of 1812. They also wanted to level the playing field between English manufacturing and the nascent attempt at industrialism in the North. In 1824, the Sectional Tariff on imported goods went to 33% . In another four years the “Tariff of Abominations” placed a 38% tax on 92% of imported goods. Each of these found opposition across the South, as Southern farmers sold their crops and bought their goods on the international market. So, they had to pay more for goods and sell their crops for less, as we did in 2018.
South Carolina threatened secession. By 1832, South Carolina had the support of several states and declared these tariffs unconstitutional, thus unenforceable. President Andrew Jackson threatened the unthinkable: using the military to go to South Carolina and collect the duties at gun point. In 1833, President Jackson successfully urged Congress to pass the Force Act, to get the authority to do it. Henry Clay (architect of the American System agenda) and John C. Calhoun (Jackson’s vice president) avoided a disaster by reaching a compromise to incrementally reduce the tariffs, thereby stopping the Nullification Crisis from devolving into violence.
By 1842 Northern industrial interests were back at it with the Black Tariff. This put rates back around the levels of the “Tariff of Abominations.” The South howled claiming revolution was the only solution for this issue. James Polk won the next election and started reducing the tariff. The Walker Tariff of 1846 lowered the average rate to 25%. This stimulated trade and led to higher government revenues. While other major sectional differences persisted, on the tariff front, at least, the sections seemed satisfied.
In 1857, however, with a healthy tariff of around 15%, it began to fall apart. There was a financial panic that year caused by several converging events. However, a leading economist – Henry Carey, a Republican and avowed protectionist– laid the whole thing at the feet of the lower tariffs.
Due to Carey’s prominence, Rep. Justin Smith Morrill (R., Vermont), a founder of the Republican Party, recruited him to help develop a new tariff. For two years, prior to 1860, Congress debated the Morrill Tariff. It didn’t pass until after Abraham Lincoln’s election once states had started to secede. James Buchanan signed it into law on March 2, 1861, two days before Lincoln’s inauguration. 
As early as 1832, in the midst of the Nullification Crises, Lincoln said, “I am in favor of the internal improvement system and a high protective tariff,” before adding 28 years later in 1860, “My views have undergone no change… the tariff is to the government what a meal is to a family.” The Morrill tariff both informed and defined U.S. trade policy until the second incarnation of the income tax in 1913.
So, in terms of cultural differences in economic philosophy, what does this history verify except that farmers and stakeholders in an agricultural economy dependent on foreign trade have always vehemently advocated for free trade and against protectionist tariffs. And, that protectionist tariffs are a fundamental part of the Republican Party’s DNA. In fact, the Republican Party’s platform from 1860 featured the tariff as its 12th plank.
Mike Wagner, who owns Two Brooks Rice and farms grain in the Delta commiserated recently, “This tariff talk comes at the worst possible time for many of America’s farmers. There’s a perfect storm of conditions already [rising taxes, land/equipment/production costs] …China has not bought U.S. corn or soy since Jan. 16th.” After a pensive pause, he continued, “This happened most recently during the 45th presidency, and our export capacity never regained its footing…when agricultural markets are lost, the loss is permanent or gruelingly regained. A nation that can’t maintain the foundational part of its economy that farming is, and won’t support her growers, sacrifices her best defense.”
To better understand the impact of these particular tariffs, I spoke with Hank Reichle, president and CEO of Staplcotn, the oldest and largest cotton cooperative in the U.S. Echoing Mark Twain, he proffered, “By the way, history rhymes. Here we go again, like the Nullification Crisis, where agrarian South Carolina was concerned with tariffs restricting commerce, this time states concerned with the same are actually taking the President to court over the tariffs. 
“Compared to President Trump’s first term, this trade war is a little different because it doesn’t involve only China. Tariffs are only good for farmers if they create a competitive marketing advantage.” Reiterating the danger to farmers, he explained, “Tariffs slow the global economic growth that fuels consumption and so decreases demand for commodities.”
But, Reichle doesn’t only predict despair and doom. Due to the reciprocal nature of the context President Trump created, we could see commodity markets rise as new markets open to U.S. farmers. According to Reichle, “…there are several countries that buy a significant amount of cotton on the export market who could easily increase purchases from the U.S. while decreasing them from the likes of Brazil and Australia…”
Tenuous as it is, I worry for all my friends still farming and welcome this bit of hope. This is a year wherein the lives of many farmers and their families’ futures hang in the balance. If we get to harvest without a solution, it will not bode well for any of us. For without farmers prayerfully, hopefully and profitably “plowing all they have into the ground” every year, American society and its position in the world will crumble. 
Our greatest hope now is that our representatives in Washington remember their constituents and make deals (and tax cuts) that are in our best interest. Quickly.
Or, as Wagner put it, “Farming has always been a full contact sport…We need leadership. Not leadershit.”

Free.,RFK Jr. insists upcoming 'Make America Healthy Again' report won’t target farming,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-insists-upcoming-make-america-healthy-again-report-wont-target-farming,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress on Tuesday that a major report due out later this week from his agency will not disparage farmers or a commonly used pesticide.Kennedy, who has long been critical of certain aspects of modern agriculture and processed food, at a U.S. Senate hearing urged lawmakers to read the widely anticipated “Make America Healthy Again” report once it's published Thursday, but didn’t go into details about any possible recommendations.“Everybody will see the report,” Kennedy said. “And there's nobody that has a greater commitment to the American farmer than we do. The MAHA movement collapses if we can't partner with the American farmer in producing a safe, robust and abundant food supply.”His comments followed stern questioning from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who said she had read news reports from ""reliable sources” that the MAHA Commission’s initial assessment “may unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools that roughly 2% of our population relies on to help feed the remaining 98%.”“If Americans lose confidence in the safety and integrity of our food supply due to the unfounded claims that mislead consumers, public health will be at risk,” Hyde-Smith said. “I've said this before, and it's worth saying again, countries have gone to war over many things — politics, religion, race, trade, natural resources, oil, pride, you name it — but threaten a nation's food supply and allow people to go hungry. Let's see what happens then.”Hyde-Smith, who was her home state’s commissioner of agriculture and commerce from 2012 to 2018, probed Kennedy about his past work in environmental law and whether he might be inserting “confirmation bias” into the forthcoming report.She asked Kennedy if he would try to change the current approval for glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, that she referred to as “one of the most thoroughly studied products of its kind.”“We're talking about more than 1,500 studies and 50-plus years of review by the EPA and other leading global health authorities that have affirmed its safety when used as directed,"" Hyde-Smith said. ""Have you been able to review thousands of studies and decades of scientific review in a matter of months?""Kennedy responded that her “information about the report is just simply wrong.”“The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,” Kennedy said.Hyde-Smith continued her questioning and told Kennedy that it would be “a shame if the MAHA commission issues reports suggesting, without substantial facts and evidence, that our government got things terribly wrong when it reviewed a number of crop protection tools and deemed them to be safe.”Home energy program in MaineSeveral other Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee raised concerns during the two-hour hearing about how Kennedy has run HHS since they confirmed him in February.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, brought up the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which the Trump administration has called on Congress to eliminate.“The LIHEAP program, which we've talked about, is absolutely vital for thousands of older Mainers and low-income families,” Collins said. “It helps them avoid the constant worry of having to choose between keeping warm, buying essential foods and medications and other basic necessities.”Kennedy sought to distance himself from the president’s budget request, saying that he understands “the critical, historical importance of this program.”“President (Donald) Trump's rationale and (the Office of Management and Budget’s) rationale is that President Trump's energy policies are going to lower the cost of energy … so that everybody will get lower cost heating oil,” Kennedy said.NIH indirect costsSubcommittee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., brought up several issues with Kennedy, including efforts to change how much the National Institutes of Health provides to medical schools and research universities for Facilities and Administrative fees, often called indirect costs.NIH sought to set that amount at 15% across the board for any institution that receives a research grant from the agency, a significantly lower amount than many of the organizations had negotiated over the years, bringing about strong objections from institutions of higher education.That NIH policy has not taken effect as several lawsuits work their way through the federal court system.Kennedy indicated NIH has figured out a way to help medical schools and research universities pay for items like gloves, test tubes and mass spectrometers, particularly at state schools.“In the public universities, we are very much aware that those universities are using the money well, that it is absolutely necessary for them. And we're looking at a series of different ways that we can fund those costs through them,” Kennedy said. “But not through the independent, indirect cost structure, which loses all control, which deprives us of all control of how that money is spent.”Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican, brought up the measles outbreak and pressed Kennedy on whether HHS needed additional resources to help his home state and others get the virus under control.Kennedy testified the “best way to prevent the spread of measles is through vaccination” and that HHS has been urging “people to get their MMR vaccines.”South Dakota grant on mine safetySouth Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds called on Kennedy to continue fixing issues created earlier this year when HHS fired people working on mine safety issues at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.“My office has learned that staff at NIOSH's Spokane mining research division have been laid off. This office focuses on the unique challenges of Western mining operations that are often more geologically complex and exposed to harsher conditions,” Rounds said. “This division provides critical technical support for institutions like the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, which recently received a $1.25 million grant to improve underground mining safety. However, the grant has now been canceled due to loss of oversight from the Spokane office.""This is not just a missed opportunity, it undermines our ability to meet national security goals tied to mineral independence and supply chain resilience.""Kennedy testified that he’s been able to bring back 238 workers at the agency and said he would work with Rounds to address ongoing issues.Pledge to fund Head Start, but no dollar amountAlabama Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican, asked Kennedy about news reports earlier this year that HHS would ask Congress to zero out funding for Head Start, one of numerous programs left out of the administration’s skinny budget request. Head Start provides early learning, health, family and development programs for free for children from low-income families.Kennedy testified that eliminating Head Start would likely not be in the full budget request, which is set to be released later this year, though the White House budget office has not said when. He said it would ask Congress to fully fund the program, but didn’t share a dollar amount.“There's 800,000 of the poorest kids in this country who are served by this program. It not only teaches the kids preschool skills — reading, writing and arithmetic — before they get to prepare them for school. But it also teaches the parents and teaches them how to be good parents.”Kennedy said there are challenges faced by the Head Start program that he hopes to change during the next four years, including the quality of the food.“The food they're serving at Head Start is terrible. You need to change that,” Kennedy said. “We're poisoning the poorest kids from their youngest years, and we're going to change that.”",,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 19:08:02+00:00,CT Mirror,‘Just cause’ eviction reform dies in CT legislature — again,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-just-cause-evictions-bill/,"Although lawmakers said many of their colleagues privately supported the idea, not enough of them were willing to vote in favor of the bill.","Proposed reform to state eviction laws — which would have required landlords to provide a reason for evicting someone, a concept known as “just cause” — will not move forward this year, proponents said Tuesday.
As the legislature’s 2025 session approaches its final weeks, Housing Committee Co-Chair, Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said he doesn’t expect House Bill 6889 to come up for a vote in the House. The bill, which had broad support from Connecticut renters and housing advocates, passed the Housing Committee in March.
Although lawmakers who endorsed eviction reform said many of their colleagues privately supported it, not enough of them were willing to go public with that support by voting in favor of the bill.
“I don’t think there is any path forward at this point,” Felipe said Tuesday morning. “I believe we have the votes. I don’t believe those votes are all willing to be public at this point.”
Last year, Felipe faced problems in the House with a similar bill that would have reformed evictions in Connecticut. Although Senate leadership believed they had the votes, the House wasn’t able to secure enough support.
Felipe championed the just cause eviction bill again this session. The bill would have banned no-fault evictions, which typically occur at the end of a lease, in buildings with five or more units, after the tenant had been there for at least a year. Connecticut has similar protections in place for renters with disabilities and seniors.
Tenants say this type of eviction may be used in retaliation when renters complain about housing conditions or to evict every resident of a building or complex when new ownership purchases the property. 
Negotiations over the bill have been going back and forth for weeks. Members of the Democratic party were split, even in the committee process.
H.B. 6889 drew some of the most heated debate and the largest number of speakers of any bill the Housing Committee considered this session. 
Landlords opposed the bill, saying it would make it harder for them to evict problem tenants.
“There is no more cause for the ‘just cause’ bill today than there was when the legislature rejected it last year, because it does not protect Connecticut’s apartment communities and will not build one new apartment home to relieve the state’s housing shortage,” the Connecticut Apartment Association said in an April press release about the bill.
Ultimately, the bill faced a similar fate this year. 
Luke Melonakos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants Union, said Tuesday that the news of its demise was disheartening, particularly considering the hundreds of renters who testified and the broad support it drew from advocacy groups focused on housing, homelessness, health and labor unions.
“I don’t understand what these Democrats are so afraid of,”  Melonakos-Harrison said, adding that about a third of Connecticut residents are tenants compared to a much smaller number of landlords.
“It’s such a massive constituency that I struggle to understand why legislators, so many of them, seem to recognize landlords as a constituency with shared concerns, but don’t seem to recognize tenants as a constituency,” Melonakos-Harrison said.
The statewide Connecticut Tenants Union has gaining political power for the past few years, formalizing its structure and increasing lobbying activities. But lobbying groups representing landlords maintain a more established presence in the state Capitol.
While the bill was under consideration, some Connecticut residents received phone calls asking them to oppose the measure. “Imagine living next to someone who makes you feel unsafe, and there is nothing you can do about it. Can we count on you to oppose this bill?” one caller said.
House leadership earlier this month said support had been difficult to gather within the party caucus. Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he’d fielded concerns from lawmakers who feared that if new owners couldn’t evict renters, they wouldn’t be able to make renovations and rental housing would deteriorate.
Members of the Democratic caucus also raised concerns that it would be hard for landlords to evict “bad tenants,” Ritter said. Landlords have repeatedly raised the same issue — that if someone is smoking or being disruptive, it’s sometimes easier to evict them through a no-fault eviction. 
“You have people saying, ‘If you don’t incentivize people to come in, and then they can’t charge higher rents, they’re going to let their buildings be decrepit, deteriorate, and then flip it,” Ritter said. “And we could not solve that in the caucus. That was probably the single biggest issue.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said it’s a tough balance to strike between tenants’ rights and landlord issues.
Republican lawmakers broadly opposed the bill.
“I had serious concerns with this same proposal last year, which would have established a general right for any tenant to remain in a rental unit after a lease term expires in perpetuity. It didn’t even come up for a vote in the House because it’s a problematic concept,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, in a text message after the launch of the just cause campaign.
Sen. Rob Sampson of Wolcott, ranking member of the Housing Committee, has said the bill would violate landlords’ rights and that government shouldn’t encroach on private contracts like leases.
It wasn’t clear whether Gov. Ned Lamont supported the bill. At a recent press briefing, he gave what he admitted was a neutral response when questioned about his stance.
“Look, rents are going up a lot,” Lamont said. “There’s a lot of sudden shock. A lot of people are at risk of losing a place to stay. So I understand the worry about that. You also want to get a balance and make sure we have people continuing to invest in a state like this with rental units.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0203_SR_HousingPolicy207-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

(Photo by Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Lake Mead’s infamous bathtub ring is expected to get bigger this summer as low snowpack levels in the Rocky Mountains choke the reservoir’s biggest source of water – the Colorado River.
Snow melt from the Rocky Mountains contributes about 85% of the total water flow in the Colorado River, but those flows will likely be lower than usual this summer, according to federal data.
Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks.
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year.
Utah Gov. Cox issues drought executive order, urges Utahns to conserve water

A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The snow pack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said.
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too.
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.
Stalled talks and a problematic pipeline
The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are currently working on setting rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Representatives Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.
The office of Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A troubled Southern New Mexico utility scrutinized for recent arsenic violations has just logged yet another one, prompting state environmental officials to evaluate taking rare emergency action.
The Camino Real Regional Utility Authority manages drinking water and sewage for approximately 19,000 people in the southern portion of Doña Ana County, Sunland Park and Santa Teresa. The area has high levels of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, which can cause cancers and other health threats over years of exposure.
After a series of water quality issues in late 2023, state investigators found the utility had bypassed its arsenic treatment systems and sent water with high-level of arsenic to residents, in addition to dozens of other violations. New CRRUA leadership said it had addressed those violations, but recently self-reported arsenic levels in the water at one plant that violate the federal standards.
Last week, Doña Ana County commissioners voted unanimously to terminate its role in the utility’s governance, as residents and the state’s environment secretary continue to criticize the utility’s lack of accountability.
New Mexico’s environment secretary urges Sunland Park to cut ties with troubled water utility

Now, the state Environment Department reports that water tests the agency itself took at CCRUA on May 7 recorded arsenic levels at the Santa Teresa Industrial Park plant that violated the federal limit.
This marks the third overage recorded at the plant in recent weeks, although the other tests were from voluntary tests.
Because of the ways contaminants are measured — using a quarterly average —  the state has little regulatory authority to intervene unless further violations are recorded, NMED Water Protection Division Director Jonas Armstrong told SourceNM.
“We’ve encouraged the system to do what community groups are asking, in terms of providing onsite treatment, test strips and things like that at no cost to the ratepayers,” he said.
Thus, Jonas said, NMED is now looking at the standards for enacting emergency powers to address “immediate and substantial endangerment.”
“This is a system that has had issues with water quality for years,” he said. ”Every single instance where we find continuing evidence of that is additionally concerning, and so it is potentially, an area when the emergency authority could be exercised.”
Officials confirmed it would be the first time the state has used these specific emergency powers for drinking water in recent memory, although the department has enacted the authority in other situations, such as concern for hazardous waste.
Those powers, laid out in both state and federal law, could mean ordering CRRUA to provide alternate water supplies, or open a civil lawsuit for further action.
Charles de Saillan, a longtime environmental attorney in New Mexico, told Source NM the federal law requires the agency to determine first if there’s an imminent and substantial threat to human health.
“The environment department would have the burden, if it took the case to court, or issued an order and that order was challenged, to prove that there was an imminent and substantial endangerment,” he said.
Source NM calls, emails and texts to CRRUA Executive Director Juan Carlos Crosby and spokesperson Udell Vigil went unreturned Monday.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9851-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

(Courtesy of USGS EROS Center)A preliminary budget request from President Donald Trump takes aim at a satellite program with a 50-year history whose data is housed just northeast of Sioux Falls, at a facility employing hundreds of people.
Trump’s discretionary budget request for NASA would cut $1.1 billion in funding for Earth observation programs, including what the request describes as cuts to the “gold-plated, two billion dollar Landsat Next” mission. The cut amounts to roughly half of the space agency’s budget for Earth observation, which includes money for Landsat design.
Landsat Next is planned as the next generation of Landsat, whose nine iterations have created the longest continuously collected Earth observation record in history. The first satellite launched in 1972.
NASA builds and launches Landsat satellites. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates them and curates the data collected by them. 

  Powerful storms containing heavy rains caused major flooding to areas in the east central portion of the United States in early April 2025. Some communities in Kentucky saw more than 15 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. In the days following April 7 — the day Landsat 8 captured this imagery over a portion of the affected area — the Kentucky and Ohio rivers were forecast to reach historic levels and crest in dozens of locations. (Courtesy USGS Landsat program)

The USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center near Sioux Falls has housed Landsat data since 1973, in addition to millions of images from other satellites and modern and historical aerial imagery, all of which is accessible at no cost to users. Landsat’s free data is used to calibrate data from commercial satellites, contributing to what the USGS calculated last fall as a $25.6 billion return on public investment since the agency began freely sharing data in 2008.
The most recent satellite in the series, Landsat 9, entered low-earth orbit in 2021. Between that satellite and its near-identical predecessor, Landsat 8, the system gathers new imagery data of the entire Earth’s surface — as well as imagery from spectral bands like infrared that are invisible to the naked eye and measurements of Earth surface temperatures — every eight days.
Landsat Next was set to launch around 2030, with improvements in resolution and speedier repeat image collection.
Trump’s budget request would “restructure” the Landsat Next mission “while NASA studies more affordable ways to maintain the continuity of Landsat imagery, which is used by natural resource managers, States, and industry.”
The request also calls for the elimination of $562 million in USGS funding. The change “eliminates programs that provide grants to universities, duplicate other Federal research programs and focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change) to instead focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals,” Trump’s budget request says. 
The cut to USGS amounts to about a third of its $1.6 billion budget.
The budget request is separate from the federal government’s efforts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to pare down the federal workforce. 
Probationary employees across multiple federal agencies were first dismissed in February, but many returned to the federal payroll and placed on paid administrative leave after legal challenges.
It’s unclear how those moves to reduce the federal workforce have impacted the EROS Center.
Around 600 government employees and contractors work at the center, according to the latest figures posted on the USGS website, but the site including that figure hasn’t changed since March 2023.
Emails from South Dakota Searchlight to USGS press contacts at EROS and in regional and national offices on the number of employees who’ve departed since Jan. 25 went unanswered.
The biggest thing you’ve never heard of: How EROS changed the world from a cornfield

Searchlight also asked about the potential impact of the USGS budget cut proposal to EROS science programs, and about how changes to the Landsat program could affect EROS.
A NASA spokesperson told South Dakota Searchlight that the agency would be in a better position to respond “once we receive the President’s full budget request in the coming weeks.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, pointed out that presidential budget requests are “aspirational” and “rarely implemented as written.”
“Dusty will continue to be supportive of Landsat’s efforts in Congress,” said a Johnson spokesperson.
The NASA budget has not emerged as a discussion point in budget reconciliation talks underway in Washington, D.C., on Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, sounded similar notes in his response to questions about Landsat. 
“The president’s discretionary budget is just that — discretionary. It outlines the president’s priorities and wish lists, but it will ultimately be our job in Congress to set the budget and appropriate federal dollars,” Rounds said in an emailed statement.
Representatives for Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return emails requesting comment on Landsat and EROS.
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told Searchlight during a visit to Sioux Falls recently that he hadn’t heard about requested cuts to the satellite program or to the USGS.
Even so, Rhoden said he trusts that an open relationship with the Trump administration on South Dakota’s priorities will help preserve them through budget negotiations.

“They give you some wiggle room as far as what your priorities are, and so I’m kind of optimistic that they are tempering some of those decisions with common sense,” Rhoden said.
Trump’s actions have had at least one public impact on EROS, though not an operational one.
EROS is home to a supercomputer whose processing power is shared across multiple arms of the Department of Interior. The system came to EROS with the name Denali, named after the tallest peak in the U.S. 
Like the Alaska mountain after which the computer was named, the Denali system at EROS was renamed “McKinley” after the issuance of a Trump executive order.
Denali has long been the mountain’s name among Alaska’s Indigenous Athabascans, but the federal government embraced the name given to it by a prospector for about 100 years. The prospector called it “Mount McKinley,” after then-presidential candidate William McKinley.
President Barack Obama renamed it Denali in 2015, matching the name the surrounding national park had taken nearly 40 years earlier.
The order does not mention the USGS or supercomputers, but rather instructs the Department of Interior to “update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.”
The EROS supercomputer’s name was changed based on the order, however.
“Pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order No. 14172, ‘Restoring Names that Honor American Greatness,’ this supercomputer has been renamed to McKinley,” a poster in the EROS visitor area now reads.

Jared Polis signed an executive order May 16 that pushes local governments to comply with certain state housing laws as a condition of receiving state grant funding, at the Colorado Capitol in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Six cities in the Front Range filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Gov. Jared Polis claiming recently approved state housing laws violate the Colorado Constitution’s home rule provisions. 
The 86-page lawsuit filed in Denver District Court Monday says Colorado courts have established that matters of land use and zoning are “core matters of local concern,” and that home rule cities are “not inferior” to the Colorado Legislature. Colorado has 105 municipalities with home rule power, meaning they can make laws on matters of local concern instead of being directed by the state.
The General Assembly approved two laws in 2024 that are subject to the lawsuit: one that allows for denser housing close to transit stops and another that prohibits minimum parking requirements. The lawsuit also challenges an executive order Polis signed Friday to incentivize municipalities to comply with new state housing laws if they want to receive discretionary grant funding.

Housing availability and affordability has been a growing crisis in Colorado that state legislators have sought to address since 2023, when a major land use package failed on the last day of the legislative session. A 2023 housing executive order Polis signed said the state is short tens of thousands of housing units, and his latest order said the same concerns continue to escalate. 
Plaintiff cities include Greenwood Village, Arvada, Aurora, Glendale, Lafayette and Westminster. The lawsuit outlines each of the cities’ zoning and land use approval processes and how they have increased their own efforts to build more affordable housing, and how abiding by the new state laws would disrupt their approval processes. 
The cities argue the new laws won’t immediately lead to an increase in affordable housing and that a one-size-fits-all approach to zoning isn’t appropriate for the cities in the Denver metro area. They also said the laws’ requirements take away a citizen’s right to be heard on land use issues as each new potential development is reviewed at the city level.  
The lawsuit says provisions of the Colorado Constitution mandate court declarations that the two new laws “have neither force nor effect in the Cities,” and it asks for injunctive relief barring enforcement of the laws. In particular, it says House Bill 24-1313 — related to transit-oriented housing — “departs from time-tested approaches to resolving local land-use decisions” in Colorado.
“In a move without precedent in Colorado’s history of planning and zoning, the General Assembly mandated site-specific zoning changes in select urban Colorado communities, including the Cities, that the General Assembly dubbed ‘transit-oriented communities,’” the lawsuit says. 
Defendants include the state, Polis, the Department of Local Affairs and DOLA Executive Director Maria De Cambra. Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said Polis is “confident” a court will rule in favor of the state, and he is proud to have worked together with many local governments to work toward solving the state’s housing shortage. 
“It’s disappointing to see certain local governments that have among the priciest homes in Colorado use taxpayer money on a lawsuit that could go toward lowering the cost of housing,” Wieman said in a statement. “It’s clear this lawsuit is about preventing more housing from being built that Coloradans can afford. Rather than standing in the way of more housing being built, Governor Polis and the General Assembly have passed common-sense laws that break down barriers to housing. 
The lawsuit seeks declarations that both laws violate certain articles of the Colorado Constitution, violate due process, and that Polis’ executive order exceeds the governor’s powers.

Government […],"The Iowa Supreme Court chamber in the Iowa Judicial Building on Feb. 22, 2023. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Supreme Court gave citizen engagement and accessibility to public meetings a much-needed boost Friday in an appeal of a lawsuit against the Iowa City Community School District.
The district’s practice of posting full videos of school board meetings on the internet for on-demand public viewing was at the heart of the case.
Government officials, staffs of statewide organizations of cities, counties and school boards, and access advocates like the Iowa Freedom of Information Council had awaited the decision with some trepidation. They worried the court might impose liability for statements expressed during public comment portions of governmental meetings and for their republication via internet posting of meeting recordings on government web sites or YouTube.
But the justices unanimously upheld lower court decisions dismissing the claims by Amie Villarini, the former girls’ tennis coach at Iowa City West High School.
The Supreme Court ruling should curtail a recent practice by an increasing number of public officials who advocated that the risk of defamation lawsuits made it necessary for city councils and school boards to omit or limit public comment periods during their meetings, to warn speakers in advance about what they could and could not say, and even to remove or arrest speakers who made crude or demeaning comments.
The court decision takes away any rational basis for a governmental body to claim it should not archive recordings of meetings for later public viewing.
The Iowa City case arose because the school district is among the governmental bodies that did not cower to pressure to limit members of the public from speaking their minds, lodging complaints, or heaping praise during meetings. The district also did not give in to pressure to closet away video recordings of meetings that captured those comments.
Villarini’s lawsuit in effect challenged both practices. She sued over statements by two former West High School tennis players who spoke freely during the public-comment time at a 2022 school board meeting.
The students expressed disappointment with the results of an internal school investigation of allegations of mistreatment involving the tennis coach, whom the girls did not identify by name. One girl told the board she believed the investigation protected the coach, not students. The other girl asked the board to change the district’s investigation procedures to protect students better.
Board members did not respond to the girls’ statements. The following day, the district placed Villarini on paid leave for the remainder of her one-year contract. The deputy superintendent said school staff learned after the meeting Villarini had posted comments the administrator described as unprofessional and disrespectful to students.
In keeping with its custom, the district posted a complete, unaltered video recording of the school board meeting on its YouTube channel two days after the meeting. The district refused multiple requests from Villarini and her lawyer to take the video down.
She sued, alleging the district defamed her by republishing what she called “slanderous” statements by the two girls. The district defended the case, in part arguing that posting unaltered video of a public meeting of a governmental body constituted privileged speech.
The Supreme Court agreed. Chief Justice Susan Christensen wrote in the decision:
“The fair-report privilege protects the publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern … if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.”
The court continued: “Although we are fully articulating this privilege for the first time, we have recognized a version of it since the early 1900s. At the time, the privilege only covered judicial proceedings and could be defeated by a showing of malice. … Here, we are expanding the privilege and updating it so that it covers the report of more proceedings and is defeated by inaccuracy instead of malice.”
The court said it may have reached a different conclusion had the district edited the meeting recording. Yet, the court reiterated the importance of supporting steps that increase public access to governmental meetings.
“The application of the fair-report privilege to this case furthers Iowa’s open-meeting laws. … Government entities, including school boards, must prioritize the accessibility of public meetings,” the court wrote.
“ICCSD [Iowa City Community School District] has chosen to comply with these laws with the most transparency possible, and that should not be punished. The fair-report privilege protects those government bodies that provide the public with a full account of their meetings.”
Thankfully, the Supreme Court did not mince words when it ratified that comments at a public meeting are privileged communications and that posting recordings of those comments is protected so long as the posted version is unaltered.
This common sense support of citizen participation in and access to governments continues Iowa’s history of openness and its protection of free speech, while adapting state law to current realities.
Letting people watch live-streamed governmental board meetings and archived recordings of past meetings from their homes, offices — or even their tractor cabs — is a positive result from the Covid pandemic, when many people avoided large gatherings.
Citizens without transportation, parents with children at home, the elderly, or people away from home learned to use Zoom or YouTube to watch their school boards and city council meetings when they could and from remote locations.
By applying the fair-report privilege to meetings live-streamed or archived on the internet, even when they contain untoward comments, our Supreme Court has modernized an important protection for expressive rights of Iowans and articulated how the distribution of full-length recordings of meetings promotes government transparency.
With this Supreme Court endorsement, city councils, school boards and county boards of supervisors that persist in opening their meetings only to in-person attendees serve only themselves, not the public. Even more, the court’s decision strips away a convenient but now dispelled legal excuse for elected officials to avoid doing the right thing.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is suing the Geauga County Sheriff’s office over its refusal to provide copies of contracts it’s signed with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Geauga is one of at least five counties in Ohio that have signed contracts to house migrants detained by ICE on the belief that they’re undocumented.
The ACLU on Tuesday afternoon filed a writ in the Ohio Supreme Court asking the court to mandate the release of the contracts. In a statement, the civil liberties group said that in April the sheriff’s office claimed that releasing the records was “‘prohibited by federal law’ and therefore not public per the Ohio Revised Code. (The ACLU) was instructed to instead contact ICE for the records.”
Under such contracts, the federal government pays counties to house detainees. During the first Trump administration, the Ohio counties that housed detainees faced complaints and lawsuits.
The ACLU’s statement said that the office didn’t cite a valid reason not to release its ICE contract.
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

“None of the federal statutes (the county’s lawyers) have cited, however, prohibit the disclosure of the requested records,” the writ said. “Because (the county’s lawyers) have refused to perform their clearly defined duty to provide the requested records, (the ACLU) respectfully submits this complaint for alternative and peremptory writs of mandamus to require (the sheriff’s office) to provide her with the records she seeks.” 
Geauga County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Thomas Rowan said the county’s attorneys are telling a different story — that only ICE can release the documents.
“It’s in our attorneys’ hands,” he said. “Once the court rules, we’ll definitively know which way to go. Our attorneys believe that they have to go through ICE to get copies of any of the paperwork.”
As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A wave of state and national public records laws were passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal to crack down on government corruption. Documents relating to the expenditure of government dollars were a particular target of such laws. 
As Trump promises mass deportations, the ACLU said it would try to keep a close watch.
“The ACLU of Ohio is deeply committed to protecting immigrants’ rights and our organization serves as a watchdog for government transparency and accountability,” Jocelyn Rosnick, Chief Policy and Advocacy Officer, said in a written statement. “We know that Geauga County Jail has housed ICE detainees for years, some of whom we have previously defended in court. Our lawful demands for timely and accurate information must not be ignored.”

TYLERTOWN, Miss. (AP) — More than two months after a tornado destroyed his home, Brian Lowery still looks through the rubble, hoping to find a tie clip his mother gave him, made from the center stone of her wedding band.
“I still have hope,” Lowery said.
He, his wife and 13-year-old son made it to safety before the tornado ripped apart their trailer home of 15 years, but the recovery from the storm has been a slow and painful process. Mississippi’s request for federal aid is still pending before the Federal Emergency Management Agency, meaning badly needed assistance has not yet made it to his hard-hit community of Tylertown to recover from the storms that struck in mid-March.
The delays could provide a glimpse into what’s in store for communities around the country as the summer storm season arrives and FEMA is mired in turmoil. A stretch of states including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma have already been battered with tornadoes this week, setting the stage for more disaster requests to FEMA. And the Atlantic hurricane season is just around the corner.March storms left 7 dead and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged
In Mississippi, nearly 20 tornadoes tore through the state on March 14 and 15, leaving seven people dead and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged. Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves asked the Trump administration for a major disaster declaration on April 1. The state, and residents like Lowery, are still waiting.
The declaration would allow the state to access a wide range of FEMA resources, including financial aid for individuals and for government agencies still removing debris and repairing infrastructure.
“I don’t know what you got to do or what you got to have to be able to be declared for a federal disaster area because this is pretty bad,” Lowery said. “We can’t help you because, whatever, we’re waiting on a letter; we’re waiting on somebody to sign his name. You know, all that. I’m just over it.”
The declaration would allow the state to access a wide range of FEMA resources, including financial aid for individuals and for government agencies still removing debris and repairing infrastructure.
“We don’t have a declaration yet. People are still hurting,” said Royce McKee, emergency management director for Walthall County, which includes Tylertown.Requests for help come at a time of upheaval for FEMA

Mississippi’s request comes at a time of upheaval for FEMA. The agency’s acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was recently ousted after he publicly disagreed with proposals to dismantle FEMA, an idea President Donald Trump has floated in calling the agency “very bureaucratic” and “very slow.”
David Richardson, FEMA’s new acting administrator, committed himself to executing Trump’s vision for the agency. He also previewed potential policy changes, saying there could be “more cost-sharing with states” and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance “when deemed necessary.”
Walthall County was hit especially hard by the massive storm system that wreaked havoc across multiple states. The storm spawned two significant tornadoes in the county, where four people died.
McKee said the county has sunk an estimated $700,000 into cleaning up the damage but can’t afford to spend more and has halted operations until it receives federal help.
“We need federal help, and we need it desperately, and we need it now,” said Bobby McGinnis, a Tylertown resident and firefighter. “I know President Trump said that — America first, we’re going to help our American folks first. But we haven’t seen the federal folks down here.”
While Mississippi has been waiting, a similar major disaster declaration request out of Arkansas after the storms hit was denied, appealed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and finally approved on May 13.
“We are encouraged by FEMA’s decision regarding Arkansas’ application from the same storm system that hit Mississippi,” Scott Simmons, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency’s director of external affairs, said in a statement. “We anxiously await a positive decision.”In Missouri, there are frustrations about the federal response to March storms
In Missouri, the federal response to storms earlier this year is being criticized as residents pick up the pieces from a Friday twister. The EF3 tornado packing winds of up to 150 mph (241 kph) slammed into St. Louis on Friday, and the city is awaiting a disaster declaration from the Missouri governor’s office so it can access federal help.
“We need to get the federal government mobilized,” said U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. “All federal resources that can be brought to bear here should be.”
The senator also expressed frustration over the federal response to a deadly March storm.
“We cannot wait months. I’m not happy about the fact we’re still waiting from all of that damage two months ago. We lost 12 people in those storms. We’ve lost seven here,” he said. “The scope of the damage is immense.”Mississippi lawmakers press federal officials about assistance
Mississippi lawmakers have been pressing federal officials on the issue. During a congressional hearing in early May, Republican Mississippi Rep. Michael Guest asked U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, to push forward the request.
“I would ask you if you could make sure that you could do everything to expedite that request,” Guest said. ”It is impacting my local jurisdictions with debris cleanup. It is impacting people as they seek to recover.”
Republican Mississippi U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith also asked Noem about FEMA assistance and the administration’s new approach to the agency.
“President Trump has been very clear that he believes that the way that FEMA exists today should not continue,” Noem responded. “He wants to make sure that those reforms are happening where states are empowered to do the response and trained and equipped, and then the federal government would come in and support them and financially be there when they need them on their worst day.”

(Getty Images)Five years after medical cannabis became available in Utah after being legalized by voters, the program, while still controversial, keeps on growing. This year, the state counted over 100,000 medical cannabis card holders, a new peak in the program’s five-year existence.
Members of the Utah Patients Coalition, a plant medicine advocacy group which lobbied hard to help pass the 2018 referendum that allowed the medical cannabis program in deeply conservative Utah, see the milestone as a demonstration that the system to obtain a card is getting easier to navigate.
Even now that a major 2025 cannabis bill has gone into effect and eliminated a system that allowed for a cheaper, more accessible way to obtain a card, the group remains hopeful for the future of medical cannabis in the state.
“The growth in 2025 has been encouraging, just because we have seen a lot of patients struggling in the past. And every year we go back to the legislative session, we go back to our platforms with education, and just try to remove some of those barriers,” Desiree Hennessy, executive director at the Utah Patients Coalition, said on Monday.
 Utah Legislature still making tweaks on state’s medical cannabis law

One of the 2025 general session’s routine bipartisan medical cannabis bills, sponsored by Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, and Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, went through several iterations and proposed allowing more medical cannabis pharmacies in the state. But, it didn’t make it to a vote on the Senate floor, ultimately failing.
However, Senate Bill 64, another bill sponsored by Vickers, passed, containing a provision that Utah Patients Coalition considered “a heartbreaking loss.”
Up until this month, pharmacies were allowed to partner with clinics that have medical providers qualified to prescribe medicinal cannabis to host “card drives,” a sort of pop-up clinic in pharmacies’ parking lots in which doctors could see patients and issue cards, often at a discount.
Those partnerships allowed cards, which are good for up to a year, to go from a regular $200 to about $75, Hennessy said.
“This year, we lost the ability to allow pharmacies to do that. So now no longer can somebody write a card within 500 feet of a pharmacy unless they’re in their own business,” she said. “And so it’s really not going to hurt anybody that’s middle class or higher, but these patients struggling with finances that used these card drives.”
That was one of the last additions to Vickers’ bill. He explained on the Senate floor that the bill’s authors didn’t feel like the pop-ups were appropriate, and patients should be going to a doctor’s office for medical advice.
“If someone is a qualified medical professional, they can’t go to a pop-up tent in front of the marijuana pharmacy to give cards. We want to make sure that we are not producing a recreational environment,” SB64’s House floor sponsor, Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St George, told House members about the change.
But, with that loss, also came some flexibility on who gets to recommend medical cannabis to a patient. Now, medical providers who are licensed to prescribe controlled substances can recommend the treatment, which according to a Department of Health and Human Services April report is mostly used to treat pain.
According to Hennessy, that change would improve patient accessibility.
“Patients can go to their regular care physician, hopefully not get charged any more than a co-pay, and have this medical cannabis conversation with their doctor,” she said.
While advocates celebrate the numbers, the program remains a contentious point among Utahns, with some still protesting the annual technical bills, arguing that the state shouldn’t allow cannabis at all.
But, ultimately, Hennessy hopes that medical cannabis patients get to be treated like those receiving any other treatment. Especially, she said, since the program has been demonstrated to lower rates of opioid use and opioid-related deaths, according to a study by Management Science Associates in partnership with Dragonfly Wellness, a medical cannabis pharmacy.
“We do believe that there’s a lot of good that can come out of using medical cannabis as a first-line drug, and not as a second or third or fourth when everything else fails,” Hennessy said, “but we could use this first and treat a lot of conditions with a lot less risk than other medications that patients are now using.”

(Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Lake Mead’s infamous bathtub ring is expected to get bigger this summer as low snowpack levels in the Rocky Mountains choke the reservoir’s biggest source of water – the Colorado River.
Snow melt from the Rocky Mountains contributes about 85% of the total water flow in the Colorado River, but those flows will likely be lower than usual this summer, according to federal data.

Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks.
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year.
 ‘Extreme and exceptional drought’ expected for Southern Nevada this year

A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The snowpack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said.
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too.
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.

 Stalled talks among Colorado River Basin states and a problematic pipeline

The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are working to set rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Reps. Greg Stanton, D-Arizona, and Susie Lee, D-Nevada, said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.
The office of Utah Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.

He plans to file and appeal regarding his execution within a couple of weeks claiming that he did not assault Lane. (Alabama Department of Corrections)An Alabama death row inmate plans to represent himself in a final appeal of his sentence, weeks before his execution.
Gregory Hunt, convicted of the 1998 murder and sexual assault of Karen Lane, will argue that he killed but did not sexually assault Lane, which would reduce his charge from capital murder to murder and make him ineligible for the death penalty.
“I think that Greg is at peace no matter what happens,” Pastor Jeff Hood, who works with inmates on Alabama’s death row, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I think he is prepared to die no matter what happens, but he wants people to know that he is sorry for killing Karen Lane but that he did not sexually assault her.”
Messages were sent to both the Governor’s Office and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office on Tuesday seeking comment.
Hunt was convicted on three counts of capital murder by a jury in 1990 and by an 11-1 vote, recommended that he be put to death.  Two of the counts alleged Hunt sexually assaulted Lane; the other said Hunt killed her during a robbery.
The first count dealt with killing Lane during the course of a robbery while the other two counts related to allegations that he sexually abused her.
Federal and state courts in recent years have been unwilling to stop Alabama executions, even in the face of evidence of prior issues with capital punishment in the state.
Hunt, who plans to represent himself, will ask the court to delay his execution and argue his trial attorneys did not present mitigating circumstances from his background or evidence that he did not sexually assault Lane.
He has stated similar claims in his appeals in the past that were rejected by the courts.
According to Hood, Hunt is only challenging capital murder charges related to sexual abuse allegations and not the one pertaining to the robbery.
“When you look at the transcripts, the primary aggravating factor they (prosecutors) focused on was sexual assault,” Hood said. “And this is the problem with these cases. The state gets to move the goalposts.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gregory-Hunt-horizontal-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

In total, according to the New Mexico Forestry Division, 23 towns, counties, tribal or other jurisdictions across the state have imposed some level of fire restriction due to high fire risk. The division has a map here showing much of the state under some type of burn ban, including federal and state forests. 
“In the face of significant wildfire potential, we need every New Mexican to take active steps to reduce the likelihood of an accidental wildfire start,” State Forester Laura McCarthy said in a statement. “These restrictions are needed because of current wildfire threats and the rising probability of dangerous wildfires as temperatures warm through May and June.”
Forecasters predicted earlier this month that southeastern New Mexico, including the Gila National Forest, would experience above-normal wildfire risk in May that would grow to cover the eastern two thirds of New Mexico by June. A national drought update issued Tuesday said a warm, dry spring had led to intensification of drought conditions in the Intermountain West region, with the worst conditions in New Mexico and Arizona.
So far this year, 377 wildfires in New Mexico have burned more than 33,500 acres, though the vast majority of those fires burned less than an acre. The biggest wildfire this year, so far, the Mogote Hill Fire, burned a little more than 21,000 acres near Wagon Mound in mid-March. 
Of the 377 fires, 275 were human-caused, 26 were naturally caused and causes of the remaining 76 are still being determined, according to the Southwest Coordination Center.
The fire restrictions are in place as most of the state experiences some form of drought. According to the Office of the State Engineer, all but 3.8% of New Mexico is in drought, with 41% in extreme drought and 7.5% in exceptional drought. 
Stage I fire restrictions generally prohibit building a fire in an area other than a developed campsite or picnic area, along with smoking outside of a vehicle or building. State II restrictions also prohibit discharging a firearm, operating an internal combustion engine, welding or using explosives. 
Nowhere in New Mexico is currently under the most severe fire restriction, in which entire areas are closed to the public to prevent wildfires.

Rollins, accompanied by Gov. Jim Pillen on her three-stop tour, was following through on a request Pillen had made earlier. She said the waiver she signed while in Fremont was the first approved by the USDA. It becomes effective Jan. 1.
Pillen, in a news conference last month, said he planned to submit a request for the federal waiver to remove the drink items he describes as unhealthy “junk.”
 ‘First of its kind’

“There’s absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,” said Pillen.
Rollins called the move “historic” and, in a statement, called Pillen a pioneer, along with the governors of six other states, in improving health in the nation. The waiver amends the definition of food products to be purchased by SNAP benefits, excluding soda, soft drinks, and energy drinks.
“Today’s waiver to remove soda and energy drinks from SNAP is the first of its kind, and it is a historic step to Make America Healthy Again,” Rollins said, adopting the phrasing popularized by the Trump administration’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Rollins’ visit and approval of the move came the same day the Nebraska Legislature upheld a Pillen veto of a bill that sought to lift a lifetime ban on SNAP benefits for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies.
Lawmakers back Pillen veto, kill bill to lift lifetime ban on food aid for some with drug pasts 

Both measures received instant criticism from nonprofits that work low-income families and inmates reentering their communities. 
Eric Savaiano, manager for food and nutrition access for Nebraska Appleseed, said SNAP is designed to “maintain the dignity” of participants by helping low-paid people buy groceries. He called the latest SNAP ban “poverty-shaming.”
“With the approval of this waiver, some of that dignity is stripped away,” Savaino said.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, or about 7.5% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, including seniors, children, people with disabilities, working families and veterans. Nebraska Appleseed said the average SNAP benefit received in the state is about $5.82 per person per day.
Savaiano, in a statement, said research shows SNAP recipients buy the same things as everyone else, including soda, soft drinks and energy drinks. “By targeting just SNAP participants, we’re poverty-shaming the most vulnerable among us and adding complications to an already complicated system.” 
He said carrying out the restriction would cause extra expenses to grocers, and he worried that could cause smaller stores to stop serving SNAP recipients altogether, and possibly shut off options in some rural areas.
 ‘Nothing nutritious’ 

Pillen said SNAP is to help families in need get “healthy food into their diets” and that there is “nothing nutritious” about the drinks to be ruled out under the waiver.
“We have to act because we can’t keep letting Nebraskans starve in the midst of plenty,” Pillen said.
Also with Rollins and Pillen during the Nebraska ag tour was Sherry Vinton, director of Nebraska’s Department of Agriculture and U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb. 
The group stopped at the Cargill Bioscience 650-acre facility in Blair, Wholestone Farms in Fremont and the Ohnoutka Family Farm in Valparaiso.

LaMonica McIver was “out of control” while speaking to reporters on the Hill Tuesday.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver said a new federal felony charge won't force her to ""roll over and stop doing my job."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Rep. LaMonica McIver acted as a human shield to thwart the May 9 arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an immigration detention center in Newark, federal authorities say in new court documents. 
An eight-page criminal complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey Monday formally charges McIver (D-10) with two felony counts of assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest. The complaint includes multiple stills captured by body cameras that the Department of Justice says show her striking, grabbing, and pushing the officers.
The charges against McIver have led to complaints from her fellow Democrats that the Trump administration is weaponizing the justice system to target his political foes. President Donald Trump claimed McIver was “out of control” while speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., Tuesday. 
“The days of woke are over. That woman, I have no idea who she is. That woman was out of control. She was shoving federal agents. She was out of control,” Trump said. “The days of that crap are over in this country. We’re going to have law and order.”
McIver has called the charges “purely political,” and said she was at the detention center that day as part of her congressional oversight duties.
“I’m not going to roll over and stop doing my job because they, you know, don’t want me to, or they want to neglect the fact that we needed to be in there to see what was going on in that detention center,” McIver said in an interview on CNN Tuesday.

Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges against McIver on Monday, the same day she said she would drop a trespassing charge her office had filed against Baraka.
The charges stem from a visit McIver made to Delaney Hall, a newly opened migrant jail in Newark that Baraka has said is operating illegally without proper city permits. McIver, along with Democratic Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, said they wanted to inspect the facility. Baraka was also present.
According to statements made in the criminal complaint by Robert Tansey, a special agent at the Department of Homeland Security’s investigations agency in Newark, the mayor initially entered the property because guards thought he was a member of Congress. An agent approached the mayor and ordered him to leave the facility’s secure area, warning him he would be arrested if he did not do so, the complaint says.
Video shows Baraka exiting the property to join protestors on the other side of the gate separating the street from the detention center. Federal agents then moved to arrest him, and, according to the complaint, McIver started to shout, “Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!”
McIver, Watson Coleman, and other protestors circled the mayor, and during the scuffle that ensued, McIver pushed past a federal agent and pushing another on his shoulder, according to video of the episode.
McIver is represented by one of Habba’s predecessors, Paul Fishman.
“The decision to charge Congresswoman McIver is spectacularly inappropriate. She went to Delaney Hall to do her job. As a member of Congress, she has the right and responsibility to see how ICE is treating detainees. Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos. This prosecution is an attempt to shift the blame for ICE’s behavior to Congresswoman McIver. In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter,” Fishman said in a statement.

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.

In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

Emily Chenevert's House Bill 685 (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator) The Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Monday that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curriculum for undergraduate students. 
House Bill 685 by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, advanced from the House on a 57-32 vote, narrowly clearing the 53-vote threshold for passage. Sixteen members, including several moderate Democrats and Republicans, were absent for the vote.
In an unusual move, every Democratic lawmaker present stood together in solidarity behind the House floor lectern, while nearly every Black lawmaker took turns making speeches against the bill. 
“To me, this is an anti-Black bill,” Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge said. “It’s not just divisive. It’s offensive.”
“This is the most racially oppressive piece of legislation that I think I’ve seen,” Rep. Candace Newell of New Orleans said. 
Republican Reps. Beth Billings of Deshrehan, Vincent Cox of Gretna and Jeff Wiley of Maurepas joined Democrats in opposing the bill. 
“It was needlessly divisive,” Billings said in an interview when asked why she opposed the bill. 
In tearful comments after the speeches, Chenevert said her bill is not racist. 
“This is not divisive,” Chenevert said. “This is protecting every Louisianian. This is about equality for all.” 
Chenevert’s bill has been dramatically rewritten from her original legislation, which only banned DEI practices in state government. 
As is, the bill would prohibit required classes that cover any of the following subjects: 

Critical race theory
White fragility or white guilt
Systemic racism, institutional racism or anti-racism
Systemic bias or implicit bias 
Intersectionality
Gender identity
Allyship
Race-based reparations
Race-based privilege

Amendments added to the bill on the House floor would allow any of the subjects to be taught if it is “included at the discretion of the faculty member, is not prescribed by the institution as a program requirement, and is part of a broader pedagogical objective.” 
Opponents of the bill said even with the amendments, the legislation could have a chilling effect on faculty’s academic freedom and freedom of speech. 
The bill also makes an exception for majors, minors and certificates that are specifically related to race or gender studies. 
The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to lawmakers Monday asking them to oppose the bill. 
“This legislation would stifle the ‘marketplace of ideas’ and infantilize our students, forcing faculty to avoid concepts the legislature dislikes and presenting only those that have gained their favor,” the letter reads. “This is antithetical to freedom in a democratic society and hurts our students as they transition into fully enfranchised citizens.” 
The Southern University Foundation, which is affiliated with Louisiana’s largest historically Black  university, also opposes the bill. 
Chenevert’s bill will next be discussed in a Senate committee.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For the first time since 2002, the Alaska Legislature has overridden the veto of a sitting governor.
With a 46-14 vote, lawmakers enacted a significant increase to Alaska’s per-student public funding formula, overriding Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to reject House Bill 57. Forty votes were needed for an override. 
It was the third time in two years that the governor vetoed a significant education funding bill; lawmakers failed by a single vote to override the governor last year. A second veto earlier this year was sustained by a larger margin.
Tuesday’s vote may be the first chapter in a longer struggle between the governor and the Legislature. 
HB 57 prescribes an increase to the state’s public school funding formula, but that formula is subject to appropriations in the annual state budget. To use an analogy: If the formula is a bucket, the budget fills that bucket. 
Dunleavy has previously said he may veto some education money from the state budget, leaving the formula only partially funded.
In addition, parts of HB 57 are contingent upon the enactment of Senate Bill 113, a bill adjusting the state’s corporate income taxes. On Monday, Dunleavy implied that he will veto SB 113.
Overriding either a funding veto or a veto of SB 113 would require 45 votes.
Some legislators who voted to override the governor on Monday declined to confirm that they would override vetoes on the two funding mechanisms.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current). Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone’s side business selling guns out of his house does not prevent him from discussing and voting on an assault-style weapons ban or other gun legislation, the Rhode Island Ethics Commission decided Tuesday.
The ethics panel’s 8-1 vote follows the recommendation put forth by its expert staff, which concluded that Ciccone’s federal firearms license is not a conflict of interest with the high-profile gun legislation pending at the Rhode Island State House. The four-page opinion, presented by Staff Attorney Lynne Radiches, invoked the class exemption within the state’s ethics code, reasoning that Ciccone does not stand to benefit, or suffer, any more or less from state gun laws than the other 98 federally licensed firearms dealers in the state, including the other 79 with a Class 1 license.
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, referenced the same exemption in his letter to the Ethics Commission asking for advice. 
Ciccone has been a licensed firearms dealer for decades. Should he recuse himself from gun debate?

Ciccone, who did not attend Tuesday’s meeting, was unaware of the commission’s decision until he was contacted by Rhode Island Current.
“I believe they looked at all the facts, and they came to their conclusion,” Ciccone said.
However, the advisory opinion comes with an important caveat: If any of the gun bills under review by the Rhode Island General Assembly, including the assault weapons ban legislation, are amended in a way that impacts Ciccone, or fellow Class 1 license holders, more than other federal firearms dealers, Ciccone should recuse himself or seek a new advisory opinion.
Ciccone, a longtime opponent to state gun restrictions, has already indicated he wants to see changes to the assault-style weapons ban in order for him to support it.
Fresh off a marathon hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14, Ciccone said he still has questions over the legality of the legislation as drafted. However, Ciccone declined to specify what changes he’d like to see made, or whether he intends to back the controversial issue already named a top priority by Gov. Dan McKee.
“I am waiting to see what decisions the committee is going to make, what changes the sponsor is going to make,” Ciccone said. “At this point in time, I don’t know. It’s up to the committee.”
A committee vote on the assault weapons ban bill has not been scheduled as of Tuesday.
Better late than never
Ciccone has served as a state lawmaker for 22 years, and been licensed to sell guns since the 1980s. But this was the first time he asked for ethics advice on gun-related legislation. Asked why now, Ciccone said he never served on the Senate Judiciary committee, and therefore had little sway over whether gun-related bills advanced to the full chamber.
Now, as the newly elected Senate majority leader, Ciccone is an ex-officio member on all Senate committees, meaning he can vote to advance a bill to the full chamber. 
Ethics Commissioner Christopher Callahan cast the sole vote against giving Ciccone permission to vote on gun bills, pointing to Ciccone’s leadership role as reason for his hesitation.
“My perception is that there is potential as a senior political leader that he may have greater influence on the outcome of the decision,” Callahan said in an interview after the meeting. Callahan, the retired head of the Rhode Island National Guard, was tapped by Gov. Dan McKee in April to serve on the state ethics panel.
Commissioner Hugo Ricci Jr. disagreed.
“He has one vote, the same as any other lawmaker,” Ricci said during the commission discussion. “He’s not president of the Senate.”
Some commission members questioned whether the 99 federal firearms dealers in Rhode Island is a large enough number to apply the class exemption. There is no minimum laid out in the ethics code, leaving it up to the panel to determine on a case-by-base basis whether belonging to an affected group constitutes reason to grant exception to potential conflicts of interest.
“It’s not a perfect science,” Radiches, the staff attorney, told the committee. “The big numbers, we love, like 13,000 teachers.”
“I don’t think we should get into a finite discussion with facts that are presented as to whether 99 is not enough,” Commissioner Frank Cenerini said.
The size of an affected group is one of several variables the commission must weigh when considering whether a class exemption applies. Other factors include the importance of “the function or official action being contemplated by the public official” and “the nature and degree of foreseeable impact upon the class and its individual members as a result of the official action,” according to standard language in ethics opinions that involve class exemptions.
Common Cause Rhode Island Executive Director John Marion, who attended the meeting, said he was not surprised that the panel granted permission for Ciccone to vote on gun bills, given its “liberal” application of the class exemption in recent history. 
However, Marion said he wished the panel had a more robust discussion of Ciccone’s role in leadership.
“The majority leader helps set the agenda for the chamber, deciding what bills move and what bill dies,” Marion said. “That’s part of what the ethics commission can regulate.”
Marion expects the need for ethics input on legislative conflicts of interest will increase under the new Senate leadership team, both for Ciccone and for Senate President Valarie Lawson. Lawson’s day job as president of one of the state’s two largest teachers’ unions has already prompted concern by some of her colleagues about potential conflicts of interest. She has not requested an advisory opinion from the Ethics Commission since her election on April 30, though she said at the time she was considering it.
“Out of an abundance of caution, she is in the process of formulating a question to the Ethics Commission and will be submitting it to them soon,” Greg Pare, a spokesperson for Senate leadership, said in an email Tuesday.
This story was updated to correct when Senate leaders can vote on bills in committee.
